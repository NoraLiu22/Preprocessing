Kennedy became one of the youngest U.S. presidents, as well as the first Roman Catholic to hold the office. Born into one of America’s wealthiest families, he parlayed an elite education and a reputation as a military hero into a successful run for Congress in 1946 and for the Senate in 1952.&nbsp;</p><p>As president, Kennedy confronted mounting Cold War tensions in Cuba, Vietnam and elsewhere. He also led a renewed drive for public service and eventually provided federal support for the growing civil rights movement. His assassination on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, sent shockwaves around the world and turned the all-too-human Kennedy into a larger-than-life heroic figure.

His parents, Joseph and Rose Kennedy, hailed from two of Boston’s most prominent Irish Catholic political families. Despite persistent health problems throughout his childhood and teenage years (he would later be diagnosed with a rare endocrine disorder called Addison’s disease),&nbsp;Jack led a privileged youth. He attended private schools such as Canterbury and Choate and spent summers in Hyannis Port on Cape Cod. </p><p>Joe Kennedy, a hugely successful businessman and an early supporter of <a href="/topics/us-presidents/franklin-d-roosevelt">Franklin D.

His older brother, Joe Jr., was not so fortunate: He was killed in August 1944 when his Navy airplane exploded on a secret mission against a German rocket-launching site.

Less than a year later, he returned to Boston, preparing a run for Congress in 1946. As a moderately conservative Democrat, and backed by his father’s fortune, Jack won his party’s nomination handily and carried the mostly working-class Eleventh District by nearly three to one over his Republican opponent in the general election. He entered the 80th Congress in January 1947, at the age of 29, and immediately attracted attention (as well as some criticism from older members of the Washington establishment) for his youthful appearance and relaxed, informal style.</p><p>Kennedy won reelection to the <a href="/topics/history-of-the-house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</a> in 1948 and 1950, and in 1952 ran successfully for the Senate, defeating the popular Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. On September 12, 1953, Kennedy married the beautiful socialite and journalist Jacqueline (Jackie) Lee Bouvier. Two years later, he was forced to undergo a painful operation on his back. While recovering from the surgery, Jack wrote another best-selling book, <em>Profiles in Courage</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957.

He defeated a primary challenge from the more liberal Hubert Humphrey and chose the Senate majority leader, Lyndon Johnson of Texas, as his running mate. In the general election, Kennedy faced a difficult battle against his Republican opponent, Richard Nixon, a two-term vice president under the popular <a href="/topics/us-presidents/dwight-d-eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Offering a young, energetic alternative to Nixon and the status quo, Kennedy benefited from his performance (and telegenic appearance) in the first-ever televised presidential debates, watched by millions of viewers. In November’s election, Kennedy won by a narrow margin—fewer than 120,000 out of some 70 million votes cast—becoming the youngest man and the first Roman Catholic to be elected president of the United States.</p><p>With his beautiful young wife and their two small children (Caroline, born in 1957, and John Jr., born just weeks after the election), Kennedy lent an unmistakable aura of youth and glamour to the <a href="/topics/white-house">White House</a>. In his inaugural address, given on January 20, 1961, the new president called on his fellow Americans to work together in the pursuit of progress and the elimination of poverty, but also in the battle to win the ongoing <a href="/topics/cold-war">Cold War</a> against communism around the world. Kennedy’s famous closing words expressed the need for cooperation and sacrifice on the part of the American people: “Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”</p><div class="block-story-grid"><div class="card-grid is-style-3-col"><div class="card-grid__container"></div></div></div><h2 id="kennedy-s-foreign-policy-challenges">Kennedy’s Foreign Policy Challenges </h2><p>An early crisis in the foreign affairs arena occurred in April 1961, when Kennedy approved the plan to send 1,400 CIA-trained Cuban exiles in an amphibious landing at the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/bay-of-pigs-invasion">Bay of Pigs</a> in Cuba. Intended to spur a rebellion that would overthrow the communist leader <a href="/topics/cold-war/fidel-castro">Fidel Castro</a>, the mission ended in failure, with nearly all of the exiles captured or killed.&nbsp;</p><p>That June, Kennedy met with Soviet leader <a href="/topics/cold-war/nikita-sergeyevich-khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> in Vienna to discuss the city of Berlin, which had been divided after <a href="/topics/world-war-ii">World War II</a> between Allied and Soviet control. Two months later, East German troops began erecting a wall to divide the city. Kennedy sent an army convoy to reassure West Berliners of U.S. support, and would deliver one of his most famous speeches in West Berlin in June 1963.</p><p>Kennedy clashed again with Khrushchev in October 1962 during the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis">Cuban missile crisis</a>.

In July 1963, Kennedy won his greatest foreign affairs victory when Khrushchev agreed to join him and Britain’s Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in signing a nuclear test ban treaty. In Southeast Asia, however, Kennedy’s desire to curb the spread of communism led him to escalate U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, even as privately he expressed his dismay over the situation.</p><h2 id="kennedy-s-leadership-at-home">Kennedy’s Leadership at Home </h2><p>During his first year in office, Kennedy oversaw the launch of the Peace Corps, which would send young volunteers to underdeveloped countries all over the world. Otherwise, he was unable to achieve much of his proposed legislation during his lifetime, including two of his biggest priorities: income tax cuts and a civil rights bill. Slow to commit himself to the civil rights cause, events forced Kennedy into action, spurring him to send federal troops to support the desegregation of the University of Mississippi after riots there left two dead and many others injured. The following summer, Kennedy announced his intention to propose a comprehensive civil rights bill and endorsed the massive <a href="/topics/black-history/march-on-washington">March on Washington</a> that took place that August.</p><p>Kennedy held enormous popularity, both at home and abroad, and his family drew famous comparisons to King Arthur’s court at Camelot. His brother Bobby served as his attorney general, while the youngest Kennedy son, Edward (Ted), was elected to Jack’s former Senate seat in 1962. Jackie Kennedy became an international icon of style, beauty and sophistication, though stories of her husband’s numerous marital infidelities (and his personal association with members of organized crime) would later emerge to complicate the Kennedys’ idyllic image.</p><h2 id="jfk-s-assassination">JFK’s Assassination </h2><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/729/707/BRAND_THC_HGMS_286470_SFD_000_2398_10_20230208_01_0326411_NoOB_HD__996964.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">Catching JFK&#x27;s Killer</div></div><button type="button" class="video-player-decoy__play" aria-label="Play Catching JFK&#x27;s Killer"><span class="video-player-decoy__play-icon"></span></button></div></div><p>On November 22, 1963, the president and his wife landed in Dallas; he had spoken in San Antonio, Austin and Fort Worth the day before.

His parents, Joseph and Rose Kennedy, hailed from two of Boston’s most prominent Irish Catholic political families. Despite persistent health problems throughout his childhood and teenage years (he would later be diagnosed with a rare endocrine disorder called Addison’s disease),\u0026nbsp;Jack led a privileged youth. He attended private schools such as Canterbury and Choate and spent summers in Hyannis Port on Cape Cod. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Kennedy, a hugely successful businessman and an early supporter of \u003ca href=\"/topics/us-presidents/franklin-d-roosevelt\"\u003eFranklin D.

As a moderately conservative Democrat, and backed by his father’s fortune, Jack won his party’s nomination handily and carried the mostly working-class Eleventh District by nearly three to one over his Republican opponent in the general election. He entered the 80th Congress in January 1947, at the age of 29, and immediately attracted attention (as well as some criticism from older members of the Washington establishment) for his youthful appearance and relaxed, informal style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy won reelection to the \u003ca href=\"/topics/history-of-the-house-of-representatives\"\u003eHouse of Representatives\u003c/a\u003e in 1948 and 1950, and in 1952 ran successfully for the Senate, defeating the popular Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. On September 12, 1953, Kennedy married the beautiful socialite and journalist Jacqueline (Jackie) Lee Bouvier. Two years later, he was forced to undergo a painful operation on his back. While recovering from the surgery, Jack wrote another best-selling book, \u003cem\u003eProfiles in Courage\u003c/em\u003e, which won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957.

In the general election, Kennedy faced a difficult battle against his Republican opponent, Richard Nixon, a two-term vice president under the popular \u003ca href=\"/topics/us-presidents/dwight-d-eisenhower\"\u003eDwight D.

Two months later, East German troops began erecting a wall to divide the city. Kennedy sent an army convoy to reassure West Berliners of U.S. support, and would deliver one of his most famous speeches in West Berlin in June 1963.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy clashed again with Khrushchev in October 1962 during the \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis\"\u003eCuban missile crisis\u003c/a\u003e.

In July 1963, Kennedy won his greatest foreign affairs victory when Khrushchev agreed to join him and Britain’s Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in signing a nuclear test ban treaty. In Southeast Asia, however, Kennedy’s desire to curb the spread of communism led him to escalate U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, even as privately he expressed his dismay over the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kennedy-s-leadership-at-home\"\u003eKennedy’s Leadership at Home     \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his first year in office, Kennedy oversaw the launch of the Peace Corps, which would send young volunteers to underdeveloped countries all over the world. Otherwise, he was unable to achieve much of his proposed legislation during his lifetime, including two of his biggest priorities: income tax cuts and a civil rights bill. Slow to commit himself to the civil rights cause, events forced Kennedy into action, spurring him to send federal troops to support the desegregation of the University of Mississippi after riots there left two dead and many others injured. The following summer, Kennedy announced his intention to propose a comprehensive civil rights bill and endorsed the massive \u003ca href=\"/topics/black-history/march-on-washington\"\u003eMarch on Washington\u003c/a\u003e that took place that August.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy held enormous popularity, both at home and abroad, and his family drew famous comparisons to King Arthur’s court at Camelot. His brother Bobby served as his attorney general, while the youngest Kennedy son, Edward (Ted), was elected to Jack’s former Senate seat in 1962. Jackie Kennedy became an international icon of style, beauty and sophistication, though stories of her husband’s numerous marital infidelities (and his personal association with members of organized crime) would later emerge to complicate the Kennedys’ idyllic image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"jfk-s-assassination\"\u003eJFK’s Assassination     \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 22, 1963, the president and his wife landed in Dallas; he had spoken in San Antonio, Austin and Fort Worth the day before. From the airfield, the party then traveled in a motorcade to the Dallas Trade Mart, the site of Jack’s next speaking engagement. Shortly after 12:30 p.m., as the motorcade passed through downtown Dallas, \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/jfk-assassination\"\u003eshots rang out\u003c/a\u003e.

As a moderately conservative Democrat, and backed by his father’s fortune, Jack won his party’s nomination handily and carried the mostly working-class Eleventh District by nearly three to one over his Republican opponent in the general election. He entered the 80th Congress in January 1947, at the age of 29, and immediately attracted attention (as well as some criticism from older members of the Washington establishment) for his youthful appearance and relaxed, informal style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy won reelection to the \u003ca href=\"/topics/history-of-the-house-of-representatives\"\u003eHouse of Representatives\u003c/a\u003e in 1948 and 1950, and in 1952 ran successfully for the Senate, defeating the popular Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. On September 12, 1953, Kennedy married the beautiful socialite and journalist Jacqueline (Jackie) Lee Bouvier. Two years later, he was forced to undergo a painful operation on his back. While recovering from the surgery, Jack wrote another best-selling book, \u003cem\u003eProfiles in Courage\u003c/em\u003e, which won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957.

In the general election, Kennedy faced a difficult battle against his Republican opponent, Richard Nixon, a two-term vice president under the popular \u003ca href=\"/topics/us-presidents/dwight-d-eisenhower\"\u003eDwight D.

Two months later, East German troops began erecting a wall to divide the city. Kennedy sent an army convoy to reassure West Berliners of U.S. support, and would deliver one of his most famous speeches in West Berlin in June 1963.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy clashed again with Khrushchev in October 1962 during the \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis\"\u003eCuban missile crisis\u003c/a\u003e.

In July 1963, Kennedy won his greatest foreign affairs victory when Khrushchev agreed to join him and Britain’s Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in signing a nuclear test ban treaty. In Southeast Asia, however, Kennedy’s desire to curb the spread of communism led him to escalate U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, even as privately he expressed his dismay over the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kennedy-s-leadership-at-home\"\u003eKennedy’s Leadership at Home     \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his first year in office, Kennedy oversaw the launch of the Peace Corps, which would send young volunteers to underdeveloped countries all over the world. Otherwise, he was unable to achieve much of his proposed legislation during his lifetime, including two of his biggest priorities: income tax cuts and a civil rights bill. Slow to commit himself to the civil rights cause, events forced Kennedy into action, spurring him to send federal troops to support the desegregation of the University of Mississippi after riots there left two dead and many others injured. The following summer, Kennedy announced his intention to propose a comprehensive civil rights bill and endorsed the massive \u003ca href=\"/topics/black-history/march-on-washington\"\u003eMarch on Washington\u003c/a\u003e that took place that August.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy held enormous popularity, both at home and abroad, and his family drew famous comparisons to King Arthur’s court at Camelot. His brother Bobby served as his attorney general, while the youngest Kennedy son, Edward (Ted), was elected to Jack’s former Senate seat in 1962. Jackie Kennedy became an international icon of style, beauty and sophistication, though stories of her husband’s numerous marital infidelities (and his personal association with members of organized crime) would later emerge to complicate the Kennedys’ idyllic image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"jfk-s-assassination\"\u003eJFK’s Assassination     \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 22, 1963, the president and his wife landed in Dallas; he had spoken in San Antonio, Austin and Fort Worth the day before. From the airfield, the party then traveled in a motorcade to the Dallas Trade Mart, the site of Jack’s next speaking engagement. Shortly after 12:30 p.m., as the motorcade passed through downtown Dallas, \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/jfk-assassination\"\u003eshots rang out\u003c/a\u003e.

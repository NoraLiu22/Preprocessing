Its first season looked at the mysterious abduction of Jacob Wetterling in rural Minnesota and the lack of accountability that sheriffs face when they fail to solve cases. Season 2 examined the case of Curtis Flowers, who was tried six times for the same crime. In 2020, In the Dark released a special report on the coronavirus pandemic in the Mississippi Delta. In 2023, In the Dark joined The New Yorker and Condé Nast. “The Runaway Princesses,” In the Dark’s first collaboration with a New Yorker staff writer, is a four-part series that asks why the women in Dubai’s royal family keep trying to run away. Season 3 of In the Dark is currently in production.\nIn the Dark is a two-time Peabody Award winner and, in 2019, became the first podcast to win a George Polk Award, one of the top honors in investigative journalism. The program has also received an Edward R. Murrow Award and a Robert F.

Ask Nick - Every Monday, listeners navigating a challenging yet relatable interpersonal circumstance--from a 2 year situationship to a blowout fight with their mom to a friendship feud to reigniting intimacy after 10 years of marriage--call in for Nick's signature blunt yet compassionate advice. It's ripe with the type of hard truths your friends are too afraid to say, but you're better off for hearing. Bachelor Recap - We break down this week's episode of the Bachelor, Bachelorette, or Bachelor in Paradise on Tuesdays. This color commentary is full of hot takes, debates, jokes, and the insider knowledge only a former Bachelor can provide. Nick, Ali and Amanda are joined by special celebrity guests--you'd be surprised how many of your favorite actors and comedians are closet bachelor fans. Freestyle - On Tuesday during the Bachelor \"off-season,\" we dive into the hot-button, zeitgeist topics--the latest celebrity drama, trending reality tv shows, new love song/music video that everyone's obsessed with, and occasionally a months-long highly publicized defamation trial between divorced A-list actors. Our lively discussions include takeaways we can all relate to. We also have \"Texting Office Hours,\" a segment where we help a caller craft, edit, and press the send button on a nerve-wracking message. Going Deeper - Every Thursday, a special guest joins the show for a tell-all interview and to discuss their latest project, their philosophies on love and relationships, plus the most relevant pop culture topics. These episodes conclude with our beloved \"Texting Office Hours \" segment where Nick, the guest, and our co-hosts team up to give advice to a listener on a message they need help writing. The Update Show - The last Friday of the month, by popular demand (and we mean POPULAR) cliffhangers are resolved and burning questions are answered with updates from our most engaging callers. These much-anticipated follow-ups reveal if the caller took Nick's advice and how everything transpired, providing much-needed resolution to the callers' stories that stole our hearts and attention.","editorialContentQuery":[],"hostIds":[],"id":30425532,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0aWMubGlic3luLmNvbS9wL2Fzc2V0cy8zLzYvNC82LzM2NDYxODk3ZTE1MTBiYWQ4OGM0YTY4YzNkZGJjNGYyL1ZpYWxsRmlsZXNfQ292ZXJfMjAyNC5qcGc","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1714436153,"seedId":30425532,"seedShowId":30425532,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"867-the-viall-files","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"The Viall Files","url":"/podcast/867-the-viall-files-30425532/","episodeIds":[]},"30542615":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Some crimes are truly unforgettable.

On their biweekly podcast Inappropriate Questions, now in its third season, cohosts Elena Hudgins Lyle and Harvinder Wadhwa make a space for curiosity where guests can unpack the tricky questions they get asked and learn stories about them—whether they ask if polyamorous people cope with jealousy in relationships, if Indigenous people are full Native, or brave the dreaded “have you lost weight” assumption. Created by Hudgins Lyle alongside producers Sabrina Bertsch and Cindy Long, the podcast was built out of a school project while they were studying Media Production in Toronto, Ontario. Bertsch, who’s mixed-race, had been asked a lot of questions about her background and ethnicity after studying abroad for a semester. Long and Lyle, both LGBT, would also get frequently asked about their identity and sexuality. Even if these frustrations served as a jumping-off point for them, they quickly realized that they could also learn about a variety of topics from others too—especially from their parents and older generations. So they auditioned a “dad-like” figure to be a counterpart as co-host. Wadhwa, a project manager with an engineering degree, was the unanimous choice. “Harv was the very first interview we did,” Lyle says. “After the interview, he was like, ‘All right, how many more of these do you have to go?’ You know I'm it, right? You can stop now.’” In each episode, guests share stories about being asked the week’s specific inappropriate question. Though, occasionally, they'll have an expert or academic who can break down more of the historical and social aspect of the question. Both Hudgins Lyle and Wadhwa bridge together their different generational perspectives to challenge themselves and their guests, having casual, yet meaningful conversations that are engaging, unpredictable, and humorous. “Though I've been in Canada for over 20 years, I consider myself an immigrant coming from India,” Wadhwa says. “So, what the show is also trying to do is also bring the balance. Because if everybody's thinking the same way, then we lose out a lot.” Even if they sometimes step into difficult territory, what they both hope to provide with each episode is a starting point for listeners to ease into these topics. “It could be that we've left you with some new ideas and perspectives from the guests who have this lived experience,” Lyle says. “You don't need to change and develop overnight, but hopefully, we've given you a starting place where you can then do your own research or reflection.”","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":30940740,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL3JhZGlvL3BvZGNhc3RzL2ltYWdlcy9wcm9tby1pcS5qcGc","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1704093109,"seedId":30940740,"seedShowId":30940740,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"553-inappropriate-questions","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Inappropriate Questions","url":"/podcast/553-inappropriate-questions-30940740/","episodeIds":[]},"30962754":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Hosts John and Hank Green (authors and YouTubers) offer both humorous and heartfelt advice about life’s big and small questions.

Ike counted celebrities and Manhattan elites as his patients. He’d host star-studded parties at his eccentric vacation house.

Follow characters on the fringes of society — con artists, cult leaders, corrupt politicians — as they seduce their marks and bend communities to their will. Join us as we unravel their stories and bring justice to the people they’ve deceived. SEASON 8: My Fugitive Dad Ashley’s Dad was her favorite person in the world. He drove fast cars and sold them for a living. He was a scratch golfer and the love of her Mum’s life. Ashley thought she knew him better than anyone. But at 38, she found out he wasn’t who he said he was. Inspired by his favorite movie the Thomas Crown Affair, he had pulled off a robbery in Cleveland then disappeared. It turns out he evaded the authorities for half a century, living in their sleepy Massachusetts town. His secret upended his family’s life, but another family’s too. Because from the moment this 20-year-old vault teller escaped with $215,000 in 1969, Deputy U.S. Marshal John Elliott made it his life’s mission to bring him to justice. After he retired, his son even took up his mantle. For this six episode podcast, host Jonathan Hirsch teams up with Ashley Randele to unravel the mystery of how her Dad got away with it, and ultimately, why he left behind everyone and everything to start over.

SEASON 7: Betrayal on the Bayou For almost two decades, DEA Special Agent Chad Scott ruled the streets just North of New Orleans. He controlled a network of snitches by convincing people he arrested to work for him as informants. Chad would stop at nothing to put drug dealers behind bars. His successes won awards at the DEA, but his willingness to bend the rules earned him a terrifying reputation on the streets. Some called him the Golden Boy. Others called him the White Devil. But when one of guys on Chad's team is caught dealing drugs, Chad’s life is overturned. His right-hand men betray him and confess everything to the FBI. Investigators go over his career with a fine-toothed comb, asking the question: is Chad Scott the greatest DEA Agent in the South, or is he a criminal? SEASON 6: Just Say You're Sorry Texas Ranger James Holland is celebrated as the ‘serial killer whisperer’, solving dozens of murders through his legendary interrogation skills. But how far does he go to get confessions? And has he put innocent people in prison along the way? Smoke Screen: Just Say You're Sorry uses shocking police tapes to reveal the psychological drama behind one murder case, and uncovers something rotten at the heart of the justice system. SEASON 5: Deadly Cure Smoke Screen: Deadly Cure is a podcast about a family on the fringe who convinced tens of thousands of people across the globe to buy a miracle liquid made of poison, the international conspiracy they ignited, and the people who fought to take them down. Produced in collaboration with Bloomberg. SEASON 4: Puppy Kingpin Americans are used to being on the lookout for a scam, but authorities are warning of a new kind of fraud. Puppy Kingpin shines a spotlight on Jolyn Noethe, a secretive businesswoman from Iowa who is accused of laundering puppies much like drug money. Investigative reporter Alex Schuman exposes the scheme and an underground part of the industry bringing us the pets we love.

Rising from a life of hardship and crime, Don King became the most successful boxing promoter the sport has ever seen—and the first Black man to do so. He is his own American Dream. His flamboyant appearance and commanding personality made him a star in and out of the ring, as did his promotion of greats like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and even America’s musical dynasty, the Jacksons. But his less-than-honest exploits? They made him legendary. Season two of Power tells the story of Hugh Hefner. Who was Hugh Hefner? Centerfold models, Playboy Bunnies, and other women from the Playboy founder’s inner circle, like TV personality and author Holly Madison, tell journalist Amy Rose Spiegel their side of his story. We hear how Playboy changed their lives, for better and for worse. Beyond the bunny tails are darker questions: What actually went on at the notorious Playboy Mansion? How can we square Hefner's progressive legacy with his abuse of vulnerable people? What can the Playboy saga tell us about sex and power—then and now? Season one of Power tells the story of Ghislaine Maxwell (Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged partner in crime). Everyone’s heard of her, but there’s a shadowy figure who hangs above her who you likely don’t know: her father, media tycoon Robert Maxwell. His rise from nothing to fall… from the deck of his super yacht under mysterious circumstances is straight out of a crime novel. His favourite daughter Ghislaine’s theory: her father was murdered.

Maya is no stranger to change. “My whole childhood revolved around the violin, but that changed in a moment when I injured my hand playing a single note,” says Shankar, who was studying under Itzhak Perlman at the Juilliard School at the time. “I was forced to try and figure out who I was, and who I could be, without the violin.\" Maya soon discovered a new path in the field of cognitive science, where she earned her PhD as a Rhodes Scholar studying how and why we change. Her insights into human behavior ultimately led her to create A Slight Change of Plans—Apple Podcasts’ Best Show of the Year in 2021. You’ll hear intimate conversations with people like Tiffany Haddish, Kacey Musgraves, and Riz Ahmed, as well as real-life inspirations, like John Elder Robison, who undergoes experimental brain stimulation to deepen his emotional intelligence, Daryl Davis, a Black jazz musician who inspires hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan, and Shankar herself, who had her own “slight change of plans” earlier this year. The show also explores the science of change with experts like Adam Grant and Angela Duckworth. \"What I love most about this show is that the content is evergreen,\" says Shankar. \"You can listen to episodes in any order and at any time.\"","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":82213198,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzBmMTI4M2UyLTgwZmUtNDYwYi1iMTU3LWFlMzkwMDM3NWQzOC9kNTQ4ZjJjMS1kNTIyLTRhYTgtOWZmMy1hZTM5MDAzNzVkNDEvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTY0NDU0OTY5NSZzaXplPUxhcmdl","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706645753,"seedId":82213198,"seedShowId":82213198,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1297-a-slight-change-of-plans","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"A Slight Change of Plans","url":"/podcast/1297-a-slight-change-of-plans-82213198/","episodeIds":[]},"82262169":{"customLinks":[],"description":"In every ballet studio, there is a wall of mirrors.

Pandora Sykes pieces together what we know about her story, and what it tells us about sex, entertainment, and how we treat women in the public eye. \nIn this eight-part series for BBC Radio 4, Pandora traces Britney's incredible life: from her hardscrabble childhood in rural Louisiana, to her coronation as the inaugural pop princess of the internet, navigating an insatiable celebrity gossip complex; through to a young mother on trial by the paparazzi. \nBritney is a pop culture phenomenon. Pandora looks behind that mask - and beyond Britney herself - to explore how Britney became the most Googled person in the world, for almost seven years, and what it says, both then and now, about the entertainment industry, politics, sex and how we see women in the public eye. \nBritney's public struggles saw her placed in a conservatorship, in which she lost the right to control her finances and day to day life. Thirteen years later, and she is in court, pleading for this controversial legal arrangement to end. We will look at how Britney has been transformed from girl-next-door teen sensation to a mute symbol of a supposedly rotten system. \nPieces of Britney mixes documentary, archive and interviews to tell Britney's remarkable story. It also features drama, written by playwright Katie Hims, to bring Britney and her extraordinary world to life. \nPieces of Britney is a sympathetic portrayal of Britney, during a time of cultural reappraisal about how we treat women - famous, or otherwise. These are some of the stories that have been told about her - but The Narrative is hers to finish. \nPresenter: Pandora Sykes Dramatist: Katie Hims Sound: Peter Ringrose Producers: Anne Isger & Sasha Yevtushenko A BBC Audio production for BBC Radio 4","editorialContentQuery":[],"hostIds":[],"id":84490701,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2ljaGVmLmJiY2kuY28udWsvaW1hZ2VzL2ljLzMwMDB4MzAwMC9wMGJzN2ttYy5qcGc","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1701102021,"seedId":84490701,"seedShowId":84490701,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"20-pieces-of-britney","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Pieces of Britney","url":"/podcast/20-pieces-of-britney-84490701/","episodeIds":[]},"84623293":{"customLinks":[],"description":"When Ian Coss decided to get married, every living member of his family who had ever been married had also gotten divorced: parents, grandparents, and all his aunts and uncles on both sides — some of them twice.

Season 2: Dreamers Last season, we tackled Ronald Regan’s 1986 amnesty act, Season 2 will trace the origins of DACA or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a contentious executive order to protect undocumented young people from being deported. Issued by former President Barack Obama in 2012, DACA was meant to be a temporary stop gap on a broken immigration system. Welcome to Season 2 of Out of the Shadows - Dreamers. Season 1: Children of 86 Immigrants and their children have long lived in the shadows of America, their destinies aren't just shaped by where they come from but by their particular place in history.

Before long it would make an even bolder claim - it could cure any of your problems, all you had to do was move in. What started in a house on the beach soon spread to compounds across the country. The man who made the miracle happen, Charles E. Dederich, aka “Chuck,” would be the one to destroy it all, along with the lives of many of his followers and millions of dollars in assets. The Sunshine Place tells the mind-blowing, true story of Synanon - one of America’s most cutting edge social experiments turned into one of its most dangerous and violent cults as it’s never been told before: by the people who lived it. Executive Produced by Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, and Emily Barclay Ford for Team Downey, together with Josh McLaughlin for Wink Pictures.

We in western, especially American, capitalist culture often focus on stories of people who have achieved positions of influence, wealth and power; this podcast won’t be doing that. I want to shed light on the experiences of folks who feel invisible in some way in our world; blue collar workers, people who deal with a physical difference, immigrants, and many more. Each voice you hear is another layer of our national or international community. Each conversation offers insight into a perhaps previously unexplored way of living, allowing us to expand our view into what is possible, what is truly valuable to us, and how that can be the opposite of what we thought. As host of this show, I can relate to my guests’ experiences because I come from a bifurcated background; there are times when I’ve felt invisible; there are other times I’ve felt privileged. I’m passionate about exposing and breaking down barriers between people to make the world a better place. Many of my guests are being interviewed for the first time in their lives and it is an honor to host them. At times, listeners will hear unbelievable, yet true stories. What do everyday people have to say about their lives, their country, the world they grew up in, their hopes and dreams? When a person comes from any sort of privilege (and there are many kinds) there are a number of biases and assumptions we hold. On this show, I’ll unpack some of my own. When You’re Invisible hopes to inspire generous and honest conversations with others who are different from us, conversations that might help us see life in an entirely different way.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":104920988,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzAwNWI2ZDJmLWJkYTItNGRiZC1hZWVmLWFmMzkwMTQ1NmE2Ny9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg0OTYwNDcxJnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1707098941,"seedId":104920988,"seedShowId":104920988,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-when-youre-invisible","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"When You're Invisible","url":"/podcast/1119-when-youre-invisible-104920988/","episodeIds":[]},"104974284":{"customLinks":[],"description":"When Mangesh Hattikudur (Part-Time Genius, Humans Growing Stuff) set out to do a big, sweeping show on astrology, he didn’t realize the first interview would change the course of his life.

Fifty years later, with drug overdoses in the US at a record high, are we any closer to ‘victory’? The War on Drugs has a more profound effect on society than any of us really understands. It is embedded in the fabric of our culture and permeates our daily lives in visible and invisible ways – perhaps the most daunting pandemic we face.\nLava for Good’s The War on Drugs podcast, co-hosted by comedian Clayton English and Greg Glod, senior criminal justice fellow at Americans for Prosperity, examines the true cost of five decades of policy, policing, and persecution. Special guests, including diverse subject matter experts, peel back the surface of this complicated period of US history, showing the ways the War on Drugs has fueled over incarceration, exacerbated addiction and hampered economic progress. By shining a spotlight on how our communities have crumbled under the weight of this so-called ‘war,’ we can explore the politicization of public health policy, institutional racism and classism in the legislation and administration of criminal law, and how decriminalization and other alternatives could bring the fruitless ‘war’ to an end. \nThe War on Drugs will be available every Wednesday beginning January 25 wherever you get your podcasts.\nThe War on Drugs is a production of Lava for Good Podcasts in association with Signal Co.

Some of our most valuable and vulnerable moments happened there as we watched parents struggle with bills, wrestle with shifting family dynamics, or figure out new roles for themselves as feminism changed the national terrain. Your Mama’s Kitchen is a podcast about cuisine and culture, ingredients and identities, and the meals and memories that make us who we are.\n\nPlease Note: This is now the home of Your Mama’s Kitchen hosted by Michele Norris. To listen to Michelle Obama: The Light, search for it wherever you listen.\nHosted on Acast.

I’m here to tell you it’s never too late to change your course and awaken the healthy, wise, and wonderful woman within. My name is Dominique Sachse, and I love to ask questions, which was why I spent nearly three decades of my life in the TV news business. I also started a YouTube channel in 2014 to connect intimately with my community, and I took an even deeper dive in my book Life Makeover - Embrace The Bold, Beautiful and Blessed You. I’ll be the first to say, I’ve made mistakes, and I’m not afraid to be vulnerable and learn from them. I mean let’s face it, this stage of life can be complicated. Children are moving out, relationships are being examined, our parents are aging, and we’re having to manage all of this along with our menopause! It’s easy to lose sight of ourselves, but can I just say.. we matter. So, whether it’s finding ways to enhance and celebrate our own beauty, taking bold steps toward living our best life in the second half of life, finding ways to be healthier, happier, and more spiritually connected, I will bring you thinkers and innovators who share the same passion of flushing out these ideas. It’s my goal to leave us all feeling inspired, thought and intent-driven, and with a sense of purpose in whatever we pursue. Let’s celebrate growing older together and embrace our Prime.

In his new series, Jamie tells the story of Megan Bhari, an inspirational 16 year old girl who in 2012 launches a charity to grant wishes to seriously ill children. The charity is called Believe in Magic and it attracts the support of the biggest boy band in the world: One Direction. Believe in Magic soon becomes a household name in the child cancer community, putting on parties, sending thoughtful gifts and organizing trips to Disney. Megan is adored by all those she helps and is given an award by the then Prime Minister David Cameron. What’s even more remarkable is that Megan is herself extremely unwell. She announces that she has been diagnosed with a brain tumour. She raises money online for life saving treatment in the United States. But a group of internet sleuths start to suspect that Meg isn’t ill at all. When they discover Megan is in a Disney resort rather than a US hospital, they decide to hire a private detective to prove Megan is faking her illness–and expose the truth to the world. But events take an unexpected turn. And the internet sleuths-who are all parents of seriously ill children themselves-begin to wonder if they've got it all wrong. \"It wasn't meant to end like this,\" says one. Author Jamie Bartlett and producer Ruth Mayer investigate the truth about Megan Bhari, tracing back over the sleuths’ incredible discoveries, meeting Megan’s old friends and supporters, and exploring the medical profession’s most mysterious condition. After months of investigation, Jamie and Ruth discover a secretive investigation into the truth about Megan’s medical condition. The conclusion is shocking–and will have far-reaching consequences for everyone involved. Believe in Magic is a BBC Studios production.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":115257187,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2ljaGVmLmJiY2kuY28udWsvaW1hZ2VzL2ljLzMwMDB4MzAwMC9wMGZtOTlsNC5qcGc","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1701101640,"seedId":115257187,"seedShowId":115257187,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1292-believe-in-magic","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Believe in Magic","url":"/podcast/1292-believe-in-magic-115257187/","episodeIds":[]},"115868947":{"customLinks":[],"description":"The true story of a man who wreaks havoc on a community: “He taps phone lines, steals notary stamps, gets banned from restaurants, hacks emails, and forges signatures.

Staff Sergeant Robert Bales leaves his base–in the dead of the night–and lays siege to two villages, killing a reported sixteen innocent Afghan civilians. The reaction from the American government is swift and severe; provoking universal condemnation and a life sentence in Fort Leavenworth military prison.\nOver a decade later, the lingering question about what became known as the Kandahar Massacre remains. Why did it happen? Anchored by 18 hours of exclusive interviews from America's most notorious war criminal and complemented by a chorus of people central to this polarizing case, THE WAR WITHIN: THE ROBERT BALES STORY is a 12-episode investigative podcast that will shed new light on the inner sanctum of the military. Throughout, the series will contain explosive revelations that run the gamut, from brain injuries, to potentially toxic drugs, to possible cover-ups by the nation Robert Bales swore to protect.\nEpisodes drop every Thursday, starting on June 29th.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":117863007,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzg3ZWFjYzQ1LWRjYzEtNDBhMS1iOWNkLWIwMjcwMTM1YjFkYi9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg3Mjg4MDcxJnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1706809613,"seedId":117863007,"seedShowId":117863007,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-the-war-within-the-robert","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"THE WAR WITHIN: THE ROBERT BALES STORY","url":"/podcast/1119-the-war-within-the-robert-117863007/","episodeIds":[]},"118498756":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Join Grammy-nominated hitmaker, entrepreneur, and philanthropist Billy Mann on a journey through the twists and turns of failure in \"Yeah, I Fucked That Up.\" Mann has had the privilege of rubbing shoulders with some of culture's most influential figures.

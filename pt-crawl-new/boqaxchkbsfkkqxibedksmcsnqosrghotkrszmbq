In Laurence Sterne’s A Sentimental Journey, the lead character Yorick comforts a young woman who has been abandoned by a little pet goat that had proved as faithless as her lover. Yorick describes her effect upon his ‘sweet sensibility’, “I sat down close by her, and Maria let me wipe the tears away as they fell, with my handkerchief.  I then steeped it in my own - and then in hers - and then in mine - and then I wiped hers again - and as I did it, I felt such undescribable emotions within me, as I am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion. (I am positive I have a soul; nor can all the books with which materialists have pestered the world ever convince me to the contrary.)”It seems a bit mawkish to us now but Sterne, Richardson and Mackenzie were all part of the ‘cult of sensibility’ in the eighteenth century which elevated the sentimental novel to the height of literary art. Jane Austen’s masterpiece, Sense and Sensibility, has traditionally been taken as a parody of sensibility. But what caused the rush to emotion that so infused and enthused the Sensibility movement and was Jane Austen really so critical of the expression of feeling?With Claire Tomalin, literary biographer and author of Jane Austen: A Life and The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft; John Mullan, Senior Lecturer in English at University College London; Hermione Lee, Goldsmiths Professor of English Literature, University of Oxford."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01grdgj.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2010-07-26T13:02:13Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p0054888","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:p0054887","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2002-01-10T00:00:00Z","label":"10 Jan 2002"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"Nuclear Physics","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Nuclear Physics"},"synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg examines the 20th century development of nuclear physics as a science.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg discusses the controversial 20th century scientific breakthrough and development of nuclear physics, which harnesses the enigmatic qualities of the atom’s core to create nuclear power.","long":"Melvyn Bragg examines one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century, and certainly the most controversial; the development of nuclear physics.

In 1215 Pope Innocent III called the greatest meeting of Catholic minds for a hundred years. He hoped that the Fourth Lateran Council would represent the crowning glory of a Papacy that was more powerful than ever before, and it laid down decrees to standardise Christian belief across the whole of Western Europe and heal the papal schism of a generation before. But despite the wealth and power of the Vatican, all was not as it should have been in the Catholic world; Jerusalem was lost, the Crusades were failing, and in the regions of Europe the spectre of heresy moved over the land. It loomed largest in the wealthy Languedoc region of Southern France, where celibate vegetarians called Cathars were proving more popular than Jesus. The Pope moved against the Cathars but why was Catharism such a threat, what were its beliefs and what was the intellectual and spiritual climate that made the high middle ages the era of the heretic?With Malcolm Barber, Professor of Medieval History at the University of Reading; Miri Rubin, Professor of Medieval History at Queen Mary, University of London; Euan Cameron, Professor of Modern History at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01grdg3.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2010-03-17T14:33:16Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p005489h","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:p005489g","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2002-01-24T00:00:00Z","label":"24 Jan 2002"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"Happiness","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Happiness"},"synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg considers whether 'happiness' means living a life of pleasure or of virtue.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg discusses whether 'happiness' means living a life of pleasure or of virtue. How much does this ancient philosophical debate still define what it means to be happy today?","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss whether 'happiness' means living a life of pleasure, or of virtue.  It is an old question, and the Roman poet Horace attempted to answer it when he wrote; 'Not the owner of many possessions will you be right to call happy: he more rightly deserves the name of happy who knows how to use the gods's gifts wisely and to put up with rough poverty, and who fears dishonour more than death'.  It seems a noble sentiment but for the Greek Sophist Thrasymachus this sort of attitude was the epitome of moral weakness:  For him poverty was miserable, and happiness flowed from wealth and power over men, an idea so persuasive that Plato wrote The Republic in response to its challenge.

He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven: “Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,Enwrought with golden and silver light,The blue and the dim and the dark clothsOf night and light and the half-light,I would spread the cloths under your feet:But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.”           But Yeats the dreamer and the poet was also a mystic, a philosopher and a practitioner of magic.

When Socrates asked the question ‘How should man live?’ Plato and Aristotle answered that man should live a life of virtue. Plato claimed there were four great virtues - Temperance, Justice, Prudence and Courage and the Christian Church added three more - Faith, Hope and Love. But where does the motivation for virtue come from? Do we need rules to tell us how to behave or can we rely on our feelings of compassion and empathy towards other human beings? Shakespeare’s Iago says “Virtue! A fig! ‘tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners. ” So is virtue a character trait possessed by some but not others? Is it derived from reason? Or does it flow from the innate sympathies of the human heart? For the last two thousand years philosophers have grappled with these ideas, but now in the twenty first century a modern reappraisal of virtue is taking the argument back to basics with Aristotle.

When the Monarchy was restored in 1660 it was only Marvell's intervention that saved Milton from execution. By then, Marvell argued, Milton was old and blind and posed no threat to Charles II. But as a young man Milton had been an activist and pamphleteer extraordinaire. Allegedly inspired by a meeting with Galileo he wrote in passionate defence of Liberty. He detested the Church's insistence on empty ritual. And most dramatically for his time he demanded that the state serve its people rather than the people serve the state.

Socrates, the Greek philosopher of the 4th century BC, famously declared that \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" His drive towards rigorous self-enquiry and his uncompromising questioning of assumptions laid firm foundations for the history of Western Philosophy. But these qualities did not make him popular in ancient Athens: Socrates was deemed to be a dangerous subversive for his crime, as he described it, of \"asking questions and searching into myself and other men\". In 399 BC Socrates was sentenced to death on the charge of being \"an evil-doer and a curious person\". Two thousand years later, the novelist George Eliot was moved to reply to Socrates that \"The unexamined life may not be worth living, but the life too closely examined may not be lived at all\". For Eliot too much self-scrutiny could lead to paralysis rather than clarity. What did Socrates mean by his injunction?

When Newton published his Principia Mathematica in 1687 his work was founded on one simple message: Nature has laws and we can find them. His explanation of the movements of the planets, and of gravity, was rooted in the principle that the universe functions like a machine and its patterns are predictable. Newton’s equations not only explained why night follows day but, importantly, predicted that night would continue to follow day for evermore. Three hundred years later Newton’s principles were thrown into question by a dread word that represented the antithesis of his vision of order: that word was Chaos. According to Chaos Theory, the world is far more complicated than was previously thought. Instead of the future of the universe being irredeemably fixed, we are, in fact, subject to the whims of random unpredictability. Tiny actions can change the world by setting off an infinite chain of reactions: famously, if a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil - it could cause a tornado in Berlin. So what’s the answer? Is the universe chaotic or orderly? If it’s all so complicated, why does night still follow day? And what is going on in that most complex machine of all - the brain - to filter and construct our perception of the world?

Freud thought a lot about this process and in 1922 he published Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, in which he pronounced that the group \"wants to be ruled and oppressed and to fear its masters.\" He was writing at a time when ideas about rules and oppression were much discussed because the 20th century was also a century of fascism, totalitarianism and dictatorship.

Henry James said “Realism is what in some shape or form we might encounter, whereas romanticism is something we will never encounter”.

Attacked as ordinary, mundane, overly democratic and lacking the imaginative demands of poetry, its defendants argued that the ordinariness of life contained a complexity and depth previously unseen and unconsidered. At its best the realist novel was like life itself - complex in appearance, rich in character, diverse in outlook, teeming with ideas and operating on several levels. It was a forum for the confusions of the Victorian age over Christianity and Darwinism, economics, morality and psychology, yet it was also a domestic novel concerned with the individuality of human relationships. From the provincialism of George Eliot’s Middlemarch to Hardy’s bleak and brutal Wessex, Victorian Realism touched all the great Victorian authors, but can it truly be the touchstone of an age which produced the fantasy of Alice in Wonderland, the escapism of Tthe Waterbabies and the abundant grotesquerie of Dickensian London?

In 711 a small army of North African Berbers invaded Spain and established an Iberian Islamic culture that would last for over 700 years. Despite periods of infighting and persecution, Muslim Spain was a land where Muslims, Jews and Christians co-existed in relative peace and harmony. Its capital, Cordoba, although not unique amongst Spanish cities, became the centre and focus for generations of revered and respected philosophers, physicians and scholars. By the 10th century Cordoba was one of the largest cities in the world. But what some historians refer to as Cordoba’s Golden Age came to an end in the 11th century, when the society was destabilised by new threats from Africa to the South and Christendom to the North. However, it was not until 1492, when Granada fell to the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella, that Islamic Spain was well and truly over.In that same year the Jews were expelled from its shores and Christopher Columbus set sail to lead Spanish Christian expansionism into the new world. But how did Muslims, Jews and Christians interact in practice? Was this period of apparent tolerance underpinned by a respect for each other’s sacred texts?

Stars, like everything else in the universe, are subject to change. They are born among vast swirls of gas and dust and they die in the stunning explosions we call supernovae. They create black holes and neutron stars and, in the very beginning of the universe, they forged the elements from which all life is made. But how do stars keep burning for millions of years, why do they self-destruct with such ferocity and what will happen to the universe when they all go out?With Paul Murdin, Senior Fellow at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge; Janna Levin, Advanced Fellow in Theoretical Physics in the Department of Applied Mathematics & Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge; Phil Charles, Professor of Astronomy at Southampton University."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01gn3jk.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2010-06-30T10:36:42Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p00548wp","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:p00548wn","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2003-04-03T00:00:00Z","label":"03 Apr 2003"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"The Spanish Civil War","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"The Spanish Civil War"},"synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg examines the causes, events and repercussions of the Spanish Civil War.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg discusses the causes, events and repercussions of the Spanish Civil War, which became an international battleground for the forces of Fascism and Communism as Europe geared up for war.","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Spanish Civil War which was a defining war of the twentieth century.

They founded their ascendancy on the twin pillars of land and heredity and in terms of privilege, preferment, power, style and wealth, they dominated British society.

At its peak, its influence stretched from western India to eastern China via the farthest reaches of the Indonesian archipelago. It had a fleet of 130 twelve hundred tonne ships and commanded an army of 200,000 troops that came to dominate the Indian subcontinent. It funded governments, toppled princes and generated spectacular amounts of money from trading textiles and spices. But this wasn’t an empire, it wasn’t even a state, it was a company. The East India Company, founded in 1600, lasted for 258 years before the British state gained full control of its activities.

He described it to the historian Tacitus, It seemed as though the sea was being sucked backwards, as if it were being pushed back by the shaking of the land. Certainly the shoreline moved outwards, and many sea creatures were left on dry sand. Behind us were frightening dark clouds, rent by lightning twisted and hurled, opening to reveal huge figures of flame. These were like lightning but bigger.

Theirs was a union designed to bring together the rival factions of France and finally end the French Wars of Religion.

Scratched onto rocks, pots and portable items, he found scribblings of a very unexpected but strangely familiar nature. He had expected to see the complex pictorial hieroglyphic script the Egyptian establishment had used for over 1000 years, but it seemed that at this very early period, 1700 BC, the mine workers and Semitic slaves had started using a new informal system of graffiti, one which was brilliantly simple, endlessly adaptable and perfectly portable: the Alphabet. This was probably the earliest example of an alphabetic script and it bears an uncanny resemblance to our own.Did the alphabet really spring into life almost fully formed?

And what, in the explanation of evolutionary science, provided the catalyst to start turning the cycle of life?With Richard Dawkins, Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University; Richard Corfield, Visiting Senior Lecturer at the Centre for Earth, Planetary, Space and Astronomical Research at the Open University; Linda Partridge, Biology and

The French philosopher of food Brillat-Savarin wrote in his Physiology of Taste, 'The pleasures of the table belong to all times and all ages, to every country and to every day; they go hand in hand with all our other pleasures; outlast them, and remain to console us for their loss' . The story of food is cultural as well as culinary, and what we eat and how we eat has always been linked to who we are or whom we might become, from the great humanist thinker Erasmus warning us to 'Always use a fork!' to the materialist philosopher Feuerbach telling us baldly, 'You are what you eat'.But what have we eaten, and why? In Europe since the Renaissance how have our intellectual appetites fed our empty stomachs?

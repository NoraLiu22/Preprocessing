Childhood malnourishment is also linked to developing problems, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7949429/">cardiovascular disease, hypertension and metabolic disorders</a> as an adult.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">People who were exposed to famine while in utero are the most vulnerable<i>, </i>particularly if the malnutrition occurred <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09603123.2021.1888894">in early gestation</a>, when organs first start to form.A <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197608122950701">foundational 1976 study of 300,000 men</a> who were born during or shortly after the <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/moore-institute/dutch-famine-birth-cohort">Dutch Hunger Winter</a> of 1944 to 1945 found that those exposed to hunger in the first half of pregnancy were more likely to be obese later in life than those who weren&rsquo;t exposed or who were exposed later in their gestation. More recent research has drawn similar conclusions. For example, one study found that men who had developed in utero during the Dutch famine were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10087479/#:~:text=The%20Dutch%20famine%20context&amp;text=In%20September%201944%2C%20Germany%20imposed,people%20to%20a%20severe%20famine">more likely to live a shorter life</a> and to develop health problems such as cardiovascular disease compared with those born right after the famine.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">&ldquo;What you experience before your birth can affect your health decades later. It&rsquo;s a huge, long shadow,&rdquo; says <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/bas-heijmans#tab-1">Bas Heijmans</a>, an epigeneticist at the Netherlands&rsquo; Leiden University Medical Center.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">The mechanism for these long-lasting effects may be <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160616302974">epigenetic</a>, whereby certain biological processes activate or deactivate different parts of the genome. The most studied way this occurs is through <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/">DNA methylation</a>. Famine influences this process: research on the Dutch Hunger Winter, for example, has found that even six decades later, people who had been developing in utero during the famine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18955703/">showed differences in their DNA methylation</a> compared with siblings who were born later.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">&ldquo;It may well be that these changes in epigenetics explain why your body remembers the famine decades later,&rdquo; Heijmans says&mdash;or possibly why your offspring&rsquo;s body might do so. Recent &ldquo;third-generation&rdquo; research, much of it focused on the Great Chinese Famine of 1959 through 1961, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234145486_Maternal_Prenatal_Nutrition_and_Health_in_Grandchildren_and_Subsequent_Generations">has found</a> that the children of parents who were exposed to famine prenatally had higher risks of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927634/">hyperglycemia</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35449569/">poorer cognitive function</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36507560/">obesity</a>. Some researchers argue that such intergenerational mechanisms might be responsible for the striking rise of diseases such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30310152/">type 2 diabetes</a> in China&mdash;though some, including Heijmans, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-019-0195-5">have argued that these data were misinterpreted</a>. They say that many of these studies fail to account for the difference in age between famine-exposed subjects versus postfamine controls; the controls have been, on average, three to five years younger.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep13792">Not all studies have found a &ldquo;grandchild&rdquo; effect</a>. For those that do, the effects tend to be weaker in the third generation than for the generation that was directly exposed to famine in utero. Most evidence peters out beyond the third generation. In other words, while the offspring of the person who was exposed prenatally might be affected, there&rsquo;s little evidence that the offspring&rsquo;s children will be.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">&ldquo;Intergenerational epigenetic inheritance is fairly well accepted. Particularly if a woman is pregnant and exposed [to hunger], there&rsquo;s good evidence that her offspring can have epigenetic changes, and those changes can persist for decades,&rdquo; says <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Sarah-Watkins-7675f3f6-96e1-47bc-88df-8f5e1d034617/">Sarah Watkins</a>, an epigenetic epidemiologist at the University of Bristol in England. &ldquo;But when you get to <i>transgenerational</i> effects&mdash;so three generations or more where there isn&rsquo;t direct exposure&mdash;it is very controversial.&rdquo;</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">One main problem is that researchers haven&rsquo;t found a &ldquo;solid molecular mechanism,&rdquo; she says: a biological explanation for how such information would be passed down. Furthermore, there are reasons to think our biology protects us against this type of multigenerational memory. After an egg is fertilized, our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130423/">epigenetic marks are wiped</a>. They&rsquo;re erased once again in the fetus&rsquo;s germ cells, which eventually form gametes.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">As a result, many researchers argue that any epigenetic multigenerational changes aren&rsquo;t the result of these changes themselves being passed down. Rather, it could be that anything a pregnant individual is exposed to also affects not only the fetus but&mdash;because female fetuses already carry the ovaries and eggs that can lead to their future children&mdash;their grandchildren, too, at least along the maternal line.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Other scientists, however, remain convinced that there&rsquo;s more going on. They point to research that has found that fathers&rsquo; environmental exposures before conception also affect their offspring.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">It&rsquo;s not clear exactly what could be causing these apparently inherited risks. One theory is that the &ldquo;erasure&rdquo; of epigenetic marks may not be complete. &ldquo;There are some sites in the genome which don&rsquo;t get wiped&mdash;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26046444/">they seem to escape</a> these waves of demethylation and remethylation. So that&rsquo;s one potential mechanism by which it could be maintained,&rdquo; Watkins says. The other argument is that wiped DNA methylation changes might be restored later. But, she says, when it comes to humans, &ldquo;it is all still sort of hypothetical.&rdquo;</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Researchers admit that this is a thorny topic to study. &ldquo;With famine, you get social breakdowns. So it gets incredibly difficult to maintain the records to identify who was exposed,&rdquo; says <a href="https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=aryeh-stein-53">Aryeh Stein</a>, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University, who researches child nutrition and its consequences for adult health. &ldquo;You know very little about the detail of the circumstances of the pregnancy, and you know very little about what happened to that person throughout childhood.&rdquo;</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Because famine often occurs alongside other traumas, such as war and displacement, it&rsquo;s also hard to untangle cause and effect: Are these epigenetic changes the result of food shortages, other environmental stresses or a combination?</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Even so, scientists say, the research is clear on a crucial takeaway: early-life deprivation and trauma, including hunger and war, have long-lasting, sometimes catastrophic effects&mdash;ones that are both tragic and, because they&rsquo;re human-made, avoidable. &ldquo;There is no excuse for acute famine because there&rsquo;s enough food in the world,&rdquo; Stein says. &ldquo;It just needs to get to the people.&rdquo;</p></div><footer class="article__block-KZIY9 footer-u1I4n"><div class="divide-L7a-x"><div

The most studied way this occurs is through <a href=\\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/\\">DNA methylation</a>. Famine influences this process: research on the Dutch Hunger Winter, for example, has found that even six decades later, people who had been developing in utero during the famine <a href=\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18955703/\\">showed differences in their DNA methylation</a> compared with siblings who were born later."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"&ldquo;It may well be that these changes in epigenetics explain why your body remembers the famine decades later,&rdquo; Heijmans says&mdash;or possibly why your offspring&rsquo;s body might do so. Recent &ldquo;third-generation&rdquo; research, much of it focused on the Great Chinese Famine of 1959 through 1961, <a href=\\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234145486_Maternal_Prenatal_Nutrition_and_Health_in_Grandchildren_and_Subsequent_Generations\\">has found</a> that the children of parents who were exposed to famine prenatally had higher risks of <a href=\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927634/\\">hyperglycemia</a>, <a href=\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35449569/\\">poorer cognitive function</a> and <a href=\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36507560/\\">obesity</a>. Some researchers argue that such intergenerational mechanisms might be responsible for the striking rise of diseases such as <a href=\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30310152/\\">type 2 diabetes</a> in China&mdash;though some, including Heijmans, <a href=\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-019-0195-5\\">have argued that these data were misinterpreted</a>.

For those that do, the effects tend to be weaker in the third generation than for the generation that was directly exposed to famine in utero. Most evidence peters out beyond the third generation. In other words, while the offspring of the person who was exposed prenatally might be affected, there&rsquo;s little evidence that the offspring&rsquo;s children will be."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"&ldquo;Intergenerational epigenetic inheritance is fairly well accepted.

Furthermore, there are reasons to think our biology protects us against this type of multigenerational memory. After an egg is fertilized, our <a href=\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130423/\\">epigenetic marks are wiped</a>. They&rsquo;re erased once again in the fetus&rsquo;s germ cells, which eventually form gametes."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"As a result, many researchers argue that any epigenetic multigenerational changes aren&rsquo;t the result of these changes themselves being passed down. Rather, it could be that anything a pregnant individual is exposed to also affects not only the fetus but&mdash;because female fetuses already carry the ovaries and eggs that can lead to their future children&mdash;their grandchildren, too, at least along the maternal line."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"Other scientists, however, remain convinced that there&rsquo;s more going on. They point to research that has found that fathers&rsquo; environmental exposures before conception also affect their offspring."},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"It&rsquo;s not clear exactly what could be causing these apparently inherited risks. One theory is that the &ldquo;erasure&rdquo; of epigenetic marks may not be complete. &ldquo;There are some sites in the genome which don&rsquo;t get wiped&mdash;<a href=\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26046444/\\">they seem to escape</a> these waves of demethylation and remethylation. So that&rsquo;s one potential mechanism by which it could be maintained,&rdquo; Watkins says. The other argument is that wiped DNA methylation changes might be restored later. But, she says, when it comes to humans, &ldquo;it is all still sort of hypothetical.&rdquo;"},{"tag":"p","type":"paragraph","attributes":{},"content":"Researchers admit that this is a thorny topic to study. &ldquo;With famine, you get social breakdowns.

<h2>Use And Processing Of Information</h2>

<p>In addition to the purposes and uses described above, we use information in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To identify you when you visit our Sites.</li>
    <li>To provide products and services.</li>
    <li>To improve our Sites, services, and product offerings.</li>
    <li>To conduct statistical, marketing and demographic analyses of our delivery subscribers and their subscription patterns.</li>
    <li>To respond to inquiries related to support, employment opportunities, or other requests.</li>
    <li>To send marketing and promotional materials, including information relating to our products, services, sales, or promotions.</li>
    <li>For internal administrative purposes, as well as to manage our relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose.  For example, if you purchase a subscription we collect your information to provide the service to you, but we also collect your information as we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your subscription.  As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to provide the service you purchased, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.</p>

    <li><strong>Other Disclosures with Your Consent.</strong> We may ask if you would like us to disclose your information to other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Disclosures without Your Consent.</strong> We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws.  We may also disclose your information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third-party intermediary.</li>

Their use of your information is not governed by this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We disclose your information to service providers.  Among other things, service providers help us to process payments, and assist in the fulfillment of orders, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management.</li>
    <li><strong>Social-Media Platforms.</strong> Account registration can be done by linking your Facebook or Google accounts.  If you choose to link your social-media account or account relating to other third-party services, you may be asking third parties to send us certain information from those social media accounts or services accounts, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  The use of your information by those third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media Networks.</strong> Some of our websites have features such as, plugins, widgets, or and other tools made available by third parties that may result in information being collected or disclosed between us and the third party.

    <li><strong>Aggregated and Deidentified Personal Information</strong> We may disclose or use aggregated or deidentified data for any lawful purpose.  Aggregated data means information that relates to a group or category of consumers, from which individual consumer identities have been removed, that is not linked or reasonably linkable to an individual consumer or household.  Deidentified data means information that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, an identified or identifiable consumer.  Aggregated or Deidentified data is generally not considered to be personal information.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last twelve months, we have &quot;sold&quot; and &quot;shared&quot; (as such terms are defined in the California Privacy Rights Act (&quot;CPRA&quot;) and the Colorado Privacy Act (&quot;CPA&quot;), and have disclosed for the purposes of &quot;targeted advertising&quot; (as defined in the CPA and the Virginia Consumer Data Privacy Act (&quot;VCDPA&quot;)), the following categories of personal information for marketing purposes to business partners and third parties, such as social media platforms and/or data brokers as described in this Privacy Policy.

<ul>

You can stop receiving promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in emails that you receive.  If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you service-related communications.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotional Mailings.</strong> If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us (our contact information is below) with &quot;NO SNAIL MAIL&quot; in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code.  Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotional Text Messages.</strong> If you receive a text message from us that contains promotional information you can opt-out of receiving future text messages by replying &quot;STOP.&quot;</li>
    <li><strong>Access To Your Personal Information.</strong> You have the right to request access to personal information we hold about you.  Specifically, you have the right to request access to information about the categories of personal information concerned and categories of recipients to whom the personal information has been or will be disclosed, and the sources from which we receive that personal information among other information.  You generally have the right to receive this personal information, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format so you can transmit this personal information to another entity.</li>
    <li><strong>Changes/ Corrections To Your Personal Information.</strong> We rely on you to update and correct your personal information.  Most of our Sites allow you to modify or delete your account profile.  Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.  If our Site does not permit you to update or correct certain information contact us at the address described below.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion Of Your Personal Information.</strong> Typically, we retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.  You may, however, request information about how long we keep a specific type of information, or request that we delete your personal information by contacting us at the address described below.  In addition, we may keep your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of our agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-Out of the Selling or Sharing of Personal Information.</strong> Our use of cookies or other tracking technologies is deemed a &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;share&quot; under California law (in this context &quot;sharing&quot; means cross-contextual behavioral advertising) of personal information.  You may elect to opt out of the use of cookies by clicking the &quot;Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information (Opt Out of Targeted Advertising)&quot; button at the footer of our Site.
        <ul>
            <li>The disclosure of the following categories of personal information may be considered a &quot;share&quot; or &quot;sale&quot;: direct identifiers, device information, geolocation data, internet and other electronic activity information.</li>

    <li><strong>Objection to Processing or Revocation Of Consent.</strong> In certain circumstances, you may object to processing of your personal information.  If you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information then we may no longer be able to provide you services.  In some cases, we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity.  You may revoke consent to processing (where such processing is based upon consent) by contacting us at the address described below.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-discrimination</strong> We do not discriminate against consumers who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Policy, nor do we retaliate against employees who exercise these rights. However, we may require the use of your personal information to provide access to the services. Therefore, when you exercise your deletion right, in particular, as well as other rights, you may lose access to certain aspects of the services that require your personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Consent to or Limit the Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information.</strong> You have the right to consent to the processing of your sensitive personal information in Colorado and Virginia. Separately, you have the right in California to instruct us to limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to only that which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer or for specific business purposes defined by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Appeal.</strong> You have the right to appeal our decisions about your privacy requests.  If you would like to appeal a decision regarding your privacy request, please contacts us.  Additionally, you may contact the Colorado or Virginia Attorneys General Offices.</li>
</ul>

We must be able to verify your identity to make sure you are the person about whom we have collected personal information or an authorized representative.

The information you must provide as part of the verification process may include name, contact information (such as email address or phone number), relationship with us, and residency.  We may also ask for additional information as needed based on your relationship with us.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf to access or delete your personal information.  To do so, you must (1) provide that authorized agent written and signed permission to submit such request, and (2) verify your own identity directly with us.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may limit or deny your requests to access, modify, or delete your information, or to revoke consent or object.  This may occur because the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity.</p>

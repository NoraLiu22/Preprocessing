I watched him bat on India's tour of England in 2002, and then that double-century in Adelaide, which remains my favourite innings of his.I think I became a serious fan of him when I was around 13 years old. The thing that stood out for me was that he put a price on his wicket. He was a fighter - as long as Rahul bhai was the crease, it was very difficult for the opposition to take wickets.  As a spectator you felt comfortable that India would not collapse; as long as he was at the crease, we would put up a reasonable total. To bowl India out, you had to get him out as the opposition. He provided that solidity. I observed his technique and temperament closely. The way he spoke about the game, he had a lot of knowledge, but he always kept his game simple and did not complicate things too much. By coincidence, both of us have used the same kit - from SG. I never used the same bat as him, though, but I always wanted the "Dazzler" batting gloves he used, that SG made. I really liked the design, and when I signed with SG for the first time, I asked them for those gloves. Despite my enchantment with him, I did not copy him. There is a similarity in our games, but that's not because of my fascination with him. That came mainly through my experiences with Saurashtra, where I learned that scoring a hundred alone isn't enough, you have to carry your team. That is how I learned responsibility - it is about helping my team to raise a big total, and for that I ought to attach importance to my wicket. I learned that from my junior cricket days with Saurashtra, which was a weaker team in domestic cricket. Yes, you could say that I subconsciously imbibed that from Rahul bhai. His influence had shaped my thought process. Meeting your idol is always special. I remember meeting Rahul bhai for the first time around 2006 or 2007. It was the Race Course ground in my home town, Rajkot. India were preparing for some series. I remember someone introduced me to him, and I think he had heard my name already: I had just played for India Under-19 and the Deodhar Trophy, and had scored some runs in the Ranji Trophy. I think he was a little busy at the time, but he said that I could always chat to him whenever I came to Bangalore to the National Cricket Academy. As it happened, I made my India debut in Bangalore, in the second Test of the Australia series in 2010, which we won. It was a memorable few days for me, especially the 72 I made in the second innings that contributed to the win. The best part about Rahul bhai has been that he understands a player's psychology. I was lucky that I had him around when I started playing cricket. He had already gone through so many things in his journey, so he was able to tell me what I could expect, in a way. He helped me understand when I was young that it is not all about technique. As a young cricketer you might want to focus on technique a lot, but eventually I realised  - yes, you need technique, but there are other aspects as well. There is one other thing I will be thankful to him for. He helped me understand the importance of switching off from cricket. I had the same thought, more or less, but when I spoke to him, it gave me a lot of clarity about it and I was sure of what I needed to do. I also saw in county cricket how they keep personal and professional lives separate. I value that advice a lot. Many people consider me to be focused. Yes, I am focused, But I also know when to switch off. There is life beyond cricket. I cannot say in one line what Rahul bhai means to me. He has always been an inspiration, and will remain one. <I>Cheteshwar Pujara has played over 75 Tests over India since 2010</I>","articleSection":"June 2020 issue","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1225715/cheteshwar-pujara---rahul-dravid-taught-me-there-is-life-beyond-cricket"},"headline":"Cheteshwar Pujara: 'Rahul Dravid taught me there is life beyond cricket'","description":"The India No. 3 talks about growing up idolising perhaps the greatest No. 3 India have ever had","datePublished":"2020-06-27T001:00:02+00:00","dateModified":"2020-09-14T006:01:45+00:00","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","ESPNcricinfo":"Organizations name","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/espncricinfo.com","logo":"https:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com/static/images/logo.png","width":"125","height":"26"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Interview by Nagraj Gollapudi"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/cricket_monthly/tcm_updated.png","width":"499","height":"91"}} </script>

<i>In the first instalment of a new series where cricketers talk about the first sportsperson they wanted to be: Cheteshwar Pujara on Rahul Dravid</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class=text_index>I</span> must have been eight years old when I saw <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/28114.html>Rahul <i>bhai</i></a> bat for the first time. I watched him bat on India's tour of England <a href=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/28114.html?class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;opposition=1;orderby=start;spanmax1=24+Jan+2003;spanmin1=20+Jun+2001;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=match>in 2002</a>, and then that double-century <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/15119/scorecard/64060/australia-vs-india-2nd-test-india-tour-of-australia-2003-04>in Adelaide</a>, which remains my favourite innings of his.
</p>
<p>
I think I became a serious fan of him when I was around 13 years old. The thing that stood out for me was that he put a price on his wicket. He was a fighter - as long as Rahul <i>bhai</i> was the crease, it was very difficult for the opposition to take wickets.  As a spectator you felt comfortable that India would not collapse; as long as he was at the crease, we would put up a reasonable total. To bowl India out, you had to get him out as the opposition. He provided that solidity. 
</p>
<p>
I observed his technique and temperament closely. The way he spoke about the game, he had a lot of knowledge, but he always kept his game simple and did not complicate things too much. 
</p>
<p>
By coincidence, both of us have used the same kit - from SG. I never used the same bat as him, though, but I always wanted the "Dazzler" batting gloves he used, that SG made. I really liked the design, and when I signed with SG for the first time, I asked them for those gloves.

Despite my enchantment with him, I did not copy him. There is a similarity in our games, but that's not because of my fascination with him.

That is how I learned responsibility - it is about helping my team to raise a big total, and for that I ought to attach importance to my wicket. I learned that from my junior cricket days with Saurashtra, which was a weaker team in domestic cricket. 
</p>
<p>
Yes, you could say that I subconsciously imbibed that from Rahul <i>bhai</i>. His influence had shaped my thought process. 
</p>
<p>
Meeting your idol is always special. I remember meeting Rahul <i>bhai</i> for the first time around 2006 or 2007. It was the Race Course ground in my home town, Rajkot.

I think he was a little busy at the time, but he said that I could always chat to him whenever I came to Bangalore to the National Cricket Academy. 
</p>
<p>
As it happened, I made my India debut in Bangalore, in the <a href= https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/13112/scorecard/464527/india-vs-australia-2nd-test-australia-tour-of-india-sep-oct-2010-2010-11>second Test</a> of the Australia series in 2010, which we won. It was a memorable few days for me, especially the 72 I made in the second innings that contributed to the win.

<p>
The best part about Rahul <i>bhai</i> has been that he understands a player's psychology. I was lucky that I had him around when I started playing cricket. He had already gone through so many things in his journey, so he was able to tell me what I could expect, in a way. 
</p>
<p>
He helped me understand when I was young that it is not all about technique. As a young cricketer you might want to focus on technique a lot, but eventually I realised  - yes, you need technique, but there are other aspects as well. 
</p>
<p>
There is one other thing I will be thankful to him for. He helped me understand the importance of switching off from cricket. I had the same thought, more or less, but when I spoke to him, it gave me a lot of clarity about it and I was sure of what I needed to do. I also saw in county cricket how they keep personal and professional lives separate. I value that advice a lot. Many people consider me to be focused. Yes, I am focused, But I also know when to switch off. There is life beyond cricket. 
</p>
<p>
I cannot say in one line what Rahul <i>bhai</i> means to me. He has always been an inspiration, and will remain one.

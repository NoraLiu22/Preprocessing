After Georgia arrested four Russian military officers for suspected espionage, Russia responded by closing Georgian businesses and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/world/europe/07moscow.html">deporting Georgian citizens</a>. </p><p>With Georgia on the verge of joining NATO, but not yet subject to the organization’s <a href="https://www.history.com/news/nato-article-5-meaning-history-world-war-2">collective defense agreement</a>, Russia saw an opportunity to rein in its neighbor and demonstrate its military strength in the region.

So…to a large extent, Georgia was left on its own.” </p><p>After Russia called a halt to its advance into Georgia, a cease-fire on August 12 ended the Russia-Georgia War. According to <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/HUDOC_38263_08_Annexes_ENG.pdf">an official EU fact-finding report</a> in 2009, nearly 850 people were killed during the five-day conflict, while some 35,000 Georgians were left homeless. That same fact-finding report <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/georgia-began-war-with-russia-but-it-was-provoked-inquiry-finds-1795744.html">concluded</a> that though Georgia had initiated the war, Russia had provoked its neighbor over a long period and overreacted to that initial artillery attack. </p><figure class="wp-block-image article__contained"><div class="wp-block-image__wrapper"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"><img style="display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271024%27%20height=%27577%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="Georgia after the War" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Georgia after the War" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 704px, calc(100vw - 2.5rem)" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/08/georgia-after-the-war.jpg?width=1080&amp;height=609&amp;crop=1080%3A609%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/08/georgia-after-the-war.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1154&amp;crop=2048%3A1154%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2x" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/08/georgia-after-the-war.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1154&amp;crop=2048%3A1154%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></div><figcaption class="wp-block-image__caption">A Georgian woman holds her head as she walks past a bombed building on August 23, 2008 in Gori, Georgia.

Meanwhile, Georgia turned further away from Russian influence in the aftermath of the conflict, and signed an association agreement with the EU in 2014.</p><p>Perhaps the most lasting consequence of the Russia-Georgia War can be seen in what happened six years later, in Ukraine. With Putin back as president (and Medvedev as prime minister), Kremlin-backed forces <a href="https://www.history.com/news/crimea-russia-ukraine-annexation">seized control of the Crimean peninsula</a> and parts of the Donbass region in 2014. Russia had undertaken a “much more serious military reform program,” in the wake of the Georgia war, Galeotti explains, “which led to the far more competent forces that we saw in the annexation of Crimea.” </p><p>Moreover, by not coming to Georgia’s defense in the lopsided 2008 conflict, the international community had proved to the Russians that it was “essentially lacking in the will to back up its fine words,” Galeotti says. “In hindsight, one wonders, would Crimea and the Donbass wars have happened if the West had been more robust in its response to Georgia?” </p></div><footer class="article-footer article-footer--topic"><div class="author-byline article__contained has-elevation"><div class="byline__content"><div class="byline__information"><div class="byline__author-wrapper"><div class="byline__avatar"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover"/><noscript><img sizes="112px" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=16&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 16w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=32&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 32w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=48&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 48w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=64&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 64w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=96&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 96w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=128&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 128w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=256&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 256w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=392&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 392w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 640w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=750&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 750w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=828&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 828w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=1080&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1080w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=1248&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1248w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=1920&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1920w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=2048&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=3840&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 3840w" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/sarah-pruitt.jpg?width=3840&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></div><p class="byline__author"><span aria-hidden="true">By: </span><a aria-label="Read more articles from Sarah Pruitt" link-name="Sarah Pruitt" href="/author/sarah-pruitt">Sarah Pruitt</a></p></div><div class="byline__description"><p>Sarah Pruitt is a writer and editor based in seacoast New Hampshire.

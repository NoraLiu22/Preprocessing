             <h3><a href="/datasets/police-service-areas/">Police Service Areas</a></h3>
             <p>There are currently 65 Police Service Areas (PSA) boundaries in Philadelphia with two to four per District. These boundaries replaced a much smaller boundary, Sectors in 2009. In several Districts, PSA’s split Sector boundaries and therefore a historical comparison would not necessarily be accurate.</p>

<h3>Dear friends,</h3>

<h3>The Board of the Virtaul Guide to Belarus was receiving lately upto 300 unsolicitated
SPAM messages a day from different advertizers due to our e-mail contact address being
exposed in the open on our web pages. </h3>

<h3>At this moment we have switched to showing our contact e-mail as graphical file:</h3>

<h3 align="center"><img src="../images/main/vg_mail.gif" alt="vg_mail.gif (2285 bytes)" width="308" height="34"></h3>

<h3>You will need to manually type in our address into your e-mail address line. This
unpleasant measure is needed to prevent from harvesting our new e-mail address by the
automated e-mail harvesting bots on the Web and stop the SPAM sent to our address. Please
do not store this address in any of your webpages other than the link to this address page</h3>

<h3>Thank you,</h3>

<h3>Board of Editors - the Virtual Guide to Belarus</h3>

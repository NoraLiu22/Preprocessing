2001, terrorists linked to the Islamic extremist group al Qaeda—founded by <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/osama-bin-laden">Osama bin Laden</a>—hijacked four commercial passenger airplanes and carried out suicide attacks against targets in the United States. Two of the planes were flown into the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a> in New York City. Within a few hours, both of the twin towers collapsed into rubble, demolishing a large section of lower Manhattan. A third plane hit the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/pentagon-design-september-11-attacks">Pentagon</a> in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. The passengers and crew of the fourth plane fought back, and the plane was downed in a field near&nbsp;Shanksville, Pennsylvania. </p><p>Almost 3,000 people were killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, including the 19 al Qaeda terrorists. The shocking events of September 11 were televised globally and left much of the world reeling in horror. The administration of President George W. Bush responded by declaring a “war on terrorism,” including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/afghanistan-war">invasion of Afghanistan</a>.</p></div></div><div class="article-content content"><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/21/126/911-timeline_HD_1104x622-16x9.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">9/11 Timeline</div></div><button type="button" class="video-player-decoy__play" aria-label="Play 9/11 Timeline"><span class="video-player-decoy__play-icon"></span></button></div></div><h2 id="world-trade-center">World Trade Center </h2><p>On September 11, 2001, at 8:45 a.m. on a clear Tuesday morning, an American Airlines Boeing 767 loaded with 20,000 gallons of jet fuel crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/new-york-city">New York City</a>. </p><p>The impact left a gaping, burning hole near the 80th floor of the 110-story skyscraper, instantly killing hundreds of people and trapping hundreds more in higher floors. </p><p>As the evacuation of the tower and its twin got underway, television cameras broadcasted live images of what initially appeared to be a freak accident.

The bipartisan “<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/9-11-commission">9/11 Commission</a>,” as it came to be known, was charged with investigating the events that lead up to September 11th.

It named Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind behind 9/11, “the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mohammed led propaganda operations for al Qaeda from 1999-2001. He was captured on March 1, 2003 by the Central Intelligence Agency and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence and interrogated before being imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay detention camp with four other accused terrorists charged with 9/11-related war crimes. The use of torture, including waterboarding, during Khalid Sheikh Mohammed’s interrogation has received international attention.&nbsp;In August 2019, a U.S. military court judge in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba set a trial date for Mohammed&nbsp;and the other four men charged with plotting the 9/11 terrorist attacks to begin in 2021; it was later postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2 id="economic-impact-of-9-11">Economic Impact of 9/11</h2><p>The 9/11 attacks had an immediate negative effect on the U.S. economy. Many <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/wall-street-timeline">Wall Street</a> institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange, were evacuated during the attacks. On the first day of trading after the attacks, the market fell 7.1 percent, or 684 points. New York City’s economy alone lost 143,000 jobs a month and $2.8 billion wages in the first three months. The heaviest losses were in finance and air transportation, which accounted for 60&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of lost jobs. The estimated cost of the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a> damage is $60 billion. The cost to clean the debris at <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/ground-zero">Ground Zero</a> was $750 million.</p><div class="block-story-grid"><div class="card-grid is-style-3-col"><div class="card-grid__container"></div></div></div><h2 id="9-11-victim-compensation-fund">Victim Compensation Fund</h2><p>Thousands of first responders and people working and living in lower Manhattan near Ground Zero were exposed to toxic fumes and particles emanating from the towers as they burned and fell. By 2018, 10,000 people were diagnosed with 9/11-related cancer.</p><p>From 2001 to 2004, over $7 billion dollars in compensation was given to families of the 9/11 victims and the 2,680 people injured in the attacks. Funding was renewed on January 2, 2011, when President Barack Obama signed The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act into law. Named for James Zadroga, a New York City Police officer who died of respiratory disease he contracted after rescuing people from the rubble at Ground Zero, the law continued health monitoring and compensation for 9/11 first responders and survivors.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, funding for the treatment of 9/11-related illness was renewed for five more years at a total of $7.4 billion. The Victim Compensation Fund was set to stop accepting claims in December 2020.</p><p>On July 29, 2019, then-President Trump signed a law authorizing support for the <a href="https://www.vcf.gov/">September 11 Victim Compensation Fund </a>through 2092. Previously, administrators had cut benefits by up to 70 percent as the $7.4 billion fund depleted. Vocal lobbyists for the fund included Jon Stewart, 9/11 first responder John Feal and retired New York Police Department detective and 9/11 responder Luis Alvarez, who died of cancer 18 days after testifying before Congress.</p><h2 id="9-11-anniversary-and-memorial">Anniversary and Memorial</h2><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/49/599/BRAND_THC_HOSF_234225_SFB_000_2398_5_20190903_01_HD.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">The 9/11 Survivor Tree</div></div><button type="button" class="video-player-decoy__play" aria-label="Play The 9/11 Survivor Tree"><span class="video-player-decoy__play-icon"></span></button></div></div><p>On December 18, 2001, Congress approved naming September 11 “Patriot Day” to commemorate the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In 2009, Congress named September 11 a National Day of Service and Remembrance. </p><p>The first memorials to September 11 came in the immediate wake of the attacks, with candlelight vigils and flower tributes at U.S. embassies around the world. In Great Britain, Queen Elizabeth sang the American national anthem during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. Rio de Janeiro put up billboards showing the city’s Christ the Redeemer statue embracing the New York City skyline.</p><p>For the first anniversary of the attacks in New York City in 2002, two bright columns of light were shot up into the sky from where the Twin Towers once stood. The “Tribute in Light” then became an annual installation run by the Municipal Art Society of New York. On clear nights, the beams are visible from over 60 miles away.</p><p>A World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was held to select an appropriate permanent memorial to the victims of 9/11. The winning design by Michael Arad, “Reflecting Absence,” now sits outside the museum in an eight-acre park. It consists of two reflecting pools with waterfalls rushing down where the Twin Towers once rose into the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>The names of all 2,983 victims are engraved on the 152 bronze panels surrounding the pools, arranged by where individuals were on the day of the attacks, so coworkers and people on the same flight are memorialized together. The site was opened to the public on September 11, 2011, to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of 9/11. The <a href="https://www.911memorial.org/">National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum</a> followed, opening on the original World Trade Center site in May 2014. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/one-world-trade-center-officially-opens-in-new-york-city">Freedom Tower</a>, also on the original&nbsp;World Trade Center site, opened in

On the morning of the attacks, he was working on the 27th floor of the North Tower, along with a wheelchair-bound friend, Edward Beyea. Zelmanowitz decided to stay behind to remain by his friend’s side as the rest of the company began to evacuate. Coworkers who evacuated informed professional emergency responders that the two were awaiting assistance inside. FDNY Captain William Francis Burke, Jr. arrived at the scene on the 27th floor as the South Tower began to collapse. Burke, with the same bravery as Zelmanowitz, sacrificed his life to help others by telling his team to evacuate to safety while he stayed behind to try and help Zelmanowitz and Beyea. The three men would only make it as far down as the 21st floor, making phone calls to loved ones before their deaths.</figcaption></figure><figure class="swiper-slide slideshow-gallery__slide"><div class="slideshow-gallery__image-wrapper"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0"><img alt="9/11 Attacks Artifacts from the 9/11 Memorial Museum" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:contain;object-position:center center"/><noscript><img alt="9/11 Attacks Artifacts from the 9/11 Memorial Museum" sizes="(min-width: 636px) 704px, 100vw" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=640&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 640w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=750&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 750w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=828&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 828w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=1080&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1080w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=1248&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1248w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=1920&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1920w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=2048&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=3840&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 3840w" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2011/06/9-11-lost-and-found-the-items-left-behind-5.png?width=3840&amp;amp%3Bheight=400&amp;amp%3Bcrop=2%3A1&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:contain;object-position:center center" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></div><figcaption class="slideshow-gallery__caption">This gold link bracelet belonged to Yvette Nicole Moreno.

Vocal lobbyists for the fund included Jon Stewart, 9/11 first responder John Feal and retired New York Police Department detective and 9/11 responder Luis Alvarez, who died of cancer 18 days after testifying before Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-11-anniversary-and-memorial\"\u003eAnniversary and Memorial\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn December 18, 2001, Congress approved naming September 11 “Patriot Day” to commemorate the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In 2009, Congress named September 11 a National Day of Service and Remembrance. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first memorials to September 11 came in the immediate wake of the attacks, with candlelight vigils and flower tributes at U.S. embassies around the world. In Great Britain, Queen Elizabeth sang the American national anthem during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. Rio de Janeiro put up billboards showing the city’s Christ the Redeemer statue embracing the New York City skyline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first anniversary of the attacks in New York City in 2002, two bright columns of light were shot up into the sky from where the Twin Towers once stood. The  “Tribute in Light” then became an annual installation run by the Municipal Art Society of New York. On clear nights, the beams are visible from over 60 miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was held to select an appropriate permanent memorial to the victims of 9/11. The winning design by Michael Arad, “Reflecting Absence,” now sits outside the museum in an eight-acre park. It consists of two reflecting pools with waterfalls rushing down where the Twin Towers once rose into the sky.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe names of all 2,983 victims are engraved on the 152 bronze panels surrounding the pools, arranged by where individuals were on the day of the attacks, so coworkers and people on the same flight are memorialized together. The site was opened to the public on September 11, 2011, to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of 9/11.

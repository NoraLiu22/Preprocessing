<p>By purchasing a Paid Subscription, you acknowledge and agree to these Paid Subscription Terms, including the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/plain/">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/user-guidelines/plain/">User Guidelines</a>. Capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meaning given to them in the Terms of Use. If you purchase a Paid Subscription directly through Spotify, we will use your payment details and any other information in accordance with our <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/plain/">Privacy Policy</a>. If you purchase a Paid Subscription or begin a Trial (as defined below) through a third party, you will transact directly with that third party, and your purchase and/or Trial will also be subject to that third party's terms and conditions. If you purchase a Paid subscription using a gift card, please see the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/gift-card/plain/">Gift Card Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
<p>These Paid Subscription Terms, the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/plain/">Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/plain/">Privacy Policy</a> along with any other terms referenced in this document should be read carefully. To the extent these Terms conflict with the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, these Terms shall take precedence to the extent of such conflict.</p>
<h1><a id="2-paid-subscriptions" href="#2-paid-subscriptions">2. Paid Subscriptions.</a></h1>
<p>You can find descriptions of each Paid Subscription and their features on our website, and w e will explain which options are available to you when you create a Spotify account. Subject to these Paid Subscription Terms, users who purchase a Paid Subscription may access that Paid Subscription for their own personal use (and for their household members, where applicable) from the moment they submit their payment details successfully to Spotify, or applicable third party, and complete the checkout process.</p>
<p>Paid Subscriptions include, amongst others, subscriptions under the Spotify Premium brand ("<strong>Premium</strong>"), such as Spotify Premium Individual ("<strong>Premium Individual</strong>"), Spotify Premium Student ("<strong>Premium Student</strong>"), Spotify Premium Family ("<strong>Premium Family</strong>"), Spotify Premium Duo ("<strong>Premium Duo</strong>") and any other Premium offerings made available from time-to-time (each a "<strong>Premium Plan</strong>").</p>
<p>From time to time, we may also offer special promotional plans, content or memberships, including offerings of third party products or services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service. We are not responsible for the products or services provided by such third parties.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify the features and content we provide as part of our Paid Subscriptions from time to time and for any reason.</p>
<p>We may terminate or suspend your Paid Subscription, in whole or in part:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A. at any time if we believe you have breached any of these Terms, if we stop providing the Spotify Service or any material component thereof, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>B. upon reasonable notice to you for any other reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After such time, Spotify shall not be obligated to maintain or permit any further access to such Paid Subscription(s).</p>
<h3><a id="21-single-user-paid-subscriptions" href="#21-single-user-paid-subscriptions">2.1. Single-user Paid Subscriptions</a></h3>
<p><strong>"Single-user Paid Subscriptions"</strong>, such as Premium Individual, entitle the paying account holder to access such Paid Subscription for their own personal use.</p>
<h3><a id="22-household-paid-subscriptions" href="#22-household-paid-subscriptions">2.2. Household Paid Subscriptions</a></h3>
<p><strong>"Household Paid Subscriptions"</strong>, such as Premium Duo and Premium Family, entitle the paying account holder of the Paid Subscription (the "<strong>Primary Account Holder</strong>" or sometimes referred to as <strong>"Plan Manager"</strong>), together with a specified number of subsidiary account holders (each a "<strong>Sub-Account Holder</strong>" or sometimes referred to as a <strong>"Plan Member"</strong>) to access such Paid Subscription, for their own and each Sub-Account Holder's personal use. We may, at our discretion, provide features to the Primary Account Holder that are not available to Sub-Account Holder(s).</p>
<p>As part of a family subscription, Spotify may offer a kids experience. By creating subsidiary kids account(s), the Primary Account Holder confirms that they are the legal guardian of any child using such an account. Please read the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/kids-privacy-policy/plain/">Spotify Kids Privacy Policy</a>, which applies to any use of a kids account. The kids account option is only offered as part of a family subscription and any kids account will count as one of the permitted Sub-Account Holders.</p>
<p>If the Primary Account Holder cancels the Household Paid Subscription or the account is otherwise suspended or terminated, the Primary Account Holder and Sub-Account Holder(s) will automatically be downgraded to the Spotify Free plan at the end of the then-current billing period (or as permitted in accordance with clause 2.2.1(C)) and any kids account(s) will be suspended or deleted.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>B. Upon activation of any Household Paid Subscription account (excluding kids account(s)), you will be asked to verify your home address.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>C. Spotify reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to a Household Paid Subscription immediately and at any time if you fail to meet the eligibility criteria here and as otherwise set out in the Terms of Use.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>D. Spotify gift cards and closed loop prepaid cards (i.e. not credit or bank cards) cannot be used as a valid payment method for Household Paid Subscriptions.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>F. We may from time to time ask for re-verification of your home address in order to confirm that you are still meeting the eligibility criteria.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>G. We use Google Maps address search to help you find and set your address. The address you enter upon activation or re-verification will be subject to the Google Maps Additional Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>H. Note; If you are a holder of a Single-user Paid Subscription account, by joining a Household Paid Subscription as a Sub-Account Holder, you acknowledge and agree that no refunds are available for changing from your then-current Paid Subscription before the end of your then-current Paid Subscription period. Upon joining, you will switch immediately to the selected Household Paid Subscription, and your access will remain uninterrupted, but any unused time you've already paid for, including any remaining free or discounted Trial days, under your then-current Paid Subscription will be forfeited.</p>

<h3><a id="23--student-user-paid-subscriptions" href="#23--student-user-paid-subscriptions">2.3 Student-user Paid Subscriptions</a></h3>
<p><strong>"Student-user Paid Subscriptions"</strong>, such as Premium Student, entitle the paying account holder to access such Paid Subscription for their own personal use.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.1 Additional conditions for Student-user Paid Subscriptions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A. Use of Student-user Paid Subscriptions is only open to students at US Title IV accredited higher education institutions who meet the additional qualifications described below ("<strong>Qualifying Student(s)</strong>").</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>B. To activate a Student-user Paid Subscription, you will be required to submit certain information sufficient for us to verify that you are a Qualifying Student. This includes your name, valid educational institution, email address, date of birth and/or other documents ("<strong>Qualifying Information</strong>"), as well as your payment details.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>C. We will use the services of third parties to assist with verifying your Qualifying Information (the "<strong>Student Status Verifier</strong>"). At present, the Student Status Verifier is SheerID, Inc. ("<strong>SheerID</strong>"). The Student Status Verifier will process your Qualifying Information, in accordance with their privacy policy (SheerID's privacy policy can be found here), and confirm your student status to us. Spotify may also receive your Qualifying Information and share such information with the Student Status Verifier. We reserve the right to determine if you are a Qualifying Student based on the information provided by our Student Status Verifier. Spotify will collect, store and process your name, educational institution name, email address and date of birth in accordance with our <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/plain/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>D. If you are a Free or new Spotify user, the Discounted Period (as defined below) will start after you have activated your access to the Student-user Paid Subscription. If you are already subscribed to another Paid Subscription, the first Discounted Month (also as defined below) will start after the expiry of the period of the Paid Subscription that you have already paid for when you complete your verification as a Qualifying Student and the activation process. You may only be subscribed to a Student-user Paid Subscription under one Spotify account.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>E. Spotify gift cards and closed loop prepaid cards cannot be used as a valid payment method for the Student-user Paid Subscription, and no other discounts can be applied, unless otherwise advertised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2.3.2 Duration, Cancellation and Payment of Student-user Paid Subscriptions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A. If the Student-user Paid Subscription is made available at a discount (compared with the then-current monthly price of a Single-user Paid Subscription), Qualifying Students may receive the benefit of that discount each month (each a "<strong>Discounted Month</strong>"), for up to a period of twelve (12) consecutive months ("<strong>Discount Period</strong>") after the subscription is first activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>B. If you cancel your Student-user Paid Subscription at any time during a Discount Period, you may re-activate your subscription during the same Discount Period by purchasing access to the Student-user Paid Subscription again. However, upon reactivation you will only receive the remaining Discounted Months in that Discount Period in line with what you would have received, had you not cancelled your subscription. Your then-current Discount Period will always end twelve (12) consecutive months after you first subscribed and verified your Qualifying Student status for that Discount Period. Discount Periods may not be extended for any reason. For example, if your subscription starts at the beginning of January, you will have activated a Discount Period for twelve (12) consecutive months until the end of December. If you cancel your subscription in March of that year and reactivate it in August, the Discount Period will remain the same and will still expire at the end of December that same year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>C. After the first Discount Period, Qualifying Students are entitled to activate up to a maximum of three (3) additional Discount Periods for their own use, provided they remain eligible and actively re-submit their Qualifying Information for re-verification.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>D . <strong>Qualifying Students who have reached the maximum duration limit for their Student-user Paid Subscription, as described above, or who do not reactivate their student status, will migrate automatically to the applicable Single-user Paid Subscription, as advertised, and will start being charged the then-current full price on a monthly recurring basis, after the current student Discount Period has come to an end</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>E. Qualifying Students who do not want to migrate to a Single-user Paid Subscription at the end of the student Discount Period, must cancel their subscription first and can do so at any time before the Discount Period ends by following the steps outlined in the cancellation section of these Paid Subscription Terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2.3.3</strong> <strong>Partner Services</strong></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A. Spotify may, from time-to-time, make access available to certain third party services to Qualifying Students (each a "<strong>Partner Service</strong>") as part of their subscription to the Student-user Paid Subscription. Spotify may add or remove such Partner Services from the Student-user Paid Subscription at its discretion with or without notice. The availability and use of each Partner Service will be subject to the additional applicable provisions, outlined below, in this section 2.3.3 (each a set of "<strong>Partner Service Terms</strong>").</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>B. To access a Partner Service, Qualifying Students will be required to affirmatively activate their access by following the steps outlined by Spotify in each case, subject to any eligibility restrictions that may exist in relation to each Partner Service and as contained within this section 2.3.3. To activate access, Qualifying Students that are new to a Partner Service must create an account. In the case of certain Partner Services, Qualifying Students using an existing Partner Service account that is eligible (where relevant) may be required to take further steps, such as by switching the billing of that account from being billed by the Partner (as defined below) to a billing method specified by Spotify or by cancelling their existing subscription with the Partner Service and re-attempting the activation process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>C. Some US States and Territories may require that certain Partner Services are taxed in a different way to the Spotify Service. In such cases we will charge you, on a monthly subscription basis, the applicable taxes in respect of your ability to access all Partner Services as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p>a. in the case of new subscribers to the Student-user Paid Subscription, from the moment you complete the process of subscribing to the Student-user Paid Subscription; or</p>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p>b. in the case of legacy student subscribers, from the moment you commence the process of activating any one Partner Service from your Spotify Services account page.</p>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In each case, all applicable taxes will be charged regardless of whether you use any of the Partner Services.</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>D. Whilst a Partner Service is included within the Student-user Paid Subscription, you may only access it for as long as you remain subscribed to, and eligible for, the Student-user Paid Subscription and subject to any restrictions on eligibility for that Partner Service.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>E. Any Partner Services that are added to the Student-user Paid Subscription will be made available on a monthly basis, unless otherwise noted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>F. Unless stated otherwise in relation to a particular Partner Service, Partner Services cannot be accessed via Student-user Paid Subscriptions that are not billed directly by Spotify (e.g. by cable or telecommunications providers).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>G. Only one account for each available Partner Service may be activated and used for each Student-user Paid Subscription.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>H. In the event that eligibility restrictions of certain Partner Services prevent a Qualifying Student from accessing that service through his or her Student-user Paid Subscription, the monthly cost of the Student-user Paid Subscription shall remain unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>I. All billing and cancellation issues with respect to a Partner Service accessed via a Student-user Paid Subscription are between the Qualifying Student and Spotify - not with the third party offering the Partner Service (each a "<strong>Partner</strong>").</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>J. You may delete your account with a Partner Service at any time, upon which you will lose access to that Partner Service. Your Student-user Paid Subscription will be unaffected (provided you continue to be eligible) and you will continue to be charged the advertised price plus applicable taxes - unless you cancel. If Spotify ceases to offer a particular Partner Service, we may notify you using information you provide to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>K. In addition to the permissions you grant us in relation to your personal information under these Student-user Paid Subscription terms, by receiving access to a Partner Service, you also acknowledge and agree in each case that certain Spotify account information will need to be provided to each Partner. The nature of the personal information that we share will vary across Partners and will be specified in each case before you activate your access to that Partner Service. This is for the purpose of activating and administering your access to the relevant Partner Service and enabling the Partner to provide you with its service. Any Spotify account information received by the respective Partner will be subject to that Partner's privacy policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>L. Neither Spotify nor any Partner will be liable to you or any other person in the event of any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the access to any Partner Service. Except where prohibited by applicable law, Spotify reserves the right to amend, modify or waive the Partner Service Terms at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>M. The Partner Services listed below are those that are (or have been) made available within the Student-user Paid Subscription. This selection is subject to change from time-to-time in accordance with the terms in this section 2.3.3. Additional terms specific to your ability to access and use a particular Partner Service, to the extent applicable, are set out below and are incorporated into these Student-user Paid Subscription terms.</p>
</blockquote>

  </blockquote>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C. Your Use of Hulu.</strong></p>
<p>The Hulu Partner Service account linked to your Student-user Paid Subscription and your use of Hulu's services will be subject to Hulu's Terms of Use and Hulu's Privacy Policy.

<p>In order to be eligible for a Trial, users must satisfy all of the following conditions (each an "<strong>Eligible User</strong>"):</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A. Unless you are subscribing to a Trial that is advertised as available to past subscribers, you must be a new subscriber to any and all Paid Subscriptions and not have subscribed to, or accepted a trial of, a Paid Subscription at any time in the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>B. If you are subscribing to a Trial that is advertised as available to past subscribers, you must have been a subscriber to the relevant Paid Subscription (as advertised) and your subscription must have expired before the date or time frame advertised.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>C. In respect of Trials for a Household Paid Subscription and a Student-user Paid Subscription: the additional eligibility requirements set out in sections 2.2 and 2.3 respectively above shall apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>D. Unless otherwise advertised, you must provide Spotify with a valid and current payment method that is approved by Spotify (prepaid cards and Spotify gift cards are not valid forms of payment).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>E. Unless otherwise advertised, you must provide the payment method above directly to Spotify and not through a third party (e.g., not through a cable or telecommunications provider or other distributor).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>F. Additional eligibility requirements (if any) as advertised from time-to-time in connection with a Trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.2 Trial availability.</strong></p>
<p>Spotify will determine your eligibility for a Trial acting reasonably, based on information available to Spotify. A Trial must be accepted before the applicable offer expiration date advertised, if any. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Spotify reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate a Trial at any time and for any reason by notice to you and with no liability, in which case we will not honour subsequent enrollments for that Trial.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Trial duration and cancellation.</strong></p>
<p>In the case of any Trial, the corresponding Trial Period shall continue for the period as advertised, subject to section 4.2, above.</p>
<p>Unless cancelled before the end of the Trial Period, or such Trial is in conjunction with a Prepaid Period, you will automatically become a subscriber to the particular Paid Subscription that you chose to sign up to under the Trial and the payment method you provided will automatically be charged the then-current recurring price on the first day following the end of the Trial on a monthly recurring basis or other interval that we disclose to you in advance (any time-capped features of that Paid Subscription will be reduced by the length of the Trial Period). <strong>IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO PAY THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY A) FOLLOWING THE STEPS DESCRIBED</strong> HERE<strong>IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR B) IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY</strong>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in these Terms or in connection with an offer or Trial, if you cancel a Trial during the Trial Period, you will lose access to the Paid Subscription and your Spotify account will switch automatically to a Spotify Free account at the end of the Trial Period.</p>

Allocated content listening time and top-up purchases (applicable to certain Paid Subscriptions only)</a></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>Some Paid Subscriptions may come with a certain amount of allocated listening time for a certain type of content, for example (but in each case as advertised) audiobooks ("<strong>Allocated Content Listening Time</strong>"). We will publish from time-to-time which, if any, Paid Subscriptions include Allocated Content Listening Time and how much listening time, and if we make any changes to this allocation. Spotify may change the Allocated Content Listening Time, at its discretion, and will notify you in advance of such changes, by any reasonable means. Note: unused Allocated Content Listening Time will be subject to expiry, as advertised.</p>
<p>You may be eligible to purchase additional "<strong>Top-Up</strong>" hours which you can use if your Allocated Content Listening Time runs out prior to expiry. You can always check your Account page to see what's included in your Paid Subscription, and how much Allocated Content Listening Time you have left.</p>
<p>The content available for consumption within a Paid Subscription may vary from time-to-time. As a result, such content may not be the same as the catalogue of similar content available elsewhere on Spotify. For example, in the case of audiobooks, any audiobooks made available for consumption as part of a Paid Subscription may not be the same audiobooks as are made available for direct purchase on Spotify. Please see the FAQ for more details on audiobooks on Spotify.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p>From time to time, Spotify may make certain add-on services available to Paid Subscription users. The add-on services will have their own terms of use which will apply. We will take reasonable steps to bring these terms to your attention. Certain add-on features may have additional eligibility and payment conditions which, if applicable, will be outlined in the relevant add-on features terms of use.</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" nonce="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"_sentryTraceData":"ad9f479258dc40ff9060967153bc96e7-8ed9e02e201e5be2-1","_sentryBaggage":"sentry-environment=production,sentry-release=301933be-71ef-468c-9a41-defa37b9aea8,sentry-public_key=5127fdf9139249acbc0d9f57bc9c1127,sentry-trace_id=ad9f479258dc40ff9060967153bc96e7,sentry-sample_rate=1,sentry-transaction=%2Flegal%2F%5Btype%5D%2F%5Bformat%5D,sentry-sampled=true","locale":"us","document":"\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"#spotify-paid-subscription-terms-and-conditions\" id=\"spotify-paid-subscription-terms-and-conditions\"\u003eSPOTIFY PAID SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS:\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello, and welcome to the terms and conditions for Spotify Paid Subscriptions (\"\u003cstrong\u003ePaid Subscription Terms\u003c/strong\u003e\" or \"\u003cstrong\u003eTerms\u003c/strong\u003e\").

Spotify may change the Allocated Content Listening Time, at its discretion, and will notify you in advance of such changes, by any reasonable means. Note: unused Allocated Content Listening Time will be subject to expiry, as advertised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may be eligible to purchase additional \"\u003cstrong\u003eTop-Up\u003c/strong\u003e\" hours which you can use if your Allocated Content Listening Time runs out prior to expiry. You can always check your Account page to see what's included in your Paid Subscription, and how much Allocated Content Listening Time you have left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe content available for consumption within a Paid Subscription may vary from time-to-time. As a result, such content may not be the same as the catalogue of similar content available elsewhere on Spotify. For example, in the case of audiobooks, any audiobooks made available for consumption as part of a Paid Subscription may not be the same audiobooks as are made available for direct purchase on Spotify.

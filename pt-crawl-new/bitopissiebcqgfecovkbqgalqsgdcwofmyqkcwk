So, and then,</p><p>I mean, each,</p><p>each object as Andrew describes them,</p><p>is more beautiful than the next.</p><p>And you really see for 65 years,</p><p>how Karl just was so creative,</p><p>so visionary, invented so many things,</p><p>and at the same time,</p><p>I think was intrinsically the chicest designer</p><p>that you can ever imagine.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>So with everything going on in so many beautiful moments,</p><p>what are you looking forward to the most tonight?</p><p>Or how do you even pick one thing?</p><p>Well, I,</p><p>always love to see what everybody is wearing</p><p>on the carpet,</p><p>and I had been lucky enough to have a sneak preview</p><p>of what some of our guests are wearing.</p><p>And I&#x27;m just so grateful that they&#x27;ve made such</p><p>an incredible effort.</p><p>And I know,</p><p>I know how thrilled Karl would&#x27;ve been.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>And I just wanna thank you for helping me</p><p>with my dress tonight.</p><p>You look amazing. And I feel so good.</p><p>And thank you so much,</p><p>and I hope you have an incredible evening.</p><p>And have fun yourself.</p><p>Thank you. I will.</p><p>Thank you, see you later.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Thank you Anna, who was here.</p><p>Beautiful, amazing.</p><p>And the evening is gonna continue.</p><p>It&#x27;s gonna be epic.</p><p>[Audience Member] I&#x27;ll take the glasses off.</p><p>[Chloe] Wow, Emma Chamberlain has arrived.</p><p>Emma Chamberlain? Yes.</p><p>Oh, she&#x27;s like the Internet&#x27;s little sister.</p><p>Yes. I love you Emma.</p><p>We love you, Emma.</p><p>She will also be interviewing guests</p><p>on a carpet this evening.</p><p>You can watch those interviews on Vogue&#x27;s YouTube channel</p><p>and hopefully we will be able to check in with her later</p><p>this evening.</p><p>[Crowd Member] We finally get to see!</p><p>This year&#x27;s Met Gala is co-chaired by Michaela Coel,</p><p>Penelope Cruz, Roger Federer, and Dua Lipa.</p><p>And they&#x27;ll be walking the carpet alongside</p><p>more of the most notable figures</p><p>from the worlds of film, music.</p><p>Yes. Sports, politics,</p><p>and of course, fashion.</p><p>We&#x27;ll be interviewing them right here and you can help us.</p><p>Join the conversation by using the #MetGala.</p><p>Share your questions and comments on social media,</p><p>and we will feature our favorites right here on the show.</p><p>We&#x27;ll also be conducting viewer polls</p><p>throughout the evening, so make sure you check those out.</p><p>I am here with Nicole Kidman,</p><p>who also just shut down the Met Gala Carpet.</p><p>As you were coming up, I was just like,</p><p>you look amazing and this dress looks familiar.</p><p>Can you tell us about the dress?</p><p>So this dress was worn</p><p>in the Chanel No. 5 commercial</p><p>that Baz Luhrmann and I did with Karl,</p><p>who concocted this out of his head.</p><p>It&#x27;s gorgeous. I have the sketches</p><p>when he was drawing it.</p><p>Wow. And then we fitted it.</p><p>I remember fitting it repeatedly.</p><p>And I think my deep, deep sort of love of Karl</p><p>came through this time together</p><p>because I knew him very, very well.</p><p>And so to be able to honor him and wear this dress now</p><p>for Chanel and show, I suppose, the way these,</p><p>these couture gowns last.</p><p>Yes. And the exquisiteness.</p><p>Isn&#x27;t that incredible? And if you</p><p>take care of them and love them, they are timeless.</p><p>Absolutely, and I -- To wear the same thing</p><p>20 years later and it still holds.</p><p>That is amazing. Because it&#x27;s so whimsy.</p><p>There&#x27;s whimsy to it. Right.</p><p>And it&#x27;s so light as a feather</p><p>and it&#x27;s unbelievably comfortable,</p><p>but it&#x27;s all handmade.</p><p>It&#x27;s couture, and that&#x27;s what</p><p>it should be. You look absolutely</p><p>gorgeous, Nicole, absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>And I hear so many people tell stories about</p><p>working with Karl and how amazing it was,</p><p>and how kind and how patient,</p><p>what was your experience like working with Karl?</p><p>He&#x27;d make me laugh. He was funny.</p><p>He was so funny, yeah.</p><p>And I also just,</p><p>I think right now to celebrate the history of fashion,</p><p>and the way in which we need the beautiful,</p><p>beautiful work that goes into these clothes.</p><p>Absolutely. To be honored</p><p>and remembered.</p><p>That&#x27;s what I love.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>I think everyone is -- Because it&#x27;s an art form.</p><p>For an incredible evening.</p><p>Yeah, aren&#x27;t we going to have fun?</p><p>Now you get to have fun and you look absolutely stunning.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>And my husband&#x27;s here. Yes.</p><p>Hi, how are you Keith?</p><p>It&#x27;s nice to see you.</p><p>You&#x27;re just staring like a proud, proud husband.</p><p>I love that.</p><p>You guys have an incredible evening.</p><p>Thank you so much. All right, see you.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>All right, bye-bye.</p><p>Bye. Thank you, see you.</p><p>Okay, bye.</p><p>And we have a great group down here.</p><p>None other than the supermodel, Naomi Campbell.</p><p>Hello.</p><p>And the director of the Met,</p><p>the guy in charge tonight, Max Hollein, and his wife.</p><p>How are you?</p><p>Pretty good, thank you.</p><p>Naomi, I don&#x27;t wanna put you on the spot,</p><p>but how many met galas have you been to?</p><p>This is my 16th Met Gala.</p><p>Sweet 16. Wow, a sophomore</p><p>in high school.</p><p>[Derek laughs]</p><p>And Max, have you ever met Karl Lagerfeld?</p><p>I know that&#x27;s who we&#x27;re celebrating tonight.</p><p>Well, I actually met him when I was 12 years old,</p><p>which was of course, a childhood memory.</p><p>He designed together with my father,</p><p>a big theater production in Vienna.</p><p>And my fondest memory is they got pulled off the stage</p><p>because it was so radical.</p><p>And also that kind of gave me an impression of</p><p>that when you do something radical,</p><p>actually appreciation only happens then afterwards.</p><p>So it was a great thing. Why was it</p><p>pulled off the stage? Yeah.</p><p>I mean, Karl&#x27;s designs. Ahead of their time?</p><p>His fashion design was ahead of the time.</p><p>My father&#x27;s architecture for that piece.</p><p>It was at the Vienna Burgtheather,</p><p>the main theater place in Vienna.</p><p>So it&#x27;s been</p><p>an impression to me. That&#x27;s incredible.</p><p>Wow. That&#x27;s a good story.</p><p>Naomi, you must have known Karl, too.</p><p>I met Karl Lagerfeld when I was 16 years old,</p><p>and he put me in every camellia</p><p>that he could have in the span of the studio.</p><p>And I used to go out after Ines de La Fressange,</p><p>who was the Chanel girl at the time.</p><p>And he always, I loved Karl,</p><p>he treated me like, you know,</p><p>what would you, how would you wear it?</p><p>Oh, you like saris this year?</p><p>Okay, let&#x27;s do a Chanel sari.</p><p>He was, he was always very tapped in,</p><p>tapped into each individual person.</p><p>And I think tonight,</p><p>from what I&#x27;ve seen so far,</p><p>everyone looks their individual Chanel-esque self.</p><p>Thank you, that is beautiful.</p><p>Thank you guys so much for being here.</p><p>Thank you. And we will see you</p><p>inside. Thank you.</p><p>Thank you so much. Excited to be here.</p><p>Glad to meet you. Good to meet you, Naomi.</p><p>Thank you for opening it up for us.</p><p>Yes, thank you.</p><p>Great to see you.</p><p>Yeah, thank you.</p><p>Good to see you. Thank you guys.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>So this is a moment.</p><p>Ice Spice is here at the Met Gala.</p><p>This is your first one,</p><p>you hit the carpet, you shut it down.</p><p>Let&#x27;s talk about how it feels to be at your first Met Gala.</p><p>I&#x27;m just so grateful.</p><p>I&#x27;m so happy to be here.</p><p>You know, I was,</p><p>I was like really nervous like, approaching the carpet.</p><p>Right. And once I heard</p><p>everybody screaming, I was like,</p><p>I felt better.</p><p>You was like, oh, I&#x27;m okay.</p><p>I was like, they&#x27;re here.</p><p>Tell us, tell us about your look,</p><p>&#x27;cause you look so good.</p><p>Thank you, this is Balmain.</p><p>Super last minute, but we did it.</p><p>We here, can y&#x27;all see? You did it. You did it.</p><p>You did it. Okay.</p><p>Okay. Everybody see that?</p><p>You look stunning.</p><p>So what are you expecting from your first Met Gala?</p><p>Like what are you looking forward to?</p><p>What are you excited about?</p><p>Some fire pictures, hopefully.</p><p>And the fact that you got the</p><p>camera right there ready to go.</p><p>I&#x27;m obsessed with her.</p><p>Yes, we gonna go in there.</p><p>We&#x27;re gonna have fun.</p><p>We gonna party,</p><p>have good time. Yes, thank you.</p><p>You look like amazing. All right.</p><p>You too, baby, I can&#x27;t wait to see you inside.</p><p>Okay, thank you. All right.</p><p>Ice Spice, everybody.</p><p>[Crew Member] Thank you so much.</p><p>Okay, I&#x27;ll see you inside, okay?</p><p>Okay. All right, baby, okay.</p><p>[orchestral music]</p><p>As everyone knows, this year&#x27;s Met Gala</p><p>celebrates the opening of the Costume Institute&#x27;s</p><p>newest exhibition, Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.</p><p>It looks back at the designer&#x27;s career and process.</p><p>Across seven decades,</p><p>Karl put a stamp on some of Europe&#x27;s</p><p>most celebrated fashion houses.</p><p>Balmain, Patou, Chloe, Fendi, and of course, Chanel.</p><p>Chanel.</p><p>Chanel, channel. [laughs]</p><p>He also launched his own label in 1984,</p><p>and was the first designer to work with H&amp;M,</p><p>which ushered in an entire new age of the designer,</p><p>designer collaboration.</p><p>And that was in 2004.</p><p>Yes, and I had a coveted H&amp;M item.</p><p>You heard it here.</p><p>Karl is probably the most famous designer</p><p>since Coco Chanel herself,</p><p>and has left an indelible mark on the history of fashion.</p><p>Chloe and I checked it out this morning.</p><p>Yes. And I gotta say,</p><p>that exhibit is fascinating.</p><p>Is more than fascinating, it&#x27;s stunning.</p><p>It will make you cry and take your breath away.</p><p>In fact, let&#x27;s take a look inside right now.</p><p>[gentle music]</p><p>Karl would often say he was four people.</p><p>That he was one person at Chanel, one person at Fendi,</p><p>one person at his own label, and one person at Chloe.</p><p>And to an extent, that&#x27;s true.</p><p>I think that Fendi,</p><p>it was more of his modernist tendencies.</p><p>Chloe, he&#x27;s more romantic.</p><p>And at Karl Lagerfeld is more minimalist.</p><p>And I suppose at Chanel,</p><p>more of his historicist and post-modernist sensibilities.</p><p>But I think that what the show,</p><p>I hope shows, is that themes transcended all of those houses</p><p>and he would revisit themes again and again.</p><p>And there&#x27;s one particular silhouette</p><p>that he would return to again and again and again,</p><p>which we call the Schlimmerian silhouette,</p><p>which was a very broad shoulder,</p><p>a nipped in waist and wider hips.</p><p>And I think the areas of the body</p><p>that he was obsessed with were the shoulders.</p><p>And also just at the top of the ribcage,</p><p>he always wanted to make it as narrow as possible,</p><p>which meant a high armhole.</p><p>And I think that was partly to do with youthfulness.</p><p>I think he felt that having this very narrow ribcage</p><p>gave him a sort of sense of youthfulness.</p><p>[crowd chattering]</p><p>Ahead of his time.</p><p>All right, I am joined now</p><p>by one of this evening&#x27;s co-chair.</p><p>The utterly fabulous, gorgeous, I mean, you shut it down.</p><p>Michaela Coel is here with me now.</p><p>I&#x27;m gonna go out there and say,</p><p>this is one of my favorite looks of the night, for sure.</p><p>Thank you. I&#x27;m gonna say you look absolutely stunning.</p><p>I love you, you look stunning.</p><p>Tell us about this look.</p><p>Like, you guys have to see this.</p><p>Tell us about this. I am wearing Schiaparelli.</p><p>And we can see the homages to Karl here.</p><p>Wow. In the chain and the lips,</p><p>and the clutching of the pearls.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>It&#x27;s a collaboration</p><p>between my stylist, Georgia and Daniel.</p><p>I&#x27;m just like a total tourist in this industry.</p><p>I&#x27;m here to serve,</p><p>and I&#x27;m here to honor their creative vision.</p><p>I wanted to have a lot of gold,</p><p>and he created this like, second skin.</p><p>I just love this. There&#x27;s 130,000 crystals.</p><p>130,000 crystals, guys.</p><p>26,000 mixed stones. Oh my.</p><p>And over 3,800 hours of work to make this dress.</p><p>Wow. Yeah.</p><p>That has to be an honor to wear something,</p><p>so this is a work of art.</p><p>This is an absolute work of art.</p><p>Now Michaela, you were on the cover of Vogue last November.</p><p>So now you&#x27;re here at the Met Gala.</p><p>So what was it like preparing for tonight?</p><p>Oh, you know what,</p><p>I felt a strained sense of peace,</p><p>because yesterday I was at the pre-dinner,</p><p>and Anna said something.</p><p>I&#x27;d been wondering, you know,</p><p>like, why was I asked to coach her?</p><p>You know, I couldn&#x27;t help</p><p>but have the question in the back of my mind,</p><p>to be honest.</p><p>And she said,</p><p>what I like about you is that</p><p>you are unafraid to be yourself.</p><p>And Karl, her dear friend, fashion icon,</p><p>she felt his journey was to try and learn</p><p>to be unafraid of being himself.</p><p>Wow. And so she felt like</p><p>he would like that about me.</p><p>And suddenly I just felt very much at ease about being here.</p><p>Absolutely.

It&#x27;s so dirty.</p><p>I&#x27;m like, you know,</p><p>I&#x27;m just doing Chanel walking around bare feet.</p><p>But he was fun.</p><p>He&#x27;s just a, he was a lovely man.</p><p>So I&#x27;m happy to be here to honor him.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>And when was the last time you worked with Karl?</p><p>The last time, it was, I&#x27;m trying to think</p><p>if it was Chanel No. 5.</p><p>There was a Chanel No. 5 party in New York.</p><p>And I think that was, no, no, no, it was in Cuba.</p><p>Okay. We were in Cuba together.</p><p>Beautiful place.</p><p>Beautiful, and he was doing a show,</p><p>and I was doing Chanel No. 5. at the time.</p><p>And he invited me to go and yeah,</p><p>I think that was the last time I saw him in Cuba.</p><p>Absolutely, now tell us about your look.</p><p>Stunning, stunning,</p><p>stunning.

Aluminum foil.</p><p>Transformed into something incredible.</p><p>Both on the gowns and the bags.</p><p>The trash of the Met, like the actual garbage?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Dumpster diving. Inside the Met, outside.</p><p>Wow. Near the food carts.</p><p>You know, some people say</p><p>one man&#x27;s trash is another man&#x27;s treasure.</p><p>Yeah. Yes.</p><p>Or hand. One man&#x27;s trash</p><p>is another woman&#x27;s Met Gala look.</p><p>This is a first. You actually,</p><p>these are like,</p><p>ticket stubs and the maps from the Met.</p><p>So this, this,</p><p>this year we wanted to do something completely different</p><p>and it was about creating something beautiful,</p><p>creating gowns from waste.</p><p>It&#x27;s incredible. And I see a lot of</p><p>monochromatic.</p><p>I assume that&#x27;s a nod to Mr. Lagerfeld.</p><p>Indeed, yes.</p><p>Yes. Yeah.</p><p>That&#x27;s, that&#x27;s our biggest nod.</p><p>I mean,</p><p>of course, the innovation that he explored in materials</p><p>inspired our approach, but this was the most obvious nod.</p><p>Amazing. Well, thank you guys so much.</p><p>We can&#x27;t wait to see you inside.</p><p>See you inside at the bar.</p><p>Maybe? I think so, yes.</p><p>Drinks?</p><p>You already know.</p><p>Drinks, a little</p><p>Britney singing. Gabriela, everybody.</p><p>Have a great night guys.</p><p>Thank you guys.

We&#x27;re great.</p><p>We&#x27;re great.</p><p>Now how are you feeling?</p><p>Are you one stomach flu away from your goal weight?</p><p>To be honest, wish I was</p><p>because. [Michael laughs]</p><p>I was telling Michael last night I ate a pizza,</p><p>almost forget &#x27;cause I thought, well,</p><p>I&#x27;m like covered up so I&#x27;ll be all right.</p><p>And then I tried to put my skinny pants on and it was.</p><p>[all laughing]</p><p>I wish I was.</p><p>Tell us about this look. Yeah.</p><p>I assume Michael</p><p>is the -- It&#x27;s like a</p><p>pretty skinny pant to me. The man responsible</p><p>for this.</p><p>Well, I think it was all about dichotomy tonight.</p><p>I think Karl loved romantic,</p><p>but he also loved something a little edgy and nasty.</p><p>That&#x27;s me, right?</p><p>Isn&#x27;t that Emily Blunt?</p><p>That says it all, right.</p><p>Romantic and nasty. She&#x27;s romantic and nasty.</p><p>No, and I,</p><p>I just love the idea of throwing it off with the overskirt</p><p>with the really narrow, skinny cigarette trousers.</p><p>And then of course, it&#x27;s the night for flowers.</p><p>Yes. I mean.</p><p>I mean, absolutely.</p><p>And white shirts.</p><p>I know.</p><p>And white shirts.</p><p>And a play on the white shirt,</p><p>his signature white shirt. And the play.</p><p>But like a romantic version of it.</p><p>Right. Nasty and romantic.</p><p>Nasty. Nasty and romantic.</p><p>Michael, I&#x27;m sure you knew Karl Lagerfeld.</p><p>I did, indeed.</p><p>Your paths must have crashed.</p><p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>You know, it&#x27;s whenever I have a day</p><p>where I think to myself,</p><p>I have too much to do today.</p><p>I&#x27;m too busy.</p><p>What do I have to do next?</p><p>I always kind of remember Karl,</p><p>who was just this machine of creativity, energy, humor,</p><p>all of it together and, and stayed curious.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>You know, curiosity is the coolest thing in the world.</p><p>Definitely. Definitely.</p><p>Do you have a favorite memory of Karl?</p><p>Oh my God, yes.</p><p>Once he actually said to me, he said, you&#x27;re always so tan.</p><p>Why are you always so tan?</p><p>And I said --</p><p>Look at us next to each other.</p><p>Look at us next to each other,</p><p>oh my God. Just like a ghost.</p><p>No.</p><p>Well, he&#x27;d said, why are you always so tan?</p><p>I said, well, the minute I have a day off,</p><p>I run to the sun.</p><p>Do you?</p><p>I always do, and he looked at me and he said,</p><p>obviously I don&#x27;t.</p><p>Oh. So I was like,</p><p>okay, I got that.</p><p>But I mean, he had, he said, you&#x27;re always tan.</p><p>He had such a great, great wit and,</p><p>and really and such charm.</p><p>And he was just singular.</p><p>He was very like you, Michael Kors,</p><p>always wore sunglasses.</p><p>Shades.</p><p>A lot of black and white. A lot of black and white.</p><p>Boots. Good one liners.</p><p>Boots. Yeah.</p><p>Good quips. Zingy quips.</p><p>Yes. Derek, you&#x27;re getting it.</p><p>Chloe and I saw the exhibit this morning,</p><p>and you guys are gonna love it.</p><p>Can&#x27;t wait. So thank you so much</p><p>for popping in.</p><p>We can&#x27;t wait.</p><p>We can&#x27;t wait. Great to see you guys.</p><p>Great to see you.</p><p>Now I want a pizza.</p><p>I know a good place.

Drawing me with the dress.</p><p>And that was like a, you know, like,</p><p>a really specific dream come true.</p><p>I don&#x27;t have pictures of that moment,</p><p>but it&#x27;s like recorded here in my soul forever</p><p>because he is such a genius.</p><p>The amount of hard work that I respect him for that,</p><p>you know, obviously he was like a genius mind.</p><p>But also very, very generous and very hard, hard worker.</p><p>And everybody that knew him, loved him.</p><p>Loved him, loved him.</p><p>He treated everyone really, really kindly, and.</p><p>I&#x27;m so glad tonight is all about him.</p><p>Everyone is honored</p><p>to be here. It&#x27;s all about him.</p><p>So before I let you go, tell me about your look tonight,</p><p>&#x27;cause you just shut down the whole carpet.</p><p>I saw you from up here.</p><p>I was like, wow, wow, wow.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>So this is Chanel Couture, 1988.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Spring, summer.</p><p>And when they told me,</p><p>we&#x27;re gonna redo one from the patrimony, like,</p><p>whichever one you look,</p><p>whichever one you choose.</p><p>And that was not</p><p>easy to choose. No, of course not.</p><p>It was like one month going back and forth,</p><p>studying every single collection</p><p>that he ever did for Chanel.</p><p>But I really fell</p><p>in love with this. Well, you made</p><p>a perfect choice and you look gorgeous.</p><p>Thank you, you too. Thank you so much</p><p>for talking and I hope you have an incredible evening.</p><p>Thank you.

Yeah, no one.</p><p>Okay, now Gwendoline,</p><p>you are such a student and fan of fashion.</p><p>So what do you think of when you think of Karl?</p><p>Karl Lagerfeld was and is rightfully an icon.</p><p>He was a renaissance man.</p><p>He had such an interest, not only in the craft of design,</p><p>which was his career, but indeed of,</p><p>of all elements of artistry, literature, art, history.</p><p>He was such an intellectual.</p><p>He was interested in literature,</p><p>he was interested in philosophy.</p><p>And he took the rigor of discipline that he applied</p><p>to his craft into all areas.</p><p>Absolutely Of intellectual</p><p>and emotional acumen.</p><p>And I just think he was an astounding designer.</p><p>And that&#x27;s why he has endured for so long.</p><p>Yes. And I feel</p><p>very, very lucky to be here tonight</p><p>celebrating him. Absolutely.</p><p>And that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re all honoring him tonight</p><p>at such an iconic place.</p><p>What a great moment.</p><p>So tell us about your look.</p><p>You look gorgeous.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to be wearing Fendi couture.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Designed by the incredible Kim Jones.</p><p>I love Kim Jones. I love Kim Jones.</p><p>And Kim and I have been friends since I was 19 years old.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>So it is an enduring friendship.</p><p>But again,</p><p>what I love about Kim is that he&#x27;s so dedicated</p><p>to his craft.</p><p>He definitely is. He&#x27;s always spontaneous</p><p>and shows such innovation in what he does,</p><p>but he&#x27;s also working endlessly on developing</p><p>an exquisite technique and discipline.</p><p>Absolutely. Alongside the</p><p>flamboyant nature of his imagination.</p><p>And he&#x27;s great. Absolutely.</p><p>And a lol.</p><p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>Well, thank you so much,</p><p>and I hope you have an incredible evening</p><p>and I enjoyed our talk so much.</p><p>I loved it so much, darling.</p><p>I&#x27;ll see you inside.</p><p>Enjoy the night.</p><p>All right, bye Gwendoline.

All right, thank you.</p><p>[soft music]</p><p>We have the honor and pleasure</p><p>of being joined now by Tommy and Dee Hilfiger.</p><p>You guys look incredible.</p><p>Thank you. Tommy, I love this look.</p><p>Can I be so bold as to observe</p><p>that this is inspired by Karl Lagerfeld?</p><p>Inspired by Karl.</p><p>This is vintage. Tell us about it.</p><p>Chanel fabric.</p><p>But the shirt was given to me by Karl as a gift.</p><p>Karl himself? Yes.</p><p>The man. The legend. A gift.</p><p>And I&#x27;m not sure how he was able to get dressed,</p><p>in an outfit like this every day,</p><p>but certainly had a valet,</p><p>because it&#x27;s a shirt that just buttons in the back.</p><p>Really? With a separate collar.</p><p>Was this the first time Dee helped zip you up tonight?</p><p>I did not, I did not help him get into it.</p><p>I would&#x27;ve no idea what to do about it.</p><p>We had a whole team that helped us get put together tonight.</p><p>It took a small village.</p><p>We had my Tommy Hilfiger team take inspiration</p><p>from Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld</p><p>in developing Dee&#x27;s gown.</p><p>Did the gloves.</p><p>And her look. Did the rounds.</p><p>I love the curls.</p><p>This was added. Beautiful.</p><p>You know, you have to do something a little different</p><p>for the Met Gala. Yes, yes.</p><p>Tommy, I&#x27;m sure you crossed paths</p><p>with Karl a couple times.</p><p>Do you have any favorite Lagerfeld memories?</p><p>I do.</p><p>I asked Karl once how he became so successful with Chanel</p><p>and he said it was very easy.</p><p>He went back to her archive and took everything</p><p>that was from her favorite collections,</p><p>and made them relevant for today.</p><p>And that, that was very inspirational.</p><p>But we became partners with him</p><p>when we bought the Karl Lagerfeld brand in 2004.</p><p>So we became very close.</p><p>Chloe and I went</p><p>and had a look at the exhibition today,</p><p>and it&#x27;s pretty incredible.</p><p>We haven&#x27;t seen it yet.</p><p>Oh.

[laughs]</p><p>And, but I do have to say I work with an amazing team.</p><p>My stylist, Erin Walsh,</p><p>she always puts everything together.</p><p>So it&#x27;s really her that does the collaboration.</p><p>I&#x27;m just a lucky girl.</p><p>I&#x27;m seeing a lot of Karl homages here.</p><p>There&#x27;s the tweed. Yes.</p><p>I see a camellia like on</p><p>my lapel. Yes.</p><p>But also a little nod to Versace in the safety pins.</p><p>And I, yeah, absolutely.</p><p>And I have to give a shout out to my hairstylist,</p><p>Orlando Peta.</p><p>He brought a camellia from a Versace show in the nineties.</p><p>[Derek] Can we get that?</p><p>So.</p><p>This is the first time we&#x27;ve seen a vintage piece,</p><p>hairpiece.</p><p>Vintage hairpiece. All right,</p><p>I&#x27;m the first one. We&#x27;ve seen some</p><p>vintage Chanel pieces,</p><p>but not a lot of vintage hair pieces.</p><p>Yeah. Leave it to Anne Hathaway.</p><p>Well, Orlando Peta, definitely.</p><p>The two of you together. That casual icon.</p><p>Yeah, yes.</p><p>But yeah, I think it&#x27;s kind of this,</p><p>it was meant to be sort of a marriage</p><p>between Versace and Chanel.</p><p>Rings, I&#x27;m noticing.</p><p>Yeah, these little things, there&#x27;s just a couple of them.</p><p>Little things.</p><p>They&#x27;re my wonderful, wonderful friends and family</p><p>at Bulgari.</p><p>I&#x27;m very grateful.

All right,</p><p>I gotta be honest.</p><p>It&#x27;s very hard not to laugh next to Chloe.</p><p>Well, I&#x27;m gonna copy you. It&#x27;s easier not to laugh</p><p>next to Derek.</p><p>But,</p><p>but there&#x27;s just something about this dress that makes you</p><p>kinda wanna hit it.</p><p>And look. You just kinda</p><p>wanna hit it.</p><p>Get a little Rosalia going on in your head</p><p>and just live in the fantasy.</p><p>How, did I do it right?</p><p>[Anne laughing] Yeah, yeah.</p><p>Let me see.</p><p>Heck, yeah.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Just like come on.

You look gorgeous.</p><p>I was like, wow. Thank you.</p><p>Okay, first, let&#x27;s talk about this look,</p><p>&#x27;cause this, this, this, this is it.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>You look gorgeous. It&#x27;s Gautier,</p><p>half of it is archive from 2008.</p><p>Wow. And the rest is custom.</p><p>But it was an ode</p><p>to my favorite Haute Couture Chanel &#x27;93.</p><p>Wow. And you pulled this off fabulously.</p><p>Thank you. You look so incredible.</p><p>Now, people are so excited.</p><p>You&#x27;re playing Tinkerbell.</p><p>Yes. In the new</p><p>Peter Pan and Wendy movie.</p><p>So tell me,</p><p>how do you approach such a well-known character</p><p>and then make it your own?</p><p>Well, I think that&#x27;s even the task of the Met, right?</p><p>You get a theme and you try and make it your own.</p><p>Quite honestly,</p><p>I think it was trying to figure out what this movie asked</p><p>of Tinkerbell, first and foremost,</p><p>which was already really fun,</p><p>but a lot of fun references.</p><p>Last year I was here as an ode Josephine Baker.</p><p>And funny enough,</p><p>in this movie I watched a lot of her performances.</p><p>Oh wow. To look at how</p><p>people like her are using their facial expressions</p><p>to communicate so much.</p><p>When you say so little.</p><p>That&#x27;s incredible, and everyone is</p><p>looking forward to that.</p><p>Thank you. So what are you</p><p>looking forward to here tonight honoring</p><p>such a icon and a legend like Karl?</p><p>What are you looking forward to the most tonight?</p><p>Well, the Chanel House and Karl</p><p>were the first fashion house</p><p>to really bring me in at 16, I believe.</p><p>Wow. 16 years old.</p><p>The first shows I ever went to,</p><p>my first experiences.</p><p>And I think my general appreciation for fashion</p><p>comes from that experience,</p><p>and it comes from how welcoming they are</p><p>and being able to see fashion as art.</p><p>And so I think that really kicked off my entire journey.</p><p>So it&#x27;s beautiful to be able to be here.</p><p>Absolutely. Well, I hope you have</p><p>an incredible evening. Thank you,</p><p>I&#x27;ll see you inside. Go have some fun,</p><p>see you inside,</p><p>you look gorgeous. Thank you.</p><p>All right, for sure.

In the couture.</p><p>And it just shows he was so,</p><p>he was so sweet.</p><p>[Derek] And he was always made it work,</p><p>that Lagerfeld.</p><p>You know, he really did.</p><p>And he was so good to me.</p><p>So that was a fun story that I always think about.</p><p>Chloe and I checked out the exhibit this morning,</p><p>and I can&#x27;t wait for you guys to see it.</p><p>I&#x27;m sure you,</p><p>you&#x27;re in some of the pictures.</p><p>Yes, you are.</p><p>I know, I know, I&#x27;m so excited.</p><p>Can&#x27;t wait for you guys to see it</p><p>and have the most magical night.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>Thanks for stopping by, guys.</p><p>Thank you.

At his last show,</p><p>we became friends.</p><p>I started, I became a songwriter,</p><p>and he came to all my concerts.</p><p>Wow.

And so we remained friends</p><p>for about 30 years.</p><p>And Karla,</p><p>how does it feel to just see everyone honoring him tonight?</p><p>You personally knowing him and having such a relationship?</p><p>I know that has to be an incredible feeling.</p><p>It feels moving.</p><p>Almost overwhelming.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>And I can feel his soul around us here.</p><p>And you know, Karl didn&#x27;t really believe in death.</p><p>He would always say death doesn&#x27;t exist.</p><p>Wow. He&#x27;d just go,</p><p>the person just goes in another room,</p><p>and he could come, person can come back any minute.</p><p>So that&#x27;s how I feel tonight.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Well, thank you so much</p><p>for stopping by.

Cara Karl.</p><p>Cara Karl.</p><p>No, people just call me Karla by the end, you know.</p><p>[Chloe] Karla, that&#x27;s what I would</p><p>do too. Karla.</p><p>One of my favorite Cara Delevingne moments</p><p>in the world of Chanel was the supermarket show.</p><p>Yeah, my favorite.</p><p>That was so much fun. Do you remember Rihanna</p><p>was push pushing you around in a shopping cart?</p><p>I was pushing her around.</p><p>Oh, excuse me. Don&#x27;t worry about it.</p><p>Thank you for fact checking me.</p><p>Oh no, she was.</p><p>I think she was pushing the internet</p><p>will know it. We, no, we were both in it.</p><p>Joan was pushing us around. Joan Smalls was</p><p>pushing you around. There you go.</p><p>And I&#x27;m sure the internet will correct.</p><p>all of us. I stole some.</p><p>Can I say that?</p><p>I stole so much from that supermarket.</p><p>They had like a, a Chanel chainsaw.</p><p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t steal things. You have to have it.</p><p>Well, that&#x27;s my favorite</p><p>supermarket experience. Ice cold.</p><p>Do you have a favorite Chanel memory?</p><p>There was so many.</p><p>I think doing a show in Edinburgh.</p><p>We went to Japan, we went all around the world.</p><p>But honestly, his like, looking into the future,</p><p>he really like, did so many things.</p><p>We did this amazing Women&#x27;s March,</p><p>and I think also this one of, you know,</p><p>one of his last shows that we did.</p><p>And it was like at the ski chalet,</p><p>and like all the girls,</p><p>we were all crying and holding hands,</p><p>and it just felt like such a moment.</p><p>But he is one of those people that no matter where he is,</p><p>he&#x27;s always there.</p><p>You may see him on the carpet tonight.</p><p>I hope so.</p><p>Little bit of you as well.

Of course.</p><p>[Erykah] Thank you, Vogue.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take another look</p><p>at the making of this year&#x27;s exhibition.</p><p>[gentle music]</p><p>The candlestick dress is from Karl&#x27;s own label</p><p>from Autumn Winter 1985.</p><p>And it falls within a line called the Satirical Line.</p><p>And it looks at how Karl would</p><p>transfer his wit and irony and humor into clothes</p><p>through almost surrealistic embroideries.</p><p>This particular one was inspired by a candlestick.</p><p>It was almost as if when you placed the candlestick</p><p>on the body, it became a sort of substitute of the woman.</p><p>So when she walks and animated the candlestick,</p><p>it almost looked like an animated cartoon.</p><p>A bit like Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast.</p><p>[orchestral music]</p><p>All right, so I&#x27;m here with my sis.</p><p>My family has arrived.</p><p>Teyana Taylor is here on the carpet.</p><p>Hey, girl. I mean, sexy fire.</p><p>Swagged out.</p><p>I don&#x27;t even know</p><p>what else to say. Thank you.</p><p>Tell me about this amazing look by Thom Browne.</p><p>Yes, I&#x27;m in Thom Browne</p><p>from head to Toe inspired by Karl Lagerfeld.</p><p>You know his classic look, the tie.</p><p>Absolutely. The little ponytail</p><p>in the back.</p><p>Get into that.</p><p>Get in, you know, the Chanel tweed.</p><p>Get in. Get in.</p><p>The classic Karl Shade.</p><p>[Both] Get in.</p><p>[both laughing]</p><p>I&#x27;m just suited and booted, yeah.</p><p>Head to toe.</p><p>The body is bodying and doing everything else.</p><p>Thank you. So Teyana,</p><p>you have been to tons of red carpets.</p><p>You&#x27;ve been to so many events.</p><p>What does a red carpet like the Met Gala mean to you?</p><p>Especially honoring Karl Lagerfeld?</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>I know it feels big when I got a potty.</p><p>And it was just like I did so good</p><p>the whole 35 minutes. I was watching you.</p><p>I was watching you.</p><p>As soon as I got my ass on that carpet,</p><p>my bladder said, hey girl.</p><p>I said. Not now.</p><p>Not now, not now.</p><p>So, yeah, but I mean,</p><p>that means it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s good though.</p><p>I always, always got a potty when I&#x27;m nervous.</p><p>So me, I was a little bit nervous.</p><p>And I wanna talk about your performance</p><p>in A Thousand and One.</p><p>Thank you. Like.</p><p>I watched it so many times,</p><p>I watched it on the plane.</p><p>I watched it in theater.</p><p>I watched it over and over and over.</p><p>Tell me what you did to embody that character</p><p>the way you did.</p><p>It was, it was showstopping for sure.</p><p>Thank you so much, sis.</p><p>Honestly, it was a lot of layering,</p><p>and a lot of color coordinating</p><p>of the layering, you know? I heard them talking</p><p>about that. Inez, yes.</p><p>She has a lot of layers with her.</p><p>So we had to color coordinate it, and it was like.</p><p>a good shorthand for being on set.</p><p>Cause you know how it go,</p><p>we film outta order.</p><p>Of course. So one day, you know,</p><p>she&#x27;s getting in that taxi,</p><p>the next day, she getting married, you know.</p><p>So I think color coordinating and layering Inez was,</p><p>you know, made the process really amazing,</p><p>and it was really therapeutic.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>I think there&#x27;s some big awards</p><p>in your future for that. Thank you.</p><p>For sure.</p><p>Thank you so much for coming by.</p><p>We&#x27;re gonna party tonight.</p><p>We&#x27;re gonna have fun.

So.</p><p>We need to check that that&#x27;s ready to go.</p><p>For the show,</p><p>since many of the objects are loans from outside,</p><p>we unpack them and do a very thorough examination of them</p><p>to make sure that they&#x27;re safe to exhibit.</p><p>I think that should work pretty well.</p><p>[orchestral music]</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Your face is like glowing.

Oh yes.</p><p>And he had a little nickname for Mr. Derek.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>I mean,</p><p>I loved Karl Lagerfeld for all the reasons we heard tonight.</p><p>He could do 10 jobs at once.</p><p>But the puns, this guy was a pun wizard.</p><p>I&#x27;m a pun fan.</p><p>He used to call me -- A pizard.</p><p>I had to. He called me Beau Derek.</p><p>Ooh. But like, not</p><p>Bo Derek with the braids in the swimsuit.</p><p>Beau Derek, the French word for Beau, Derek.</p><p>Beau, which means, and I pronounce that buh.</p><p>Buh.</p><p>Beau Derek. If nothing else,</p><p>we&#x27;ve learned tonight that Chloe Fineman&#x27;s French is.</p><p>Is terrible at French.</p><p>Chloe. Perfect.</p><p>Chlo-ay. Chlo-ay.</p><p>But speaking of you impersonating people that you&#x27;re not,</p><p>did you find any new impersonations this evening?</p><p>Anyone that you&#x27;d like to do?</p><p>You know, I do.</p><p>When I was talking to Anne Hathaway, I was like, that&#x27;s</p><p>gonna go to my. Do you wanna tease</p><p>a little Annie or no?</p><p>Well, I mean, I just, in the way she,</p><p>just the posing.</p><p>Right. You know,</p><p>fashion&#x27;s kind of cool,</p><p>&#x27;cause you get to see a new side</p><p>of how to do an impression,</p><p>which is like how they are on the carpet.</p><p>That was sort of my in on Nicole Kidman was the way,</p><p>you know, she poses.</p><p>I gotta be honest. Yes.</p><p>There have been some people</p><p>who&#x27;ve come into the fashion swirl.</p><p>Ooh, the swirl.</p><p>Which I&#x27;ve worked in for over two decades,</p><p>longer than I&#x27;d like to admit sometimes.</p><p>And they sometimes describe coming to fashion events</p><p>as an SNL skit.</p><p>There&#x27;s so much drama over the hat and the hair.</p><p>I mean, little, little secret we&#x27;re gonna share.</p><p>We had Cardi B in here, but she was worried.</p><p>Yes. That if she</p><p>did the video first,</p><p>it would rob her or would cannibalize.</p><p>Right. Her red carpet debut.</p><p>The reveal.</p><p>And she didn&#x27;t wanna, she didn&#x27;t wanna ruin</p><p>her reveal. Right.</p><p>She needed the drama, ok-err.</p><p>I&#x27;m not allowed to do that kind.</p><p>Not the impression we&#x27;re gonna learn tonight.</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>But the drama, the looks. The drama.</p><p>The trains,</p><p>there&#x27;s always like eight people.</p><p>I want, that&#x27;s my new job that I want.</p><p>Is which part?</p><p>To just to like be,</p><p>I wanted to do that to Kara, but I,</p><p>I didn&#x27;t wanna be bad.</p><p>Right. Right.</p><p>You didn&#x27;t wanna pick her train.</p><p>I was gonna try and pick her train and kind of like --</p><p>You&#x27;d like to be a fluffer?</p><p>A fashion fluffer. She&#x27;s Megan Thee Stallion,</p><p>and I&#x27;m. Oh, right.</p><p>Yeah. Oh!</p><p>Oh, I know.</p><p>A missed opportunity.</p><p>Hindsight is 2020.</p><p>Gosh, is it ever?</p><p>One thing I loved about tonight was reliving</p><p>all these incredible Karl memories.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I&#x27;ve worked in fashion long enough</p><p>to really respect his craft.</p><p>He&#x27;s a legend. Yes.</p><p>And I&#x27;m very excited about the exhibit.</p><p>Yes, Karl Lagerfeld: A Line Of Beauty</p><p>is open to the public May 5th to July 16th.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take yet another peak inside the exhibition.</p><p>Paper was Karl&#x27;s favorite material.</p><p>This white garment was from</p><p>Chanel&#x27;s Haute Couture 2009 collection,</p><p>which was an ode to paper.</p><p>And you see the papery quality</p><p>in the sort of Christmas of the shoulders.</p><p>The Christmas of the a-line skirt,</p><p>and the inverted V in the pleat.</p><p>And it&#x27;s entirely embroidered with</p><p>tiny piettes and seed beads.</p><p>That took 700 hours to embroider by Lesage.</p><p>And the garment itself, it&#x27;s a dress and a bolero.</p><p>And it took about 340 hours.</p><p>So in total, it was over a thousand hours to complete it.</p><p>Real tour de force of the haute couture,</p><p>and shows the incredible skilled craftsmanship</p><p>of the petites mains workshops.</p><p>What do we say? I don&#x27;t know.</p><p>[Derek] Yep, it&#x27;s.</p><p>[orchestral music]</p><p>Karl began at Fendi in 1965.</p><p>And this particular coach from Fendi is inspired by</p><p>Sonia Delaunay&#x27;s simultaneous paintings,</p><p>which was all about color and geometric shapes</p><p>and rhythmic patterns.</p><p>And it&#x27;s a remarkable achievement.</p><p>Each square, each circle, each rectangle</p><p>has been pieced and laid into the garment,</p><p>and it&#x27;s lined with silk that mirrors</p><p>the same pattern as a fur.</p><p>So it sort of has this ambiguity</p><p>between the inside and the outside.</p><p>[orchestral music]</p><p>So Chloe Fineman?</p><p>Yes, Derek, Beau Derek Blasberg?</p><p>How are you hanging in there?</p><p>Well, I&#x27;ll be honest.</p><p>I&#x27;m in my flip flops.</p><p>Can we, can we pan down and show.</p><p>I&#x27;m in my Ritz-Carlton slippers.</p><p>Can we show where Chloe is this evening?</p><p>This is her vibe.</p><p>She&#x27;s officially transitioned to slippers.</p><p>You know, it&#x27;s still chic.</p><p>I&#x27;m in my corset. The heels.</p><p>I was losing circulation, but, you know.</p><p>There&#x27;s just so much glamour.</p><p>Chloe had to, had to take a little break.</p><p>Hey, I think La La, can you hear us?</p><p>Are you there?</p><p>She can&#x27;t hear us. No.</p><p>Well, we are waiting for our biggest star of the night.</p><p>Yes, we are.</p><p>Who do you think it is?</p><p>I think I know who it is.</p><p>I think you know who it is.</p><p>Okay, it rhymes with just kidding.</p><p>[both laughing]</p><p>She. She.</p><p>They. They.</p><p>He?</p><p>Oh.</p><p>[both whooshing]</p><p>Did she?</p><p>He.</p><p>Or she. She.</p><p>Or they. They.</p><p>Have made us wait before.</p><p>Yes.

We&#x27;ll just see how it goes.</p><p>Maybe we&#x27;ll have other clues as the night goes on.</p><p>I&#x27;ll say. Chloe, quick question.</p><p>Yes.

And she was having</p><p>such an incredible night.</p><p>And there was another cat jumping around</p><p>down there. Jared Leto.</p><p>[Derek] Jared Leto was a cat.</p><p>Lil Nas X. Yes.</p><p>Was a cat. Was a cat, yeah.</p><p>So cat cats. Cats, cats.</p><p>[La La] Look you, you&#x27;re right on theme.</p><p>You&#x27;re right on theme. Raining cats, yeah.</p><p>Exactly. I actually didn&#x27;t</p><p>think cats would,</p><p>could become a bigger deal. I didn&#x27;t either.</p><p>[Derek] Like they already have their place</p><p>in the meme-of-sphere. I know, I know.</p><p>On the internet. Choupette.</p><p>On Instagram. Choupette was honored</p><p>just as much as Karl in a way.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>We have, we have some comments on Twitter.</p><p>Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s going on. So @ritazagoo says,</p><p>my first time watching the Met live.</p><p>And everyone is so on theme, I love it.</p><p>I can&#x27;t wait to see more of the fits.</p><p>Wow. @monetalex_ says,</p><p>the girls are doing really well with the theme this year.</p><p>This has to be some sort of record.</p><p>Wow. @cupidlilly says</p><p>this year&#x27;s Met Gala is honestly my favorite theme.</p><p>And I love it so much.</p><p>I love it so much.</p><p>It&#x27;s so nice when they&#x27;re nice on the internet.</p><p>I know. I was like --</p><p>Honey.</p><p>Every time Twitter, it&#x27;s like, ooh.</p><p>Ahh.</p><p>Exactly. This a little love fest.</p><p>So thank you.</p><p>Thank you for all the love and I mean,</p><p>we&#x27;re almost there.</p><p>Do we feel some commotion?</p><p>Do we feel something</p><p>happening? Hear anything?</p><p>Do we hear anything? What do we think&#x27;s going on?</p><p>Do we feel something happening?</p><p>Do we hear anything happening?</p><p>Who could it be? I can feel it.</p><p>Who could it be?</p><p>Derek&#x27;s like I know who it is.</p><p>I know who it is. Any favorite Karl quotes?</p><p>Ooh.</p><p>That&#x27;s a good question.</p><p>I have some good Karl one liners.</p><p>I mean, I love that guy.</p><p>If you&#x27;re cheap, nothing helps.</p><p>Ooh, okay.</p><p>That&#x27;s a bar.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. That&#x27;s a bar for sure.</p><p>My favorite, which I tell myself every day,</p><p>&#x27;cause this is what I wear</p><p>all the time. Is it about sweatpants?</p><p>It is.</p><p>Sweatpants are a sign of defeat.</p><p>You took mine. You lost</p><p>control of your life.</p><p>And so you bought some sweatpants.</p><p>You took mine, you took mine.</p><p>What&#x27;s so surreal about this evening is that Karl himself</p><p>was not a fan of nostalgia.</p><p>Right. He was relentlessly</p><p>forward looking.</p><p>He was obsessed with technology.</p><p>I remember when the iPads and the iPods</p><p>and the I-Everything came out.</p><p>He had 10 of every of them.</p><p>A dozen iPod touches.</p><p>And so it&#x27;s sort of surreal tonight to spend so much time</p><p>thinking about him nostalgically, in retrospective.</p><p>Yeah. I definitely think</p><p>if he was here tonight,</p><p>knowing he was being honored at the Met Gala</p><p>with an exhibition at the Costume Institute,</p><p>he&#x27;d have a couple of one liners to deliver himself.</p><p>[La La] Absolutely.</p><p>So let me ask you a question.</p><p>Did you get any material tonight?</p><p>I did. I know you</p><p>got some tricks up your sleeve</p><p>after this one. I did.</p><p>A new cast of characters to start working on.</p><p>[La La] So good, can&#x27;t wait to see.</p><p>So great.</p><p>Well, I heard something,</p><p>I heard some clapping or some,</p><p>some yelling or something going on.</p><p>[Chloe] Wow, I love this Kendall look</p><p>that we&#x27;re looking at right now.</p><p>[La La] Yeah, oh, it&#x27;s so, it&#x27;s so great.</p><p>[Chloe] And the hair was really on point.</p><p>I have to say tonight.</p><p>[Derek] Orlando Pita gave Anne Hathaway</p><p>a beehive bumpette</p><p>A lot of ribbons and bows we saw in everyone&#x27;s hair.</p><p>So good. So good.</p><p>I think -- Karl Lagerfeld of course,</p><p>was most famous for a powdered white ponytail.</p><p>I think Cardi B had a little tribute</p><p>of her. Yes.</p><p>She did, yes. Gray.</p><p>Do.</p><p>And Cara.</p><p>And Cara.</p><p>Definitely. J. Lo.</p><p>Oh, how was J.Lo?</p><p>Yes. La La, you interviewed J.Lo.</p><p>What was she like?</p><p>She&#x27;s awesome.</p><p>She was like,</p><p>at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the hat,</p><p>but then I looked at it and I loved it.</p><p>I&#x27;m like,</p><p>the hat was absolutely perfect.</p><p>The hat was perfect.</p><p>Here she goes, right here.</p><p>She looked incredible. Wow.</p><p>[La La] Absolutely incredible.</p><p>[Chloe] Not to comment on a woman&#x27;s body,</p><p>but oh my God.</p><p>[La La] Absolutely incredible.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Unbelievable. The hat was cool.</p><p>So many amazing looks tonight.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take a look at Janelle Monae as well,</p><p>who you guys saw.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t get to see her.</p><p>We didn&#x27;t see her, either. We saw her come in,</p><p>and she had a pretty elaborate</p><p>monochromatic, I mean, a couture tent.</p><p>Yes. Can we call it that?</p><p>Oh wow. I would say.</p><p>[Derek] What are some of the verbiage?</p><p>[Chloe] Couture tent.</p><p>Oh, what was that word today at the costume exhibit?</p><p>[speaking in foreign language]</p><p>That&#x27;s the one. Yeah.</p><p>[Derek] That&#x27;s the one.</p><p>[La La] Mary J. Blige.</p><p>[Derek] Who&#x27;s this in</p><p>the purple lace, La La? Mary J. Blige.</p><p>Oh. Wow, the queen.</p><p>[La La] Shutting it down like always.</p><p>[Chloe] I love how florals</p><p>make their way into so many of the looks tonight.</p><p>Absolutely. La La, did I see you</p><p>talking to Diddy today?</p><p>[La La] Yes, and it was good.</p><p>It was a good moment.</p><p>We had some fun, but, all right,</p><p>so we are going to just take a chill pill real quick</p><p>and keep waiting.</p><p>All right.</p><p>[orchestral music]</p><p>All right, so we tried and we tried.</p><p>Sometimes things don&#x27;t work out the way we expected,</p><p>but you can catch everything on vogue.com.</p><p>You don&#x27;t wanna miss anything.</p><p>I promise you.</p><p>There are some magical moments and you never know.</p><p>You never know what you&#x27;re gonna see.</p><p>So make sure you tune in and the night isn&#x27;t over.</p><p>But the show is.</p><p>I just wanna thank everyone so much for joining us live</p><p>on the carpet at the 2023 Met Gala.</p><p>If you missed anything,</p><p>like I said, I said it once.</p><p>I&#x27;m gonna say it again.</p><p>Visit vogue.com to watch the show again.</p><p>Now, I don&#x27;t know about you two,</p><p>but who I could really use some champagne.</p><p>Champagne.</p><p>Yes, you read my mind. I think you mean</p><p>cham-pleasure, Chloe.</p><p>[both laughing]</p><p>Ta-ta.</p><p>That type of night.</p><p>It&#x27;s that type of night.</p><p>Good night, everybody.</p><p>Thank you.

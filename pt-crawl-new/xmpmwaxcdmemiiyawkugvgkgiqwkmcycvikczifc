  	   <h2>Sun Fade</h2>
  		<p><strong>SUN OUTAGES BEGIN AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND RUN THROUGH MID OCTOBER</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Sun outages begin as early as October 1 in Key West and run as late as October 16 in Juneau AK.
        As an affiliate it is necessary to prepare for this outage in advance. Sun fade WILL cause a temporary loss of satellite reception on your XDS receivers.
Please remember, if you are delaying the feed on XDS for playback later the segment will not have audio missing in the middle of it but instead will be shortened by the length of the sun fade interruption or the time it took to transition to streaming.
All Premiere XDS receivers are configured by default to fail over to a streaming source with 20 seconds of RF loss. This is true for both live shows assigned to ports and shows being recorded for later playback (Delilah, AME, etc.).
If you currently have the unit(s) connected to an IP on your studio or office LAN/WAN, we suggest each XDS unit be tested at safe time (no recording or live feeds occurring) by pulling the RF input and confirming the test channel audio (1khz tone) returns with 15-30 seconds. When RF is returned and determined stable the XDS will return to the RF input as its source for all ports.
<br />
<br />
You can get specific times and dates for your location by going to the link below and utilizing the Sun Transit Event Prediction tool.
<br />

<br />
<br />
Please share this info with your programming and engineering departments so that they may plan ahead.
<br />
<br />
Premiere recommends ALL unused ports be set to <b>NONE</b> and locked in order to avoid streaming un-needed audio or duplicated audio. This may slow down the audio packet delivery due to locally overloading the receiving station's bandwidth.

Thank you

	<h2>Limits to The Length of Time Recorded Programs can Remain on the XDSPRO4-P Receivers:</h2>
    <p>The Premiere XDS PRO4-P receiver can record live programs and delay the playback as scheduled by you, the affiliate.
        However, the recorded programs will remain in the XDS receiver for a limited amount of time.
        The files will be deleted to insure the receiver has ample storage for future recordings.
        These are global settings for all stations.
        If you need to delay a program longer than than allowed, you may wish to use an external recording device</p>

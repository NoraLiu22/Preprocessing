Classical Music</u></b></font></p>
<p><b>Belarus was always on the cross-roads of different armies. The turmoil of
wars disrupted many time normal development of Belarusian culture. It is as hard
to trace a single timeline of Belarusian history as it is to write the history
of Belarusian culture. Nevertheless we will attempt to collect here the history
of Belarusian classical music and its main figures. This is a living page you

<ul>
  <li>opera Faust by Radzivill</li>
  <li>&quot;Polacak Notebook&quot; and &quot;Courants&quot; - XVII century
    monuments of domestic musical culture of the Baroque epoch, collections of
    vocal and instrumental pieces of music.</li>
  <li>Vilna Notebook - collection of pieces for a chamber orchestra,</li>
  <li>&nbsp;the ballet Polonaise by Aginski</li>
  <li>Stanislau Maniushka - this Polish composer created his most outstanding
    works while residing in Belarus. It is here that his individual artistic
    style and unique manner of composition were developed. Stanislau Maniushka
    lived in Minsk (today's Belarus capital) for many years. It is here he
    created in cooperation with Belarusian poet Vincent Dunin-Macinkevich an
    opera &quot;Syalianka&quot; (&quot;Peasant woman&quot;). He had also worked
    in Vil'na (today Vilnius). Maniushka composed majority of his chamber and
    vocal pieces while in Belarus. The <a href="http://sb.by/minsktimes/9.pdf">2004
    Mir castle Music festival</a> was devoted to 185th anniversary of Stanislau
    Maniushka.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#0080C0" size="4" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">XVIII century:</font></p>
<p>Y. Golland, E. Van-zhura, M. Radzivil, R. Vardotsky (opera &quot;Apollo the
Legislator, or Reformed Parnassus&quot;). </p>
<p><font color="#0080C0" size="4" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">XIX- Early XX
century:</font></p>
<p>From the beginning of the 19th century in large cities (Vitebsk, Grodno,
Minsk, Mogilev) city orchestras acted, plays were staged
(&quot;Recruitment&quot; and &quot;Peasant Woman&quot; by S. Moniuszko to
libretto of V. Dunin-Martsinkevich). Composers A. Abramovich, M. Yelsky, F.
Miladovsky, N. Orda, etc. were creating at that time.</p>
<p><font color="#0080C0" size="4" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Soviet Belarus:</font></p>
<p>Some historical accounts from heavily biased toward Soviet propaganda <a href="http://belembassy.org/uk/music.html">official
Belarusian sources</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;V. Zolotaryov, pupil of N. Rimski-Korsakov, who headed the composers'
education at the conservatoire. Among his students were outstanding composers:
A. Bogatyryov, P. Podkovyrov, L. Abeliovich, D. Lukas, V. Olovnikov.</p>
<p>The pre-war years witnessed active creative activity of N. Aladov, Y.
Tikotsky, N. Churkin, G. Pukst. Operas &quot;Mikhas Podgorny&quot; by Y.
Tikotsky, &quot;In Polesye Virgin Forest&quot; by A. Bogatyryov, ballet
&quot;Nightingale&quot; by M. Kroshner became bright events of cultural life.</p>
<p>During the Great Patriotic War the Belarusian people went through heaviest
ordeals possible. Fight against the fascist occupation became the main subject
of musical art. Creation of cantata &quot;To Belarusian Partisans&quot; (text by
Y. Kupala) by A. Bogatyryov, opera &quot;Alesya&quot; about national avengers by
Y. Tikotsky (libretto by P. Brovka) became prominent.</p>
<p>In the post-war period the pedagogical activity of A. Bogatyryov as a tutor
of the majority of Belarusian composers of subsequent generations became
extremely relevant. They are Y. Glebov who is intensively working in all musical
genres, but has gained special recognition in the genre of ballet: &quot;Alpine
Ballad&quot;, &quot;The Elect&quot;, &quot;Tyhl Uhlenspiegel&quot;, &quot;Little
Prince&quot;; A. Mdivani who addresses in his works to historical subjects
[ballet &quot;Passions&quot; (&quot;Rogneda&quot;)]; V. Soltan who created a
remarkable opera &quot;Wild Hunting of King Stakh&quot;. Its staging received a
broad public resonance.</p>
<p>In the genre of songs V. Olovnikov, Y. Semenyako, I. Kuznetsov, I. Luchenok,
Y. Glebov, V. Budnik, E. Zaritsky and many others are working successfully. In
1980s-1990s works of spiritual music appeared (L. Shleg, V. Kopytsko, A.
Bondarenko).</p>
<p>A significant cultural event of the latest years was awarding in Paris of the
Benois de la Dance Prize to V. Yelizariev, Art Director of the National Academic
Theatre of Ballet for the best choreography in the world-wide ballet art of
1996. The Prize was awarded for staging of the &quot;Passions&quot; ballet of
the Belarusian composer A. Mdivani dedicated to the topic of national history.
This ballet was also marked by the State Prize of the Republic of Belarus.
Distinctive events of ballet and opera art were premieres of ballets
&quot;Spring Sacred&quot; and &quot;Firebird&quot; by I. Stravinsky,
&quot;Circular Motion&quot; by O. Zaletnev, operas &quot;Visit of a Lady&quot;
by S. Kortes, &quot;Prince Igor&quot; by A. Borodin, etc. Increase of creative
activity, strengthening of material-technical base, level of performers was
promoted by transformation of the State Academic Bolshoi Theatre of Opera and
Ballet into the Creative Association &quot;The National Academic Bolshoi Theatre
of Opera and Ballet of the Republic of Belarus&quot;.</p>
<p>Premieres of works of various genres created by Belarusian composers took
place: concerto for piano and symphonic orchestra, &quot;Divertissement&quot;
for chamber orchestra by D. Smolsky, Symphony No. 4. by G. Vagner, concerto for
trombone and symphonic orchestra by G. Gorelova, the first symphony by O.
Khodosko, etc. State Prizes were awarded to programs of the &quot;Khoroshki&quot;
Belarusian State Choreographic Ensemble and the State Orchestra of Symphonic and
Variety Music.&quot;</p>

    <i>Honestly I am estranged by the age census in this competition. It
    excludes participation of most of the World famous soloists. Well, what else

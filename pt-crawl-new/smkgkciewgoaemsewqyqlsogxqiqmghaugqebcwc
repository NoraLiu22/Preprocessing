The Finnish rave scene has been blooming since the late 1980s -- actually
everything started in September 1988 when the now-legendary Berlin club in 
Helsinki held its first acid house nights. Subsequently, DJ Njassa had 
the first underground
rave party at Helsinki's Lepakko in November 1988 (with DJs
Jokke and Eliot Ness). The Hyperdelic Housers posse 
of the Turku town also organised their first illegal
techno parties in 1989, the same year the Metal Bass Organisation (of 
the DJs Mr. Kirk and H2) had the first proper rave in Finland at the 
Helsinki

<H2>Finnish disco years</H2>
<p>
In the beginning, though, there was disco. The annals of Finnish disco
mark as its beginning the year 1966, when the first discotheque in 
Finland, simply called Discoteca (and later shortened to Disco), was 
launched at Kalastajatorppa of Helsinki by promoter Paavo 
Einiö together with Tom Hertell, though the 
actual heyday of disco was had in the late 70s when blockbuster films 
such as <i>Saturday 
Night Fever</i> kicked off the dancefloor mania also in these Northern 
latitudes. 
<p>
The DJ culture has undergone many changes since the 
original disco days. Whereas today's "star" DJs mostly remain just 
silent and technical masters of record beatmatching, the yesteryear 
DJs were often hyper-talkative and flamboyant "masters of ceremony", 
not only spinning records but also introducing them to audiences and 
raising their spirits the best they could; sometimes also wearing 
outlandish costumes to add to the rockstar-like appearance. <p>
Hailing 
from this era, there are now over 30 members in the Finnish DJ Hall 
of Fame, 
including such disc-spinning veterans as Tapani "Beaver" Ripatti, 
Markku "DJ Edward" Vesala, Jyrki "Jyräys" Hämäläinen (alongside winning 
the 
first domestic disc jockey contest in 1967 also a Finnish 
pop magazine legend, who sadly passed in 2008), Pekka "Takku" 
Kotilainen (1946-2011), Kari "Nite" Niiranen, Pentti "Poppamies" Kemppainen, 
Esko "Eemu" Riihelä, and Johnny-Kai "Johnny" Forssell; many of these 
familiar names also in Finnish music media and radio. Also Greek 
expatriate Nicolas "Black Mike" Mavromichalis, Kari "Nite" 
Niiranen, Joke "Stadin Säkki" Linnamaa, Heikki "Lisko" Linko and Tapio 
"Madman" Korjus were prominent in the inner circle of old school DJs.
<p>
<i>Diskosusi</i> ("Disco Wolf") was a magazine (or maybe "fanzine" would be a 
more appropriate description for this pocket-size amateur publication) 
that was published in Tampere from 1979 to 1982, as its sole purpose 
to unite Finnish DJs, disco music fans and clubbers of the day. In its 
heyday <i>Diskosusi</i> was distributed in Finnish discos and clubs, at its 
best reaching an edition of 10.000 copies. 
<p>
The primus motor behind 
<i>Discosusi</i> was Pentti "DJ Pena" Teräväinen (b. 1956), one of the 
veterans of Finnish disco culture and an organiser of the union of DJs 
who started his record-spinning career in 1972. Diskosusi did its 
share in contributing to local DJ/disco culture with charts, 
background histories of artists, DJ interviews and naturally record 
reviews. The magazine covered all popular styles of disco and dance 
music, but also some artists performing 50s style of rock'n'roll and 
rockabilly revival, extremely popular in the late 70s Finland, would 
find their way to the pages of <i>Diskosusi</i>.
<p>
One of the <i>Discosusi</i> interviewees was Tapani "DJ Beaver" Ripatti 
(b. 1950), who had became a small celebrity in the late 70s by being 
a regular face in TV's popular "jukebox jury" show called <i>Levyraati</i>, 
and through his own radio shows -- such as Ocsid (read that backwards) 
-- in the 80s and 90s gained a legendary position in Finland playing 
Hi-NRG disco and Italo, and later on even moving to rave techno. 
<p>
<p>
Also finding his musical origins in disco, DJ Jokke (a.k.a. Jouni Helminen, d. 2017) started his DJ career in 1979. 
In 1988 he became a resident DJ in club Berlin, taking place at Helsinki's Botta, which was arguably the first venue to 
promote the acid house sound in Finland. DJ Jokke also worked at Helsinki's Street Beat store which became one of the 
main providers of imported techno and house records in the town. During the 1990s DJ Jokke's mixes for Dance Mob radio 
show on national channel Radiomafia channel were widely listened.
<p>
<H2>Early recording artists</H2>
<p>
Finnish music scene has paralleled the international developments in 
club music and its 1970s-1990s development from disco via synthpop and 
hip-hop electro to techno, house and their various subgenres. Early 
Finnish disco in the late 1970s and early 1980s often consisted of
international hits of the day translated into Finnish versions, but
original domestic disco material was written by such people as Jokke Seppälä 
and 
Steel City (whose vocalist Kaija Koo launched a successful solo 
career later on). 
<p>
Jimi 
Sumén, Organ and Stressi were rare examples of Finnish synthpop or electronic
new wave of the early 1980s. <i>The Art of Breeding</i> compilation of 1983
featured 'I'm Young Beatiful and Natural' by General Njassa and His Lost 
Division, often considered the very first Finnish hip-hop electro track. 
The same year was also released the electronic funk/hip-hop track 
'WhatUGonnaDo' by Kojo and Billy Carson. 'Grandmaster Klaus' by Tommi Lindell's
Lindelltronics in 1988 pioneered sampling techniques in Finland. 
<p>
Mika Vainio (1963-2017), later on 
known as &Oslash, collaborated with Pertti Grönholm as Corporate 09, 
whose industrial techno album <i>Mindprobe</i> came out in 1991. Early Finnish techno 
pioneers such as Mono Junk (a.k.a. Kimmo "Kim" Rapatti), Mixmaster K 
(a.k.a. DJ Kaippa a.k.a. Kari Kaivola) and 
JS16 (a.k.a. Jaakko Salovaara) were heard
on the 1993 various artists collection <i>From the Edge of Nowhere: Finnish 
Underground-Sound Compilation</i>. 
<p>
<H2>Raves in Finland, 1990s onwards</H2>
<p>
The Finnish party scene really concentrates on the largest cities in the 
South of Finland: Helsinki, Turku and Tampere. Naturally there are many 
smaller scenes around the country, with the biggest parties still happening 
in Helsinki. (Actually, after writing this, some people have complained to me 
that I haven't included here the scenes in their own home towns outside
this "Great Triangle", like for example Lahti or Vaasa, but maybe I'll get to 
feature them some time in the future...)
<p>
The Finnish raves of the 1990s heyday usually varied from 100 to 1,500 
people; with 2000 we would 
already have been talking about a really massive happening; but as an 
average, 200 - 500 attending would have been quite normal. The most 
important crews organising
the raves from the late 1980s and early 1990s onwards were the 
Hyperdelic Housers of Turku and Metal Bass of Rauma, Eliot
Ness's various organisations like Vision and Planet of Love,  
Entropy, Hytky and House Collective of Helsinki, Pumpkinhead Promotions
and PETY of Tampere (neither in existence any more), and Niitty of
Jyv&auml;skyl&auml;; not to 
mention many smaller 'posses' around Finland (see <a
href="/finncontacts/organisations/">here</a>).
<p>
<img src="/pic/djs2.jpg" alt="Some  
Tampere  DJs  in  1995" align=right>
<p>
The "grand old man" of the Finnish rave scene during the 1990s was DJ 
Eliot Ness, who organized and promoted countless parties, also importing several
international name DJs to the country. Other important DJs 
of the era were Jori Hulkkonen,
Sasse, Marko Laine, Ender, Jokke, Borzin, 
Orkidea and Angel; not to 
mention such veterans as DJ Kaippa, whose dance act 3rd Nation reached 1994 the British charts 
with their 'I Believe'. (You can find a list on some Finnish DJs
and the styles they are playing 
<a href="/finncontacts/djs/">here</a>.)
<p>
The most popular styles of the Finnish raves in their heyday were monotrax, 
trance and acid, house (including garage, deep, NY house, etc.), and 
of course, techno. Ambient also gained a strong foothold in Finland - in 
1994 Radio City in Helsinki played continuously, all night and day, 
<a href="http://nic.funet.fi/~joha/ambient-city-mp-1.html">ambient music for 
the whole two weeks</a>, which must have been an unique happening on the 
whole world scale -- although one rarely hears ambient music at the parties. 
Also Finnish 
jungle scene seems to be reality as of now, with such DJs as 
<a href="/pyssy/okkeriku.html">Infekto</a>,
Mekaanikko
and Adder bringing the sounds of drum 'n' bass to unsuspecting clubbers and 
ravers. Naturally the purist technoids existed there, also the more 
"enlightened" people into the underground Detroit and minimalist sounds
&agrave; la Jeff Mills and Underground Resistance. Also Goa trance 
genre seems to have been pretty active in Finland, with such dedicated 
DJs as Yogi 
and Halo spinning records amidst the banners of ultraviolet-coated Indian
gods and goddesses. <i>Suomisaundi</i> ("Finnish sound") was the genre
name for Finnish psytrance artists such as Texas Faggott and Squaremeat. 
<i>Metsäbile</i> ("forest party") scene took this
music into the Finnish woods, where the neohippie type of party people
grooved under the strobe lights and open sky.
<p>
Trance in general seems to have been
the most popular style of electronic dance music at clubs, as it has been
all over the world, with house steadily following in its wake. Also hip
hop scene has been steadily growing in Finland since the 1980s, and
lately such Finnish rap acts as Fintelligens, Seremoniamestari, Petri
Nyg&aring;rd, Nuera and Paleface have reached enormous popularity, hip hop
being a far bigger subculture in Finland than house or techno. 
[<a
href="http://www.the-fam.com/">The FAM</a>, a Finnish hip hop site.]
<p>
Finland
had its activist counterpart to Reclaim The
Streets, when the Street Party events were held in the biggest towns of
Finland in between 1997 and 2000, just in the middle of the main streets,
opposing car traffic and pollution.
<p>
Though many said there was not a heavy drug scene attached to the 
Finnish rave circles, the most consumed drugs among the party people 
have been cannabis, LSD, ecstasy
(a.k.a. MDMA; Finnish nicknames "nipsu", "esso"), amphetamines
and cocaine -- alcohol not included, the absence of
which would be a curiosity
in the traditionally heavy-drinking Finnish culture. Still, compared to their 
continental European counterparts, the Finnish ravers must have been relatively 
'clean', even though local tabloids tried to start rave-related drug scares 
every now and then. 
<p>
From the mid-1990s on, there were reports of increasing drug use in 
the raves, but it was really hard to say how the situation actually is, as
the 1995 membership of European Union and the opening of the borders of 
ex-Soviet Union countries had their effect on narcotics trafficking and
use in any case. The latest newcomers of party drugs have been GHB (in
Finland simply called "gamma") and GBL ("lakka" in Finnish
vernacular), which had already created their share of
tabloid horror stories in Finnish press. By the early millennium there 
had been only one
reported ecstasy and techno party related death in Finland, when an
18-year old girl died in Tampere, August 2000 (and that was reportedly in
connection with other medication),
but fake Mitsubishi (a 
popular form of MDMA) pills had been also found in Finland.
<p>

<p>
<H2>1990s Finnish rave and techno scene vs. Mainstream</H2>
<p>
It can be argued the local rave culture never really surfaced
from the underground, despite the fact that the largest parties
received
their fair share of publicity in the local media, and a following amongst
those hip hordes of the Finnish trend-hoppers. So one could well ask if the
whole thing was only much ado about nothing -- even despite all those
recent
claims in international press hailing "Finnish sub-arctic underground" led
by
such as S&auml;hk&ouml; Recordings, Pan sonic and Jimi Tenor -- was 
there actually any real Finnish 
techno scene in the 1990s?
<p>
There must have been good reasons not to paint too rosy a picture. The Finnish 
airwaves and the chart programmes of local TV were still dominated by 
your average Pearl Jams, Ace of Bases and 2 Unlimiteds, as it must have 
been everywhere 
over the MTV-gazing civilized Western world. As for the recording techno and 
dance acts, it was very easy to count them with the fingers on both hands, as 
the 1990s Finnish tastes were still orientated to the traditional melancholic soft 
pop music, or to the always so popular rock 'n'roll sounds, the biggest 
import act of the moment being the Leningrad Cowboys, who were -- somehow 
mercifully -- being taken as <i>actual</i> Russians outside these Northern 
shores. (For more information on Finnish rock and pop scene, see the extensive 
<a href="http://www.sjoki.uta.fi/~latvis/rockdata.html">Finnish Rockdata</a> 
pages maintained by Jarmo Latva-&Auml;ij&ouml;</a>.) On the other hand,
Finnish classic and avantgarde music was traditionally held in very high
regard because of such composers as Einojuhani Rautavaara,
<a href="http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/saariaho.html">Kaija
Saariaho</a> and Magnus Lindberg, or orchestra conductors like Esa-Pekka
Salonen (not to mention here such classic giants as Jean Sibelius). 
<p>
The foreign chart acts, like the Prodigy being occasionally at the Top One in
<a
href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fi.html">Finland</a>
didn't really count -- as Finns reached the third millennium, punk rock was
still
considered something radical in Finnish music scene. For
example, the
internationally acclaimed S&auml;hk&ouml; label must have only remained in minority,
as no one actually knew them in Finland, their records' distribution almost
literally from hand to hand, at the same time as the word of their minimal
electronic outcrop spread rapidly in the international DJ and techno circles. 
If there was a "scene", it was not too visible in any case, many people said.
<p>
Finnish rock and
pop media were usually not too interested in local underground electronic
sounds, unless any of those acts gains international popularity, or there
was a diluted pop chart version -- something not too difficult to
understand for an average
trend-spotting music journalist worth his/her salt. Before 
now-defunct <i>Basso</i> 
magazine
(which got its origins as hip-hop publication <i>Posse</i> in 2001) 
there was a long period of
time when there was not in existence any
Finnish special magazine dedicated to dance music, though for example 
the rock tabloid <a
href="http://www.rumba.fi/"><i>Rumba</i></a> used to have its
bi-weekly column on dance music.
<p>
One brave effort for a techno music magazine was had, though, in 1994,
when three issues of a
magazine
called <i>ex</i> were published in Helsinki, but financing the publication
proved too difficult in the end, and <i>ex</i> vanished quite soon. The 
same year saw also the publication of <i>Tekno - digitaalisen 
tanssimusiikin historia, filosofia ja tulevaisuus</i> ("Techno - the 
history, philosophy and future of digital dance music"), 
an ambitiously-titled book 
edited by 
Sam
Inkinen which -- though patchy at times and occasional over-enthusiasism
taking over more critical content --
was for a long time the only one of its kind
written in Finnish. <i>DJ-kirja</i> ("DJ Book") was a collection of 
interviews from Finnish DJ veterans, published as a crowdfunded book in 
the late 2013.
<p>
Jori Kuusinen (a.k.a. George Spruce, now of Moodmusic Records fame) in
Turku
published a in the 1990s little
underground house fanzine <i>Speakeasy</i> with his friend Jussi Uusitalo
(DJ Newhouse) along with clubs of the same name and Kuusinen's own
record store Groovy Beat. Only one issue of <i>Speakeasy</i> was released,
along with a catalogue of Groovy Beat's new records. Groovy Beat was
also the first Finnish store to export Sähkö Recordings releases to German
distributors. Neither Groovy Beat Records nor <i>Speakeasy</i> exist any
more as Jori Kuusinen moved to Germany in late 1999.
<p>
There was also a weekly dance music show <i>Nousu</i>
at
Helsinki's Moon TV cable channel which
could be seen in all larger towns
in Finland until Moon TV went bankrupt in summer 2003. <i>Nousu</i>
featured live reports, artists and DJ interviews and music videos.
<p>
Hannu Puttonen directed his groundbreaking techno music documentary 
<i>Bring The Beat Back</i> in 1992, with interviews both from Finland 
and UK. Jimi Tenor's 
<i>Sähkö The 
Movie</i> (1995) is a now rarely-seen documentary on the early days 
of Finland's perhaps most important techno label. Tero Vuorinen's 
documentary film <i>Machine 
Soul</i> 
(2015) has interviews of many Finnish techno scene's prime 
movers. 
<p>
Gladly
Finnish underground scene found a place for itself from the 
ever-expanding Internet and World Wide Web, but the mailing lists inexistence easily turned to battlegrounds of endless and pointless flame
wars between adolescent ravers, arrogant "scene people", navel-gazing
purists and so on, and judging by the
standards of professional journalism, even the
best Web sites usually suffered from the lack of continuity and maintenance
and all too sporadic updates (including the humble and
amateurish efforts of this site), or emphasized flashy Web design and
latest technology at the
expense of actual content.
<p>
Joe Martin wrote in the March 1997 issue of American dance music magazine 
<i>XLR8R</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
So if all us basement illuminati are finally pledging allegiance to the Finnish
minimal nation. why is everyone involved so convinced that it doesn't 
exist? Even [Kim] Rapatti [a.k.a. Mono Junk of Dum Records], who
freely admits his connection with the mono traxx image, denies the
existence of an underlying scene. Jouni Alkio, who with his Aural
Expansion ambient releases on SSR is one of the artists responsible
for expanding the popular image of Finnish electronic music from 
repetitive pH-challenged bonks, assures the world that "there is no
gang of 'intelligent techno' freaks here who break showroom windows to
steal pocket calculators." <a
href="http://xlr8r.com/sections/archives/25/25FEAT.finland.html">[The
whole article]</a> </blockquote>
<p>
So it was better in any case not to exaggerate the volume of techno music scene 
in Finland, even though during the last few years some interesting new names
and labels -- such as Function Recordings, Pulssi, Rikos, and so on
-- popped up from the local soil. It reflected more the strength of 
international
techno scene, spreading rapidly and knowing no borders, than the fact 
that
Finnish climate (in all its bleakness) would have been especially benevolent for
electronic music. 
<p>
Not that experimental electronics would not have some 
traditions even in Finland. 
<p>
Already in the 1960's such Finnish pioneers as 
Erkki Kurenniemi (1941-2017) were creating music with their self-made instruments (more 
info <a href="/early/">here</a>), like 
S&auml;hk&ouml;kvartetti ("Electric Quartet") and Kurenniemi's DIM series 
synthesizers. These must have been more an interesting curiosity, though; 
reflecting the fact that Finnish people have always been watching closely 
international trends, such as the development of electronic music in the 
post-World War II decades. And maybe just because of the fact that people
in a
small and distant country like Finland -- in order to maintain their own 
cultural livelihood -- learn to follow closely what's happening everywhere 
else. Still, and this can't be repeated too often, Finnish "techno
underground" remained as one of the tiniest subcultures there was.
<p>
<H2>
Some tips from the Finnish scene - rhythm veterans and flashy newcomers
</H2>
<p>
* First of all, read histories on
<a href="/sahko/history.html">S&auml;hk&ouml; 
Recordings</a> for info on the already legendary Finnish label, 
and <a href="/panasonic/history.html">Pan 
sonic</a>,
about their most popular act; and also on <a 
href="/tenor/history.html">Jimi Tenor</a>,
who 
became famous for his easy listening/Hammond records for S&auml;hk&ouml;'s 
sublabel <a href="/sahko/puu.html">Puu</a>, but 
who has already made a long career here in Finland.
<p>
Luckily the Finnish electronic music scene was not limited only to the 
S&auml;hk&ouml; avantgarde minimalisms. There was an active industrial 
and 
synthpop music scene, in connection with the ever so lively (if that's
the
right word) local goth-rock scene (for more info, see <a 
href="http://www.sci.fi/~cyberwar/">Cyberware Productions</a> and 
<a href="http://www.prospective.nu/">Prospective
magazine</a>)
in Finland, influenced by Kraftwerk (and who in their real senses 
<i>wouldn't</i> be influenced by them?), Front242, Skinny Puppy, Depeche 
Mode, et al., but there were also people interested in more modern 
sounds than 
those of all these gloomy acts dressed in black, whose role models were left 
somewhere in the angstful 80's... Here are some people who at the turn of the
millennium were having stronghold:
<p>
* <a href="/mind/laine.html">Marko
Laine</a>, who 
signed a deal with the Dutch Djax-Up Beats label, recording also for Drop 
Bass Network as Goio. Marko's "Mosaic" was released on Djax-Up 
February 1996, with follow-ups and international DJ gigs to come.
These releases were mostly hardish monotrax. Marko has 
also gained some success as the head of his import record store and label <a 
href="http://www.mindrecords.com/">Mind Records</a>, which 
during early 1997 started as an umbrella and distributor to some smaller 
Finnish labels like S&auml;vel, Pulssi and Moodmusic. Later on Marko
concentrated mostly on Mind Records, though still occasionally played 
some DJ gigs, where his style shifted from harsh monotrax mayhem to 
house; with even some added samba and Latino flavour.

* Kimmo Rapatti (picture on the right) a.k.a. Mono Junk a.k.a. Detroit Diesel - the 
man behind the Dum label, steadily on a Detroit/Chicago tip. With the 
S&auml;hk&ouml; guys somewhat a veteran of the Finnish techno underground. 
Later on ran a duo called New York City Survivors, with Irwin Berg on vocals.
See the <a href="/dum/">Dum Records

S&auml;hk&ouml; sublabel Puu in 1996: a house man to the bone.
Best known for his dubby deep house productions and now living in
Frankfurt, Germany, producing for local i220 label and running his own
Moodmusic. Also used 
to play with the fast doom-gabba monsters Amalgam V (featuring Irwin, 
a gonzo DJ legend and the owner
of his now-legendary Wartburg Gabba Mobile...): for those more into the
200 
BPM, Rotterdam style, bone-crunching soccer hooligan sounds... 
<p>
* <a href="/finndiscog/hulkkonen/">Jori
Hulkkonen</a>, originally from Kemi in the north of Finland and now 
relocated to Turku, 
one of the 
founders
of <a href="/lumi/">Lumi Records</a>;

Swedish  
Hybrid and Plumphouse, and the Italian ACV. And more. The house

Finland, who also used to have his own radio show on Radiomafia 
and YLEX stations.
<p>
* Jouni Alkio a.k.a. <a href="/aural/">Aural
Expansion</a>, churning out IDM and electronic listening music. Has been
keeping quiet since his excellent <i>Surreal Sheep</i> album for Belgian
SSR, but hopefully re-surfaces one day.
<p>
* <a href="/finndiscog/others/op:l/">Op:l
Bastards</a> - consisting of Timo Kaukolampi, Vilunki 3000 and Tuomo

electro and disco to analogue synth sounds, with a sense of eccentrity,
and have already reached an international cult reputation. They were
also behind the enormously popular <a
href="/flyers/hkiturbo/">Helsinki Turbo</a>
electro parties. Op:l Bastards are now having a break of 
indeterminate 
length. The latest project of 
Kaukolampi and Puranen has been K-X-P,
an electronic Krautrock/postrock/drone type of band featuring live drum
beats. Vilunki 3000 has with Street Kobra a new act called Uusi Fantasia,
who have even backed the 1970s "Finnhits" veteran Freeman (a.k.a. Leo
Friman), both as a guest to their own album and also on Freeman's 2011 
solo
record <i>IV</i>.
<p>
* <a href="/finndiscog/tie/">Mr Velcro

luminaries as Carl Craig and Dave Clarke. Their debut album <i>Lucky
Bastards Living Up North</i> has been released
on German i220 Records, with sleeve designed by legendary Designers
Republic. Mr
Velcro Fastener's
musical output is electro, in the style of Detroit Bass and 
old school artists such as Kraftwerk and Afrika Bambaataa, but with
a distinctive IDM flavour. 
<p>
Mr Velcro 
Fastener's Mesak (a.k.a. Tatu Metsätähti) has enjoyed a successful 
solo career with many electronic cult releases for labels around the
world, and also one of the driving forces behind Harmönia label, with Randy
Barracuda (a.k.a. Perttu Häkkinen), offering the unsuspecting world
the fruits of a brand new Scandinavian dance music genre called 
<i>Skweee</i>. 
<p>
* <a href="/finndiscog/delay/">Vladislav
Delay</a> a.k.a. Sasu Ripatti, recording minimal techno for such labels as 
Finnish Huume
and German Max Ernst & Freunde and Chain Reaction. Many people have
even called Vladislav Delay the biggest new artist coming from Finland
after Pan sonic. He has also published records with such aliases
as Luomo (more deep house type of sounds) and Uusitalo.
<p>
* <a
href="http://www.ovuca.com/">Ovuca</a>,
a.k.a. Aleksi Per&auml;l&auml;, who records for the legendary British
RepHlex record label, the home of Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, et al. Ovuca's
music could be described as drill'n'bass meets old school breakbeat, with
added eccentrity and "anything goes" attitude.
<p>
* <a href="http://www.m3rck.net/lackluster/">Lackluster</a>, a.k.a. Esa
Ruoho, whose <a
href="http://www.hyperreal.org/music/lists/idm/">IDM</a>-style
music has raised interest among the international
fan circles.
<p>
* <a href="http://www.rikosrecords.com/">Rikos Records</a>. Electro and
IDM from Jyv&auml;skyl&auml;s hot cult label. 
Rikos released Dr.
Robotnik's electro, Tero's Commodore 64 sounds, Lackluster's IDM
excursions, Puola's genre-splitting freakery and Polytron's 
Italodisco-tinged electro sounds. With now new releases since the 
early 2000s, Rikos label seems 
to 
be 
now on
permanent hiatus.
<p>
* <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Morphology" target="_blank">Morphology</a>. An electro duo consisting of Matti Turunen (a.k.a. Näköradiomies)
and Michael Diekmann (a.k.a. CRC), fast becoming international cult 
favourites.
<p>
For the 2010s biggest Finnish electronic dance promises gaining name
in the international hipster scene must be such
as LCMDF, TV Off, Renaissance Man, Femme En Fourrure, Zebra & Snake
Hannulelauri, Teeth and Helsinki 78-82; Teersom (a.k.a. Niko 
Pettersson) representing the good old techno sound. Dubstep community's 
biggest 
name probably is Tes La Rok (a.k.a. Jani Niiranen), with also such artist 
as Clouds and Desto following in his foot(dub)steps.
<p>
<H2>The future of the Finnish scene?</H2>
<p>
The late-90s/early-Noughties new 
generation of the Finnish ravers understood the meaning of being widely 
orientated: house, trip hop, acid jazz, jungle, electro, anything goes. In
summer
1998, Helsinki clubs such as Kerma (which means "Cream" in Finnish, by the
way) gained mention in such international trend magazines as <i>The
Face</i>, so it seemed local scene got a bit more coverage than earlier
on.
Also such international "super clubs" as Gatecrasher visited in Finland.
<p>
<img align=left src="/pic/flyer.jpg">
<p>
Also, as the Russian and Estonian techno and rave scenes got bigger,
Finland also had its moment as an important gateway for the 
international artists and DJs 
en route to the Eastern dance floors. Some foretaste of this was had back 
in 1992, when the Finnish DJs Pixy and Chill visited the Planetarium raves 
of 
<a href="http://www.dux.ru/guest/netcafe/Eng/tehnota/nfo.htm">St. 
Petersburg</a>, Russia - the rave scene was rapidly blooming in the East of 
the Finnish border, 
too. Russian DJ's like Lena Popova in their turn frequented Finnish
parties, and Russian techno acts such as <a
href="/finndiscog/newcomposers.html">New
Composers</a> were recording for Finnish record labels like <a
href="/finndiscog/saunaconnections/">Sauna
Connections</a> (now defunct). 
<p>
Furthermore, <a href="http://www.finnish-institute.org.uk/">The Finnish
Institute</a> in London organised, under the guidance of Jali
Wahlsten, some parties around Jimi Tenor
and Pan sonic (who sadly split in 2010, to give more room to the respective
solo careers of Mika Vainio and Ilpo Väisänen), which were well received 
in British media.
<p>
The early 21st century saw Finnish dance music also making 
commercial inroads with such acts as Bomfunk MCs, having their 15 
minutes of fame on
European charts with their combination of hip hop, 
electro and house sounds, and their producer Jaakko Salovaara, a.k.a.
JS16, on his own right. Salovaara's "discovery" Darude hit 
the British club charts with his take on ever so popular trance techno.
<p>
2000 also saw the first Finnish electronic music festival, <a
href="http://www.koneisto.com/">Koneisto</a>
("Machinery"), August in Turku, which was covered by such British music
magazines as <i>NME</i> and <i>The Wire</i>. Koneisto also had in Turku
a successor called UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, the New Music 
Festival). In 2009 was started another festival, Turku Modern. Flow festival
of Helsinki, starting in 2004, has gradually become the biggest event
for indie rock and electronic dance music, gaining a reputation as a 
popular meeting
place for trendy "hipster" audiences.
<p>
Helsinki's <a
href="http://www.avantofestival.com/">Avanto</a> festival which started
 in November of 2000 and ceased its activities after 2008, was 
dedicated to some more experimental acts, such as Rehberg,
Fennesz, Hecker and Skot of Austria's Mego label, Merzbow, Scanner,
Pan sonic, Kaffe Matthews, <i>et al.</i>; with glowing reviews in such
prestigious magazines as <i>The Wire</i> to follow. 
As all over the world,
the traditional visual arts and electronic music scenes were getting
closer each other also in Finland. International art galleries saw
and heard installations from the people of S&auml;hk&ouml; Recordings and
Pan sonic, and such Finnish multimedia societies as <a
href="http://www.katastro.fi/">Katastro.Fi</a> were in close
collaboration with electronic artists and events.  
<p>
Alex Needham wrote in the February 2001 issue of UK's <i>The Face</i>
magazine:
<p>
<blockquote>
... Finland's youth culture has never been more alive. There is, believe
it or not, a thriving hip hop scene, excellent clubs, and - aided by
cultural committee Helsinki 2000 - festivals showcasing everything from
avant-garde noise to light-based art installations situated around the
Finland concert hall, conceived to chase the winter away.  
<p>
... In the classic way of an emerging pop culture, many Finns are
discovering their own identity through the music and style of peoples that
seem, on the face of it, completely opposite. Older Finns like to dance
the tango. Twentysomethings hang around beautifully designed record
shops, digging through crates of dub, soul and Latin vinyl.
<p>
... It's the confidence of of a new generation streching out in directions
their parents hadn't considered, whether into black music, dance culture
or avant-garde art. They might not get it 'right', but that's the story of
pop culture; instead they end up with a fascinating hybrid that is
peculiarly Finnish. The people are shy, but they're hungry for ideas; go
there and participate in a hugely entertaining cultural exhange. 
</blockquote>
<p>
But despite all said and done, was the fate of Finnish scene
eventually just
to remain left in the marginal; as of interest only to those most
dedicated connoisseurs looking for the more obscure and exotic sounds?

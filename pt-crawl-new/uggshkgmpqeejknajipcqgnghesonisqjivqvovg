<p><strong>Please note that this is a very large dataset and Excel will <em>not</em> load all of the records. If you’re only comfortable with Excel, please use either the links for individual years, or the <a href="https://data.phila.gov/visualizations/real-estate-transfers">data visualization</a> which allows you to filter the dataset by your specific interests (i.e. a zip code) and then export a custom CSV from the table at the bottom of the visualization. We provide the CSV of All Years mostly for developers to use when coding.
If you are comfortable with APIs, you could also use the API links to access this data.

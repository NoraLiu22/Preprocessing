<p>Last Updated: 29 June 2023</p>
<p>California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia have enacted consumer privacy laws that grant their residents certain rights and require specific disclosures ("<strong>State Laws</strong>"). This Supplemental U.S. State Privacy Notice ("<strong>Notice</strong>") addresses these state-specific requirements and also serves as our California notice at collection.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of one of the states listed above, this Notice, together with our <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>, applies to you. In particular, this Notice applies to your use of:</p>
<ul>
 <li>all Spotify streaming services as a user; and</li>
 <li>other Spotify services which include a link to this Notice. These include Spotify websites, Customer Service and the Community Site</li>
</ul>
<p>From now on, we'll collectively call these the "<strong>Spotify Service"</strong>.</p>
<p>We may update this Notice from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the Last Updated date above. If we make material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our websites and mobile apps or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Notice regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

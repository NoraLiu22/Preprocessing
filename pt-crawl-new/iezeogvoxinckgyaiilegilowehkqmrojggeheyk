In 1998, when <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/bill-clinton">Bill Clinton</a> called Yeltsin to tell him the United States was considering air strikes in Serbia, Yeltsin was furious. He screamed at Clinton that this was unacceptable and then hung up. The <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nato-bombs-yugoslavia">bombing raids</a> went ahead anyway.</p><p>Putin was determined that this could not continue, and it was immediately clear that his style was going to be very different to that of Yeltsin. When Bill Clinton’s point man on Russia, <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/05/strobe-talbott-brookings-foreign-policy-interview-politico-215226">Strobe Talbott</a>, first met Putin during the late 1990s, the American official found his style completely different from the histrionics or lecturing that he was used to from Yeltsin and other Russian officials. Talbott was struck by Putin’s “ability to convey self-control and confidence in a low-key, soft-spoken manner.” </p><p>And the future president also used a number of tricks from his KGB background to show he was in control, making sure to name-drop poets Talbott had studied at university to show he had read Talbott’s file. “I could imagine him debriefing a captured spy who’d already been softened up by the rougher types,” Talbott recalled in his memoirs.</p><p>A few days before he became president, in late 1999, Putin wrote an article in the Russian newspaper <em>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</em>, outlining his task as he saw it. “For the first time in the past 200 to 300 years, Russia faces the real danger that it could be relegated to the second, or even the third tier of global powers,” Putin warned. He called on Russians to unite to make sure that the country remained what he called a “first-tier” nation.</p><p>To achieve this, Putin turned to history. Russia’s recent past had been contradictory, painful and bloody, but Putin was determined that Russians should take pride in their history. Victory in World War II, still known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War, became a kind of national founding myth for the new Russia.</p><p>“Through you, we got used to being winners,” Putin told veterans on his first Victory Day, two days after his inauguration in 2000. With each year, the victory narrative became more pronounced. Questioning the darker sides of the Soviet war narrative, such as the deportation of 2 million Soviet citizens during the war, or the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ukrainian-famine-stalin">ruthless tactics</a> of the Stalin regime on the eve of the conflict, became ever more taboo. Putin was determined that Russians should not be made to feel guilty for their past.</p><h2 id="putin-burnished-his-tough-guy-image">Putin Burnished His Tough-Guy Image</h2><figure class="wp-block-image article__contained"><div class="wp-block-image__wrapper"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"><img style="display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27704%27%20height=%27352%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 704px, calc(100vw - 2.5rem)" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-taking-part-in.jpg?width=750&amp;height=375&amp;crop=750%3A375%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-taking-part-in.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=960&amp;crop=1920%3A960%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2x" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-taking-part-in.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=960&amp;crop=1920%3A960%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span><figcaption class="image-credit wp-block-image__credit"><span>Alexey Druzhinin/AFP/Getty Images</span></figcaption></div><div class="wp-block-image__caption">Vladimir Putin taking part in a judo training session in St. Petersburg, 2010.</div></figure><p>Putin’s personal image evolved to reinforce the narrative of a newly resurgent country.

There was even a rumor that Putin wanted to be blasted into space to orbit the earth.

The circle of real decision makers around Putin shrank, skewing toward people with a security services background. Putin has prided loyalty above all else, and many of the people around him are those he has known since his KGB days—or at least since the 1990s in St Petersburg.</p><p>These people almost never talk to journalists, making reliable information about the inner workings of the Kremlin hard to come by. Putin is a cloistered leader, who hardly ever uses the internet and mainly receives information in briefing notes handed to him in red folders by Kremlin aides. While he cultivates an image as a man of the people, he has come into contact with “real Russians” increasingly rarely, and usually in carefully scripted encounters.&nbsp;</p><p>Even his then-wife Ludmila, in a rare 2005 interview to Russian newspapers, painted a picture of a taciturn and authoritarian master of the house. She said he could only be asked questions (never about work) when he came home late at night and drank a glass of kefir before bed. And Ludmila said she gave up cooking because her husband never praised her food. “He has put me to the test throughout our life together. I constantly feel that he is watching me and checking that I make the right decisions,” she said. The couple announced a divorce in 2013.</p><p>Over the years, Putin has made himself synonymous with the new state, extending his presidency more than two decades. During this time, Putin’s use of the Second World War has been augmented with other, secondary historical figures and victories, as Putin has tried to weave a narrative of Russian glory, starting with the 10th-century Prince Vladimir, founder of Kievan Rus—and ending with the Vladimir currently residing inside the Kremlin.</p><p><strong>Shaun Walker is the Central and Eastern European correspondent for <em>The Guardian</em> and author of the&nbsp;book, <em>The Long Hangover: Putin’s New Russia and the Ghosts of the Past</em>, published by Oxford University Press.

Putin called for armed backup to protect the employees and the sensitive files hidden inside, but was told no help would come. “Moscow is silent,” said the voice on the line. He had no choice but to go outside and lie to the crowds that he had heavily armed men waiting inside who would shoot anyone who tried to enter. The bluff worked, the mob dissipated and the KGB’s files on informers and agents remained safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePutin felt he was watching one of the largest and most powerful empires the world had ever seen unravel in the most pathetic and humiliating way. “I had the feeling that the country was no more,” he recalled later in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/First-Person-Astonishingly-Self-portrait-Publicaffairs/dp/1586480189\"\u003eseries of interviews\u003c/a\u003e published in 2000. “It had disappeared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to mourn not the human cost or material tribulations, but the national humiliation of a powerful state simply imploding. He later claimed to have had a sense for some time that the collapse of Soviet power in Europe was inevitable. “But I wanted something different to rise in its place. And nothing different was proposed. That’s what hurt.

And while Putin rose swiftly in the political ranks in its aftermath, he did have his own personal trauma associated with the fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a 37-year-old KGB lieutenant colonel stationed in the East German city of Dresden, Putin watched nervously as angry crowds stormed the city’s huge Stasi compound in December 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/berlin-wall\"\u003eBerlin Wall\u003c/a\u003e signaled the end of Soviet control in Europe. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverrunning the offices of the East German secret police, the crowds moved on to its inner sanctum: the \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/russia/kgb\"\u003eKGB\u003c/a\u003e headquarters. Putin called for armed backup to protect the employees and the sensitive files hidden inside, but was told no help would come. “Moscow is silent,” said the voice on the line. He had no choice but to go outside and lie to the crowds that he had heavily armed men waiting inside who would shoot anyone who tried to enter. The bluff worked, the mob dissipated and the KGB’s files on informers and agents remained safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePutin felt he was watching one of the largest and most powerful empires the world had ever seen unravel in the most pathetic and humiliating way. “I had the feeling that the country was no more,” he recalled later in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/First-Person-Astonishingly-Self-portrait-Publicaffairs/dp/1586480189\"\u003eseries of interviews\u003c/a\u003e published in 2000. “It had disappeared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to mourn not the human cost or material tribulations, but the national humiliation of a powerful state simply imploding. He later claimed to have had a sense for some time that the collapse of Soviet power in Europe was inevitable. “But I wanted something different to rise in its place. And nothing different was proposed. That’s what hurt. They just dropped everything and went away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eTo Restore Russian\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8216;First-Tier\u0026#8217; Status, Putin Invoked Its History\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"814\" src=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-in-may-2000.jpg?width=800\u0026amp;height=400\u0026amp;crop=2:1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36625\" srcset=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-in-may-2000.jpg?width=300 300w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-in-may-2000.jpg?width=1024 1024w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-in-may-2000.jpg?width=1536 1536w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-in-may-2000.jpg?width=2048 2048w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-in-may-2000.jpg?width=1200 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eVladimir Putin in May 2000 with World War II veterans in Kursk, Russia, site of history’s biggest tank battle, when Soviet forces defeated a major Nazi German offensive in 1943.

In 1998, when \u003ca href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/bill-clinton\"\u003eBill Clinton\u003c/a\u003e called Yeltsin to tell him the United States was considering air strikes in Serbia, Yeltsin was furious.

The \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nato-bombs-yugoslavia\"\u003ebombing raids\u003c/a\u003e went ahead anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePutin was determined that this could not continue, and it was immediately clear that his style was going to be very different to that of Yeltsin. When Bill Clinton’s point man on Russia, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/05/strobe-talbott-brookings-foreign-policy-interview-politico-215226\"\u003eStrobe Talbott\u003c/a\u003e, first met Putin during the late 1990s, the American official found his style completely different from the histrionics or lecturing that he was used to from Yeltsin and other Russian officials. Talbott was struck by Putin’s “ability to convey self-control and confidence in a low-key, soft-spoken manner.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the future president also used a number of tricks from his KGB background to show he was in control, making sure to name-drop poets Talbott had studied at university to show he had read Talbott’s file. “I could imagine him debriefing a captured spy who’d already been softened up by the rougher types,” Talbott recalled in his memoirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few days before he became president, in late 1999, Putin wrote an article in the Russian newspaper \u003cem\u003eNezavisimaya Gazeta\u003c/em\u003e, outlining his task as he saw it. “For the first time in the past 200 to 300 years, Russia faces the real danger that it could be relegated to the second, or even the third tier of global powers,” Putin warned. He called on Russians to unite to make sure that the country remained what he called a “first-tier” nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo achieve this, Putin turned to history. Russia’s recent past had been contradictory, painful and bloody, but Putin was determined that Russians should take pride in their history. Victory in World War II, still known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War, became a kind of national founding myth for the new Russia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Through you, we got used to being winners,” Putin told veterans on his first Victory Day, two days after his inauguration in 2000. With each year, the victory narrative became more pronounced. Questioning the darker sides of the Soviet war narrative, such as the deportation of 2 million Soviet citizens during the war, or the \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/news/ukrainian-famine-stalin\"\u003eruthless tactics\u003c/a\u003e of the Stalin regime on the eve of the conflict, became ever more taboo. Putin was determined that Russians should not be made to feel guilty for their past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ePutin Burnished His Tough-Guy Image\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-taking-part-in.jpg?width=800\u0026amp;height=400\u0026amp;crop=2:1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36626\" width=\"704\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-taking-part-in.jpg?width=1250 1250w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-taking-part-in.jpg?width=800 800w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/02/vladimir-putin-taking-part-in.jpg?width=500 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eVladimir Putin taking part in a judo training session in St. Petersburg, 2010.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePutin’s personal image evolved to reinforce the narrative of a newly resurgent country. He won Russians over with his calm, no-nonsense approach and tough talking. Over time, Kremlin spin doctors played up his macho credentials, resulting in a series of photo opportunities that seemed to get more and more absurd: Putin at the controls of a race car and a fighter jet, Putin riding a horse bare-chested, Putin flying a microlight with a flock of rare cranes. There was even a rumor that Putin wanted to be blasted into space to orbit the earth.

The circle of real decision makers around Putin shrank, skewing toward people with a security services background. Putin has prided loyalty above all else, and many of the people around him are those he has known since his KGB days—or at least since the 1990s in St Petersburg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese people almost never talk to journalists, making reliable information about the inner workings of the Kremlin hard to come by. Putin is a cloistered leader, who hardly ever uses the internet and mainly receives information in briefing notes handed to him in red folders by Kremlin aides. While he cultivates an image as a man of the people, he has come into contact with “real Russians” increasingly rarely, and usually in carefully scripted encounters.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven his then-wife Ludmila, in a rare 2005 interview to Russian newspapers, painted a picture of a taciturn and authoritarian master of the house. She said he could only be asked questions (never about work) when he came home late at night and drank a glass of kefir before bed. And Ludmila said she gave up cooking because her husband never praised her food. “He has put me to the test throughout our life together. I constantly feel that he is watching me and checking that I make the right decisions,” she said. The couple announced a divorce in 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, Putin has made himself synonymous with the new state, extending his presidency more than two decades. During this time, Putin’s use of the Second World War has been augmented with other, secondary historical figures and victories, as Putin has tried to weave a narrative of Russian glory, starting with the 10th-century Prince Vladimir, founder of Kievan Rus—and ending with the Vladimir currently residing inside the Kremlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShaun Walker is the Central and Eastern European correspondent for \u003cem\u003eThe Guardian\u003c/em\u003e and author of the\u0026nbsp;book, \u003cem\u003eThe Long Hangover: Putin’s New Russia and the Ghosts of the Past\u003c/em\u003e, published by Oxford University Press.

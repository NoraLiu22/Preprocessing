There is a kiwi Christmas song in the NZ Singles chart though.  In 1985 Billy J James relsaed A Maori Christmas.  That very funny track finally shows up in our chart, at #16 in the NZ Singles Chart.   There are also a couple in the NZ Hot 20 from Reb Fountain and PERE as well. With the new entries, we now have 71 Christmas singles charted since 1957.<br>The first is an oldie. Perry Como was huge in the charts from 1938 right through to his last recording in 1987.  He recorded one of the most popular versions of It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas in 1951.  As charts are missing from back then we don't know how the single went in New Zealand but it did reach #12 in the US.  This week he enters our chart at #28. <br>Kelly Clarkson and Ariana Grande are next with Santa, Can't You Hear Me? at #37. Recorded in December 2022, it comes from Clarkson's second Christmas album When Christmas Comes Around, which debuts at #19.<br>The newest Christmas song comes from Cher. DJ Play A Christmas Song at #39, is taken from her new album Christmas, which debuts at #18.  It is her 27th studio album.<br>Kylie Monogue has the final of three new albums.

<BR>
<P>Today, 29 June 2004, the International Seed Treaty (International Treaty on
Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture - IT PGRFA) comes into force.
Its purpose is to ensure that the agricultural biodiversity of the crops
nurtured by farmers over millennia is conserved and that there is equitable
benefit sharing from its sustainable use. To date 54 countries have ratified
the Treaty representing a broad range of both developing and industrialised
countries. </P>
<P>While the achievement of bringing this new Treaty into law is significant
there is much work to do to make sure its laudable purposes are not undermined
by economically powerful countries seeking rights to extract and privatise
genetic resources covered by the Treaty and finding ways to minimise their
financial contributions to the conservation efforts of farmers as required by
the Treaty.</P>
<P>Smallholder farmers worldwide, the principal guardians and developers of
these vital resources, have demanded full international implementation of their
inalienable Farmers Rights to produce, exchange and sell seeds and they have
insisted that agricultural biodiversity be kept free of the restrictions
imposed by intellectual property rights (IPRs). The diversity that feeds the
world was created through the free exchange of seeds by farmers within and
between communities, countries and continents. Farmers Rights are an essential
prerequisite for ensuring this free exchange can continue to be practiced by
smallholder farmers worldwide.</P>
<P>The interpretation of the Treaty is ambiguous on this point. The text says
clearly that no IPRs may be taken out on the genetic resources covered by the
Treaty. However, the UK, EU countries and others are insistent that weasel
words inserted into the Treaty text mean that they should have the right to
privatise resources extracted from the common pool covered by the Treaty, if
these resources are modified and are no longer &#147;in the form
received&#148;. Furthermore, during negotiations, these same countries weakened
the Treaty&#146;s provisions on Farmers Rights subordinating them to
restrictive national IPR rules. </P>
<P>The Treaty process is facilitated by the Food and Agriculture Organisation
of the United Nations (FAO) that has recently discredited itself by publishing
a biased report on GM crops. In this report there is also a whole section
devoted to arguments in favour of the privatisation of genetic resources:
&#147;&#133;the essential role of IPR protection in stimulating research and
technology development is clear.&#148; This flies in the face of farmers
experience and the reality that the diversity of foods and crop varieties that
we now enjoy are the result of the free exchange of seeds. The FAO seems to
have weakened its objective commitment to keeping agricultural biodiversity in
the public domain, free from the restrictions of IPRs. </P>
<P>The combined pressure of economically powerful countries and advice from the
body that hosts the negotiations that IPRs are good for development may force
the negotiations towards acceptance of conservation-reducing restrictive IPRs.
</P>
<P>Today, there should be new funds flowing to farmers for their conservation
efforts, as promised. But long gone are the heady days of the negotiations of
the innovative Leipzig Global Plan of Action for the conservation and
sustainable use of agricultural seeds. It called for significant, new and
additional funding for the on-farm conservation of the myriad but threatened
diversity developed by farmers - up to 95% lost in the past century from the
ravages of industrial agriculture. </P>
<P>This 1996 Plan was put on hold until the Treaty became law. Articles 5 and 6
of the Treaty provide the legal framework for this Global Plan of Action. Well,
today is the day this Plan should be rolled out and countries should now be
queuing to fund these programmes and where are they? The two trillion dollar
food industry is based on these resources &#150; now is payback time.</P>
<P>Developing countries eager to support the conservation efforts of their
farmers will find themselves increasingly embattled as they struggle to defend
free access in the upcoming negotiations on a universal Material Transfer
Agreement &#150; the agreement that provides the rules of access to the common
resources covered by the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Governing Body, made up of all the countries that have ratified the
Treaty, will be put under great pressure to accede to the demands of
economically powerful countries for the privatisation of the resources taken
from the common gene pool. And these same countries are the ones that should be
paying for the conservation programmes &#150; will they, without such
concessions?</P>
<P>All is not yet lost but the battle continues. FAO and its donors would do
better to support the enthusiasm of the global farmers movement, La Via
Campesina, who in their recent International Conference reasserted their
commitment to conserving the seeds of humanity, campaigning for the survival of
ecologically-supportive farming and calling for the adoption of food
sovereignty policies. </P>
<P>The sights of La Via Campesina are set not only on the conservation and
development of seeds but also livestock breeds and the diversity of aquatic
organisms. The Treaty should have provided the international framework for
supporting this type of work and a possible model for the conservation of all
types of agricultural biodiversity. But the signs are not good: it may only
hasten its demise unless privatisation is outlawed, Farmers Rights are
implemented internationally and funding for new conservation efforts is
dramatically increased.</P>
<P>When the history is written of this sorry period of destruction of farmers,
farming and the natural resources on which the world depends for its food, the
writer may wonder why humanity was so foolish not to encourage those who best
could ensure the diversity of tomorrow&#146;s foods. Historians may well recall
the words of Fidel Castro at the 1996 World Food Summit when he said:
&#147;<I>The bells that are presently tolling for those starving to death every
day will tomorrow be tolling for all humankind if it did not want, did not know
how, or could not be sufficiently wise, to save itself.&#148;</I></P>

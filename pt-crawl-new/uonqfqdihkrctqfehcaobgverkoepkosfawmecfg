Its first season looked at the mysterious abduction of Jacob Wetterling in rural Minnesota and the lack of accountability that sheriffs face when they fail to solve cases. Season 2 examined the case of Curtis Flowers, who was tried six times for the same crime. In 2020, In the Dark released a special report on the coronavirus pandemic in the Mississippi Delta. In 2023, In the Dark joined The New Yorker and Condé Nast. “The Runaway Princesses,” In the Dark’s first collaboration with a New Yorker staff writer, is a four-part series that asks why the women in Dubai’s royal family keep trying to run away. Season 3 of In the Dark is currently in production.\nIn the Dark is a two-time Peabody Award winner and, in 2019, became the first podcast to win a George Polk Award, one of the top honors in investigative journalism. The program has also received an Edward R. Murrow Award and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":27668829,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9mLnByeHUub3JnLzU3NzAvaW1hZ2VzLzkxY2VhNWJkLWIwZDMtNDU5ZS04YWFiLWZmZTYxODhhZDZhMC9Jbl90aGVfRGFya19TMl8zMDAweDMwMDAtVE5ZXzFfXzJfLnBuZw","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1711642131,"seedId":27668829,"seedShowId":27668829,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1314-in-the-dark","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"In The Dark","url":"/podcast/1314-in-the-dark-27668829/","episodeIds":[]},"27797564":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Hosted by celebrated criminal justice reform advocate and founding board member of the Innocence Project Jason Flom, and Pulitzer prize-winning podcast host and producer Maggie Freleng, Wrongful Conviction features intimate conversations with men and women who have spent years in prison for crimes they maintain they did not commit.

The autopsy proved otherwise: Nathan, 67, had been viciously beaten to death, punched so hard by her assailant that two of her teeth had been knocked out. Days later, a hotel employee went to the hospital to be treated for an infection in his hand, which was teeming with a bacteria most often found in human mouths. That, plus a pendant an officer said was discovered in the trunk of his car, sealed the fate of Elwood Jones, who awaits execution on Ohio's death row. For nearly 30 years, Jones has maintained his innocence -- and accused police of straight-up framing him. The journalists of Accused are reexamining the case to learn if Jones truly belongs on death row, or if a botched investigation let someone else get away with murder.\nSeason 3: In 1984, a father of three disappeared while working at a mysterious Cincinnati plant. It turned out he’d met a gruesome fate: Pieces of bone, his eyeglasses and walkie-talkie were uncovered inside a vat that reached 1350 degrees Fahrenheit. Two months later, the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center was revealed to have been processing uranium – and polluting the region. The dead man’s children believe their father was murdered because he intended to expose how the plant had been releasing millions of pounds of uranium dust into the atmosphere. We’re hoping to figure out: Did 39-year-old David Bocks kill himself, as Fernald officials alleged, or was he more likely killed?\n\nSeason 2: A soft-hearted prison minister was found killed in her Kentucky apartment, and Newport police zeroed in on an ex-convict she’d counseled. Thirty years later, the conviction is overturned and the case is once again unsolved. The Cincinnati Enquirer investigates: Was William Virgil wrongly convicted for murder?\n\nSeason 1: When Elizabeth Andes was found murdered in her Ohio apartment in 1978, police and prosecutors decided within hours it was an open-and-shut case.

Dr. Death | S1: Dr. Duntsch\n\nWe’re at our most vulnerable when we go to our doctors. We trust the person at the other end of that scalpel. We trust the hospital. We trust the system. Christopher Duntsch was a neurosurgeon who radiated confidence. He claimed he was the best in Dallas. If you had back pain, and had tried everything else, Dr. Duntsch could give you the spine surgery that would take your pain away. But soon his patients started to experience complications, and the system failed to protect them. Which begs the question: who - or what - is that system meant to protect? From Wondery, the network behind the hit podcast Dirty John, Dr. Death is a story about a charming surgeon, 33 patients and a spineless system.

Ten years later, Tiffani Horn’s mother, 8-year-old brother, and a close family friend were found murdered.

One of America’s deadliest school shootings took place in a small town in Colorado, leaving thirteen dead and another twenty-one severely injured. And it was all broadcast over national tv for the nation to see. \nThe second season of Confronting takes on one of the most prolific tragedies in American history: the Columbine High School massacre. It was a devastating example of how easily a place of learning, familiarity and peace can descend into a war zone of chaos in a moment, the teenagers present that day are now adults who bear the mental and physical scars of the carnage they lived through. Amy Over, a Columbine survivor who is still living with its aftermath and raising her own children in its shadow, confronts many of the realities, questions and myths that surround the massacre to this day. Amy, through her own experience and by speaking with survivors, investigators, classmates, reporters on the scene and other important voices, brings a first-person account of the physical, emotional and spiritual journey that comes along with confronting the worst day of her life. \n\nSeason 1 - Confronting: O.J. Simpson \n25 years after the crimes that ignited the \"Trial of the Century\" Kim Goldman, sister of murder victim Ron Goldman, is digging deep into the vicious crime that changed her life, and many others, forever. Thrust into the public eye at the age of 22, Kim was devastated when OJ Simpson was found not guilty of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her brother Ron. There has been much debate and confusion about what really happened the night of those brutal murders and for the first time Kim gets answers to questions that have been haunting her since the trial. She sits down with prosecutors, investigators, and witnesses who never got to speak and jurors who voted not guilty. In this 10-part series, Kim takes you on a journey as she reclaims and reflects on the part of her life that was changed permanently.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":45914403,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250ZW50LnByb2R1Y3Rpb24uY2RuLmFydDE5LmNvbS9pbWFnZXMvNWQvYWYvOGIvMTAvNWRhZjhiMTAtOGRjMC00MjVhLWFjM2EtNDI2MzgzNDEzZTJmL2U4MTVlMmIwZjg1MzljM2VjOWJmNzkzNGQyMGE4NmUwZDFkYjBiYTdjZTY3ZWUyZGM1NjE5OGRjMTdmNWZmY2ZmNGFmYTg4YzFhNWNhY2VlODhjZmExMzlhYWI3NjZhYzE5N2FhN2ZlMmMwZDU0ZGYxY2Y3ZTQ3ZTgzMzIyMDA1LmpwZWc","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1650391313,"seedId":45914403,"seedShowId":45914403,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"272-confronting-oj-simpson","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Confronting","url":"/podcast/272-confronting-oj-simpson-45914403/","episodeIds":[]},"46165170":{"customLinks":[],"description":"What happens when you immerse yourself in true crime, night after night, digging deeper into the lives of serial killers?

Follow characters on the fringes of society — con artists, cult leaders, corrupt politicians — as they seduce their marks and bend communities to their will. Join us as we unravel their stories and bring justice to the people they’ve deceived. SEASON 8: My Fugitive Dad Ashley’s Dad was her favorite person in the world. He drove fast cars and sold them for a living. He was a scratch golfer and the love of her Mum’s life. Ashley thought she knew him better than anyone. But at 38, she found out he wasn’t who he said he was. Inspired by his favorite movie the Thomas Crown Affair, he had pulled off a robbery in Cleveland then disappeared. It turns out he evaded the authorities for half a century, living in their sleepy Massachusetts town. His secret upended his family’s life, but another family’s too. Because from the moment this 20-year-old vault teller escaped with $215,000 in 1969, Deputy U.S. Marshal John Elliott made it his life’s mission to bring him to justice. After he retired, his son even took up his mantle. For this six episode podcast, host Jonathan Hirsch teams up with Ashley Randele to unravel the mystery of how her Dad got away with it, and ultimately, why he left behind everyone and everything to start over.

SEASON 7: Betrayal on the Bayou For almost two decades, DEA Special Agent Chad Scott ruled the streets just North of New Orleans. He controlled a network of snitches by convincing people he arrested to work for him as informants. Chad would stop at nothing to put drug dealers behind bars. His successes won awards at the DEA, but his willingness to bend the rules earned him a terrifying reputation on the streets. Some called him the Golden Boy. Others called him the White Devil. But when one of guys on Chad's team is caught dealing drugs, Chad’s life is overturned. His right-hand men betray him and confess everything to the FBI. Investigators go over his career with a fine-toothed comb, asking the question: is Chad Scott the greatest DEA Agent in the South, or is he a criminal? SEASON 6: Just Say You're Sorry Texas Ranger James Holland is celebrated as the ‘serial killer whisperer’, solving dozens of murders through his legendary interrogation skills. But how far does he go to get confessions? And has he put innocent people in prison along the way? Smoke Screen: Just Say You're Sorry uses shocking police tapes to reveal the psychological drama behind one murder case, and uncovers something rotten at the heart of the justice system. SEASON 5: Deadly Cure Smoke Screen: Deadly Cure is a podcast about a family on the fringe who convinced tens of thousands of people across the globe to buy a miracle liquid made of poison, the international conspiracy they ignited, and the people who fought to take them down.

At first, the police thought they were dealing with an open-and-shut case, suspecting that it was Sheila Caffell – diagnosed with schizophrenia – who had shot her adoptive parents and twin sons before turning the gun on herself. As one detective set out to prove, however, certain elements of that narrative that didn’t add up – and the spotlight turned to Sheila’s brother, Jeremy Bamber. In the new companion podcast to the HBO Max limited series The Murders at White House Farm, host Lauren Bright Pacheco speaks with the show’s creators, as well as with Carol Ann Lee -- author of the book The Murders at White House Farm -- and Colin Caffell, the father of the two young boys.

The government alleged that these men conspired to kidnap, and possibly even kill, the sitting governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer. But is that really what happened? On season 7 of Chameleon, we’ll explore that notorious plot to kidnap governor Whitmer from its inception by taking listeners on an unprecedented journey inside the investigation. Through hundreds of hours of wire recordings that have never been heard by the public, you’ll ride along in the pocket of an FBI informant posing as a militia member, as he infiltrates an anti-government group that seems dangerous. But are they? Was the plot to kidnap governor Whitmer the sophisticated plan the government said it was, or just the stoned fantasies of a group of down-on-their-luck gun nuts? Did the FBI stop a dangerous plot in motion…or did it help to create it? Want the full story? Unlock all episodes of Chameleon: The Michigan Plot, ad-free, right now by subscribing to The Binge.

Fans arrived in Rolls Royces delivered from New York City. Adorned in vibrant fur coats and dripping with diamonds, they grabbed engraved invitations then strutted into the arena. The sold-out crowd stood and cheered when the first-round bell rang, minus two empty seats. After the fight, many celebrating the victory, including top black mafia leaders, headed to Chicken Man’s house with invitation in hand. Instead of women and wine greeting them at the front door, each walked into the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun. On FIGHT NIGHT, J.D. Hudson, one of the first black detectives in Atlanta’s desegregated police force helped lead Muhammed Ali into the ring. The next day, he was assigned to the robbery by the chief of police.

Her family describes her as a strong, fun-loving, career-minded, and responsible young woman. So why did Jennifer Kesse seemingly vanish without a trace? On the morning of Tuesday, January 24, 2006, Jennifer Kesse failed to show up for work at Central Florida Investments, where she was a finance manager. Jennifer was known for her reliability, but on that winter morning 14 years ago, nobody heard from Jen. And that meant something was terribly wrong. In this podcast, hosted by crime reporter Cristina Corbin, she travels to Florida to uncover new leads, conduct exclusive interviews, and examine evidence in recently unsealed police records. Years later, the Jennifer Kesse case is anything but cold. In fact, the investigation, by some accounts, is only just beginning.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":74038193,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWdhcGhvbmUuaW1naXgubmV0L3BvZGNhc3RzLzUyNDJhZWFjLTYwMDMtMTFlYy04MjJlLWFiYzQ3ZWVlZDFmZC9pbWFnZS9pbWFnZS5qcGc_aXhsaWI9cmFpbHMtNC4zLjEmbWF4LXc9MzAwMCZtYXgtaD0zMDAwJmZpdD1jcm9wJmF1dG89Zm9ybWF0LGNvbXByZXNz","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1696504737,"seedId":74038193,"seedShowId":74038193,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1293-house-of-broken-dreams-th","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"House of Broken Dreams: The Jennifer Kesse Story","url":"/podcast/1293-house-of-broken-dreams-th-74038193/","episodeIds":[]},"74038380":{"customLinks":[],"description":"The disappearance of two of Lori Vallow’s children in Rexburg, Idaho in September 2019 would expose a bizarre trail of death, devotion and Doomsday beliefs that captivated the nation… A haunting podcast from Keith Morrison and Dateline NBC.

Through time psychopaths have lived amongst us. But there are psychopaths and then there is Australia’s Vince O’Dempsey. Currently in prison for life for three murders, and charged with another, he has self-confessed to thirty-three killings. His weapons of choice are knives, and as a last resort, his bare hands. On the serial killer pop charts thirty-three victims puts him way above the Milwaukee cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, on a level-pegging with the Killer Clown, John Wayne Gacy, and just a fraction behind the infamous Ted Bundy. But Vince’s criminal associates laugh at his humility when it comes to a body count. All are convinced that his tally exceeds 100 victims. In this podcast series, author and journalist Matthew Condon, takes us back to Vince’s early years, where he terrorised a small country town and ultimately graduated to become the most feared man in the Australian underworld. We will piece together the story of his victims over half a century. We will talk to men and women who were close to him - family, workmates, fellow gangsters - and survived his evil. Gang members and criminals who worked shoulder to shoulder with Vince in the underworld finally speak out about the killer in their midst. And we will search deep into wild bushland for that unholiest of Grails – Vince O’Dempsey’s mythical private graveyard, where his many victims rest.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":74856146,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9kM3Qzb3pmdG1kbWgzaS5jbG91ZGZyb250Lm5ldC9zdGFnaW5nL3BvZGNhc3RfdXBsb2FkZWRfbm9sb2dvLzM2OTk5MjAxLzAzMjIzOTQwZDkyZjA3NTAuanBlZw","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1679452210,"seedId":74856146,"seedShowId":74856146,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"269-ghost-gate-road","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Ghost Gate Road","url":"/podcast/269-ghost-gate-road-74856146/","episodeIds":[]},"75204164":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Unraveled is hosted by journalist Alexis Linkletter.

A bullet brutally tore through decorated law enforcement veteran LaVerne Stordock.

At the center of Dorothy’s investigation is Suzanne Brandon, LaVerne’s second wife, who confessed to the shooting -- and who Dorothy believes completely escaped justice. As it follows Dorothy’s discoveries, MANslaughter explores questions around the psychology of crime, the ways women are made responsible in families, and the lasting impact of trauma.\nA final encounter between Suzanne and Dorothy reveals a complex connection that even that gunshot cannot shatter.

Frank Carson was Stanislaus County’s most controversial defense attorney, a wizard with juries and a courtroom brawler with an unapologetically caustic style. He racked up legal wins for decades. He was the terror of police and prosecutors, often accusing them personally of corruption. When a small-time thief disappeared, police — some of them Carson’s longtime adversaries — launched a massive investigation into a spectral underworld of street hustlers, junkies and snitches. Carson was charged with murder, accused of masterminding a conspiracy. It would be one of the longest criminal trials in California history, with the flinty veteran of so many courtroom wars on trial for his life. The Trials of Frank Carson was produced by the Los Angeles Times and Western Sound.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":82469944,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFnZS5zaW1wbGVjYXN0Y2RuLmNvbS9pbWFnZXMvNGViZDBhOTMtNzMwZS00NTM3LWI4NDctOGQ5NjNkNmM4MTlkLzA4MGUwN2VmLTI1Y2UtNGMzYi04YTNmLTg4OWUwZDcyMzhkNi8zMDAweDMwMDAvbGF0MjEtZnJhbmtjYXJzb24tMzAwMHgzMDAwLTEuanBnP2FpZD1yc3NfZmVlZA","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1689785289,"seedId":82469944,"seedShowId":82469944,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"269-the-trials-of-frank-carson","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"The Trials of Frank Carson","url":"/podcast/269-the-trials-of-frank-carson-82469944/","episodeIds":[]},"82633930":{"customLinks":[],"description":"On April Fools Day 1999, 26-year-old Yvonne Layne was found murdered in her Ohio home.

With exclusive interviews from journalists, FBI agents, historians and mental health experts this season promises to be the most comprehensive - and most terrifying - account of how one man brought New York City to a standstill.

After falling in love with a young, beautiful preacher, Michael’s personality began to change. The mild-mannered family man became abusive and unhinged.

But when Hargrove reached out to warn local police, he was ignored -- until Afrikka Hardy was murdered, and those cold cases suddenly didn’t look so cold. Algorithm follows the investigation into Afrikka’s murder, exposing the warnings that police ignored, and uncovering more than anyone expected -- that a serial killer was strangling women in Gary, Indiana could've been stopped.

The FBI's hunt for the leak led to an astonishing discovery—the mole was one of its own, special agent Robert Hanssen. For two decades, Hanssen masqueraded as a devoted patriot while ruthlessly selling out his country, trading classified intelligence to the Soviet Union and later Russia, in exchange for cash and diamonds. He was a whirlwind of contradictions—a self-proclaimed patriot and a traitor; a family man who sexually betrayed his wife; an ardent man of God and a sinner. Through interviews with Hanssen’s family, friends, and colleagues, CBS News Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett (Host of “The Takeout”) delves into the double life of Robert Hanssen and unravels the chilling truth about the most damaging spy in FBI history in “Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen”.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":87460260,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250ZW50LnByb2R1Y3Rpb24uY2RuLmFydDE5LmNvbS9pbWFnZXMvZTAvYzAvN2MvMjcvZTBjMDdjMjctMzFmOC00YWUwLWEyZDYtMGU4Y2Q4ZTJjYWJmLzUzYjc4NTQwNWY2M2VkMDZlNDhlMDAxNjM4MWU0NjM1MTYzNTczYzAyNmNiOGJkOGVjZTMxZjcwZDhhMDMxYmU3OTNlMzI4NTUyNjIxMjAzMmQ5YmM3ODVlZjM2NTA1NWJkN2ZjM2FlZWJmYjg4NTcxMWVhODI2MGY1MjEyYTIyLmpwZWc","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1697701854,"seedId":87460260,"seedShowId":87460260,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1288-agent-of-betrayal-the-dou","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen","url":"/podcast/1288-agent-of-betrayal-the-dou-87460260/","episodeIds":[]},"87627989":{"customLinks":[],"description":"The streets of wartime London are pitch black and the darkness offers cover to a murderer every bit as terrible as Jack the Ripper.

In 2018, a Toronto man drove a van down a busy sidewalk, killing 11 people and injuring many more. He was linked to the \"incel\" movement, a dark online world fueled by violent misogyny, extreme isolation and perceived rejection. In the wake of the attack, Evan Mead discovers a disturbing connection to the perpetrator. They were former high school classmates; both outcasts, existing together on the fringes of social acceptance. How did two young men who started in similar circumstances, end up on such drastically different paths? This five-part series examines how socially-isolated young men can vanish into an online world of nihilism and despair that radicalizes them into angry — potentially deadly — misogynists.

It tells the story of Naasón Joaquín García, a self-proclaimed apostle, who is currently behind bars after pleading guilty in June 2022 of sexually abusing girls from his congregation. Naasón is currently serving a nearly 17-year sentence, but maintains his innocence.\nHost and investigative journalist Roberta Garza explores Naasón's control over a multitude of devotees, some of whom now describe their experiences in the church as \"pure evil.\" In this true-crime series, survivors share stories about this powerful religious leader and the alleged sexual abuse that followed, many relating to minors.\nSEASON 1:\nTwo decades ago on a calm, dark Miami night, a nun was stabbed nearly 100 times on the grounds of a prestigious private academy and monastery, by student Mykhaylo Kofel. As investigators started asking questions around this Byzantine Catholic School and the gruesome murder, they found more than just her killer. In a search for answers that stretches into some of the most remote villages of Eastern Europe, they uncovered allegations of sexual abuse, secret letters to the Vatican and other mysteries of faith. Sacred Scandal unravels the fuller picture that came to light in the wake of this crime. Led by a former student, told by those who lived through the aftermath, and Kofel himself, the show pieces together a complicated narrative that, twenty years later, still has those closest to it questioning what they truly believe… including a man who’s spent half his life in prison for the crime: “It’s so unbelievable.

Hosted by Susan Simpson of the Undisclosed Podcast and Jacinda Davis of TV’s Evil Lives Here, Proof unravels the tangled and competing demands of the legal system, police practices, truth, guilt and innocence. Season 2: The second season of Proof: Murder at the Warehouse takes Susan Simpson and Jacinda Davis to Manteca, CA where they reinvestigate the murder of 18-year-old Renee Ramos. On June 5, 2000, Ramos’ body was found buried under a pile of debris inside the shell of a new Home Depot building. Despite tips hinting at alternate suspects - tips that were ignored until now - Renee’s boyfriend, 18-year-old skateboarder Jake Silva, and Ty Lopes, the 33-year-old uncle of one of Jake's close friends were arrested for her murder. The questionable testimony of a 14-year-old boy was the key evidence used to convict them both to life in prison. Twenty-three years after Renee Ramos was murdered, Jake Silva remains in prison and maintains he is innocent. In season two of Proof: MURDER AT THE WAREHOUSE, Susan and Jacinda travel the streets of Manteca, reinvestigating the case against Jake and Ty – and in the process uncover long-overlooked evidence about what really happened to Renee Season 1: In season one of Proof: RUSSIAN ROULETTE Susan Simpson and Jacinda Davis reinvestigate the murder of Brian Bowling. On an October night in 1996, a gunshot rattles the walls of a double-wide trailer on the outskirts of Rome, Georgia. 15-year-old Brian Bowling is laying on the floor of his room, head bleeding from a gunshot wound. By the next morning, Brian is dead. Investigators quickly conclude that Brian’s wound was self-inflicted, the tragic result of teenage bravado. And yet within six months, two friends are arrested and accused of plotting to kill Brian. Cain Joshua Story and Darrell Lee Clark are convicted and sentenced to life in prison. An evil teenage plot? A horrible tragic accident? Or, a blatant miscarriage of justice? In this first season of PROOF, Susan and Jacinda drive the back roads of Rome, searching for the truth.

From corrupt individuals to clandestine institutions, Cover Up exposes deceit, deception and the abuse of power. SEASON 5: The Conspiracy Tapes In the mid-1970s, a man burst onto the evangelical scene with a shocking tale: claiming to be a former witch involved in human sacrifices among elite circles. After converting to Christianity, he toured the nation warning of hidden Satanists and spoke about a secret organization known as the Illuminati. John Todd preached salvation to frightened congregations, urging them to prepare for a world takeover by stockpiling weapons and retreating to remote areas. But John Todd was no saint; he was not the good, honest Christian he claimed to be. He was running from his past. As his influence peaked and his teachings spread through countless tapes, his facade crumbled, and he vanished. Yet, his legacy endured, inspiring acts of extreme violence from Ruby Ridge, Waco, PizzaGate, QAnon right through to the steps of the Capitol on January 6th. SEASON 4: The Anthrax Threat In the wake of 9/11, a series of letters laced with a deadly powder called anthrax appeared on the desks of prominent journalists and politicians in New York City and Washington D.C. Five people were killed, and seventeen more were infected. It was the worst case of bioterrorism in American history, setting off a surge of finger pointing, xenophobia, and fear. But what started as an unprecedented case soon turned into an unsettling mystery. Who had sent these letters? And why? On season 4 of Cover Up, we trace the FBI’s costly investigation into the attacks, which was stacked with a seemingly endless series of false leads, damaging leaks, and embarrassing blunders. Through revealing interviews with victims, agents, and suspects, we unpack the case in its messy entirety, all with an eye toward the question that remains today: Did the FBI identify the true killer, or is this case still unresolved? From Campside Media and Sony Music Entertainment, this is Season 4 of Cover Up: The Anthrax Threat. SEASON 3: Body Brokers For eight years, Megan Hess ran Sunset Mesa Funeral Home in the small town of Montrose, Colorado. She promised clients discounts on normally expensive cremations, a seeming kindness in a town where many are poor. But in the back of the funeral home, Megan’s elderly mother Shirley was actually dismembering the dead. And then Megan was selling the body parts – heads, torsos, legs – to companies that claim to do medical research. Megan and Shirley were body brokers, trading on a dark network where people buy and sell bodies. What exactly were the two women after? Who was really buying those stolen bodies, and why? SEASON 2: The Pill Plot Back in the ‘90s, a ragtag group plotted an international drug smuggling scheme and set up a secretive lab to cook up tablets. But they weren’t trafficking narcotics—they were fighting to bring the abortion pill America. This season will take you inside the epic struggle facing activists who battled presidents, the Supreme Court, militant anti-abortionists, would-be assassins and murders. SEASON 1: The Ministry of Secrets Season one uncovers the story of The Ministry of Secrets, one of the great unsolved mysteries of the Cold War. At its heart is a missing person — a wartime hero and international celebrity. But that’s just the starting point. It involves the royal family, MI6, the CIA and the KGB. There’s conspiracies. And lies. This story is so sensitive, so secret - that the truth is being withheld for 100 years, until 2057.

Over the course of 12 episodes, Kramer unravels this mystery, searching for proof of explosive allegations against Burton and a possible cover-up at one of the nation’s leading crime labs.

Hardy was shot behind the Crown Sterling Suites hotel in Birmingham, Alabama. At the same time as the murder, at least ten people saw Toforest Johnson four miles away, at a popular nightclub called Tee's Place. But detectives zeroed in on him as a main suspect in Deputy Hardy’s murder anyway, ultimately resulting in Toforest being tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. For over a quarter century, Toforest has been confined to a 5’ by 8’ cell on Alabama’s death row.\nIn 2019, investigative journalist Beth Shelburne began covering the case, going down a disturbing rabbit hole revealing many unsettling facts that cast grave doubts about Toforest’s guilt. The facts she found tear at the very foundation of the American criminal justice system: No eyewitnesses or physical evidence tied Toforest to the murder; the state tried to convict a different man for the same crime; and perhaps most disturbing of all, Toforest’s conviction relied on an ‘earwitness’ – a woman who claimed to have eavesdropped on an incriminating phone call, a woman whom prosecutors paid for her testimony, in secret. That payment was not disclosed to the jury, Toforest, or his lawyers until after he had been on death row for 17 years.\nFrom the team behind the award-winning hit podcast Bone Valley, Lava for Good’s Earwitness is an 8-episode docuseries that asks the question, “How did an innocent man end up on death row — and why is the state still trying to execute him over the objection of the prosecutor who put him there?” Shelburne’s unprecedented access to key players—the lead detective, lead prosecutor, witnesses, jurors, and the earwitness herself— illuminate a story filled with disturbing twists, frustrating ambiguities, and shocking admissions. The story of Toforest Johnson and the state's enthusiasm for the death penalty in the face of such troubling evidentiary flaws brings to light the failings of a criminal justice system run amok.\nEarwitness is available every Tuesday wherever you get your podcasts.

Sarah and Jacob have never been found. After disappearing for several days, Catherine was arrested and ultimately charged with the children’s murder. Catherine was declared not competent to stand trial shortly after and has been committed to a psychiatric facility until her competency can be restored.\nBut plenty of people - including some of Catherine’s own family members - have suggested she’s faking incompetence, convinced it’s her path out of prison.\nSarah and Jacob’s dad, Troy, and his wife, Stephanie, continue to search for the kids, desperate for both answers and justice. And now, the clock is ticking. Maryland law requires dismissal of murder charges against a defendant found incompetent to stand trial after the expiration of five years. This means that Catherine could be on the verge of release. Troy, Stephanie and their lawyer, Matt—along with police and prosecutors—are racing to stop that from happening.\nIn addition to a compelling and tragic personal narrative, this case raises broader issues about mental health and the justice system and the unintended consequences of well-intentioned laws. Journalists Sarah Treleaven and Beth Karas examine a father’s quest for justice and one key question that overshadows this case: Can you really fake being incompetent and get away with murder?","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":124203513,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzgxNGFkMjE5LTQxOWYtNDNiZS1hNjljLWIwNjYwMGY1ZGU4OC9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjk0MDI3MzA5JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1706647985,"seedId":124203513,"seedShowId":124203513,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1119-unrestorable","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Unrestorable","url":"/podcast/1119-unrestorable-124203513/","episodeIds":[]},"124403314":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Wisconsin is no stranger to high-profile cases and horrific murderers, from the notorious Jeffrey Dahmer to the perplexing Ed Gein.

Scarcella was a legendary figure in New York City during the '90s. In a city overrun with violent crime, he cracked the toughest cases and put away the worst criminals. But the story changed when a group of convicted murderers-turned-jailhouse lawyers made a startling discovery that linked all their cases: Scarcella was the cop who helped put many of them away. They made a vow: Take down Scarcella. And with the help of a relentless New York Times reporter, they did just that. Thirty years later, 20 people who Scarcella helped put behind bars have since walked free. In the media, he’s known as the disgraced, rogue cop who hoodwinked an entire system. But was this really the workings of one person? \nWe spent hundreds of hours talking with witnesses who were coerced, jailhouse lawyers, outraged attorneys, and righteous cops. Scarcella insists he didn’t do anything wrong. And after finally tracking him down, he agreed to take us into the belly of the beast... where justice is done (and undone). Welcome to The Burden. \nThe Burden is a production of Orbit Media in association with Signal Co.

How did you find your way to Condé Nast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI developed my career within the start-up-scene, worked with dynamic cross functional teams and cultivated a deep passion for digital media and growth. At Condé Nast, I recognized significant potential for expanding our digital audiences, prompting my transition from the Editorial team to Audience Development.

In response, we strategized an alternative user journey aimed at retaining and engaging users, thereby attracting our B2B clients eager to connect with the GLAMOUR audience. Recognizing the successes of the German market on social media, in editorial and digital commerce, we made a strategic decision to leverage TikTok as a substitute platform for the GLAMOUR App. Our objective was to showcase our clients' shopping codes to a fashion-forward and shopping-oriented audience. Through repurposing TikTok video galleries, we successfully generated buzz for our partners' offers, resulting in over 78 million impressions on our ads and 100,000 page views on our TikTok Shopping Hubs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn what way does the new concept fit GLAMOUR as a brand? / Which benefits does the new concept bring for GLAMOUR\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGLAMOUR holds a special place in the hearts of consumers as a beloved brand they trust and associate positively with.

How did you find your way to Condé Nast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI’m the head of editorial for British Vogue and have been at Condé for almost 14 years. Prior to that, I was working in indie publishing, first at a magazine called Trace, then at the Fader. I honestly wasn’t sure Condé would be the right fit for me initially. But a friend connected me to Sally Singer who was at Vogue at the time.

It all came into sharp focus for me maybe because I’d been away from the UK for 20 years. The bigger question I kept coming back to from a fashion perspective was this idea of the modern British eccentric and what that means now. I think twigs embodies that spirit quite perfectly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat has surprised you most about being back in the British fashion scene?

So much of what I like to wear every day is by British designers or creative directors, the likes of Martine Rose, Wales Bonner, Simone Rocha, and Molly Goddard. I think it’s changed enormously over the years. In fact, it’s been so encouraging to see a new generation coming up more recently. Supriya Lele and Jawara Alleyene are two designers I’m particularly excited about. Both of their brands are featured in the cover story on FKA twigs.

I’d add to that, we also used to take more of a try-anything approach, do random, fun, crazy stunts. WIRED used to do a segment called “Most Dangerous Object in the Office.” Some of those old videos are hilarious. “Almost Impossible” was another. And Angry Nerd. I do miss some of those.

Being able to simply read any Andy Greenberg feature is a joy. I mean, his most recent—the full, exclusive story of the internet-crashing Mirai hack—was so, so good. Lauren Goode wrote a personal piece a few years ago about digital “photo memories” and how they can keep opening wounds. I hold that story up as an example to other writers. Lauren figured out the tech origins of photo memories, and then she went to the companies who built them to ask how, or if, they think about the downsides. It was a deft combination of a personal story that illuminated the human consequences of unthinking product development. Add to that, I’ve been able to work on super fun Jason Kehe, Jason Parham, Virginia Heffernan columns and stories. I just love seeing staff writers shine at features. And a great rough draft from a talented freelancer.

We'll share throwback photos of some of the most viral moments from past Men of the Year parties to build anticipation in the week leading up to the event on Instagram and TikTok, and then devote the first half of the week to rolling out our cover stories across all platforms.

One thing we focused on this year was really fleshing out our target audience profiles. We have managed to attract a core audience of young people who are passionate about style culture, and who have a genuine interest in the brands we invited to participate. One of the most intriguing takeaways was that, while this year’s attendees were generally younger than the people who came last year, they also had more purchasing power.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis year’s event saw double the sponsorship and triple ticket sales in comparison to its inaugural year.

Last year was about making a splash in the market, and this year we were able to gather even more accurate data about our target audience.

So every time we plan different projects, there’s ample room for letting our imaginations fly and coming up with new ideas.

As the project manager, although there are lots of details that need my attention, it’s even more important to make sure everyone is communicating and pulling in the same direction.

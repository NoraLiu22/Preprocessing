In particular, it is not shared with advertisers or with the third-party advertising networks that we work with other than in highly aggregated form so that your personal data cannot be identified.</p><p><b>3.1.1 The data we collect and what we do with it</b></p><p>The data we use for this purpose is as follows:</p><ul><li>The page you view, and associated information such as how long you spend on them.</li><li>Your approximate location, to city or town level.</li><li>Your email address, name and sometimes username and postcode, which we will receive when you sign up for an account on one or more of our websites or apps, when you subscribe to our newsletters or marketing, when you enter one of our competitions or when you complete one of our surveys.</li><li>The newsletters and marketing you have subscribed to, the promotions and competitions you have entered and the surveys you have completed.</li></ul><p>We will analyse this information to infer interests, preferences, and demographic characteristics, and associate it with an internal identification number. For example, if our website analytics tell us that you are located in the approximate area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and you read our online title ChronicleLive (which is focused on local news for that area), and you sign up to receive an email newsletter about football from our national title The Mirror, then we could infer from that you are interested in things related to a local football club or to football generally.</p><p>We then divide up our identification numbers into groups based on the inferences we draw about them. Those groups are called &ldquo;audience segments&rdquo; or &ldquo;audiences&rdquo;. So, for example, an identifier associated with Newcastle, ChronicleLive and the football newsletter could be allocated to audiences likely to be interested in football, and events near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p><p>We then use those &ldquo;audiences&rdquo; to do two things: first, to help us to recommend content which is more likely to be interesting (for instance, more articles about football), and second to help us to target advertisements when advertisers buy advertising space from us directly.</p><p>The advertiser would never see the actual data that we use &ndash; it remains with Reach at all times. All we would share with them would be the criteria we used to target their advert, how many times their advert was shown and how many people clicked on it (but not who), so that they know how well the advert did and we know how much to charge them.</p><p><b>3.1.2 Our legal basis</b></p><p>Your activity on our websites and in our apps can be managed by you using our &ldquo;cookie banner&rdquo; and related Consent Management Platform (CMP). The vast majority are used on the basis of your consent where you provide it. Some may use our Legitimate Interest and some are Essential &ndash; Please see our <a href="/cookie-policy/">Cookie Notice</a> for further information or the &lsquo;cog&rsquo; icon or link at the bottom of every webpage to manage your consents. When using our apps, if you want to change the settings, go to the &lsquo;My Account&rsquo; Link at the bottom of the screen which includes &lsquo;My Privacy&rsquo; and takes you to the CMP.</p><p>We combine that information with the other things we know about you (like your newsletter subscriptions) on the basis of our legitimate interest in understanding our readership, both to serve you better and to make us more attractive to advertisers. This helps us to secure a future for news reporting and journalism in the age of social media, especially local news reporting and journalism.</p><p>You do, of course, have an absolute right to object to this. You can always register your objection by completing the relevant form [<a href="#rightoobjectdata">15.5. Your right to object to what we do with your data, and to have restrictions placed upon it</a>].</p><p><b>3.1.3 How long we keep it for</b></p><p>We keep the information about your activity on our websites and in our apps for up to up to three years since last browsing activity, with some anonymised browsing activity retained thereafter.</p><p><b>3.1.4 Who we share it with and why</b></p><p>The data which we use to create the unique identifier and our &ldquo;audiences&rdquo; is shared with the partners who provide us with the technology powering it, most notably Upland Software and Lotame, who host core data management platforms for us. They act as our &ldquo;processors&rdquo;. This means that they are bound by law and contract to do only what we tell them to do with the data, to keep it safe, and not to share it with anyone else or use it for anything other than providing their service to us.</p><p><b>3.1.5 Whether we send it outside the country of collection</b></p><p>Upland Software and Lotame are global businesses and so the data they host for us may be held outside of the country of collection. We have implemented the required safeguards as necessary (for example, standard agreements and frameworks approved by the relevant authorities).</p><p><b><a name="targeting3rd" id="targeting3rd"></a>3.2 Targeting by third party advertising networks</b></p><p>Digital advertising helps us to fund the news articles and content published on our sites and enables us to provide some of our content for free. We and our third-party ad partners may display digital advertising on our sites that is tailored to your interests and preferences so the online adverts you see are more relevant to you. We work with third party ad networks to fill unsold advertising space on our sites and in our apps by auctioning it automatically through a process called &ldquo;real time bidding&rdquo;. These ad networks bid to show their ad to you when you visit our sites or use our apps.</p><p>The ad networks exchange information through cookies, which allow them to recognise you when you visit any site that they work with (not just Reach sites). Where we use cookies on our sites for advertising purposes, we ask for prior consent. The cookie information will be used along with other information we hold about you to display digital advertising that is more relevant to you. It is important to note, however, that where you do not provide your consent for digital advertising you will still see digital advertising on our sites, but this will not be tailored to your interests and preferences.</p><p>Where you provide consent to using your data to create a profile for digital advertising we may also sell or share limited data types to our partners with whom we have a legally binding relationship for similar purposes; typically data on the page content which you have shown an interest in and online identifiers, not direct identifiers such as your email address. Captify is one such partner. They may act as an independent controller of your data, and their privacy policy is shown here: <a href="https://www.captifytechnologies.com/privacy-notice/">Captify Privacy Policy</a></p><p><b>3.2.1 The data collected and how it is used</b></p><p>On your first visit to one of our sites or apps (and on other occasions to allow you to change your mind), you will be presented with a &rdquo;cookie banner&rdquo;. This asks you if you consent to the use of cookies and related technologies for the purposes of, amongst other things, selecting and delivering ads. If you do, then the ad networks will be able to recognise your device according to a unique identification number.</p><p>We then send out a &ldquo;bid request&rdquo; to the advertising networks we work with. What that bid request says is, essentially, &rdquo;ID number ABC123 has landed on our website, do you want to show this user an advert?&rdquo; The winner then gets to display their ad.</p><p>The auction process happens automatically, in the second or so between you requesting the page and its loading and displaying. The data used by the ad networks to select the ad to show is held by them, not us, and we never see it.</p><p>If we sell or share limited data to an ad partner, as described in 3.2, it will be used for profiling and digital marketing on Reach websites and apps, and potentially other sites &amp; apps with whom the partner has a relationship, if you have given permission for that site or app to do so.</p><p>An important point to understand is that most of these ad networks will not know who you are in a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; sense. They will not know your name, or your email address, or your phone number (we may know those things because you&rsquo;ve given them to us in other contexts, but we never share that information with them).</p><p>We say &ldquo;most&rdquo; because there are two significant exceptions, which are Facebook and Google. They provide targeted advertising services based on the things they know about their users, and so if you are signed into your account with them on your device, they will be able to recognise you and associate your browsing history across sites that use their services.</p><p><b><a name="datamatching" id="datamatching"></a>Data Matching</b></p><p>From time to time we may allow our clients to compare their customer database to ours using partner platforms such as InfoSum. This is called data matching and allows our partners to see if they can reach their audiences on our platforms and to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.</p><p>Generally this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights. For example, this could involve matching your hashed, pseudonymised email data with the same data held by our advertising clients. This then enables the advertiser to understand if you use their products and visit our sites, then to use this data to target bespoke advertising messages.</p><p>Alternatively, we may allow advertising partners to build target audiences based on predefined attributes. These &lsquo;lookalike&rsquo; audiences may be similar to our partners&rsquo; existing audiences. For example, a sports brand may want to reach &lsquo;football enthusiasts&rsquo;. They could select audiences who have been identified as having an interest in these areas. To do this, we segment our audiences into groups depending on what we think they like or other behaviours. This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.</p><p>The way we match your data could also involve working with partners such as LiveRamp Inc and Tradedesk and their group companies, acting as joint controllers. These partners use this information to create a secure online identification code for the purpose of recognising you for cross-channel advertising. This code is placed in our cookie, does not contain any of your identifiable personal data, and will not be used by them to identify you. It may be shared with our advertising partners and other third-party advertisers globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content or targeted advertising through Reach sites. These third parties may in turn use this code to link demographic or interest-based information you have provided in your interactions with them to the pseudonymised code. Detailed information on LiveRamp&rsquo;s data processing activities is available in LiveRamp&rsquo;s privacy notice and opt-out here <a href="https://liveramp.uk/privacy/service-privacy-policy/">LiveRamp</a>. Information on the Trade Desk&rsquo;s use and how they work with partners can be found here <a href="https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy">EUID Privacy Notice</a>. Alternatively to withdraw consent and object to targeted advertising based on the Trade Desk EUID activity click <a href="https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/">here</a>.</p><p>If you accept the use of cookies in our Consent Management Platform, when you submit your email address to create an account or sign-up to a newsletter or marketing we may share your email address in a hashed form with Amazon Publisher Services (APS). APS then links the hashed email to a profile which they may already hold related to that address. The hashed email will be used in a secure, pseudonymised form within a cookie to flag to APS whenever you visit an APS enabled Reach website again. APS will use this to determine, in real-time, if any of their business customers want to market to a profile similar to yours. If this is the case they may initiate an advert which will appear to you on the Reach website concerned. The APS Privacy Notice can be found at <a href="https://aps.amazon.com/aps/privacy-policy/">APS PN</a>.</p><p><b>Withdrawing consent</b></p><p>You have the right to withdraw your consent or opt-out to the processing of your personal data at any time via our Cookie Management Platform accessed via the &lsquo;cog&rsquo; icon or link at the bottom of every webpage. For example, we will only match your hashed, pseudonymised email with an advertiser in the Infosum platform, if you have consented to your data being used by our adtech provider Lotame. We will also only work with partners such as LiveRamp, as described above, if you have accepted cookies in our Consent Management Platform.</p><p>Alternatively, if you would like to stop your email being used in this way please email dataprotection@reachplc.com, stating &lsquo;opt out of hashed email&rsquo;.</p><p><b>3.2.2 Our legal basis</b></p><p>Where required by applicable law advertising networks undertake this activity on the basis of your consent, which we ask for on their behalf through the &lsquo;cookie banner&rsquo; which appears when you first visit our site. The &lsquo;cookie banner&rsquo; message box will reappear from time to time in case you change your mind, or when something changes (typically every 30 days). Please see our <a href="/cookie-policy/">Cookie Notice</a> for further information or the &lsquo;cog&rsquo; icon or link at the bottom of every webpage to manage your consents. When using our apps, if you want to change the settings, go to the &lsquo;My Account&rsquo; Link at the bottom of the screen which includes &lsquo;My Privacy&rsquo; and takes you to the CMP.</p><p>Most of our third-party advertising partners operate within an industry framework and code of practice issued by the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) called the &ldquo;Transparency and Consent Framework&rdquo;, which sets out the technical means for your choices to be passed through the ad networks. It also requires that members adhere to IAB policies and standards of behaviour.</p><p>Advertising partners who do not work within the IAB framework are listed separately in the platform which can be viewed in our Consent Management Platform (CMP) &ndash; please see our <a href="/cookie-policy/">Cookie Notice</a> for further information or click on the &lsquo;cog&rsquo; icon or link at the bottom of every webpage. In the Consent Management Platform popup go to the &lsquo;Partners&rsquo; page and scroll down - IAB partners are listed first, then you'll see Non-IAB vendors and finally Google partners.</p><p><b>3.2.3 How long we keep it for</b></p><p>We do not ourselves hold a copy of the data gathered by the advertising networks. They will each have their own retention policies which you can find in their privacy notices linked through our &lsquo;cookie banner&rsquo; &ndash; these are often short (between 30 and 60 days), because shopping interests change over time.</p><p><b>3.2.4 Who we share it with and why</b></p><p>When we participate in auctions for unsold advertising space, we send bid requests to third party advertising networks. You can find the list of third-party advertising networks who we work with by clicking on the &lsquo;cog&rsquo; icon or link at the bottom of every webpage and reviewing our Consent Management Platform.</p><p><b>3.2.5 Whether we send it outside the country of collection</b></p><p>The digital advertising networks are global in nature and so, while we are predominantly a UK business, this data will travel across international borders, and in particular many automated advertising transactions will be processed in the USA. Where we are the ones making the transfer (typically, we are not), we have implemented the required safeguards as necessary (for example, standard agreements and frameworks approved by the relevant authorities).</p><p><b><a name="sitesapps" id="sitesapps"></a>3.3 Making our sites and apps work properly, and understanding how they are used</b></p><p>We use the information logged by our servers and certain third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mpulse and Hotjar) to help us to spot problems with our digital services, such as page errors or slow loading times, as well as understanding usage patterns and watching for security problems. This may include statistical and analytical data about your visits and activity on our sites, such as the pages you view, how long for, and which links are followed. This helps us to improve the way we deliver content and the products and services offered to you. We also use this data to report on our performance, provide audience insights and measurement, and to sell advertising.</p><p>We may also collect information from your devices that tells us whether you are using an ad blocker. This is so that we can manage our compliance with the law and also determine if we are able to show you advertising. We may also ask you to suspend or whitelist our sites or platforms so that we can show you adverts.</p><p>You can find more information below.</p><p><b>3.3.1 The data we collect and what we do with it</b></p><p>We gather data for this purpose in three ways.</p><p>Firstly, our servers record certain information provided by your devices when they request content, consisting mostly of technical information about your device such as language, screen size and the features and functions it supports, but also including the internet or &ldquo;IP&rdquo; address from which it is connecting, and the page or data requested. The data is used for system performance, content delivery and security purposes. It is saved together with the dates and times the requests occurred into files stored on our servers called &ldquo;logs&rdquo; or &ldquo;log files&rdquo;.</p><p>Secondly, on your first visit to one of our sites or apps (and every so often again after your first visit), you will be presented with a &rsquo;cookie banner&rsquo; asking you if you consent to the use of cookies and related technologies for our use of analytics. If you do, then several &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; (small text files) will be stored on your device containing identification numbers. Those numbers can then be read on your subsequent visits to recognise your device, and our analytics providers will use that information to provide us with various reports and metrics on how our sites are used. Google also uses the data that it gathers as a result for other purposes, which you can read about in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>. If you wish to opt-out of the use of Google Analytics you can access and download the Opt-out browser add-on from here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">GA Opt-Out</a></p><p>Thirdly, we also work with the analytics provider Amplitude, who collect measurement data on our behalf, as our processor. They collect this data for us, using their cookie, and only process your data with your consent.

By default, most email programs don&rsquo;t load remote images automatically, but only when you click on the button or link in the program to &ldquo;show images&rdquo; (or similar wording). When you do that, the images linked in the email are downloaded from our technology provider&rsquo;s server so they can be displayed in your email program.</p><p>If the images are downloaded, our technology provider can tell us that you opened the email.</p><p>Secondly, the links in our emails to articles and other external content are personalised, such that if you click through to the content using the link in our email, we will know that it was you who clicked it (or at least, someone reading the email we sent to you). This is because we use web beacons in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns. Our web beacons don&rsquo;t store any information on your computer but, by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can help us to understand how you engage with our emails.</p><p><b>6.2.2 Our legal basis</b></p><p>We record the opening of emails on the basis of your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time either by configuring your email client not to load images, or by unsubscribing from the relevant email.</p><p>We use the personalised URLs for links to external content on the basis of our legitimate interest in understanding how you engage with our emails and which kinds of content are of most interest to you.

For example, if a majority of survey respondents express a preference for one TV show over another, then we might write an entertainment piece based on that or factor it in when deciding which adverts appear where.</p><p>We may also run some surveys for which we utilise your declared responses to build into our profile about you. When we do so, this will be communicated in the associated text, and you will be asked to either consent to this use or will be given the option to &lsquo;object&rsquo; via a tick box.</p><p>Occasionally, those surveys might ask you about things which the law considers to be especially sensitive, such as your voting intentions or your religious beliefs. Where that&rsquo;s the case, we&rsquo;ll ask clearly for your permission first, and we&rsquo;ll always provide a &ldquo;prefer not to say&rdquo; or similar option. We don&rsquo;t use that kind of information for advertising purposes.</p><p><b>8.1 The data we collect and what we do with it</b></p><p>The types of information we collect and process about you when you take part in a survey may include:</p><ul><li>Personal and contact details you have provided to us, such as your name, email address or postal address</li><li>Demographic information such as date of birth, gender, work occupation, ethnicity and readership habits.</li><li>Attitudinal, behavioural or purchase information shared within our surveys or forums.</li><li>Information about your use of third party products or services or from third parties who we may use to operate certain aspects of our business.</li><li>We may also collect information from cookies on your devices and this includes information about your IP address, MAC address and other identifying information, information about your devices, including your location, from third party advertising networks and how you use our products and services.</li></ul><p>We will collect your answers to the survey questions and use them to compile anonymous statistics along the lines of &ldquo;35% of people preferred X over Y&rdquo;. Some surveys may also ask for your email address, for example if we are offering entry into a prize draw for completing it. Go <a href="#whenenter">here</a> to learn more about how we use your data for prize draws. As highlighted above, we may also retain your responses as part of a profile about you.</p><p>When you have completed a survey, you may be invited to subscribe to a newsletter or to receive special offers and promotions from us.</p><p>Sometimes we may operate &ldquo;panels&rdquo; of people who we send survey questions to periodically. If you join one of those panels then there may be additional kinds of information about you which we will receive, in which case we will provide further information to you before you sign up to the panel.</p><p><b>8.2 Our legal basis</b></p><p>We collect and compile your survey answers on the basis of your consent, which we ask for in each survey. Use of your declared data for profiling purposes will be based either upon consent (via tick box) or our legitimate interest, for which you will be given the option to &lsquo;object&rsquo;.</p><p><b>8.3 How long we keep it for</b></p><p>We retain your survey responses for however long the survey runs for, and for up to 90 days afterwards. If you participated in our research panel we may keep your data for up to a year, for the purposes of insight and tracking responses over time.</p><p>The resulting statistics may be kept longer, but those are always anonymous and don&rsquo;t contain your personal data. Data utilised for profiling will be retained for up to 3 years.</p><p><b>8.4 Who we share it with and why</b></p><p>We typically publish the overall results of our surveys, and often share those results with the brands involved (if any), but those results are always anonymous and statistical in nature (&ldquo;50% of respondents thought X&rdquo;) and don&rsquo;t contain your personal data. Actual survey responses are only shared with the service providers who provide us with the technology powering our systems. They act as our &ldquo;processors&rdquo;, meaning that they are bound by law and contract to keep your data safe, and to do only what we tell them to do with it.</p><p>Once we&rsquo;ve gathered your survey responses, we will combine them with the answers from other respondents and turn them into valuable insights which may be shared with third parties. Unless specifically stated at the start of the research activity and with your explicit permission, this information will only be disclosed to third parties in anonymised or aggregated form, stripped of any identifiable data (example forms of anonymised / aggregate data include: &ldquo;X% of males from Birmingham agree that&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;a 35 year male from Birmingham said &hellip;&rdquo;)</p><p>Please be aware that if you disclose information on forums it may be possible for other research participants to use this information. We are not responsible for the disclosure of any information you post in this way.</p><p><b>8.5 Whether we send it outside the country of collection</b></p><p>Our online form technology providers may process your personal data outside of the UK and EEA. We have implemented safeguards to secure and limit the processing of the data, including standard agreements and frameworks approved by the relevant authorities.</p><p><strong><a href="#contents">*** Click here to go back to &lsquo;Contents&rsquo; ***</a></strong></p><h2><a id="whenyousubprintdgi"></a>9.

This includes:</p><ul><li>helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;</li><li>understanding how our services or theirs are used;</li><li>promoting safety, security and integrity across the Reach Group e.g. securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;</li><li>performing analytics and analysis of how you interact with the group&rsquo;s products and services, to facilitate business efficiencies and develop products and services that would be relevant to you; and</li><li>sharing information to deliver more relevant advertising from across the Reach Group network.</li></ul><p>In addition, a key way we share data across systems and Group companies is for advertising and targeting purposes. This can be based on your online behaviour on our sites, for example:</p><ul><li>When you go onto one of our sites we can track your behaviour on those sites, or any of our other sites across our Group companies, and use this to target advertising or email content to you. For example, if you use our ecommerce site yimbly.com, we can see if you later visited one of our other sites and you may see advertising for the products you looked at based on this. If you would prefer to opt out, you can do so via the consent management pop-up.</li><li>This also applies if you open an email from us and this takes you online as we can use the information from your online behaviour to later target marketing to you. So for example if you subscribe to marketing emails on one of our regional news sites and we see you looked at sporting content on our other sites we may provide you with sport related content in your marketing emails from the regional news site. You can unsubscribe from emails at any time.</li><li>We may also upload emails (in hashed, pseudonymous form) straight to the advertising data system and this enables us to identify the same non-identifiable user across devices. So we know, for example, that the person who looks at Reach lifestyle content on their phone and then Reach fashion content on their desktop, is in fact the same non-identified person. You can unsubscribe from emails at any time.</li><li>We may also use the other data you have provided to us, combined with your online behaviour, to personalise your email campaigns. For example, if you signed up an account when browsing &lsquo;football&rsquo; content on our news sites, we may classify you as a &lsquo;football intender&rsquo;. Later when you go online we may see you are also interested in content on films and classify you as a &lsquo;football and films intender&rsquo;. As a result you may see advertising content related to football and films, when you visit our sites.</li></ul><p><b><a name="12transfer" id="12transfer"></a>12.10 Transfer as part of the sale of our business</b></p><p>If we sell part or all of our business, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets.

In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. We also require any third parties to whom we may transfer personal data to have appropriate security measures in place. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p><p>Our websites may permit you to create an account, or have the facility for an account to be created on your behalf. When this happens, you may be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorised by you. You should notify us of any unauthorised use of your password or account. In the unlikely event of a breach we will notify the affected individuals in a timely manner, as required by law. If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@reachpc.com">dataprotection@reachpc.com</a>, or if you are in the US email <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@reachplc.com">privacyofficer@reachplc.com</a> stating which state you are a resident of.</p><p><b>13.2 Reason for keeping it</b></p><p>We hold personal data for a variety of different purposes and the length of time we keep your data will vary depending on the services or products we are providing our customers with.</p><p>We will only keep your data for a reasonable period of time, which is based on the purpose for which we are using your data. For example, we review our marketing contact lists and delete those contacts where there has been no activity for three years. In addition, by law, for tax and other purposes, we may have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for seven years after they cease being customers. We may also need to keep information to evidence a contract or prevent fraud.</p><p>Once the purpose has been fulfilled, we will securely delete that data or anonymise your information (so that we, or anyone else, can no longer tell that data relates to you) unless we are required to retain the data longer for legal, tax or accounting reasons.</p><p><b>13.3 Countries we may transfer your data to</b></p><p>When you provide information to us, we may transfer your personal information to our group companies and processors who are based in a country other than your country of residence. For example, if you are a UK citizen you may find your data is processed by a supplier or service based outside the UK or EEA, such as in the United States. If such a transfer requires us to apply additional safeguards to your personal information under, for example, UK or European data protection laws, we will do so.</p><p>These steps may include implementing the UK&rsquo;s International Data Transfer Agreement clauses or European Commission&rsquo;s Standard Contractual Clauses, with additional UK-specific clauses for transfers of personal information to our service providers and business partners. Alternatively we will ensure the third parties we work with will offer an adequate level of protection by meeting the legally agreed requirements of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and the UK extension, as appropriate.</p><p>To the extent applicable, we may rely on derogations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR for the transfer and onward transfer of personal information collected from individuals in the UK or EEA to the United States, and other countries that the EU views as not providing adequate data protection. Specifically, we may transfer such information to another party in accordance with our lawful basis for processing.</p><p>By using our website, products or services or by interacting with us in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information outside your country of residence, including out of the EEA, in the circumstances set out in this Privacy Notice.

However, the term "sell" has a broader meaning under the CCPA/CPRA than would ordinarily be understood in a non-legal context. If we &ldquo;sell&rdquo; your Personal Information, you can opt-out. In addition, if you direct us not to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shine the Light'' law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Sharing: </b> We do &ldquo;share&rdquo; your Personal Information, as defined, with trusted business partners to deliver interest-based ads, content and services to you, including for site measurement.

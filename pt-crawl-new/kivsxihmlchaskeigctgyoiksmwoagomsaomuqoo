If the lead single “My City’s On Fire'' galvanized the initial inferno, then consider “Der Aufstand” his invitation to grab a torch and catch a flame, to \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://jimijules.bandcamp.com/track/der-aufstand-1\"\u003e“fight for the fragile and riot for the righteous.”\u003c/a\u003e Defiance abetted by escalating staccato synths and square bass, it’s a banger that keeps its fists clenched. — \u003ci\u003eSalvatore Maicki\u003c/i\u003e 50. Jimi Jules, “Der Aufstand”                  “jealousy” is a song that leaks into the subconscious, slowly re-tuning one’s brain until it matches its mesmerizing frequency. Compared to other tracks off \u003ci\u003eCAPRISONGS\u003c/i\u003e, twigs’ foray into capital-P pop, is one of the more straightforward, but its slinky, swaying groove has a mysterious power, converting it into the type of rhythm that lives in your head rent-free. Thankfully, twigs is more than welcome to stay, wrapping the instrumental in radiant falsetto and angelic background vocals that make the track worthy of obsession. “I'm living true / Knowing that I'm better off without your blue,” she scoffs in a disarming send-off. You don’t realize how deep the knife is until you look down. — \u003ci\u003eBrandon Callender\u003c/i\u003e 49. FKA twigs feat. Rema, “jealousy”                  For obvious reasons, the summers of 2020 and 2021 were both duds. Maybe that’s why 2022’s edition held an unbridled hedonism, with the joyful allure of dancing with friends and feeling yourself saturating everything. The soundtrack to this urge? “B.O.T.A. (Baddest Of Them All).” A collaboration between Manchester producer Interplanetary Criminal and London polymath DJ Eliza Rose, it borders on trashy Eurodance in the best possible way. With its shiny beats and sweet vocals, this gleaming banger became the UK’s inescapable party song of the year. Inspired by the energy of the titular character from the 1973 Blaxploitation film \u003ci\u003eCoffy\u003c/i\u003e, “B.O.T.A.” struts playfully, confidently, teeming with delicious heat. — \u003ci\u003eTara Joshi\u003c/i\u003e 48. Eliza Rose, “B.O.T.A.”                  Over looping, pentatonic riffs (a rarity in Western music; you’d sooner hear them in West Africa), Sudan Archives sounds like a snake-charmer on “NBPQ (Topless),\" rattling effortlessly between cool, puckish pizzicatos, tightly rapped bars, and a sweltry decrescendo. These masterful stylistic pivots drive her point home: “I’m not average / Average / Average,” she sings on the chorus — something, you realize by the song’s end, is a severe understatement. — \u003ci\u003eEmma Madden\u003c/i\u003e\n 47. Sudan Archives, “NBPQ (Topless)”                   46. Alex G, “Runner”            No matter how sunny a given Alex G song sounds, there’s a good chance it’s hiding a dark streak. Clouded by guilt, the grimness of reality, and the ghosts of the past, his moving character studies reveal a Lynchian appreciation of the sinister undercurrents lurking under life’s mundanity. “Runner” is one of his best tracks in this mode, opening with gentle acoustic guitar arrangements that recall both AM Radio Gold and the cheery, plasticine guitar pop that ruled the charts around the turn of the millennium. Still, he sings of morality, cruelty, and a deep intimacy with the mechanisms of violence. His cheerful refrain is that he’s “done a couple bad things,” an admission with distressingly little detail. It’s a delightfully grim testimony, delivered with a smile that never cracks. — \u003ci\u003eColin Joyce\u003c/i\u003e\n      The blockbuster breakbeat climax of London producer and DJ TSHA’s debut album \u003ci\u003eCapricorn Sun\u003c/i\u003e exists on the cliffside precipice between love and anguish. Written with her partner Mafro (who lends his pliant vocals to the track) amid a particularly fraught time for the couple during lockdown, “Giving Up” orbits around the idea of throwing hands in the air, quickly accumulating enough kinetic energy to obliterate it entirely. Holding on wins this round. — \u003ci\u003eSM\u003c/i\u003e 45. TSHA feat. Mafro, “Giving Up”                  “Poland,” which leaked online in October and went viral almost instantly, is proof that Lil Yachty is at his best when he’s having fun. This is an 80-second throwaway about cough syrup inspired by a plastic bottle of water, and it allegedly earned Yachty a personal invite to Poland from Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Its 8-bit production and Yachty’s uneasy warble only render it more absurd. The exuberant Lil Yachty is one of the few rappers out there who could leak something so silly and leave his audience demanding more. — \u003ci\u003eARR\u003c/i\u003e\n 44. Lil Yachty, “Poland”                  A John Cale-Weyes Blood team up is, for this writer, as close as musical collaboration can come to its platonic ideal. “STORY OF BLOOD” is Cale’s song first and foremost, but Natalie Mering’s presence can be felt in the track’s bones before she even enters. Over an instrumental that would feel almost devotional save for its synthesized trap drum beat and occasional ‘80s-style stadium blasts, Cale delivers an abstract, sinister treatise on blood’s less common functions in his forthright, booming baritone. Mering sings around him, filling up the cracks in the music like a rich, mournful mist. — \u003ci\u003eRaphael Helfand\u003c/i\u003e\n 43. John Cale \u0026 Weyes Blood, “STORY OF BLOOD”                  The typing bubbles on your phone bounce giddily; each message from them is coming quickly now. You’re past flirting, past the sensual allusions; you are tied together by the dream of skin against skin. Hikaru Utada relishes these erotic prospects on “Somewhere Near Marseilles,” spending nearly 12 minutes immersed in its deep-house instrumental co-produced by Sam Sheperd a.k.a. Floating Points. More than any one sonic element, the composition’s all-encompassing delirium is the music of Utada’s heart: “I'm gonna give it to you / I'll get a room with a view,” they sing, the deliciousness of the impending collision almost too much to bear. — \u003ci\u003eJordan Darville\u003c/i\u003e 42. Hikaru Utada, “Somewhere Near Marseilles”                   41. Carly Rae Jepsen, “The Loneliest Time”    Universal      Meredith Jenks  If you didn’t already know that Carly Rae Jepsen was a theater kid, here’s your proof. The title track from her fourth album is a gloriously slick disco duet with Rufus Wainwright — a farfetched daydream about returning to an old lover and finding paradise. It perfectly distills the deft songwriting and joyous abandon that’s distinguished her as a truly great pop star (whatever the charts might say). — \u003ci\u003eARR\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                   For the young New Jersey singer-songwriter Jane Remover, the searching is the point. Earlier this year, they wrote that they’d adopted this new name, Jane Remover, as part of a journey to “figure out who you really are.” “Cage Girl,” released at the time of the project’s rechristening, is a document of a similar kind of uncertainty and inner turmoil. Over dreary, dreamy arrangements that recall Slowdive at their stormiest, they sing fragments of memories and images that evoke, at once, tenderness and violence, uncertainty and peace. The swirl of emotions and instrumentation feels true to those liminal times in life when you don’t know which way is up. Sometimes you just have to spill it all out to try to make things make sense. — \u003ci\u003eCJ\u003c/i\u003e\n 40. Jane Remover, “Cage Girl”                  PGF Nuk imagines his music as a release valve. The Chicago rapper told \u003ca target=\"_new\" href=\"https://djbooth.net/features/2022-06-24-pgf-nuk-interview-audiomack\"\u003eDJ Booth\u003c/a\u003e earlier this year that he hopes that he can “bring the anger out of people.” The remix of “Waddup,” featuring Chicago star (and Nuk’s cousin by marriage) Polo G, does just that, in a simple, effective three minutes. Swerving over ominous synth melodies, the pair outline the violent ends that await anyone who stands in their way. Most crushing is Nuk’s simple delivery of the phrase that gives the song its title: \"Ay, bitch, waddup?\" Playful, sneering, intense, and sinister, his delivery packs a wide spectrum of feelings into just a few words — the hope is, by the time the song’s over you’ll be able to purge all of them and find some peace. But if not, you can always run it back. — \u003ci\u003eCJ\u003c/i\u003e 39. PGF Nuk feat. Polo G, “Waddup (Remix)”                  Omah Lay can legitimately claim to have done as much to broaden the emotional range of Afropop as anyone else with \u003ci\u003eBoy Alone\u003c/i\u003e, but the true selling point of his poignant debut album is the never-ending tension between the glitzy trappings of his fame and the sunken depth he falls to due to insecurities and fears. While he spends the entire course of the album sulking about his distress, he never directly addresses the elephant in the room like he does on “I’m a Mess.” Opening the song, he wistfully admits: “Sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m sad, I don’t know what’s over me.” The confessional feel of the song rests on the minimalist pairing of hi-hats and shuffling drums that producer Niphkeys weaves but it also owes its acclaim to the specificity of Omah’s songwriting. Here, Omah is fessing up to everything he feels with the hope that it will all be okay. — \u003ci\u003eWale Oloworekende\u003c/i\u003e 38. Omah Lay, “I'm a Mess”                  Drake and Future both spent this year chasing a moment that has perhaps passed them by, but “Wait For U” served as a reminder that, in fleeting moments, their tag team of relationship chaos can still be devastating. Both rappers open up in their verses, with Future candidly admitting his need to be loaded to express his true feelings. Drake, in particularly spiteful form, makes his inability to commit in a relationship sound like a hidden blessing. The spikiness of both verses jumps out between Tems’s choruses, luminous and addictive — a life raft in the choppy emotional waters created around her. — \u003ci\u003eDavid Renshaw\u003c/i\u003e\n 37. Future, “Wait For U”                   36. Midwife, “Sickworld”            A doll hangs suspended in the sky on the cover art for this song. It’s unclear whether it’s flying or falling. On “Sickworld,” heaven metal artist Midwife hangs in this moment of abeyance, switching between two arpeggiated chords for the entirety of the track’s almost seven-minute length. As Jon Brion-inspired strings float in and lightly pull you upwards to heaven, its beauty is overwhelming. The doll was flying all along. — \u003ci\u003eEM\u003c/i\u003e\n      Since his breakthrough track “Coche Bomba”, El Alfa has become one of the few artists to consistently drop music that innovates and contributes to the evolution of Dominican dembow. Produced by Chael Produciendo, “GOGO Dance'' is no exception, an automatic and worthy global sensation on TikTok and at the club. — \u003ci\u003eJennifer Mota\u003c/i\u003e\n 35. El Alfa, “Gogo Dance”                  Connecticut band Anxious’ amped-up album \u003cI\u003eLittle Green House\u003c/i\u003e is the sound of a pop-punk band with hardcore roots — but its tender closer, “You When You’re Gone,” is where it soars. Stella Branstool (from Brooklyn band Hello Mary) provides guest vocals, delivering the line “No one will miss you when you’re gone / but I’ll still love you” with unnerving clarity as guitars twinkle above her. It’s a lyric that could only come from deep inside a relationship, committed to the end when everyone and everything else has fallen away. — \u003ci\u003eDR\u003c/i\u003e\n 34. Anxious, “You When You're Gone”                  Using each new release as a reintroduction, Harry Styles always audibly strives to be more than what is expected of him. On \u003ci\u003eHarry’s House\u003c/i\u003e lead single “As It Was,” the singer hits an effervescent pitch both sonically and conceptually, expressing a willingness to embrace introspection while delivering one of the most textured performances in his loaded discography. This is a musician who has been at the center of pop music for more than a decade proving first that One Direction was more than a copy-and-paste boy band — and then that he was more than One Direction. While shedding the past on “As It Was,” and embracing the fullest extent of his skills in the present, Styles frees himself up to embark with unhindered confidence into the future. — \u003ci\u003eLarisha Paul\u003c/i\u003e 33. Harry Styles, “As It Was”                  No one makes a casual threat quite like EST Gee. And “Thump Shit,” a single from \u003ci\u003eLast Ones Left\u003c/i\u003e, his collaborative project with Detroit rapper 42 Dugg, is exactly what its title promises: a firehose of intimidation tactics and ultimatums. But the magic of “Thump Shit” is how much fun he and 42 Dugg sound like they’re having as shots ring. (Note the bars in which he compares his itchy trigger finger to, uh, premature ejaculation). Dugg, for his part, employs a nasally, halting delivery that makes even the most innocuous bars sound mischievous — outlining the lifestyle that makes such a steely mindset feel necessary. It’s the sort of song in which every staccato consonant promises chaos. — \u003ci\u003eCJ\u003c/i\u003e 32. EST Gee and 42 Dugg, “Thump Shit”                   31. Real Boston Richey feat. Lil Durk, “Keep Dissing 2”    Art Related        Real Boston Richey is fed up. The hangers-on have bled him dry, Instagram situationships endlessly linger, and his hard-and-fast lifestyle has sunk its claws into him. Richey’s mood causes his Florida cadence on “Keep Dissing 2” to coil tighter than we’ve heard previously, each word sounding like it has left a bitter taste in his mouth. Resigned, Richey shrugs off the dark side of his growing success (“Wanna know why niggas dying? Niggas keep dissing,” he says with a schoolteacher’s deliberation). In contrast, guest Lil Durk is as bloodthirsty as he is shrewd, outlining his ruthlessness while taking care not to give the prosecutors who may be listening any material for a RICO charge. The orchestral beat solemnly ebbs and swells throughout, its strings singing the song of a ceaseless, tragic blood feud. — \u003ci\u003eJordan Darville\u003c/i\u003e      black midi revel in their ridiculousness. On “Sugar/Tzu,” frontman Geordie Greep imagines himself as a “three-foot-three superfluous freak” (read: small child) watching an ultra-violent boxing match in the year 2163 between heavyweights Sun Sugar and Sun Tzu. It plays out over a maelstrom of volatile instrumentation: the controlled chaos of Morgan Simpson’s thunderous drums; an anxious, driving bass line from Cameron Picton; Greep’s caterwauling guitar; and a few key embellishments from additional contributors — most notably Kaidi Akinnibi, whose alto sax squeals make the song’s climactic moments sparkle with campy brilliance. — \u003ci\u003eRaphael Helfand\u003c/i\u003e\n 30. Black Midi, “Sugar/Tzu”                  Lamenting the end of a relationship while accepting the blame for its demise, “Less Than Zero” presents the kind of emotional vulnerability we’ve come to expect from The Weeknd in the recent years of his career — saddled, of course, with his usual hedonism. A mid-tempo new wave track, “Less Than Zero” would fit snugly on the soundtrack of a 1987 coming-of-age blockbuster, its climbing synths and acoustic backdrop offering the perfect nest for its introspective hook. — \u003ci\u003eSE\u003c/i\u003e\n 29. The Weeknd, “Less Than Zero”                  There’s nothing in the world so romantic as waiting. Waiting is the lover’s predisposition. Roland Barthes (a French boy) said so himself. On \"French Boys,\" Cate Le Bon renders that amorous anticipation into remote symbols —  plastic bouquets, faces like lakes — that scan clearer than direct language, so that you can feel the waiting rather than merely registering it. You can also feel when the waiting gets too much. After the chorus, guitars and saxophones burst into a tantrum of ecstasy. A series of little deaths that bloom and contract. — \u003ci\u003eEM\u003c/i\u003e\n 28. Cate Le Bon, “French Boys”                  A sky does not have to be crowded with stars to dazzle us. Nilufer Yanya’s virtuosity comes from a restraint buoyed by the enduring tenderness in moments anxious, desperate, and somewhere in-between. “try,” a song on Yanya’s superb second album \u003ci\u003ePAINLESS\u003c/i\u003e, best showcases this talent. Yanya wrestles with solitude and the resulting cacophony of internal noise that gets generated when everything around us is silent, beginning the journey on a cluster of gently ascending guitar notes. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, the song evolves into a post-rock soul explosion, an idea so grand that lesser artists would have thrown it at us immediately. — \u003ci\u003eJD\u003c/i\u003e\n 27. Nilüfer Yanya, “try”                   26. Ethel Cain, “American Teenager”            On “American Teenager” Ethel Cain picks at the idealized image of the U.S.A. and quickly reveals it to be a front masking widespread loneliness and hurt. How, she asks, can anyone have faith in the military when their son comes home in a box? And how will God save her when she’s drunk at the altar and can’t feel Him in her own time of need? Over jangly guitars and stadium-sized drums, Cain throws in images of darkened football arenas and tear-stained bleachers as she subverts the anthemic rock trope into a portrait of a society in decline. Standing in the rubble, she’s left to focus on the only thing she can rely on: herself. — \u003ci\u003eDR\u003c/i\u003e\n      Dubbing yourself the “Martin Scorsese of street rap” is a serious boast, but they’re shoes the Virginia rapper has filled for over two decades. On “Diet Coke,” Pusha T’s snarling voice bounds over infectious piano trills and a chopped-up sample originally intended for an 88 Keys beattape nearly 20 years ago. Push plays the long game, his bombastic delivery almost daring you to respond if you’re brave enough (“Saddle up / I’m still pitching baby, batter up”), paying homage to JAY-Z (“Imaginary players ain’t been coached right''), and fellow Virginian Missy Elliott (“Missy was our only misdemeanor”). Finding increasingly inventive ways to rap about coke and its accouterments, coupled with fourth-wall-breaking self-awareness, has always been Pusha’s superpower. Here, it makes for an audacious and dark proclamation of his longevity: “How many are still standing, reflecting in that mirror?” — \u003ci\u003eSajae Elder\u003c/i\u003e\n 25. Pusha T, “Diet Coke”                  [INSERT_AD]                   By the time Grace Ives has reached the end of her knockout sophomore record \u003ci\u003eJanky Star\u003c/i\u003e, everything has unraveled into a “lovely mess.” Carnivalesque synths bounce around her as she’s back to square one, going through the motions once again. “I hear the neighbors sing ‘Love Galore,’ I do a split on the kitchen floor,” she exclaims as though it’s just another day that ends in “y.” It’s a bittersweet certitude delivered with an oblique grin; a paean to the rituals we teach ourselves to survive, the melodies we fall back upon to ease our anxious minds. — \u003ci\u003eSM\u003c/i\u003e 24. Grace Ives, “Lullaby”                  “Buddy’s Rendezvous” may be a Father John Misty song — the original appeared on this year’s \u003ci\u003eChloe and the Next 20th Century\u003c/i\u003e — but Misty melts away when Lana sings it, even if he is still on backing vocals. “Buddy’s Rendezvous” is the most perfectly languorous ballad Lana has ever sung, floating along on coils of vape smoke, fading out as slowly as it fades in. — \u003ci\u003eShaad D'Souza\u003c/i\u003e 23. Lana Del Rey, “Buddy's Rendezvous”                  Over the last two years, Sabrina Carpenter found herself unfairly written into love-triangle gossip with Olivia Rodrigo and Joshua Bassett. But on \"Because I Liked a Boy,\" she answers the criticism and vitriol with honesty and pithiness, reclaiming her narrative along the way. She makes it clear that she doesn't want anyone's grace or pity, she wants them to know the truth. She’s not a “homewrecker” or a “rebound going ‘round stealing from the young,” she’s a confident — and often underrated — pop singer with sharp instincts for heart-on-your-sleeve lyricism. And, more importantly, before she’s any of those things, she’s a human being, a deceptively tricky truth to tell in a three-minute pop song. — \u003ci\u003eLP\u003c/i\u003e\n 22. Sabrina Carpenter, “Because I Liked A Boy”                   21. Samthing Soweto, “Amagents”            After taking a creative detour with the release of the amapiano-inspired \u003ci\u003eDanko!\u003c/i\u003e in 2020, Samthing Soweto’s recent releases have marked a return to the buttery R\u0026B and jazz-adjacent sound he originally delved into after splitting with South African acappella group The Soil 13 years ago. Samthing’s first release of 2022, “Amagents,” is a “simple yet complex message from a father to his daughter” according to the singer — but it’s also a critical portrait of how men can let down women in various ways. Tenderly written from a concerned father’s perspective, Samthing breaks down the complexity of men and their relationships with women while playing up his love for his daughter and reassuring her of his devotion regardless of what direction she heads in later in life. Performed entirely in Zulu, “Amagents” is a powerful reminder of love’s potency and a needed affirmation that it can be a force for actualizing good in our bleak world. — \u003ci\u003eWO\u003c/i\u003e       20. Cash Cobain \u0026 Chow Lee, “JHoliday”            Listening to Cash Cobain and Chow Lee’s “JHoliday” is like tapping through the Instagram story of that one friend who lives at the club. They recall their X-rated lifestyle with graphic, messy detail. “I ain't Spiderman I cannot save you ho,” Chow raps, drowning out the wholesome pleas sampled from the R\u0026B singer J. Holiday’s “Suffocate.” Sure, Cash and Chow Lee may be toxic, but they lean into it with a cartoonish sense of humor, cranking up the dial until their situations sound too ridiculous to be true. There’s no denying the comedic, easy-going spirit they brought to New York drill. Life would be more fun if we all were this loose. — \u003ci\u003eBC\u003c/i\u003e       19. Karol G, “Provenza”            As a tribute to the name of a neighborhood in Medellin, Colombia — a creative hub for music in Latin music and also the home to singer Karol G and producer Ovy On The Drums – “Provenza” fuses Afro-dance beats and tropical influences into a nostalgic pulse for a song about homecoming and nostalgia. — \u003ci\u003eJM\u003c/i\u003e\n       18. Boldy James \u0026 Nicholas Craven, “Scrabble”            Amidst a coke rap lane that usually alternates between crushing paranoia and triumphant bombast, “Scrabble” is relaxed — a rare moment of equanimity for vocalist Boldy James to survey the state of the game. Over a folky, loping sample courtesy of Nicholas Craven, Boldy uses his one-of-one monotone flow to reflect on his younger days moving weight and spraying down opps, all while making thinly veiled threats at his adversaries. The “Alphabet Boys” remain an ever-present nuisance through it all, but until his time is up, Boldy James leaves no doubt that whether DEA or FBI, rapper or drug dealer, he’s not sweating the competition. Catch him if you can. — \u003ci\u003eSon Raw\u003c/i\u003e       17. Doechii, “Persuasive”            2022 was Doechii’s year. In August, she dropped her debut project after signing with TDE, and the young star has been establishing herself as a provocateur at every turn. Known for her quick-witted lyricism and the occasional primal scream, nothing about her sound is timid. But the lead single from her EP \u003ci\u003eshe/her/black bitch\u003c/i\u003e, “Persuasive,” showcases a more mellow persona. Doechii skates over a house track as an observer, a feeling, a concept, and slowly speaks life into herself as the subject. “How does it feel to be that-that bitch? / “How does it feel to let, let-let go?” It’s flirtatious, sharp, and provocative. — \u003ci\u003eGyasi Williams-Kirtley\n\u003c/i\u003e       16. Bladee \u0026 Ecco2k, “The Flag Is Raised”            If “Amygdala” signaled the beginning of Bladee and Ecco2k’s main pop bitch era — “I want it, I want it! Iconic, iconic!” — “The Flag Is Raised” brought them to No. 1 on some strange and Drained alternate plain. The opening song from their collaborative album Crest, “The Flag Is Raised” is jet-propulsive, capturing all the rippling sweetness and cynicism of The Year In Drain Gang. At this year’s world tour, the effusive performances of “The Flag Is Raised” were inarguable highlights — like hearing a platinum hit beamed in from another galaxy. — \u003ci\u003eSD\u003c/i\u003e       15. Jim Legxacy, “Eye Tell (!)”            “Eye Tell (!)” is the sound of U.K. producer Jim Legxacy working himself out in real-time. Fingers slide up and down the fretboard as plucked guitar chords sit atop a skippy beat that loops over and over, creating a vibe somewhere between a Sunny Day Real Estate practice room circa 1995 and TikTok in 2022. Legxacy pitches his own vocals up, giving added tenderness to his lyrics about protecting his heart behind the walls of a medieval stronghold. He tries to hide his face from onlookers, ironically pulling more in with his uniquely eclectic expression of regret. — \u003ci\u003eDR\u003c/i\u003e\n       14. Asake, “Peace Be Unto You”            Asake’s “Peace Be Unto You” is an enchanting fusion of amapiano, fuji music, and street pop that feels so massive it’s hard to believe the Lagos singer is still a newcomer. Asake’s warm and commanding vocals fill the air with joy and self-determination, gently riding the momentum of the shuffling drums and whistles. “I just blow but omo I know my set / Before them use me I use me I go use my sense,” he sings with conviction. When the choir joins to sing alongside him, it’s purely magnetic. While it’s playing, “Peace Be Unto You” feels like the only thing that matters — a balm of encouragement and safeguard from bad will with Asake serving as its shimmering center of gravity. — \u003ci\u003eBC\u003c/i\u003e\n       13. Omar Apollo, “Tamagotchi”            Months after the release of Omar Apollo’s debut studio album \u003ci\u003eIvory\u003c/i\u003e, the brooding deep cut “Evergreen” became the kind of viral hit to cry to instead of dance. But when the tears subside, the effortlessly seductive Neptunes-produced standout “Tamagotchi” is a fail-proof confidence booster cathartic enough to wipe the memory of whatever it was that got the tears flowing in the first place. For three minutes, Apollo abandons his signature sleek indie pop. In its place, he paints an airy, harmony-filled wonderland as captivating as any dreamy pop performance that preceded it. — \u003ci\u003eLP\u003c/i\u003e       12. Brent Faiyaz, “Jackie Brown”            Jackie Brown is an R\u0026B ouroboros referencing everything from Timbaland and Aaliyah’s 90s run to plot points from Quentin Tarantino’s titular soul-soaked Blaxploitation homage. Morphing his voice à la Prince \u0026 Camille to sing both male and female vocals, Brent Faiyaz has no time for previous romantic conquests, whether detached or clingy — all he wants is commitment from the current object of his desire. In a year that saw pop stars pivot towards the dance floor, “Jackie Brown”’s bedroom romance felt fresh, dangerous, and extremely welcome. — \u003ci\u003eSR\u003c/i\u003e\n       11. Westside Gunn, “Big Ass Bracelet”            Taking a page from the early aughts Roc-A-Fella playbook, “Big Ass Bracelet” sees Westside Gunn and show-stealer Stove God Cooks reminiscing about their drug dealing days. Over a lush, regal soul loop, the rappers use the faded grandeur of civil rights era R\u0026B to comment on the crack years’ urban decay. Opps get slain and kilos get moved, but above all, “Big Ass Bracelet” is a tremendous flex, an opportunity for the duo to admire just how far they’ve come. Just as importantly, it’s a sign that rap’s sonic center is shifting away from the 808-heavy sound that dominated the last decade, and is heading towards stranger, more abstract frontiers. — \u003ci\u003eSR\u003c/i\u003e       10. SZA, “Shirt”            In perfect SZA fashion, “Shirt” gives us an entire unhinged inner monologue about a frustrating new fling. SZA has always been down to get her hands dirty and her heart scuffed, but “Shirt” takes things to a new level: “Blood stain on my shirt / New bitch on my nerves,” she sings. Produced by Darkchild, “Shirt” feels nostalgic but new, and even the full version of the track, as opposed to the snippet that leaked months ago, feels too short; it’s almost disrespectful. — \u003ci\u003eGW-K\u003c/i\u003e\n      [INSERT_AD]                    9. Vince Staples, “When Sparks Fly”            Concept songs anthropomorphizing guns have been a rap trope for ages, but it took Vince Staples’s blend of dry humor and sensitivity to reinvent the form as a sweaty, tender, R\u0026B-inflected ballad. Equal part romantic pillow talk and deconstruction of American gun culture, “When Sparks Fly” sees Vince and his pistol whispering sweet nothings to each other against a backdrop of gang violence and police brutality. Listen intently, and it’s a damning indictment of the cycle of violence wracking cities like Vince’s Ramona Park. Play it at 5 a.m. as your after-hours event is winding down and you’ve got a slow jam beautiful enough to forget about the threat of violence in the first place. — \u003ci\u003eSR\u003c/i\u003e       8. Jenny Hval, “American Coffee”            All good songs start simple. “My mother came to the city at 21,” Jenny Hval begins on “American Coffee” over neatly blocked organ chords before launching into an unembellished tale of tearful car rides and compassionate midwives that encapsulates her mother’s early 20s and the circumstances of her own birth with perfect, poignant clarity. From there, the song spreads out in several directions. Simplicity is no longer the name of the game; Hval moves to Australia, where she lives with a group of nurses who recite a translator’s note from Deleuze and Guattari’s \u003ci\u003eCapitalism and Schizophrenia\u003c/i\u003e: “A concept is a brick. It can be used to build a courthouse of reason, or it can be thrown through the window.” She has a UTI while watching Dreyer’s \u003ci\u003eLa Passion de Jeanne d'Arc\u003c/i\u003e. She throws shade at higher institutions of learning, \u003ci\u003eInterstellar\u003c/i\u003e, and, of course, American coffee. There’s no one else in the world who could pull all this off in the space of a pop song (even a six-minute one), but Hval does so effortlessly, her graceful voice cutting through the dense theory and endless references to create a uniquely compelling piece of art. — \u003ci\u003eRH\u003c/i\u003e\n       7. Ice Spice, “Munch (Feelin U)”            It’s been impossible to escape \"Munch (Feelin’ U)” since its release in August, no matter how hard you try. Bubbling from the Bronx to TikTok, the viral hit’s brash lyrics are like the perfect pre-game pep talk, full of quotables that are equal parts ego-boosting (“Baddest bitch out, you shittin me?”) and hilariously descriptive (\"I'm walkin' past him, he sniffin' my breeze\"). Ice Spice swerves across a glitchy bass line and frenetic hi-hats, taking munches everywhere down as she goes. Straightforward and addictive, “Munch” packs an undeniably fun punch in its sub-two-minute runtime. Part of a new crop of female rappers breaking up New York drill’s boys' club, Ice Spice’s playful delivery brings a feather-light touch to the genre's thumping beats. If “Munch” proves anything, it’s that Ice Spice’s quiet confidence makes a big splash. As she herself reminds us: “Bitch I’m a baddie, I get what I want.” — \u003ci\u003eSE\u003c/i\u003e\n       6. Beyoncé, “Cuff It”            First of all, let’s be clear that “I feel like falling in love / I’m in the mood to fuck something up” is one of the greatest opening lines that any song gave us in 2022. On \u003ci\u003eRENAISSANCE\u003c/i\u003e, Beyoncé dances free and easy through an endless summer party of her own design; “CUFF IT” is a sexy, euphoric invitation to cut loose and join her. With its glossy, distinctively Nile Rodgers guitar lines, airy strings, resplendent horns, and general aura of ecstasy, the track is an exquisite homage to more classic disco and R\u0026B stylings. But unlike on, say, \u003ci\u003e4\u003c/i\u003e-era cuts with similar sonic sensibilities, here Beyoncé leans unabashedly into her desires (“Squeeze it, don't let it go / Tease it, no self-control”). Elsewhere on the album, she’s too flawless to be touched, but the deliciousness of “CUFF IT” is in her imploration for recklessness. Drunk and high and carnal, this song is a reminder that an insatiable appetite will always result in a mess — and that can be glorious, too. — \u003ci\u003eTJ\u003c/i\u003e       5. Two Shell, “home”            Giddy, romantic, brilliant, and gleefully stupid, Two Shell’s “home” is four minutes of utter jungle pop joy. With its ebullient synth, popping candy breakbeats, and blitzed-up R\u0026B sample, the track fizzes through you as though your blood were McDonald’s Sprite. Originally a vinyl-only release, the track began making the rounds in DJ sets from Ross from Friends and Four Tet before it was made available to stream at the beginning of this year. Now the track’s been with us for almost four seasons, it remains a frenzy that doesn’t let up, no matter how many times you replay it. It’s proof that joy doesn’t always need to be tempered with melancholy — ”home”'s wholehearted and cartoonish tribute to glee can lift you with a force as strong as heartbreak can sink you. It reminds us that our childlike capacity for happiness may have never really floundered after all. — \u003ci\u003eEM\u003c/i\u003e\n       4. Jockstrap, “Greatest Hits”            Jockstrap’s \u003ci\u003eI Love You Jennifer B\u003c/i\u003e, with its discombobulating mix of indie rock and avant-garde electronic music, exists outside time and space, but you can pinpoint “Greatest Hits” easily — it’s all old-school disco glamour, slinking satin and freely-poured ice-cold vodka. Never mind that the beat itself is hardly traditional — it saunters drunkenly between dub and footwork, making sleazy advances towards each — or that the song’s mood, when you try to parse it, is actually as pensive as it is lascivious. “Greatest Hits” is pure vibe: something to slip into when the world just isn’t feeling spectacular enough. — \u003ci\u003eSD\u003c/i\u003e       3. GloRilla, “FNF”            From the moment she stepped on it, GloRilla made it look like the stage at the BET Awards was made especially for her. Dressed in silver hot pants and a matching baseball jersey emblazoned with the words “Big Glo”, she was every bit the hotly-tipped rookie prospect stepping up to the plate for her first big swing. It was when she launched into “FNF” that something in the room was unlocked; the song of 2022’s summer by a long stretch, everyone present was taken back to the cookouts, pool parties, and yes, the rowdy red lights in traffic. For two minutes and 17 seconds, GloRilla was your bodyguard tossing the toxic exes and vicious gnats from your brain: “I’m F. R. E. E. Fuck. N****. Free.” Hitting her song’s theme in a cartoon bully flow, GloRilla punches each word like there’s a period after it. The track, produced by HitKidd, surges with the menacing energy and pummeling rhythm that has since rallied contemporary Memphis rappers into unexpected chart success — but on that stage, GloRilla made it look inevitable. Months before the chants of “Let’s gooooo!” filled the room, we were already following GloRilla’s lead. — \u003ci\u003eJD\u003c/i\u003e       2. Bad Bunny, “Después de la Playa”            \"Después de la Playa''’s dreamy pop synths are quickly interrupted by Bad Bunny: “Dime, ¿vamo' pa'l mambo o no vamo' pa'l mambo?” He’s saying “let’s get to the mambo” – referring to the street merengue known as Dominican mambo. Incorporating the foundations of classic merengue – the guira, piano, trumpet, and hand drum percussion – he and producer Dahian el Apechao build a composition that represents the sonic atmosphere in Dominican beaches, albeit a more modern, street mambo take that includes a faster BPM, horns, and lyricism rooted in Dominican slang. (The track also serves as a highlight of El Apechao and Dominican musicians, which, considering the heavy influence of Dominican music on the album, \u003ci\u003eUn Verano Sin Ti\u003c/i\u003e largely fails to do.) \"Después de la Playa'' proves that homegrown styles of the Spanish-speaking Afro-Caribbean are still very much alive and present — and audiences are hungry for it. \u003ci\u003eJM\u003c/i\u003e       1. Burna Boy, “Last Last”            Much of the run from \u003ci\u003eOutside\u003c/i\u003e to \u003ci\u003eLove, Damini\u003c/i\u003e that established Burna Boy as an international superstar has seen him cosplay as a political theorist, party starter, and pan-Africanist — but there’s been little space for personal reflections from the African Giant. “Last Last,” the lead single from his sixth album course-corrects that with a groovy break-up single that reflects on the end of a romantic relationship. Here Burna Boy lays bare the inevitability of heartache (or, in his Nigerian slang, \"breakfast\"). But the true genius of “Last Last” is how he uses that pain as a map to touch on other moments that have felt precarious for him: the death of the southern Nigeria militant Soboma George over a decade ago, and a car crash in Lagos earlier this year. Like all classic break-up anthems, “Last Last” finds Burna Boy both deflecting blame (“And I know I’m in trouble / She manipulate my love”) and accepting his imperfection (“I no holy and I no denge pose”) before attempting to find an escape from his pain by consuming copious amounts of liquor and weed. It's the year’s most lucid exploration of heartbreak. — \u003ci\u003eWO\u003c/i\u003e      [INSERT_AD]                   chief keef the weeknd Lana Del Rey Kendrick Lamar Hudson Mohawke Caroline Polachek Future Vince Staples Young Thug Pusha T SZA Lil Durk Julianna Barwick The 1975 Paramore alex g Nosaj Thing tyondai braxton boldy james fka twigs Jenny Hval Show Me The Body kehlani Carly Rae Jepsen Mura Masa burna boy Lil Yachty Steve Lacy Joyce Wrice Cate Le Bon Brent Faiyaz shygirl gunna Karol G Bad Bunny sudan archives Sabrina Claudio tove lo Westside Gunn nilufer yanya Megan Thee Stallion Beyoncé omar apollo rosalia SASAMI Harry Styles El Alfa Hikaru Utada Fish Narc Rema Grace Ives jim legxacy g jones flo milli Midwife Skullcrusher Jockstrap Bad Boy Chiller Crew Conway the Machine black midi Ethel Cain Special Interest ayra starr Central Cee black sherif Two Shell nia archives Yeat caroline Omah Lay doechii easyFun Holly Humberstone Glorilla Jane Remover Flo Lucrecia Dalt Hagop Tchaparian Ice Spice Asake Skeng PGF Nuk Bladee \u0026 Ecco2k Cash Cobain \u0026 Chow Lee Sabrina Carpenter Samthing Soweto 42 Dugg and EST Gee Anxious John Cale \u0026 Weyes Blood Eliza Rose Jimi Jules Bolis Pupul Charlotte Adigéry Swami Sound Asake ft.

            <span class="lead-text" style=color:#000000>Nearly a decade</span> after “<a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh2LWWORoiM&ab_channel=ToveLoVEVO">Habits</a>” propelled her to top-40 ubiquity, <a  href="https://www.thefader.com/artist/tove-lo">Tove Lo</a> is ready to tell you that you’ve been <a target="_new" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tovelo/video/7110846135396207878?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7110846135396207878&lang=en">pronouncing her name wrong this entire time</a>. She’s left the major label she was signed to for the majority of her career and started her own, Pretty Swede Records. And she’s embracing the fact that her sound will always defy what we typically expect from pop music.<br /> <br />Her new album, <i>Dirt Femme</i>, is a daring exercise in these extremes: jumping from club banger to ballad, oscillating between ironclad and vulnerable, never afraid to contradict itself. It’s further proof that there’s no pop star more adept at encapsulating the gorgeous messiness of the human experience. <br /> <br />Ahead of the album’s release, we caught up for a wide-ranging conversation about choosing to go indie, that crazy Hot Butter sample in “2 Die 4,” and the wild nights that shaped <i>Dirt Femme</i>.

          <p>
            <b>The FADER: You took a break from songwriting during lockdown. What was that like for you?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            It started with writing “<a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMWLX0KXwF4&ab_channel=ToveLo">No One Dies From Love</a>” in January 2020. I was like, “I can’t wait to play this at the summer festivals. It’s gonna be the first song of the next chapter… setting the bar for what I want this next record to be.” I got to do a whole U.S. tour in February. I broke my foot, but I got a pink throne, and I went up there with my broken foot and finished the tour. I was very proud of myself. It was one of my favorite tours I’ve ever done. The crowds were incredible. It was sold out in most places. It felt like a lot of work had paid off, and we were looking at a very busy year of touring. And then, obviously, everything stopped, and there was no way to keep pushing my music. I didn’t have any new music to put out because when I’m in tour mode, I’m not in the writing headspace. So the pandemic for me was sit-back-and-listen mode. My record deal was up, so I had this feeling of, “Am I ever gonna be an artist again? Am I ever gonna tour again? Am I ever gonna want to write songs?” 
          </p>










          <p>
            I’m very present. I never really plan. I feel like the present is the future. That’s just how I am. I thought, “I’m not gonna want to write. I’m not gonna make a new album. I’m not gonna have any way to put it out. What if this is just the rest of it?” 
          </p>










          <p>
            That sent me into a pretty sad place for a while. But then, out of nowhere, I got asked to shoot a movie [<i><a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XzFFO10fs">The Emigrants</a></i>] in Sweden. It was a period piece about the 1850s, and I played an alcoholic sex worker who was trying to find a better life, so she goes on a boat to America. I’m one of the three lead characters, and I’d never acted before. It was very much out of my comfort zone. It was challenging and weird and stressful and fun. And when I came back from that at the end of 2020, I was itching in my fingers to write again.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>Filming at that time must have been pretty harrowing.</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            Sweden had very different COVID restrictions. We didn’t have a single case for the first two months we filmed. We were getting tested on set, wearing masks except for when we’re shooting. We were separated into groups to keep everything very controlled. And we were out in the countryside, so we weren’t around many people except for the people on set. When we switched locations, it started to trickle in, and that was a big challenge. 
          </p>










          <p>
            The movie is pretty dark. It’s showing a time when we were very behind in the industrial revolution. People were starving. Everyone owed money to the royal family because they owned all the land. You weren’t in charge of your own destiny. There was a rumor that in America they were giving away land for free, which wasn’t really the truth, but that was the reason a million Swedes — a quarter of the population — migrated here by boat around the 1850s. It’s a huge part of Swedish history. There’s a moment in the movie where we get to New York by boat and [are] supposed to take a train, but none of us have ever seen a train. You realize how far behind Sweden was: it was still horse and buggy.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>It seems like you drew from the world of cinema for this record in the visuals and the lyrics, so it’s kismet that you then ended up acting in this movie at the end of 2020. Is there a particular film that you feel embodies what <i>Dirt Femme</i> stands for?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            It’s a mix of a few: <i><a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNi_HC839Wo">Ladybird</a></i>, <i><a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwQ-NH1rRT4">The Florida Project</a></i> for the colors. <i><a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6DW0HtpT-0">True Romance</a></i> and <i><a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSz13CIyX7M&ab_channel=RottenTomatoesClassicTrailers">To Die For</a></i> are in their too, obviously. Every song has a female character who is a movie character I like or loosely based on one: “2 Die 4” is Wonder Woman with Big Dick Energy, and “No One Dies From Love” is the damsel in distress who you see in all the action movies — glamorous, but needs saving. 
          </p>










          <p>
            And they’re all a part of me: “Pineapple Slice” is the seductive, forward part. “True Romance” is murderous but cute. She’s got a hammer. She’s on her way to kill somebody, or she already did, but she looks good while she does it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>For “Grapefruit,” you tapped into a side of yourself that you thought you’d moved past. Tell me about that.</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            “Grapefruit” is a song I tried to write for 10 years. I struggled with eating disorders from when I was 15 to around 20. I did my best to keep it hidden from family and friends, but they eventually found out. [They told me] to get help, and I did, but I didn’t really take it seriously. The drive to be in control of it was more important still. But then I went to a vocal doctor because I was having problems with my voice, and he looked down my throat and said “Oh, you’re bulimic aren’t you?” I denied it, and he was like, “You don’t have to talk to me about it, but I can tell you that if you keep going, you’ll lose your voice.”
          </p>










          <p>
            That shook me. I was like, “Am I gonna treat myself this way to a point where I can’t do the one thing that makes me happy?” So from that day, I started working on getting better. I went to therapy. I worked on trying to find a way to love and accept my body the way it is. With that kind of disease, it takes a long time to recover. A lot of people never fully do. They always have a complicated relationship with food. You have to at first break the behavior and then deal with what’s actually going on, because it’s rarely about the way you look or about food; it’s about something else, something deeper. It was a few years of hard work for me to get to a point where I felt comfortable in myself, but I did it.
          </p>










          <p>
            I’m so happy that I was healthy by the time I started releasing music and becoming a person in the public, because the criticism and comments… They scan you up and down and try to find things to shit on you for. It’s quite intense. I’ve mentioned in interviews that I used to not love my body but now I do, but It felt out of nowhere for me to speak about it. But now that I’ve written a song about it, I have to. Every time I flash my tits on stage or tell everyone to not retouch my body in magazines and ask that I get to look the way I look, that’s a small victory for me because I didn’t even want to look at myself for many years of my life.
          </p>










          <p>
            What triggered me to write this song is that they asked me to lose some weight for the movie, which wasn’t much. And it wasn’t like, “You’re fat, lose weight.” It was, “You’re playing a starving character. Would you feel okay losing some weight?” I said, “Yeah, I can do that,” and I went on a diet for the first time in 10 years, and all these memories started flooding over me — remembering how exhausting it is and how nothing else matters when you’re in that state. I had to write it all down and get it out of me.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>Were you at all hesitant to set these very evocative images and lyrics to this huge pop song that you’ll have to perform again and again? Or did it feel empowering?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            Both, for sure. When I’m working on the video and doing the choreo, I feel quite exhausted after — physically, but also emotionally, because it’s taxing to throw myself into that state again. But it’s already quite rewarding. It feels powerful, like it could really reach people in a special way and I can’t keep it to myself. I also like the contrast of the very dark, intense lyrics with [the sound of] the song. You’ll be dancing and singing along, like, “Wait, what’s she singing about? Hang on.”
          </p>










          <p>
            The contrast is important to me because I’m not in that state anymore. If I was still feeling that way, I’d want the music to be more sad and intimate. But because I’ve prevailed, it’s important that the music feels hopeful. If I’m going through something like that, I don’t like songs that tell me how I’m supposed to feel. When I’m feeling myself and having a good day, like, “Yeah, I look hot today,” I love listening to feeling-yourself songs and body-positivity songs. But when I’m not in that state, I want to listen to something where someone feels the way I do, where they describe what I’m going through. That’s why I wrote the lyrics that way: They’re not hopeful. They’re just like, “This is the situation.”

            <b>This album gives me whiplash in the best way. I’m listening to one song, thinking to myself, “Your vocals have never been so stripped back and raw,” and then the next song is the clubbiest thing you’ve ever done. This duality is something you’ve played with across your career, but it feels punctuated this time, like one side can’t exist without the other. Talk me through that.</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            I [took longer] to write this record, so I had more time to experiment sonically. When you have a really short amount of time, it’s easier to make a sonically similar, cohesive world. At first, I wanted to make more stuff that was in the world of “I’m to Blame,” but nothing ended up being as good as that. I couldn’t really master that way of writing. I did it for one song, and I was so proud of it, like, “This needs to be on the record.”
          </p>










          <p>
            I stopped worrying so much about it needing to be cohesive and just let it be honest and have its raw moments of, “This is also a part of me. I’m a human being. I’m this, but I’m also that.” You can’t put anyone in a specific folder. There’s so much to us, and we change through experiences, but something at the core of you is still you. I wanted to let everything live on this album. The thing that ties it together is me and my words. That can be enough. The thread through all of it is me. I’m the essence of the album.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>When you put out “2 Die 4,” you said “I wanna make something iconic.” Tell me how that song built itself around the “<a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK3ZP6frAMc">Popcorn</a>” sample. Had you ever sampled anything before?”</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            No, it was my first time.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>So this was historic. Why that song in particular?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            It was an idea that grew out of nowhere in a session. Me and Oscar Gores, who I’ve worked with a lot over the years, were assigned to the same collective, and we had two or three days together in the studio. The album was starting to feel like it was coming from different eras of dance music. I was thinking about “<a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OQ1–STqx_k">Attention Whore</a>” and “No One Dies From Love,” and we started talking about trance music, those synths and that intense tempo. I used to hate it as a kid, and now I think it’s so cool.
          </p>










          <p>
            Oscar started playing around with those synths, and I was like, “I love this, but we’ve got to make it slower. It can’t be 140 [beats per minute]. I can’t make melodies to that.” But all of a sudden, I started singing the melody, and I was like, “Wait, this works so well on these chords.” I showed it to him, and he’s like, “<a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwI1j7sslYI&ab_channel=CrazyFrog">Oh, wait, it’s Crazy Frog</a>.” I’m like, “Yes, but no. It’s ‘Popcorn’ by Hot Butter originally.” And we pulled it up and listened to it. I was like, “I’ve never sampled anything before. Let’s just play with it and hope the OG writers approve.”
          </p>










          <p>
            That’s how it started, and we finished it in a day, which is rare — maybe because we had the main melody already. There are a few cool remixes [of “Popcorn”], but none where someone sings the melody, so that felt unique to me. It was hard to figure out something with a sentiment in that complicated melody. Once I had it, it felt like [a song] for when someone is feeling down: “Let me take you out and we’ll make out and have fun, and you’ll feel better.” It sounds pretty much the same as it did when we wrote it that day.
          </p>

            <b>Your love for the club and for dance music is so pervasive on this record. Were there any wild, game-changing nights in particular that made it onto this record?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            We went out to this festival called <a target="_new" href="https://desertairfest.com/">Desert Air</a> in Palm Springs by this old airplane museum. I saw <a href="https://www.thefader.com/artist/channel-tres">Channel Tres</a> perform there — he’s featured on “Attention Whore.” In L.A., it’s hard to find clubs with good sound that play house and techno where people are there just to dance and listen. And this was one of those nights where… you go on a journey with the DJ. I got to feel that without any disturbance there. “Attention Whore” was inspired by wanting to make something hypnotic and sexy that felt like a journey. And the tracks with <a  href="https://www.thefader.com/artist/sg-lewis">SG Lewis</a>… We’ve had some really wild nights together in L.A., so those songs just grew from us being friends and making music we both love.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>Has there been a DJ or producer who’s been inspiring you in your own sets these days?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.thefader.com/artist/fred-again">Fred Again.</a> I love anything <a  href="https://soundcloud.com/instinctrec">instinct(uk)</a> puts out… <a target="_new" href="https://www.instagram.com/idaengberg/?hl=en">Ida Engberg</a>, <a href="https://www.thefader.com/artist/honey-dijon">Honey Dijon</a>… My crew is a big group of music nerds, and we all love to go out and dance together. We live in a collective, five people who all DJ. We have a little dance music project together called <a target="_new" href="https://www.instagram.com/associanureeves/?hl=en">Associanu</a>, and I also have another crew of just girls called Ladies of Leisure. We opened for Fred Again when he did a secret show at a club in L.A., and that was another one where everyone was in it together.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>What’s your back pocket song, like, “This is gonna set the crowd off, but they don’t know it yet?”</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            It’s a <a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tITndmEQDhU&ab_channel=GlasgowUnderground">remix</a> of [GALA’s] “<a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3l7fgvrEKM&ab_channel=DOITYOURSELF">Freed From Desire</a>” with <a target="_new" href="https://www.instagram.com/kevinmckay/?hl=en">Kevin McKay</a>. It starts pretty heavy. You have no idea where it’s going, and then the vocal comes in, and any crowd goes ballistic.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>Let’s talk about Pretty Swede Records and the decision to go indie. What did that mean for this record in particular?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            My deal was up, and I wasn’t sure what to do because I was signed out of Sweden but with a commitment from the U.S. — classic major label setup. I definitely needed that at the start of my career. It made it possible for me to break in the way I did in America and build my platform, so I’m very grateful. But at this point, I know exactly how I want to express myself, and even though they never stopped me from putting something out, [it felt like I wasn’t] getting the support I thought the record needed at times, and it would be frustrating.
          </p>










          <p>
            I went to a few meetings with major labels after my deal was up. I got some offers, and they weren’t bad, but something in my stomach didn’t feel right. I felt like I was gonna have to fight for my expression constantly, and I was like, “I have such a good publishing team. My manager is a miracle worker. I’m super close with my creative director. I feel like there’s a way to do this on my own that’s more favorable to me.”
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>Were there any new challenges you weren’t expecting in taking this new step?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            I have to make sure I’m on top of everything being done and that I’m outsourcing things to the right people. I have to be more involved in the business process, but I don’t mind that. It’s a learning curve, but in the end, it’s all pretty straightforward: “Do I want to spend the money here or there?” Sometimes there might be a wrong decision, but I’m learning as I go.
          </p>










          <p>
            <b>Now that <i>Dirt Femme</i> is done and ready to take on a life of its own, what will you carry from it into your future work?</b>
          </p>










          <p>
            The playfulness and the vulnerability, and letting it take the time it takes to write the next record. That was very critical for this one to be as good as I feel it is.

                content: `<p>If you asked someone to picture a digital (or online) advertisement, chances are they would picture a display ad. These ads most closely resemble the print advertisements that appear in magazines and newspapers, typically rectangular or square. They use text, images, videos or a combination of those to market a product or service.</p><p><strong>Banner ads</strong>, which appear at the top of a webpage, are a common form of display ads. They generate high visibility for an advertiser and serve an essential purpose in any campaign. Display ads may also appear elsewhere on a page. There are a few different types of display ads, all of which can be created and placed by the team at <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS.</strong> They will deliver the desired message wherever the audience consumes our content, on any screen size.</p><p><strong>Personalized and remarketing ads</strong> use data that’s been collected about customers, such as the pages they have visited on your website or a demonstrated interest in your market based on their internet and search practices, to send them ads that are specifically targeted at them. These types of display ads are an excellent way to market to customers who have already demonstrated an interest in your brand, product or service.</p><p><strong>Contextually targeted ads</strong> are ads that are placed on websites based on similarities between the ad and the site. For example, if you’re selling hiking gear, a contextually targeted ad might be placed on <em>an outdoor magazine’s</em> website. Or if your services are location-specific, the ad can be placed in a local publication. The topic and keywords included in the display ad, location preferences and the theme and focus of the host website all play a role in determining the placement of contextually targeted ads.</p><p><strong>Site-placed ads</strong> are just as they sound; no advanced analytics necessary, these ads are placed on the websites of your choice.</p><p>Display ads can be incredibly beneficial to every campaign. Some of these benefits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased visibility</strong> among customers that keeps your brand top of mind</li><li>A <strong>fast, clear way</strong> to convey your message and reach a wide range of customers</li><li>A <strong>simple, flexible format</strong> that can be adapted and reused for different placements</li><li>Typically <strong>less expensive</strong> than other more complicated and involved types of ads</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

Custom created client video can include animation, branded shorts, commercials, custom content, scripting, voiceover, and drone or gimbal operator.</p><p><strong>In-stream ads</strong> are the most popular form of video advertisements. These are videos that play before, during or after another form of video content. Oftentimes, in-stream ads are interactive, encouraging viewers to click through in order to claim an offer or learn more. Other common forms include <strong>rewarded ads</strong>, which appear in video games and give users the chance to earn something by watching the video, and <strong>shoppable ads</strong> through which viewers can purchase an item immediately.</p><p>While video is an incredibly popular format, it is critical that customers find video ads to be interesting and relevant and not obtrusive and annoying, which is a line that’s very easy for a video ad to cross.

When your web pages and content pages are filled with links that connect them all together, this signals to search engines that your content and therefore your brand are credible.

This is product placement, and the advertiser has paid for that privilege.

The intent of the placement is to draw the viewer’s attention to the brand and trigger their desire to purchase, solely because they like or identify with the person on screen.</p><p><strong>Non-digital product placement</strong> involves purchasing coveted retail space. For example, advertisers often pay more to be placed on shelves at eye level or at the ends of aisles, places more visible and convenient for shoppers. Brands may also pay “slotting fees” to limit shelf space for their competitors.</p><p>Benefits of product placement include:</p><ul><li><strong>Brand recognition and awareness</strong></li><li><strong>Less obtrusive</strong>, does not interrupt the action</li><li><strong>More cost-effective</strong> than ads in the long term</li><li><strong>Profit</strong> potential is high</li></ul><p>Though smaller businesses might not have the dollars to purchase product placement in TV and movies, <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

Each piece often promotes a part of the brand’s story. Unlike news reporting, with branded content the brand has control over the messaging and approves the final draft before it goes live. Additionally, the brand owns the content and can reuse it on their own site if they wish.</p><p>A huge benefit of branded content hosted on a publisher site is that Google ranks our publisher sites higher because they are respected news sites. Therefore, stories appearing on our sites have higher views than content housed on a brand’s site with less traffic. Additionally, content on a publisher’s site casts a wider readership net — adding the publisher’s audience — rather than only reaching those who frequent the brand's site already.</p><p>Branded content has a variety of forms, including:</p><ul><li>Articles</li><li>Listicles</li><li>Infographics</li><li>Video</li><li><a href="https://lee.net/quizzes/article_59e2dacc-d3cc-11ed-add7-e3c412bb7eee.html" data-nav="59e2dacc-d3cc-11ed-add7-e3c412bb7eee">Quizzes</a></li><li><a href="https://lee.net/contests/article_82bb46c8-d3cc-11ed-8120-83df4dacd2fa.html" data-nav="82bb46c8-d3cc-11ed-8120-83df4dacd2fa">Contests and sweepstakes</a></li><li>Photo galleries</li><li>Other Interactive</li></ul><p>For the most eyes on your content, <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

We can help you determine the type of event that will best communicate the message you are trying to convey, achieve the goals you are trying to meet, or exceed the number of sales you would like to make.</p><p>The perks of holding company-run events include:</p><ul><li><strong>Total control</strong> over every aspect of the event to ensure that everything aligns with your brand image</li><li>The potential for <strong>additional sales</strong> outside of your primary revenue streams</li><li>Establishing a <strong>stronger, more personal relationship</strong> between your business and your community</li><li>A <strong>chance to collaborate</strong> with other businesses or individuals in your community</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES</strong> can help you plan and hold winning events, <a href="https://lee.net/advertise/#contact" data-nav="contact">click here.</a></p>`

Geofencing identifies consumers within a radius of a specific address. When those people cross a boundary into the geofenced area, an ad is sent to the consumer.

                            <h2>Display</h2>
                            <p>If you asked someone to picture a digital (or online) advertisement, chances are they would picture a display ad. These ads most closely resemble the print advertisements that appear in magazines and newspapers, typically rectangular or square. They use text, images, videos or a combination of those to market a product or service.</p><p><strong>Banner ads</strong>, which appear at the top of a webpage, are a common form of display ads. They generate high visibility for an advertiser and serve an essential purpose in any campaign. Display ads may also appear elsewhere on a page. There are a few different types of display ads, all of which can be created and placed by the team at <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS.</strong> They will deliver the desired message wherever the audience consumes our content, on any screen size.</p><p><strong>Personalized and remarketing ads</strong> use data that’s been collected about customers, such as the pages they have visited on your website or a demonstrated interest in your market based on their internet and search practices, to send them ads that are specifically targeted at them. These types of display ads are an excellent way to market to customers who have already demonstrated an interest in your brand, product or service.</p><p><strong>Contextually targeted ads</strong> are ads that are placed on websites based on similarities between the ad and the site. For example, if you’re selling hiking gear, a contextually targeted ad might be placed on <em>an outdoor magazine’s</em> website. Or if your services are location-specific, the ad can be placed in a local publication. The topic and keywords included in the display ad, location preferences and the theme and focus of the host website all play a role in determining the placement of contextually targeted ads.</p><p><strong>Site-placed ads</strong> are just as they sound; no advanced analytics necessary, these ads are placed on the websites of your choice.</p><p>Display ads can be incredibly beneficial to every campaign. Some of these benefits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased visibility</strong> among customers that keeps your brand top of mind</li><li>A <strong>fast, clear way</strong> to convey your message and reach a wide range of customers</li><li>A <strong>simple, flexible format</strong> that can be adapted and reused for different placements</li><li>Typically <strong>less expensive</strong> than other more complicated and involved types of ads</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

                            <h2>Video</h2>
                            <p>Video advertising is by far one of the most popular ways to reach audiences online. Consumers love video content, so hitching your advertising wagon to video content is a surefire way to get eyes on your brand.</p><p>At <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS</strong> we offer full-service production and distribution of video advertising content. Custom created client video can include animation, branded shorts, commercials, custom content, scripting, voiceover, and drone or gimbal operator.</p><p><strong>In-stream ads</strong> are the most popular form of video advertisements. These are videos that play before, during or after another form of video content. Oftentimes, in-stream ads are interactive, encouraging viewers to click through in order to claim an offer or learn more. Other common forms include <strong>rewarded ads</strong>, which appear in video games and give users the chance to earn something by watching the video, and <strong>shoppable ads</strong> through which viewers can purchase an item immediately.</p><p>While video is an incredibly popular format, it is critical that customers find video ads to be interesting and relevant and not obtrusive and annoying, which is a line that’s very easy for a video ad to cross. This is just one reason to employ professionals like those at <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS</strong> to develop your video ads.</p><p>Like <a href="https://lee.net/display/article_c0060730-d3c6-11ed-a1e0-4f5d2a556774.html" data-nav="c0060730-d3c6-11ed-a1e0-4f5d2a556774">display ads</a> and <a href="https://lee.net/connected-tv/article_39459fba-d3c8-11ed-a513-ab7bf66d6c89.html" data-nav="39459fba-d3c8-11ed-a513-ab7bf66d6c89">connected TV ads</a>, video ads can be targeted to customers based on factors such as location, age, income, hobbies, interests and the other content they are consuming. You can also tie video ads to specific video content or formulate them around the specific platform on which you intend to display them. On TikTok, for example, video ads may be just a few seconds long, while on YouTube 15-second and 30-second ads remain popular.</p><p>Advantages of investing in video ads include:</p><ul><li>The chance to connect with customers using a <strong>dynamic and engaging format</strong> that’s easier and more fun to consume than written text</li><li>Reaching customers through the <strong>format they spend the most time consuming</strong></li><li>Owning <strong>pieces of original content</strong> that customers can share, organically expanding your reach</li><li>The ability to <strong>convey a lot of information</strong> in a very short amount of time</li><li>Content that is <strong>optimized to be consumed on mobile devices</strong></li><li><strong>Autoplay</strong> (in most cases), which ensures that customers will see at least part of your ad without actively deciding to watch it</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

                            <p>Newsletters are one of the fastest-growing formats for brands looking to connect with their customers on a personal level. A variation on <a href="https://lee.net/email/article_d8885e74-d3c7-11ed-8706-2bddfdf2d1fc.html" data-nav="d8885e74-d3c7-11ed-8706-2bddfdf2d1fc">email marketing</a>, newsletters give brands the opportunity to present products, services and offers to customers while also providing valuable related content and/or a behind-the-scenes look at the business. Indeed, while marketing emails are more focused on converting a sale, newsletters are more about fostering a strong and ongoing relationship with the customer by educating and entertaining them.</p><p>There are no rules in terms of how to format or what to include in your newsletter. It’s also up to you how often you want to send them. Some of the most popular newsletter elements include news about what’s going on at the company, information about upcoming sales or promotions, and previews of the latest blog post, case study, testimonial or e-book.</p><p>The key to creating an effective newsletter is always providing value. This is where working with the team at <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS</strong> can help. We know that sending a newsletter simply for the sake of sending it won’t increase brand engagement. The content of the newsletter must provide value that the customer wants to continue to receive each time the newsletter lands in their inbox.</p><p>Some of the benefits of sending out a newsletter include:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased trust</strong> and belief in your brand</li><li>An <strong>improved reputation</strong> as a thought leader in your industry</li><li><strong>Higher visibility</strong> among customers who will think of you first when they need your products or services</li><li>A <strong>stronger, more personal relationship</strong> between your brand and your customers, which plays a key role in turning first-time customers into long-term ones</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

                            <h2>Product Placement</h2>
                            <p><strong>Digital product placement</strong> refers to the purposeful integration of a product into another media — movie, TV show, music video, social media (influencers), video game or ad for another product.</p><p>For example, you might see a character on your favorite show or an influencer you follow on social media drinking a canned beverage with the label clearly visible. This is product placement, and the advertiser has paid for that privilege. Had they not, the can would likely say SODA or some other generic or fictional name.</p><p>The goal of product placement is to be more subtle than an ad overtly proclaiming the virtues of a brand. The intent of the placement is to draw the viewer’s attention to the brand and trigger their desire to purchase, solely because they like or identify with the person on screen.</p><p><strong>Non-digital product placement</strong> involves purchasing coveted retail space. For example, advertisers often pay more to be placed on shelves at eye level or at the ends of aisles, places more visible and convenient for shoppers. Brands may also pay “slotting fees” to limit shelf space for their competitors.</p><p>Benefits of product placement include:</p><ul><li><strong>Brand recognition and awareness</strong></li><li><strong>Less obtrusive</strong>, does not interrupt the action</li><li><strong>More cost-effective</strong> than ads in the long term</li><li><strong>Profit</strong> potential is high</li></ul><p>Though smaller businesses might not have the dollars to purchase product placement in TV and movies, <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS</strong> can help you use social media for product placement.

STUDIOS</strong> we offer access to media properties in 73 markets throughout the United States.</p><p>The primary goal of branded content is to showcase a brand’s attributes in a way readers or viewers will enjoy, whether through education or entertainment. Each piece often promotes a part of the brand’s story. Unlike news reporting, with branded content the brand has control over the messaging and approves the final draft before it goes live. Additionally, the brand owns the content and can reuse it on their own site if they wish.</p><p>A huge benefit of branded content hosted on a publisher site is that Google ranks our publisher sites higher because they are respected news sites. Therefore, stories appearing on our sites have higher views than content housed on a brand’s site with less traffic. Additionally, content on a publisher’s site casts a wider readership net — adding the publisher’s audience — rather than only reaching those who frequent the brand's site already.</p><p>Branded content has a variety of forms, including:</p><ul><li>Articles</li><li>Listicles</li><li>Infographics</li><li>Video</li><li><a href="https://lee.net/quizzes/article_59e2dacc-d3cc-11ed-add7-e3c412bb7eee.html" data-nav="59e2dacc-d3cc-11ed-add7-e3c412bb7eee">Quizzes</a></li><li><a href="https://lee.net/contests/article_82bb46c8-d3cc-11ed-8120-83df4dacd2fa.html" data-nav="82bb46c8-d3cc-11ed-8120-83df4dacd2fa">Contests and sweepstakes</a></li><li>Photo galleries</li><li>Other Interactive</li></ul><p>For the most eyes on your content, <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS </strong>can create native ads and a distribution plan targeted to your demographic and geographic needs. We also will analyze viewership data during the course of the campaign and recalibrate as needed to help you reach your content goals.</p><p>For more information about how you can best utilize branded content as well as see some of our award-winning work, please visit our branded content agency site, <strong>BRAND AVE.

                            <h2>Sponsorships</h2>
                            <p>Marketing sponsorships are an excellent way to introduce your brand to an audience that is tangentially related to or overlaps with your primary audience. They are also an indirect way to communicate your company’s values and priorities to existing and prospective customers.</p><p>A sponsorship is, in its most basic form, a public relationship between two companies. In most cases, one business sponsors a charity event, community event, trade show or entity (think youth baseball teams) run by another business or organization. The type of sponsorship you choose will determine the shape of this relationship and what it will require from your business.</p><p>At <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS</strong>, we will work with you to determine the most logical and profitable type of sponsorship for you. Media companies can pursue <strong>media sponsorships</strong>, in which you provide a platform for or coverage of another company’s event and you get advertising opportunities in return. A <strong>financial sponsorship</strong> is just as it sounds: financial support for an event in exchange for recognition. You could also do an <strong>in-kind sponsorship</strong> in which you provide free goods, services or resources for another company’s event.</p><p>Sponsorships provide numerous benefits to a marketing campaign, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased visibility and brand awareness</strong> among a wide swath of existing and potential customers</li><li>A way to <strong>develop trust and confidence</strong> in your brand among consumers who see you associated with one of their favorite companies, events or causes and then extend the trust they have in those organizations to you</li><li>Establishing a <strong>physical presence in the community</strong> that transforms your brand from an abstract entity to a group of real people</li><li><strong>Clear communication of your business’s values</strong> and goals outside of sales and growth</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

                            <p>Running your own event is another surefire way to get more eyes, ears and wallets turning toward your business. Company-run events provide an opportunity for business owners and employees to meet and connect with customers and members of their community. With so many businesses relying on a strong and cohesive online presence to help them reach customers, hosting in-person events establish personal relationships with real people, connecting your business to their everyday lives.</p><p>Depending on your type of business, events can also provide a nontraditional yet profitable sales method. For example, if you primarily sell your products online, offering them for purchase in-person at an event every few months — where customers have the chance to hold and use them before deciding to purchase — can offer a noticeable boost in sales numbers.</p><p>The team at <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES</strong> is available to help with everything from event ideation to planning and production, as well as providing advice and tools on how best to market events in the community (and beyond, depending on the type of event). We can help you determine the type of event that will best communicate the message you are trying to convey, achieve the goals you are trying to meet, or exceed the number of sales you would like to make.</p><p>The perks of holding company-run events include:</p><ul><li><strong>Total control</strong> over every aspect of the event to ensure that everything aligns with your brand image</li><li>The potential for <strong>additional sales</strong> outside of your primary revenue streams</li><li>Establishing a <strong>stronger, more personal relationship</strong> between your business and your community</li><li>A <strong>chance to collaborate</strong> with other businesses or individuals in your community</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES</strong> can help you plan and hold winning events, <a href="https://lee.net/advertise/#contact" data-nav="contact">click here.</a></p>

                            <p>Who doesn’t love winning free stuff? Offering people the opportunity to do so is an excellent way to boost audience engagement with your brand and generate new leads. But it’s not that simple: A contest or giveaway must be intelligently designed in order to attract the people who are most likely to become customers. That’s where the experts at <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS</strong> come in. We will help you choose the prize, contest design and promotion method that will best help you reach your marketing goals.</p><p>It’s crucial to offer the right prize. After all, anyone can give away a mass market gift card or the latest tablet. The prize in your contest must be specific to your target audience. That could mean offering one of the products you make and sell. Or, if you don’t sell products, the prize could be something tangential to your services. For example, a health care company or provider might offer a prize that promotes healthy habits, such as a gym membership or a free month of a healthy meal delivery service.</p><p>Contests are an easy way to collect contact information from people who can then be added to your email lists for <a href="https://lee.net/newsletters/article_97115814-d3c8-11ed-9d3d-3700a9b60f0d.html" data-nav="97115814-d3c8-11ed-9d3d-3700a9b60f0d">newsletters</a> and promotions; you want the people who enter to be those who will find value in future communications from your brand and hopefully become customers.</p><p>Additional benefits of incorporating contests and giveaways into your digital marketing strategy include:</p><ul><li>Opportunities for <strong>cross promotion with <a href="https://lee.net/product-placement/article_faf8e636-d3cc-11ed-babb-d39c8056f780.html" data-nav="faf8e636-d3cc-11ed-babb-d39c8056f780">product placement</a></strong> efforts</li><li>Potential <strong>collaboration with related businesses</strong> and subsequent sharing of customer pools</li><li><strong>Interactive and highly engaging content</strong> to share via other marketing channels</li><li>Increased <strong>engagement from previously passive followers</strong></li><li><strong>Collecting data</strong> on the types of products and promotions most appealing to your customer base</li></ul><p>For more information on how <strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE.

                            <h2>Geolocation Target</h2>
                            <p><strong>Geolocation</strong> is a means for determining a consumer’s geographical location to target them with relevant content. Whether the information is collected from GPS coordinates, IP location or past behavior, consumers receive either a targeted text message using text messaging, a triggered email or served ads.</p><p>Examples of geolocation:</p><ul><li>Small Town Grocery sends an ad to consumers who are within 5 miles of their store promoting that a dozen eggs are $1.</li><li>A-Z Sporting Goods sends a message to consumers near Big Town Sports to come to A-Z Sporting Goods for their 50%-off sale.</li><li>Happy Bar sends a message right before happy hour to let those within a certain radius know that beer on tap is $1 from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.</li></ul><p>Another form of geolocation is called geofencing, or geodistance targeting. Geofencing identifies consumers within a radius of a specific address. When those people cross a boundary into the geofenced area, an ad is sent to the consumer. Geofencing can be especially successful in places with a captive audience, such as airports, sporting events, concerts and convention centers.</p><p><strong>LEE ENTERPRISES, POWERED BY AMPLIFIED DIGITAL AND BRAND AVE. STUDIOS</strong> can use geolocation targeting to help you reach the right prospective customers at the right time. Whether that is through text messaging or ads geotargeted across the digital marketplace online, we’ll help you find the consumers you most want to reach. And using data and trends we have at our fingertips, we can recommend a strategy that is best for your needs.</p><p>For more information about how geolocation targeting can serve your brand, <a href="https://amplifieddigitalagency.com/display/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

Martin, a professor in Classics at the College of the Holy Cross. From the limited evidence of what the administration in Rome provided the soldiers, he adds, the most important source of calories were carbohydrates: barley or wheat. One source says soldiers were given one pound of meat daily. “For an army, you have to kill 120 sheep a day just for the meat ration. Or 60 hogs,” says Martin.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the exact amount, it would not be enough to sustain a Roman soldier, who was “a mule more than anything else,” says Martin. They carried very heavy gear, on bad roads, and that’s when they were not expending calories fighting. With their food, they were given wine—a diluted version of what we’re used to—or something closer to vinegar that would help reduce bacteria in their drinking water. For their supply of fat, Roman troops, unsurprisingly, looked to olive oil.</p><div class="block-story-grid"><div class="card-grid is-style-3-col"><div class="card-grid__container"></div></div></div><h2 id="crusaders">Crusaders</h2><p>During the Crusades, the average Christian soldier in a siege would have some dried meat and grain to make things like porridge. But this was the food they would have brought with them, supplemented with fruits and vegetables or cheese purchased locally. During the First Crusade, soldiers would have provided their own food stores, which they would have mortgaged their property or sold possessions to buy. Later, during crusades like those in the 14th century, called by Pope Innocent III, deals were made with the Venetian fleet and merchants to keep soldiers supplied. </p><p>During battles, "if <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/crusades">crusaders</a> got to the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-muslims-see-the-crusades-so-differently-from-christians">Muslim</a> camp they would stop fighting and start eating. And it would cost them the battle. It happened twice at the siege of Acre,” says John Hosler, associate professor of military history at the U.S. Army Command &amp; General Staff College, a medievalist military expert and author of <em>The Siege of Acre, 1189-1191</em>. At one point in the Third Crusade, an observer noted several kitchens in the sultan Saladin’s camp, with up to nine cauldrons each. Those cauldrons were substantial—Hosler points out you could fit four cows’ heads in each. The Christian invaders had nothing comparable. </p><h2 id="genghis-khan-s-mongol-warriors">Genghis Khan’s Mongol Warriors</h2><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/855/570/History_Mankind_Gehghis_Khan_redo_SF_HD_1104x622-16x9.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">Genghis Khan</div></div><button type="button" class="video-player-decoy__play" aria-label="Play Genghis Khan"><span class="video-player-decoy__play-icon"></span></button></div></div><p>The Mongol diet “was not gourmet,” says Morris Rossabi, a historian and author of <em>The Mongols and Global History</em>. In the early 13th century, when <a href="https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-genghis-khan">Genghis Khan</a> was conquering swaths of Asia (mostly in the territory we’d now call China), his horde wasn’t able to carry much. Warriors were supplied by their own households, and as territories were conquered, the Mongols came in contact with foodstuffs like wine. (Their homegrown brand of liquor was fermented mare’s milk called airag, or kumis.) </p><p>The Mongolian lands were not particularly arable, nor did the Mongols stay in one place for a long time, so fruits and vegetables weren't staples. The Mongols brought their herds of cows and sheep with them on campaigns. When herds were unavailable, the horsemen would hunt (dogs, marmots and rabbits) or subsist on dried milk curd, cured meat and both fresh and fermented mare’s milk.</p><h2 id="the-ottoman-empire-the-janissaries">The Ottoman Empire: The Janissaries</h2><figure class="wp-block-image article__contained"><div class="wp-block-image__wrapper"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"><img style="display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271024%27%20height=%27576%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 704px, calc(100vw - 2.5rem)" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_janissaries_gettyimages-873308166.jpg?width=1080&amp;height=608&amp;crop=1080%3A608%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_janissaries_gettyimages-873308166.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1152&amp;crop=2048%3A1152%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2x" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_janissaries_gettyimages-873308166.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1152&amp;crop=2048%3A1152%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span><figcaption class="image-credit wp-block-image__credit"><span>DeAgostini/Getty Images</span></figcaption></div><div class="wp-block-image__caption">&lt;strong&gt;Janissaries gathering, including a head cook and water bearer.&lt;/strong&gt;</div></figure><p>At the height of its power, in the late 17th century, the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/ottoman-empire">Ottoman Empire</a> was a massive horseshoe around the Mediterranean, including huge swaths of North Africa, the Middle East, modern-day Turkey and Eastern Europe.

Congress lacked taxing authority and thereby lacked the funds to purchase supplies. It was a problem compounded by transportation and other supply issues. The result, according to Joseph Glatthaar, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, was that soldiers would often go days without a ration. “You’d get a little flour and maybe some meat and often the meat is pretty bad,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1775, Congress determined a uniform ration that included one pound of beef (or three-quarters of a pound of pork or one pound of salted fish), and one pound of flour or bread per day; three pounds of peas or beans per week, one pint of milk per day, one pint of rice per week, one quart of spruce beer or cider per day, and a little molasses. (Later vinegar was added.) Because army leaders were rarely able to deliver, soldiers would beg from civilians and supplement with whatever animals they could find. Congress pressured Washington to seize food—paid for with low-value paper currency (effectively an IOU)—but General Washington worried the practice would alienate the colonials. </p><h2 id="napoleon-s-army">Napoleon’s Army</h2><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/images.history.com/images/media/video/history_napoleon_the_bones_of_napoleons_army_sf_1224854/History_Napoleon_The_Bones_of_Napoleons_Army_SF_still_624x352.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">The Bones of Napoleon&#x27;s Army</div></div><button type="button" class="video-player-decoy__play" aria-label="Play The Bones of Napoleon&#x27;s Army"><span class="video-player-decoy__play-icon"></span></button></div></div><p>“On campaign, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/france/napoleon">Napoleon</a>’s soldiers spent most of their time desperately hungry,” says Charles Esdaile, professor of history at University of Liverpool. When all was going to plan, French rations included 24 ounces of bread, a half-pound of meat, an ounce of rice or two ounces of dried beans or peas or lentils, a quart of wine, a gill (roughly a quarter pint) of brandy and a half gill of vinegar. (French measurements are slightly different, so these amounts are approximate.) When bread was unavailable, rough little doughboys would be made from flour, salt and water, baked in the fire, or mixed with stew. </p><p>What helped sustain French troops was that European agriculture had switched toward things like the potatoes and corn, which one can eat almost right out of the ground. “French loaves come in long sticks; baguettes,” says Esdaile. “The story is that the baguette was developed so that French soldiers could carry their bread in the legs of their trousers.”</p><h2 id="the-civil-war-union-troops">The Civil War: Union Troops</h2><figure class="wp-block-image article__contained"><div class="wp-block-image__wrapper"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"><img style="display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271024%27%20height=%27576%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 704px, calc(100vw - 2.5rem)" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=1080&amp;height=608&amp;crop=1080%3A608%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1152&amp;crop=2048%3A1152%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2x" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1152&amp;crop=2048%3A1152%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span><figcaption class="image-credit wp-block-image__credit"><span>Timothy H.

As for water, both the Union and <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/american-civil-war-history">Confederate</a> armies relied on lakes and streams. </p><h2 id="world-war-ii-the-g-i">World War II: The G.I.</h2><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/21/198/SCREENERSSD2997_GI_BIll_History_Speeches_2041_GI_Bill_Passes_June_1944_SF_HD.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">G.I.

There’s some processed cheese and some biscuits, but really they’re crackers. And you also get a matchbook.” </p><p>Rations, designed to provide three meals—and approximately 3,600 calories—each, were almost universally unpopular. Later, soldiers would get powdered drinks like lemonade and buillion, and eventually sweetened cocoa. K-Rations would have three “meals”: a breakfast, lunch and dinner with four ounces of meat and/or eggs, cheese spread, “biscuits,” candy, gum, salt tablets and a sugary drink. There were also cigarettes, a wooden spoon and toilet paper.</p><h2 id="vietnam-from-mci-to-mre">Vietnam: From MCI to MRE</h2><p>From 1958 to 1981, U.S. rations known as the Meal, Combat, Individual or MCI, were eventually replaced with Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE). In <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war">Vietnam</a>, these were distributed to combat soldiers in a cardboard box, which contained 1,200 calories through a can of meat (like ham and lima beans, or turkey loaf), a can of “bread” which could be crackers or hardtack or cookies, and a can of dessert, like applesauce, sliced peaches or pound cake. </p><p>A full ration could be bulky, so troops often disassembled it, taking what they needed on patrol by placing the cans into socks that they could tie to their packs. In his book, <em>Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy 1945-1975</em>, Max Hastings explains how meals were cooked by punching holes in a ration tin and using a C4 explosive to heat it. Hastings also writes about the pills that troops consumed daily, including a malaria tablet, salt pills that could be sucked on, as well as Lomotil tablets, taken four times per day to control diarrhea brought on by the Halazone troops used to purify their water.</p></div><footer class="article-footer article-footer--topic"><div class="author-byline article__contained has-elevation"><div class="byline__content"><div class="byline__information"><div class="byline__author-wrapper"><p class="byline__author"><span aria-hidden="true">By: </span><a aria-label="Read more articles from John Ortved" link-name="John Ortved" href="/author/john-ortved">John Ortved</a></p></div></div></div></div><hr/><div></div><div class="container--article-wide"><div class="article-footer__facts-citation"><aside class="article-sources"><h2 class="article-sources__title">Citation Information</h2><dl class="article-sources__list"><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">Article Title</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description">Soldiers’ Rations Through History: From Live Hogs to Indestructible MREs</dd></div><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">Author</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description"><a class="article-header__author" aria-label="Read more articles from John Ortved" link-name="John Ortved" href="/author/john-ortved">John Ortved</a></dd></div><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">Website Name</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description">HISTORY</dd></div><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">URL</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description"><a href="https://www.history.com/news/soldier-wartime-food-rations-battle-napoleon-vietnam">https://www.history.com/news/soldier-wartime-food-rations-battle-napoleon-vietnam</a></dd></div><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">Date Accessed</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description">May 6, 2024</dd></div><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">Publisher</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description">A&amp;E Television Networks</dd></div><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">Last Updated</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description">September 14, 2023</dd></div><div class="article-sources__pair"><dt class="article-sources__pair-title">Original Published Date</dt><dd class="article-sources__pair-description">November 20, 2018</dd></div></dl></aside><div class="article-footer__facts-wrapper"><aside class="article-fact-check"><h2 class="article-fact-check__title">Fact Check</h2><p class="article-fact-check__copy">We strive for accuracy and fairness.

Martin, a professor in Classics at the College of the Holy Cross. From the limited evidence of what the administration in Rome provided the soldiers, he adds, the most important source of calories were carbohydrates: barley or wheat. One source says soldiers were given one pound of meat daily. “For an army, you have to kill 120 sheep a day just for the meat ration. Or 60 hogs,” says Martin.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the exact amount, it would not be enough to sustain a Roman soldier, who was “a mule more than anything else,” says Martin. They carried very heavy gear, on bad roads, and that’s when they were not expending calories fighting. With their food, they were given wine—a diluted version of what we’re used to—or something closer to vinegar that would help reduce bacteria in their drinking water. For their supply of fat, Roman troops, unsurprisingly, looked to olive oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-story-grid\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"card-grid post-grid is-style-3-col \"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003carticle class=\"card-grid-item post-grid-item post-grid-item-sm-50 post-grid-item-md-33\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"card-grid-item__link\" itemprop=\"url\" aria-label=\"8 Reasons Why Rome Fell\" \u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure class=\"card-grid-item__image-fit image-fit\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"card-grid-item__image-contain image-fit__image-contain\" aria-label=\"The Course of Empire.

During the First Crusade, soldiers would have provided their own food stores, which they would have mortgaged their property or sold possessions to buy.

Congress lacked taxing authority and thereby lacked the funds to purchase supplies. It was a problem compounded by transportation and other supply issues. The result, according to Joseph Glatthaar, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, was that soldiers would often go days without a ration. “You’d get a little flour and maybe some meat and often the meat is pretty bad,” he says.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1775, Congress determined a uniform ration that included one pound of beef (or three-quarters of a pound of pork or one pound of salted fish), and one pound of flour or bread per day; three pounds of peas or beans per week, one pint of milk per day, one pint of rice per week, one quart of spruce beer or cider per day, and a little molasses. (Later vinegar was added.) Because army leaders were rarely able to deliver, soldiers would beg from civilians and supplement with whatever animals they could find.

Martin, a professor in Classics at the College of the Holy Cross. From the limited evidence of what the administration in Rome provided the soldiers, he adds, the most important source of calories were carbohydrates: barley or wheat. One source says soldiers were given one pound of meat daily. “For an army, you have to kill 120 sheep a day just for the meat ration. Or 60 hogs,” says Martin.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the exact amount, it would not be enough to sustain a Roman soldier, who was “a mule more than anything else,” says Martin. They carried very heavy gear, on bad roads, and that’s when they were not expending calories fighting. With their food, they were given wine—a diluted version of what we’re used to—or something closer to vinegar that would help reduce bacteria in their drinking water. For their supply of fat, Roman troops, unsurprisingly, looked to olive oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-story-grid\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"card-grid post-grid is-style-3-col \"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003carticle class=\"card-grid-item post-grid-item post-grid-item-sm-50 post-grid-item-md-33\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"card-grid-item__link\" itemprop=\"url\" aria-label=\"8 Reasons Why Rome Fell\" \u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure class=\"card-grid-item__image-fit image-fit\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"card-grid-item__image-contain image-fit__image-contain\" aria-label=\"The Course of Empire.

Congress lacked taxing authority and thereby lacked the funds to purchase supplies. It was a problem compounded by transportation and other supply issues. The result, according to Joseph Glatthaar, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, was that soldiers would often go days without a ration. “You’d get a little flour and maybe some meat and often the meat is pretty bad,” he says.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1775, Congress determined a uniform ration that included one pound of beef (or three-quarters of a pound of pork or one pound of salted fish), and one pound of flour or bread per day; three pounds of peas or beans per week, one pint of milk per day, one pint of rice per week, one quart of spruce beer or cider per day, and a little molasses. (Later vinegar was added.) Because army leaders were rarely able to deliver, soldiers would beg from civilians and supplement with whatever animals they could find. Congress pressured Washington to seize food—paid for with low-value paper currency (effectively an IOU)—but General Washington worried the practice would alienate the colonials. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"napoleon-s-army\"\u003eNapoleon’s Army\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“On campaign, \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/france/napoleon\"\u003eNapoleon\u003c/a\u003e’s soldiers spent most of their time desperately hungry,” says Charles Esdaile, professor of history at University of Liverpool. When all was going to plan, French rations included 24 ounces of bread, a half-pound of meat, an ounce of rice or two ounces of dried beans or peas or lentils, a quart of wine, a gill (roughly a quarter pint) of brandy and a half gill of vinegar. (French measurements are slightly different, so these amounts are approximate.) When bread was unavailable, rough little doughboys would be made from flour, salt and water, baked in the fire, or mixed with stew. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat helped sustain French troops was that European agriculture had switched toward things like the potatoes and corn, which one can eat almost right out of the ground. “French loaves come in long sticks; baguettes,” says Esdaile. “The story is that the baguette was developed so that French soldiers could carry their bread in the legs of their trousers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-civil-war-union-troops\"\u003eThe Civil War: Union Troops\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"7383\" height=\"4152\" src=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=800\u0026amp;height=400\u0026amp;crop=2:1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34475\" srcset=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=300 300w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=1024 1024w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=1536 1536w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/11/rations_civil-war_gettyimages-177602857.jpg?width=2048 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 7383px) 100vw, 7383px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eThe officers\u0026#8217; mess of Company D, 93d New York Infantry during the Civil War, circa 1863.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Union Army in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/american-civil-war-history\"\u003eAmerican Civil War\u003c/a\u003e had a standard ration: roughly three-quarters of a pound of meat, a pound of flour or cornmeal, some kind of vegetable and vinegar and molasses. “If you received the standard ration, it would be substantial,” says Glatthaar. “Over time that did not become practical; they began issuing hardtack biscuits called salt cakes, as well as salted meat and dehydrated vegetables.” These were made with flour and water and then dried so they’d last longer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring campaigns, especially as the Union soldiers moved South, seasonal fruits and vegetables, like apples and sweet potatoes, could be pillaged from orchards and farms.

Later, soldiers would get powdered drinks like lemonade and buillion, and eventually sweetened cocoa. K-Rations would have three “meals”: a breakfast, lunch and dinner with four ounces of meat and/or eggs, cheese spread, “biscuits,” candy, gum, salt tablets and a sugary drink.

In \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war\"\u003eVietnam\u003c/a\u003e, these were distributed to combat soldiers in a cardboard box, which contained 1,200 calories through a can of meat (like ham and lima beans, or turkey loaf), a can of “bread” which could be crackers or hardtack or cookies, and a can of dessert, like applesauce, sliced peaches or pound cake. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA full ration could be bulky, so troops often disassembled it, taking what they needed on patrol by placing the cans into socks that they could tie to their packs.

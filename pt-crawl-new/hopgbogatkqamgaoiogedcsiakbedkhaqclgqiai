How did you find your way to Condé Nast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI’m the head of editorial for British Vogue and have been at Condé for almost 14 years. Prior to that, I was working in indie publishing, first at a magazine called Trace, then at the Fader. I honestly wasn’t sure Condé would be the right fit for me initially. But a friend connected me to Sally Singer who was at Vogue at the time. It was in my conversations with her that I began to see how I might have a place here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you describe your job to friends and family?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like I’m so lucky to have a job that speaks to all of my passions at the same time. And I think my friends and family have always understood my need to tell the stories in fashion and culture that matter to me. It’s exhilarating and yes, sometimes quite stressful, but above all it’s so much fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe first issue of British Vogue under your leadership just came out. Do you have a guiding idea, question, or mantra that has helped you shape it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I was working on the issue I found myself thinking a lot about all the things in British culture that had shaped my style, my sense of humor, and my way of seeing the world, everything from soccer, to rave culture, to the royals. It all came into sharp focus for me maybe because I’d been away from the UK for 20 years. The bigger question I kept coming back to from a fashion perspective was this idea of the modern British eccentric and what that means now. I think twigs embodies that spirit quite perfectly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat has surprised you most about being back in the British fashion scene? How has it changed from when you last lived in the UK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt’s funny because if there’s one thing I’ve kept up with over the years in the UK, it’s the fashion scene. So much of what I like to wear every day is by British designers or creative directors, the likes of Martine Rose, Wales Bonner, Simone Rocha, and Molly Goddard. I think it’s changed enormously over the years. In fact, it’s been so encouraging to see a new generation coming up more recently. Supriya Lele and Jawara Alleyene are two designers I’m particularly excited about. Both of their brands are featured in the cover story on FKA twigs.

He’s just a phenomenal artist, and his band is great. 10/10 would see again and again.","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Wells Fargo Center","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Philadelphia, PA","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"September 20th 2018","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Syahidah","userImageUrl":"https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7682861.jpeg","properlySizedImageURL":"https://media.bandsintown.com/36x36/7682861.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/07.png","rating":4.5,"comment":"i was supposed to go but ended up bought the ticket from the wrong person(scammer) it sucks. i was there last night at the arena waiting for someone to approach me saying they got free ticket but no one ever came. but sokay i definitely will go the next time he comes here 💙 ps i was jamming alone thru the night outside the arena tho","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Axiata Arena","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"May 10th 2018","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Lynn","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/04.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/07.png","rating":3.5,"comment":"Concert was very good, however, we were very disappointed in the fact that there were no screens facing the side so that those that were not in the middle could see the front of the stage.

I don't know if I've ever had a time in my life like that were all my inhibitions were gone and I just danced and sang my heart out like that.

The Bruno Mars concert was everything I could have ever asked for and then some. The energy in the Moda Center was pure electricity as Bruno and his extremely talented band and dancers/singers pumped us up and teased the crowd to get louder. The choreography was brilliant and oh my god I simply couldn't keep myself together. I don't know if I've ever had a time in my life like that were all my inhibitions were gone and I just danced and sang my heart out like that. Bruno Mars is everything he is cracked up to be and more. The entire show including the opener, Camila Cabello, the lights, the setlist-everything made this concert one of the best nights of my life and this concert was hands down the best one I've ever seen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Katherine"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Bruno Mars","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Los Angeles, California"},"genre":"Rnb-soul","sameAs":"http://youtube.com/brunomars","description":"Download/Stream \"Leave The Door Open\" by Silk Sonic out now: https://SilkSonic.lnk.to/LTDO\nBruno Mars is a multi-talented singer, songwriter, and producer.

everything.</p>
</span></div><div class="ArticleModule__BodyWrapper-sc-zin2bb-3"><div class="ArticleModule__Body-sc-zin2bb-4 bqewWg"><p>Another year in the books – 2023 was a big one. From new ways to promote your music, to learning from artists who have been there and done that, to new ways of connecting with your most devoted fans, it’s time to celebrate your success.</p>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:0.75em" class="Type__TypeElement-goli3j-0 gOnAVZ">You Got Ready for Your Close-Up</h2><p>With more videos being uploaded and watched across multiple platforms than ever before, it can be tough for artists to cut through the noise. So <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/spotify-clips-get-started-short-form-video-stream-on"><span>we launched Clips</span></a>, under-30-second vertical videos designed to put your music front-and-center. While the goal of social videos is to get likes, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-use-clips"><span>Clips</span></a> are meant to drive streams of your music. Your fans hear directly from you and can quickly access your music immediately after watching your video on Spotify. </p>
<p><div data-testid="video-component" data-aspect-ratio="16x9" class="sc-ddjGPC sc-fxwrCY goRMGf"><iframe title="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/syH5VyVoaIQ?autoplay=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;playsinline=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div></p>
<p>And what better way for fans to view and engage with Clips than on your artist profile, album pages, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/countdown-pages-get-fans-hyped-for-your-new-album-spotify-stream-on"><span>Countdown Pages</span></a> – a destination to get your fans hyped for a new release. Here, fans can pre-save your upcoming albums, preview the tracklist, pre-order new merch, watch Clips you’ve shared, and countdown to the release moment.  </p>
<p>The best part: We gave your top fans an extra special moment with personalized messages from their top artists. As soon as your top listeners opened Wrapped, they received an exclusive video message thanking them for their support (or, in the case of SZA hinting at new music in 2024). The gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:0.75em" class="Type__TypeElement-goli3j-0 gOnAVZ">Your Campaigns Hit New High Notes</h2><p>Your goal? Finding new listeners and turning them into lifelong fans. While using social media, billboards, and out-of-home ads can help you broadly reach listeners, these tools aren’t made for music, and they aren’t designed to reach your audience where they listen. So we’re always looking for ways to help you reach the right listeners, right when it counts. </p>
<p>That’s why we launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-showcase-a-campaign-tool-to-give-your-music-its-moment-on-home"><span>Showcase</span></a>: our newest made-for-music campaign tool. With Showcase, you can promote your music – whether it’s your newest release, your deepest catalog cut, or anything in between – at any time to likely listeners across Spotify. Showcase appears as a mobile banner at the top of Spotify’s Home – the most visited place on the app, where millions of listeners come to decide what to listen to, resulting in billions of streams each day. On average, people who see a Showcase are six times more likely to stream the promoted release. </p>

<p>With the addition of Showcase, Spotify now offers artists and their teams a robust set of tools made for helping music marketers achieve the goals that matter most.

We&#39;re excited to make it the single most effective toolkit to help you grow your audience. Each tool is designed to help you reach the right listeners, drive engagement when they&#39;re listening to music, and measure the impact on audience streaming. Just take it from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-thuy-made-it"><span>independent artist thuy’s</span></a> team (manager Anh Vu and Venice Music’s Isobel Kelly): after using Discovery Mode and Marquee over the course of 15 months and multiple releases, thuy’s monthly active listeners grew by over 300% and reached 178 countries. </p>

So when a fan is listening to your music, they can browse (and buy) your merch as well. And speaking of new, we also revamped your artist profile with new tabs for music, merch and events – putting an extra spotlight on your offers and helping you earn more revenue from Spotify.</p>

We now offer a closer look at your unique listeners from the past two years, splitting out your active audience from your previously active and programmed audiences. That’s because understanding your total audience can help you identify growth areas and measure how effectively you’re converting more casual listeners into true fans over time. And because targeting the right audience is at the heart of any strong marketing strategy, we made these new segments available for targeting with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/marquee"><span>Marquee</span></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/showcase"><span>Showcase</span></a> campaigns.</p>

<h2 style="padding-bottom:0.75em" class="Type__TypeElement-goli3j-0 gOnAVZ">You Had a Way with Words</h2><p>Whether you’re a performing artist, songwriter, or producer, you deserve recognition for your contributions to the music you’ve helped create. That’s where the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/songwriting"><span>songwriting hub</span></a> comes in – for the people who make music happen. Our one-stop shop for resources, opportunities, and creative inspiration helps showcase your work and power your career. Take for instance, our new <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/a-new-way-to-share-the-songs-youve-written-on-spotify"><span>Songwriter Promo Cards</span></a>: customizable graphics you can create to promote yourself as a songwriter and highlight the songs you’ve written, allowing for even more exposure of your written works than ever before. </p>
<p>We’ve also seen a significant increase in how often labels and distributors credit songwriters on their new releases – great news in terms of increased visibility for artists, songwriters, and producers alike. Our clickable, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/a-new-way-to-share-the-songs-youve-written-on-spotify"><span>in-app song credits</span></a> on Spotify enable fans, fellow creators, publishers, and music supervisors to dive deeper into the music they love, discovering those who have had a hand in its creation. </p>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:0.75em" class="Type__TypeElement-goli3j-0 gOnAVZ">You Stayed Curious</h2><p>On a final note, we have to give credit where credit is due: the fans. Because they’re the ones who make everything happen. We even defined a new segment made up of your very biggest fans: the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/edition/super-listeners"><span>super listeners</span></a>. Making up 2% of an artist’s monthly listeners – and accounting for over 18% of monthly streams – these avid listeners couldn’t go unnoticed. In July, we released our newest edition of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/"><span>Fan Study</span></a> centered around the habits of these diehards and their impact, from buying power (on average, that 2% of your monthly listeners accounts for more than half of your merch purchases), to whether or not they’re in it for the long haul (our sources say yes: over two-thirds of super listeners will still be streaming your music after a six-month stretch.) But super listeners have to start somewhere. We found that after an artist releases new music, artists saw their number of super listeners increase, on average, by over 20%.</p>
<p>Even rapper, singer, songwriter, and producer Russ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMCFX6oXUe8"><span>shared his journey of getting to know his fans on a deeper level</span></a>. “I’ve tried to dive deeper into my fanbase the bigger I’ve gotten,” he says. “Knowing I have 9% of my fans are super listeners on Spotify, I think it’s a testament to staying connected with my fans.” </p>

<p>Plus, because we believe you should know where your money is coming from (and where it’s going), we released the latest edition of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/"><span>Loud &amp; Clear</span></a>. One takeaway? In 2022, 10,000+ artists from 100+ countries generated $100,000+ in royalties on Spotify. We’re the only streaming service that makes this level of royalty data available to all artists, and we broke down all the details in our annual study.   </p>
<p>We heard from even more of our artist friends throughout the year on season 2 of our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/show/16AIaZJgLsQWI9gzRRsgdd"><span>Best Advice</span></a> podcast, kicking things off with Grammy-nominated Maggie Rogers, who offered <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/maggie-rogers-best-advice-podcast-songwriting-collaboration-music"><span>her thoughts</span></a> on everything from writer’s block to the pressure to go viral, plus sage words from Mumford &amp; Sons. The jam-packed season also included episodes with Rina Sawayama, Lykki Li, and the legend that is Nile Rodgers, to name a few. With so much incredible guidance from industry vets who graciously showed a more vulnerable side during our intimate episodes, we knew we wanted to share more. In observance of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0kwmU4dXIFbtOD8T0vDtlt?si=206115a91fd1491c"><span>World Mental Health Day</span></a>, we released a special episode highlighting two season’s worth of artists sharing their experiences and advice around mental health. From rituals to routines, external and internal pressure, and, of course, social media and the internet, we covered it all with guests like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5GfKW8MsHa0SXBSm3mlWbF?si=acTL2BshQnC2dCg1plo2Mg"><span>Diplo</span></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3DNl08J2fxxo5k2rV9mih9"><span>Larry June</span></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qUWMAkXMSMGKOZxETShGH"><span>Kim Petras</span></a> and more.</p>

Your fans hear directly from you and can quickly access your music immediately after watching your video on Spotify. \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/syH5VyVoaIQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAnd what better way for fans to view and engage with Clips than on your artist profile, album pages, or [Countdown Pages](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/countdown-pages-get-fans-hyped-for-your-new-album-spotify-stream-on) – a destination to get your fans hyped for a new release. Here, fans can pre-save your upcoming albums, preview the tracklist, pre-order new merch, watch Clips you’ve shared, and countdown to the release moment.  \n\nThe best part: We gave your top fans an extra special moment with personalized messages from their top artists. As soon as your top listeners opened Wrapped, they received an exclusive video message thanking them for their support (or, in the case of SZA hinting at new music in 2024). The gift that keeps on giving.\n\n## Your Campaigns Hit New High Notes\n\nYour goal? Finding new listeners and turning them into lifelong fans. While using social media, billboards, and out-of-home ads can help you broadly reach listeners, these tools aren’t made for music, and they aren’t designed to reach your audience where they listen. So we’re always looking for ways to help you reach the right listeners, right when it counts. \n\nThat’s why we launched [Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-showcase-a-campaign-tool-to-give-your-music-its-moment-on-home): our newest made-for-music campaign tool. With Showcase, you can promote your music – whether it’s your newest release, your deepest catalog cut, or anything in between – at any time to likely listeners across Spotify. Showcase appears as a mobile banner at the top of Spotify’s Home – the most visited place on the app, where millions of listeners come to decide what to listen to, resulting in billions of streams each day. On average, people who see a Showcase are six times more likely to stream the promoted release. \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZjOjrTvBEY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nWith the addition of Showcase, Spotify now offers artists and their teams a robust set of tools made for helping music marketers achieve the goals that matter most. And that’s why we launched [Campaign Kit](https://artists.spotify.com/campaign-kit), to help bring together all of our campaign tools — [playlist pitching](https://artists.spotify.com/playlisting), [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode), [Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/showcase) and [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) — under one umbrella. We're excited to make it the single most effective toolkit to help you grow your audience. Each tool is designed to help you reach the right listeners, drive engagement when they're listening to music, and measure the impact on audience streaming. Just take it from [independent artist thuy’s](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-thuy-made-it) team (manager Anh Vu and Venice Music’s Isobel Kelly): after using Discovery Mode and Marquee over the course of 15 months and multiple releases, thuy’s monthly active listeners grew by over 300% and reached 178 countries. \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/58rQ1x5v8Y4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## You Put Merch in the Spotlight\n\nWho doesn’t love a little retail therapy? And when it also supports an artist they love, fans just can’t resist. Enter: the personalized [Merch hub](https://pr-newsroom-wp.appspot.com/2023-10-16/shop-find-all-artist-merch-hub-spotify-app-shopify/). Spotify’s newest shoppable destination provides personalized recommendations based on your fans’ listening habits and allows them to browse, click, and purchase through Shopify. Plus, you can now [tag merch to a release](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/spotify-merch-guide), which means your merch will appear on the corresponding release page and on the [Now Playing view](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery) for every track included on the release. So when a fan is listening to your music, they can browse (and buy) your merch as well. And speaking of new, we also revamped your artist profile with new tabs for music, merch and events – putting an extra spotlight on your offers and helping you earn more revenue from Spotify.\n\n## You Got Personal(ized)\n\nUnderstanding who your music is resonating with is one of the most crucial aspects of building your career as an artist. And when it comes to the data about your listeners, we believe that nuance matters. This year, we introduced [new audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery). We now offer a closer look at your unique listeners from the past two years, splitting out your active audience from your previously active and programmed audiences. That’s because understanding your total audience can help you identify growth areas and measure how effectively you’re converting more casual listeners into true fans over time. And because targeting the right audience is at the heart of any strong marketing strategy, we made these new segments available for targeting with [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) and [Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/showcase) campaigns.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-y_qmt7w_0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## You Had a Way with Words\n\nWhether you’re a performing artist, songwriter, or producer, you deserve recognition for your contributions to the music you’ve helped create. That’s where the [songwriting hub](https://artists.spotify.com/songwriting) comes in – for the people who make music happen. Our one-stop shop for resources, opportunities, and creative inspiration helps showcase your work and power your career. Take for instance, our new [Songwriter Promo Cards](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/a-new-way-to-share-the-songs-youve-written-on-spotify): customizable graphics you can create to promote yourself as a songwriter and highlight the songs you’ve written, allowing for even more exposure of your written works than ever before. \n\nWe’ve also seen a significant increase in how often labels and distributors credit songwriters on their new releases – great news in terms of increased visibility for artists, songwriters, and producers alike. Our clickable, [in-app song credits](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/a-new-way-to-share-the-songs-youve-written-on-spotify) on Spotify enable fans, fellow creators, publishers, and music supervisors to dive deeper into the music they love, discovering those who have had a hand in its creation. \n\n## You Stayed Curious\n\nOn a final note, we have to give credit where credit is due: the fans. Because they’re the ones who make everything happen. We even defined a new segment made up of your very biggest fans: the [super listeners](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/edition/super-listeners). Making up 2% of an artist’s monthly listeners – and accounting for over 18% of monthly streams – these avid listeners couldn’t go unnoticed. In July, we released our newest edition of [Fan Study](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/) centered around the habits of these diehards and their impact, from buying power (on average, that 2% of your monthly listeners accounts for more than half of your merch purchases), to whether or not they’re in it for the long haul (our sources say yes: over two-thirds of super listeners will still be streaming your music after a six-month stretch.) But super listeners have to start somewhere. We found that after an artist releases new music, artists saw their number of super listeners increase, on average, by over 20%.\n\nEven rapper, singer, songwriter, and producer Russ [shared his journey of getting to know his fans on a deeper level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMCFX6oXUe8). “I’ve tried to dive deeper into my fanbase the bigger I’ve gotten,” he says. “Knowing I have 9% of my fans are super listeners on Spotify, I think it’s a testament to staying connected with my fans.” \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FaRNobJrUcU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nPlus, because we believe you should know where your money is coming from (and where it’s going), we released the latest edition of [Loud \u0026 Clear](https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/). One takeaway? In 2022, 10,000+ artists from 100+ countries generated $100,000+ in royalties on Spotify. We’re the only streaming service that makes this level of royalty data available to all artists, and we broke down all the details in our annual study.   \n\nWe heard from even more of our artist friends throughout the year on season 2 of our [Best Advice](https://open.spotify.com/show/16AIaZJgLsQWI9gzRRsgdd) podcast, kicking things off with Grammy-nominated Maggie Rogers, who offered [her thoughts](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/maggie-rogers-best-advice-podcast-songwriting-collaboration-music) on everything from writer’s block to the pressure to go viral, plus sage words from Mumford \u0026 Sons. The jam-packed season also included episodes with Rina Sawayama, Lykki Li, and the legend that is Nile Rodgers, to name a few. With so much incredible guidance from industry vets who graciously showed a more vulnerable side during our intimate episodes, we knew we wanted to share more. In observance of [World Mental Health Day](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0kwmU4dXIFbtOD8T0vDtlt?si=206115a91fd1491c), we released a special episode highlighting two season’s worth of artists sharing their experiences and advice around mental health. From rituals to routines, external and internal pressure, and, of course, social media and the internet, we covered it all with guests like [Diplo](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5GfKW8MsHa0SXBSm3mlWbF?si=acTL2BshQnC2dCg1plo2Mg), [Larry June](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3DNl08J2fxxo5k2rV9mih9), [Kim Petras](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qUWMAkXMSMGKOZxETShGH) and more.\n\n\u003ciframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/0kwmU4dXIFbtOD8T0vDtlt\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nWe sign off our newsletter notes the same way every time: “Thanks for joining us.” And we mean it. This journey is what it is because of what we accomplish together, and we can’t wait to see where we go next. \n\nSee you in 2024 — it’s gonna be great!

Knowing these differences is key to grasping your Spotify audience and reaching your goals.\n\nWhen we introduced audience segmentation to Spotify for Artists, the goal was to offer fresh insights into audience engagement levels. We want to  help you see how listeners progress from discovering your music to becoming loyal fans.\n\nWe've since expanded the Segments tab to give you detailed stats on each segment's size, how they change over time, and their contributions to monthly stream counts. \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-y_qmt7w_0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis guide covers all you need to know about audience segments and the metrics on the Segments tab, empowering you to understand your listeners better and make informed decisions to reach your goals.\n\n## Segments\n\nOn the Segments tab, you'll see your unique listeners from the past two years — we refer to this as your total audience. It's our most extensive view of your music's reach. This includes your active, previously active, and programmed audience. These segments paint a fuller picture of your audience by showing who's intentionally seeking out and streaming your music, and who is listening more passively.\n\nHere's a breakdown of these segments and why they're important:\n\n1. __Active Audience:__ These are valuable listeners who intentionally streamed your music in the past 28 days from active sources like your artist profile, single and album pages, and their own playlists or library. On average, they make up 33% of your total audience but *drive 60% of your streams and 80% of merch purchases through Spotify.* You want to keep them engaged to ensure they continue listening and stay in your active audience.\n\n   - __Super listeners:__ These are your most dedicated listeners in the past 28 days. They're also the most likely to keep streaming your music in the next three months, more than any other segment in your total audience. Super listeners are your biggest fans on Spotify and a key measure of fandom.\n\n   - __Moderate listeners:__ These are active listeners who intentionally   streamed your music multiple times in the past 28 days. Although they're not as engaged as super listeners, there's potential for them to develop into super listeners over time.\n\n   - __Light listeners:__ These are active listeners who streamed your music once or a couple of times in the past 28 days. While they're not heavily engaged like moderate or super listeners, there's potential for them to become more engaged over time.\n\n2.  __Previously active audience:__ These listeners were part of your active audience in the past two years but haven't intentionally streamed your music in the past 28 days.\n\n3. __Programmed audience:__ These listeners haven't intentionally streamed your music in the past two years. However, at least once in the past two years, they have streamed your music from programmed sources such as editorial playlists, personalized playlists, Radio \u0026 Autoplay, or playlists created by other listeners.\n\nGrowing your active audience, especially super listeners, significantly impacts your streaming numbers and long-term audience retention. However, don't overlook the importance of your previously active and programmed audiences.\n\nListeners in your previously active audience have already shown interest in your music by actively streaming it in the past, making them easier to re-engage. On the other hand, listeners in your programmed audience may be discovering your music for the first time through channels like editorial playlists or radio, so they may be primed to go deeper into your catalog in the future and join your active audience.\n\n## Listener Conversion Metrics\n\nWhen a listener starts streaming your music, they enter one of your audience segments, but that's not necessarily where they'll stay. As they discover your music on Spotify playlists, stream from your artist profile, or save it to their libraries, they transition between segments.\n\nListener conversion metrics track these changes every month, and gauge your success at turning casual listeners into dedicated fans over time.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Seddf8oB0mw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n- __New listeners:__ These are listeners who hadn't streamed your music on Spotify in the past two years but have now joined your total audience. Now you can measure how many new people your music is reaching each month on Spotify.\n\n- __New active listeners:__ These listeners joined your active audience after not intentionally streaming your music for at least two years. Their active streams might be the first time they’ve listened to your music, or they might have transitioned from streaming from only programmed sources. New active listeners will be included in your active audience numbers.\n\n- __Reactivated listeners:__ These listeners have rejoined your active audience after a period of inactivity of at least one month. As you reactivate more listeners, you'll notice your previously active audience segment shrinking and your active audience growing.\n\n## Share of Streams\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3L0Dx4KyBngY0Dg739Lhe2/f465efe028de58568688c995b859d22e/ToggleTool.png)\n\nUse the share of streams tool to grasp how different segments influence your streaming numbers. This tool provides data on how much each segment contributes to your streams in the past 28 days. By toggling between your share of audience and share of streams, you can see the streams driven by listeners in each segment, helping you understand their importance. \n\nThe data on the Segments tab helps you track your audience across various stages of fandom, from new listeners to loyal fans. Listener conversion metrics create a feedback loop connecting your marketing and release strategies to audience growth and re-engagement, which is essential for building long-term success.\n\nStart getting to know your Spotify audience by checking out the [segments tab](https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/audience/segments) on Spotify for Artists. \n","modules":[{"title":"Recirculation Module ","headline":"See More ","items":[{"title":"Making the Most of the ‘Now Playing’ View to Encourage Discovery","description":"Four actions artists can take on each of their songs to take advantage of the new Now Playing listener experience.","metadataTitle":"Making the Most of the ‘Now Playing’ View to Encourage Discovery","metadataDescription":"Making the Most of the ‘Now Playing’ View to Encourage Discovery","urlSlug":"making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery","releaseDate":"2023-05-09T09:50:00+0800","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"74ivlL7CFhFijbdz3MJiCp"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Five actions artists can take on each of their songs to take advantage of the Now Playing listener experience.","article":"As an artist, building a successful career is as much about creating music as it is about engaging your audience. If you are able to connect with listeners on a deeper level, you have the opportunity to turn them into real fans. On Spotify, you can showcase your creativity in a variety of ways, no matter what stage you’re at in your career. Whether it’s your newest track, an album anniversary, your latest merch drop, or upcoming tour dates, you can celebrate and promote it all on Spotify. \n\nWe call the space that listeners see when streaming a song on Spotify the Now Playing view. The Now Playing view was crafted to encourage discovery for listeners and to help artists form deeper connections with their audiences. Some listeners already know who you are and are coming to Spotify to listen to your music, but others may discover your work via our personalized programming or because your song is featured on a playlist. This means that a potential new fan is always at your fingertips.\n\nImagine your song is on a playlist, the listener likes what they hear, and they pull out their phone because they want to find out more. The Now Playing view presents the perfect moment to capture that listener’s attention by allowing them to dive deeper into your world. Listeners can not only find out what they’re listening to, but also who they’re listening to – with the artist’s bio, Canvas, lyrics, song credits, merch, and upcoming concerts. \n\nHere are five actions you can take to make the most out of the Now Playing view:\n\n## 1. Upload a Canvas\n\n[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us) is a great way to draw listeners in through short, looping visuals that you can add to your tracks on Spotify. They’re like album artwork, for the streaming age. By [uploading a Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-upload-your-canvas), you have the opportunity to grab the listener’s attention and share the creative vision to your song, which can entice them to dive deeper. Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlist when they see a Canvas. \n\n![Upload a Canvas](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7b5HjQDFhIIXUcq35cglsL/5bfe6f2c6061a8b2607b2b4750ce3fdc/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_Canvas_1280x720.jpg)\n\n## 2. Tag Merch Associated with Your Albums or Singles \n\n[Merch and music are better together](https://artists.spotify.com/merch). For fans, buying merch can be an emotional experience and a way to connect with their favorite artists on a deeper level. When you tag your merch to a release, it will now show up within the Now Playing view which means that while a listener is experiencing your music, they can also browse (and buy) a physical representation of your music as well.\n\nWhen you tag a piece of merch to an album, it will automatically be linked to every song included on that album within the Now Playing view, and it only takes [a few easy steps](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch?ref=sug_Help%20List\u0026category=artist-profile\u0026q=shopify%20merch).\n\nSome other things to keep in mind: \n\n- A merch item can also be tagged with multiple releases, so if a track appears on more than one release, go ahead and tag both!\n- Once the release has been delivered and is visible within Spotify for Artists, you can tag your merch pre-release so that it’s accessible the very first time a listener presses play.\n- Spotify will automatically associate merch items to releases if the name of the release is in the name of the merch item — but manually tagged merch items will be listed first on release pages. \n- Merch tagging is only available to items listed through our Shopify integration.\n\n[*Watch how mehro thinks about creating his merch and selling it on Spotify*](https://artists.spotify.com/video/mehro-merch-how-they-made-it).\n\n![Tag merch associated with your albums or singles](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/HvG2WWEZ81nk8At2qVuyK/cb9e3caa26daefa6f840927debc70a08/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_Merch_1280x720.jpg)\n\n## 3. Make Sure Your Artist Bio Is Up to Date \n\nIntroductions are key and artist bios on Spotify are an opportunity for you to let your fans know who you are in your own words. Your artist bio will now appear under “About the artist,” alongside a follow button, allowing listeners to easily follow your artist profile. Your artist image, [which you can upload via Spotify for Artists](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-change-your-artist-image), appears behind the bio. You can upload your bio by following [these steps](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-update-your-bio), and make sure to [check out our tips](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/the-dos-and-donts-of-writing-your-spotify-bio) for making the most out of those 1500 characters to tell your fans your story.\n\n![Upload your bio ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/39abQCVasegUSSE2GNswNj/b11e392da6163e0cc5267012c6e0b8fd/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_ArtistBio_1280x720_02.jpg)\n\n## 4. Include Song Credits When You Distribute Your Music\n\nWhether you’re a performing artist, songwriter, or producer, you deserve recognition for your contributions to the music you’ve helped create. Plus, fans love getting to know the people who had a hand in making the songs they love –  song credits are here to help make those connections. Mobile app users can see and interact with song credits right within the Now Playing view.\n\nWe show information supplied to us by your distributor or record label. In order to ensure your credits appear properly, check to make sure the correct metadata was submitted, and that your credits are up to date.  For songwriters or producers with a Songwriter Page, make sure your publishing info is correct with your publisher. Additionally, if you’re an artist self-releasing through a distributor, you can ensure your credits are in order right as you’re submitting your music.\n\nSong credits in the Now Playing view display three creators of the track, while the expanded view shows all creators listed. Listeners can follow Spotify artist profiles for artists with connected pages directly via the Now Playing view, and the expanded view offers navigation to connected Songwriter Pages where these are enabled.\n\n![Include song credits](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7rmEkVVpbU1iYMkViPkTPm/fdb64b8207bb3354158b281d28febf2c/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_SongCredits_1280x720.png)\n\n## 5. Connect Your Tickets and Lyrics to Your Artist Profile \n\nLetting people know when your next live show is and giving them the opportunity to discover your lyrics is a great way to turn listeners into fans, and under the new Now Playing view, both live show listings and lyrics are accessible all in one place. \n\nMake sure that your tickets are listed through one of our [third party ticketing partners](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-concerts-and-festivals?ref=sug_Help%20List\u0026category=artist-profile\u0026q=tickets) – this way listeners can find out when you’re playing near them, right while they’re listening to your music. To make sure your tickets are syncing to Spotify properly, view the On Tour section of your artist profile. Those same listings will be featured on the Now Playing view.\n\nYou can connect your lyrics by following [these steps](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/lyrics?ref=sug_Help%20List\u0026category=artist-profile\u0026q=lyrics) and using Musixmatch's free offering to make sure your fans can sing along. Fans even have the option to share snippets of your lyrics to social media platforms with share cards. Note: availability of lyrics may vary by territory and licensor.

Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Let's take a tour through the artist profile to learn how to set yourself up for success, and ultimately draw fans in. All of your profile content can be found under three main tabs: Music, Events, and Merch. Below is a breakdown of each tab: \n\n__Fan Support__ lets you highlight a fundraising destination — for yourself, your team, or a cause — by setting up a Fan Support link via Spotify for Artists and by following these [best practices](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/best-practices-for-the-artist-fundraising-pick). \n\n__Popular__ showcases your top tracks automatically ranked based on the number of all-time and recent streams. They update every 24 hours. You can’t manually change your popular tracks.\n\n__Artist Pick__ helps you spotlight what's important to you – be it your release, a playlist, show announcements, merch, or a podcast – which you can set or change at any time in [Spotify for Artists](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/fan-support/). By default, your Artist Pick will expire after six months, so remember to change it up to keep it fresh for your fans. You can add an artist comment to your Pick, as well, to give additional context.\n\n__Popular releases__ spotlights your most-streamed albums, EPs, and singles, accounting for recency as well.\n\n__Featuring__  displays the playlists you appear on, both editorial and algorithmic, such as “This Is…” and radio playlists.\n\n__Clips__ lets you give fans more insight into you and your music. You can upload [Clips](https://clips.byspotify.com/): under-30-second vertical videos that allow you to express your artistry and invite fans into your creative process, all while keeping your music front-and-center. *Clips is currently in beta and we are continuing to unlock this feature for thousands of artists. *\n\n__About__ is where your artist bio lives. Make sure to keep your bio up-to-date by following [these steps](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-update-your-bio), and [check out our tips](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/the-dos-and-donts-of-writing-your-spotify-bio) for making the most out of those 1500 characters. If you add photos to your [image gallery](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/managing-artist-images/) or set up your social links (Facebook, X, Instagram, and Wikipedia), those will show in your About section, too\n\n__Artist Playlists__ let you feature any playlist on your artist profile. Show a playlist your music’s been added to, or just what you’re into – [learn more here](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/artist-playlists/).\n\n__Fans Also Like__ recommends artists that your fans might be interested in based on your sound and their listening habits. We’re recently updated Fans Also Like so now, even more artists will have a Fans Also Like section on their profile, and the data will more accurately reflect what your fans are listening to. We’ll continue refining the feature to ensure even greater accuracy over time.\n\n__Appears On__ shows the albums and compilations that you have been a contributor on as an artist, songwriter, or producer. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/Zk2UTnKz0IU0srDtfvuUr/7cdf0800ebb1ba06722247a3122e70d1/Static2_16x9-blue.png)\n\n## Events \nNothing beats connecting with your fans in real life, and to highlight those opportunities for your listeners, your live and upcoming events now have their own home right on your artist profile. Fans can visit this tab to discover your events happening near them. Fans can see up to five of your upcoming and nearby shows so they can browse, save for later by using the ‘Interested’ button, purchase tickets while they are listening to your music, right on Spotify. These events are automatically updated from our [third party](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-concerts-and-festivals?ref=sug_Help%20List\u0026category=artist-profile\u0026q=tickets) ticketing partners. \n\nTesting a dedicated events tab resulted in a 70% surge in user engagement with concerts on platform, which, in turn, led to an 15% increase in users purchasing concert tickets. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6wldvqEf7rdoLHlUeBnzGG/0ffff35d502a27c5106d84c35e68ee3b/Static3_16x9-blue.png)\n\n## Merch \nWe’ve said it before and we’ll say it again; [merch](https://artists.spotify.com/merch) and music are better together!

You can give up to two items top billing on the merch tab by “pinning” them in Spotify for Artists. Otherwise, your most recently listed items will appear first. Our testing has shown that featuring your merch in a dedicated tab and showing more items results in more fan interactions and merch purchases. We saw a 22% increase in users purchasing a merch item when visiting the merch tab on an artist’s profile. \n\nFor fans, finding your merch on Spotify is easier than ever. To learn more about listing your products and to get set up, check out our [Merch Getting Started guide](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/spotify-merch-guide). \n\nFrom first impressions to deepening connections with existing fans, your artist profile is a great way to show off the world around your music on Spotify. Make sure you’re capitalizing on this important moment of discovery and connection by making the most of the tools and features available to you on Spotify for Artists. We’re continuing to test and introduce exciting new features, so stay tuned for updates. \n\n*Note: the tab design is available on the Spotify mobile app*\n","modules":[{"title":"Artist Profile recirculation ","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Related Stories ","items":[{"title":"Making the Most of the ‘Now Playing’ View to Encourage Discovery","description":"Four actions artists can take on each of their songs to take advantage of the new Now Playing listener experience.","metadataTitle":"Making the Most of the ‘Now Playing’ View to Encourage Discovery","metadataDescription":"Making the Most of the ‘Now Playing’ View to Encourage Discovery","urlSlug":"making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery","releaseDate":"2023-05-09T09:50:00+0800","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"74ivlL7CFhFijbdz3MJiCp"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Five actions artists can take on each of their songs to take advantage of the Now Playing listener experience.","article":"As an artist, building a successful career is as much about creating music as it is about engaging your audience. If you are able to connect with listeners on a deeper level, you have the opportunity to turn them into real fans. On Spotify, you can showcase your creativity in a variety of ways, no matter what stage you’re at in your career. Whether it’s your newest track, an album anniversary, your latest merch drop, or upcoming tour dates, you can celebrate and promote it all on Spotify. \n\nWe call the space that listeners see when streaming a song on Spotify the Now Playing view. The Now Playing view was crafted to encourage discovery for listeners and to help artists form deeper connections with their audiences. Some listeners already know who you are and are coming to Spotify to listen to your music, but others may discover your work via our personalized programming or because your song is featured on a playlist. This means that a potential new fan is always at your fingertips.\n\nImagine your song is on a playlist, the listener likes what they hear, and they pull out their phone because they want to find out more. The Now Playing view presents the perfect moment to capture that listener’s attention by allowing them to dive deeper into your world. Listeners can not only find out what they’re listening to, but also who they’re listening to – with the artist’s bio, Canvas, lyrics, song credits, merch, and upcoming concerts. \n\nHere are five actions you can take to make the most out of the Now Playing view:\n\n## 1. Upload a Canvas\n\n[Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us) is a great way to draw listeners in through short, looping visuals that you can add to your tracks on Spotify. They’re like album artwork, for the streaming age. By [uploading a Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-upload-your-canvas), you have the opportunity to grab the listener’s attention and share the creative vision to your song, which can entice them to dive deeper. Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlist when they see a Canvas. \n\n![Upload a Canvas](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7b5HjQDFhIIXUcq35cglsL/5bfe6f2c6061a8b2607b2b4750ce3fdc/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_Canvas_1280x720.jpg)\n\n## 2. Tag Merch Associated with Your Albums or Singles \n\n[Merch and music are better together](https://artists.spotify.com/merch). For fans, buying merch can be an emotional experience and a way to connect with their favorite artists on a deeper level. When you tag your merch to a release, it will now show up within the Now Playing view which means that while a listener is experiencing your music, they can also browse (and buy) a physical representation of your music as well.\n\nWhen you tag a piece of merch to an album, it will automatically be linked to every song included on that album within the Now Playing view, and it only takes [a few easy steps](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch?ref=sug_Help%20List\u0026category=artist-profile\u0026q=shopify%20merch).\n\nSome other things to keep in mind: \n\n- A merch item can also be tagged with multiple releases, so if a track appears on more than one release, go ahead and tag both!\n- Once the release has been delivered and is visible within Spotify for Artists, you can tag your merch pre-release so that it’s accessible the very first time a listener presses play.\n- Spotify will automatically associate merch items to releases if the name of the release is in the name of the merch item — but manually tagged merch items will be listed first on release pages. \n- Merch tagging is only available to items listed through our Shopify integration.\n\n[*Watch how mehro thinks about creating his merch and selling it on Spotify*](https://artists.spotify.com/video/mehro-merch-how-they-made-it).\n\n![Tag merch associated with your albums or singles](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/HvG2WWEZ81nk8At2qVuyK/cb9e3caa26daefa6f840927debc70a08/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_Merch_1280x720.jpg)\n\n## 3. Make Sure Your Artist Bio Is Up to Date \n\nIntroductions are key and artist bios on Spotify are an opportunity for you to let your fans know who you are in your own words. Your artist bio will now appear under “About the artist,” alongside a follow button, allowing listeners to easily follow your artist profile. Your artist image, [which you can upload via Spotify for Artists](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-change-your-artist-image), appears behind the bio. You can upload your bio by following [these steps](https://artists.spotify.com/video/how-to-update-your-bio), and make sure to [check out our tips](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/the-dos-and-donts-of-writing-your-spotify-bio) for making the most out of those 1500 characters to tell your fans your story.\n\n![Upload your bio ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/39abQCVasegUSSE2GNswNj/b11e392da6163e0cc5267012c6e0b8fd/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_ArtistBio_1280x720_02.jpg)\n\n## 4. Include Song Credits When You Distribute Your Music\n\nWhether you’re a performing artist, songwriter, or producer, you deserve recognition for your contributions to the music you’ve helped create. Plus, fans love getting to know the people who had a hand in making the songs they love –  song credits are here to help make those connections. Mobile app users can see and interact with song credits right within the Now Playing view.\n\nWe show information supplied to us by your distributor or record label. In order to ensure your credits appear properly, check to make sure the correct metadata was submitted, and that your credits are up to date.  For songwriters or producers with a Songwriter Page, make sure your publishing info is correct with your publisher. Additionally, if you’re an artist self-releasing through a distributor, you can ensure your credits are in order right as you’re submitting your music.\n\nSong credits in the Now Playing view display three creators of the track, while the expanded view shows all creators listed. Listeners can follow Spotify artist profiles for artists with connected pages directly via the Now Playing view, and the expanded view offers navigation to connected Songwriter Pages where these are enabled.\n\n![Include song credits](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7rmEkVVpbU1iYMkViPkTPm/fdb64b8207bb3354158b281d28febf2c/S4A_NPV_Blog_GracieAbrams_SongCredits_1280x720.png)\n\n## 5. Connect Your Tickets and Lyrics to Your Artist Profile \n\nLetting people know when your next live show is and giving them the opportunity to discover your lyrics is a great way to turn listeners into fans, and under the new Now Playing view, both live show listings and lyrics are accessible all in one place. \n\nMake sure that your tickets are listed through one of our [third party ticketing partners](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-concerts-and-festivals?ref=sug_Help%20List\u0026category=artist-profile\u0026q=tickets) – this way listeners can find out when you’re playing near them, right while they’re listening to your music. To make sure your tickets are syncing to Spotify properly, view the On Tour section of your artist profile. Those same listings will be featured on the Now Playing view.\n\nYou can connect your lyrics by following [these steps](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/lyrics?ref=sug_Help%20List\u0026category=artist-profile\u0026q=lyrics) and using Musixmatch's free offering to make sure your fans can sing along. Fans even have the option to share snippets of your lyrics to social media platforms with share cards. Note: availability of lyrics may vary by territory and licensor.

With capabilities seamlessly integrated on Spotify, listeners can easily purchase your merch while they stream your music. So while you're building a meaningful relationship with your fans, you are also able to make a meaningful impact on your bottom line by broadening your Spotify revenue with [merch](https://artists.spotify.com/en/merch).\n\nOur [integration with Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) has been updated with new features for both artists and fans. This makes it simple for you and your team to manage inventory and for fans to discover your merch on your artist profile, release pages, the [Now Playing view](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery), and more. Anytime you drop new merch, you can share it on Spotify: capitalize on release moments big and small, promote your tour, celebrate the anniversaries of your past work, and more.\n\nWith the affordable $5-per-month [Shopify Starter plan](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-create?utm_campaign=spotify_for_starter\u0026signup_types[]=starter_plan), now is a great time to join tens of thousands of other artists who are already selling on Spotify through one of our merch partners.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/619GN1CGmy9Z77EmaH6S33/ce4d3361d3432f86d3cb8750652ae1c4/WebMerch.gif)\n\n## Get Connected\n\nIf you're already selling merch through Shopify, [install the Spotify for Artists app](https://apps.shopify.com/spotify) in the Shopify App Store. After a simple integration process, you'll be able to publish up to 250 items from your Shopify store onto Spotify. Once published, your merch is available for purchase on Spotify. Our integration supports [connecting](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/listing-shopify-merch) one Shopify store to one or multiple artist profiles, so teams can streamline their stores all in one place.\n\n## Or Get Set Up\n\nNew to selling merch or looking to start fresh? There are two ways to get started while keeping your upfront costs low.\n\nFirst, there's the wallet-friendly [Shopify Starter Plan](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-create?utm_campaign=spotify_for_starter\u0026signup_types%5B%5D=starter_plan) for $5 per month that offers artists streamlined access to everything they need to easily sell merch on Spotify. If you are looking for expanded features, check out the [Shopify Basic Plan](https://www.shopify.com/sell-on-spotify) with a free 90-day trial at $39 per month.\n\nNext, you can integrate with [Printful](https://www.printful.com/spotify-merch), a print on demand partner, to design and list new merch without needing inventory to start.\n\n![Merch is now on iOS](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1J6QiYR9ANwMcgZrKNC6ew/762b350f1c93497d539cd42e832160aa/MobileMerch.gif)\n\n## Then Stock Up and Sell\n\nWithin Spotify for Artists, on web or iOS, artist team admins and editors can easily manage how merch is featured on key surfaces throughout the Spotify app. Your twelve most recently-added items will automatically appear in the new Merch tab on your artist profile, and if you’d like to give one item top billing on the Music tab, you can select it as your Artist Pick. \n\nIndividual items can be tagged with one or multiple music releases. Tagged items will then appear on the associated album and single release pages and on the [Now Playing view](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery) for each song included on the release. Spotify will also scan the names of each piece of merch you publish from Shopify to automatically associate items with release pages, but manually tagged items will always take precedence in listing order. This way, when a fan is browsing your catalog or listening to one of your songs, they'll be able to purchase merch as they’re falling in love with your music.\n\nAnd speaking of browsing - fans can now explore personalized merch recommendations from their top artists (like you!) on the brand new Merch Hub. Fans can access the Merch Hub by clicking on the “Merch” tile in the “start browsing” section of Spotify or by typing “merch” into the Spotify search bar. To give your fans the best possible browsing experience, make sure to keep your offerings up-to-date via the Spotify sales channel within your Shopify admin. \n\nYou never know when your fans will be inspired to buy, so your merch on Spotify is open 24/7/365. We’re continually investing in new features to make it easy to sell merch on Spotify, so you can continue to build your business - and your fanbase - no matter how busy you get. Whether you're celebrating an album launch, a new tour, the year-end Wrapped campaign, or just selling something cool, offering merch on Spotify is more effortless than ever.\n\n## Study the Data\n\nOnce you've set up your merch store on Spotify, take a moment to dive into the insights from our [Fan Study](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/edition/merch-2) to guide your overall merch strategy.\n\nHere are some tidbits to get the wheels turning: \n\n- More than half of all merch clicks come in the first 24 days after a new release. Consider offering your fans something new to rep your latest music.\n- Two-thirds of all of your merch clicks come from fans who follow you, like your songs, or add them to a playlist. How can you make sure your music and merch work in lockstep?\n- Brand new listeners are likely to check out your merch right after they discover you. They're 7.8x more likely to click on your merch the very first day they listen to you than they are just one day later.\n- Merch trends change with the seasons, so be sure to have the right items in stock depending on the month. For example, vinyl sales spike in April and May, and outerwear sales hit a peak in November and December.\n","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"6MpLdFgVPkJJronoBPvfY5"}}],"indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"4OGp7BxoeTfBqJoqdD8x7S","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Introducing Clips: Get Started with Short-Form Video on Spotify","description":"Today at Stream On we announced Clips – short, under-30-second vertical videos that allow you to express your artistry and invite fans into your creative process, all while keeping your music front-and-center.","metadataTitle":"Introducing Clips: Get Started with Short-Form Video on Spotify","metadataDescription":"Today at Stream On we announced Clips – short, under-30-second vertical videos that allow you to express your artistry and invite fans into your creative process, all while keeping your music front-and-center.","urlSlug":"spotify-clips-get-started-short-form-video-stream-on","releaseDate":"2023-03-08T13:50:00-0500","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7juHITgZ0qI6EMNtOFSY80"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Today at Stream On we announced Clips – short, under-30-second vertical videos that allow you to express your artistry and invite fans into your creative process, all while keeping your music front-and-center.","article":"Every minute, people around the world [stream one million hours](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195140/new-user-generated-content-uploaded-by-users-per-minute) of content online, with each individual watching an [average of 19 hours](https://www.statista.com/statistics/611707/online-video-time-spent/) of online video a week in 2022. With more videos being uploaded and watched than ever before, it’s increasingly difficult for artists to break through the sea of content creators to reach new listeners and connect with fans in a way that will build lasting fandom – not just a quick viral success. \n\nAnd on many of the most popular channels for social video, music isn’t the priority. It often gets cut into soundbites and is pushed to the background, while the artists are anonymized and content creators are put front-and-center. \n\n## That’s why we built Clips\n\nUnlike other short-form video platforms, [Clips on Spotify](https://clips.byspotify.com) are attached to artist profiles and can be attached to tracks and albums – putting your music at the center of the experience so viewers can easily listen after watching your videos. It gives you a way to inspire fandom and long-term success – not quick hits tied to the latest meme.\n\nWe’re unlocking this feature for thousands of artists this week and we’ll be opening it up to more and more artists in waves throughout spring 2023. While we continue the roll out, bookmark this page and read on for important info to help you get started – like how to upload, best practices for your videos, and tips and inspo to help you create a world around your music with Clips.\n\n## What Clips are (and what they aren’t)\n\nClips are short, under-30-second vertical videos that are uploaded directly to Spotify for Artists. They’re designed to put you and your music front-and-center, so they can be attached to your artist profile, to a song, to an album, or to an upcoming release. Listeners will be able to view and engage with Clips on your artist profile, on album pages, and on our new [Countdown Pages](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/countdown-pages-get-fans-hyped-for-your-new-album-spotify-stream-on). Clips are all about driving streams of your music, not likes – so in each of these surfaces, viewers will be able to quickly access your music after watching the video.\n\nClips don’t go away in 24 hours, and you don’t have to constantly be creating new content to keep up and chase the latest trend. Clips brings video storytelling to more parts of Spotify, so that you can tell richer stories and drive more streams. So that you can communicate with your stans (and your future fans) on the platform where they’re already listening to your music. It’s an evergreen, always-on home for videos that deserve deeper storytelling and a longer shelf-life – not just a quick viral loop.\n\n## How to upload Clips\n\n__Step 1:__ Access the video dashboard in Spotify for Artists by clicking the “Create a Clip” card on desktop or mobile, or by clicking the “Video” tab on desktop. \n\n__Step 2:__ Click the “Upload Video” button to start uploading. Clips should be vertical, at least 1280px tall and 1080px wide, MP4 format, and between three and 30 seconds. \n\n__Step 3:__ Add your video details. You can add a caption describing the Clip, tag one of your releases, note whether the video contains explicit content, and select the thumbnail image for your video.\n\n__Step 4:__ Read and agree to the Clips terms \u0026 conditions. \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Llng2AcIa1k\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nOnce you’ve accepted the terms and your Clip has been submitted, you’ll be able to see your video dashboard, where all of the Clips you’ve uploaded will be displayed in order of upload time. Click on an individual thumbnail to see the metadata, check the status, or to delete the Clip if needed. \n\nClips are always featured on your artist profile in a dedicated section, but you can also tag them to a track or album (because Clips are about the music and the artist, not just trending sounds). When a viewer watches a video tagged to one of your releases, they’ll have a quick way to dive deeper into your music and start streaming.\n\n## Best practices and inspiration for Clips\n\nNow you know what Clips are, why we built them (streams not memes), and how to upload them. But you might be thinking: What should my first Clip be? Read on for some suggestions and ideas to get your creative juices flowing. \n\n1) __Share the story behind a song.__ Give your fans an inside look at your creative process and help them dive deeper into the track they’re listening to. The three most recent Clips tagged to a release will appear on the page for that song or album. Or, if listeners discover your Clip somewhere else (like your artist profile), they’ll see a link to the tagged music when they’re watching the video and can click to listen.\n\n2) __Announce an upcoming release.__ Hype up your fans by announcing your next song or album via a Clips video on Spotify and get them excited to stream it the moment it comes out. By announcing music in your Clips, you show your fans that the best way to hear your latest news is by streaming your music early and often. (Olivia Rodrigo proved that [when she mentioned](https://people.com/music/olivia-rodrigo-teases-new-music-to-come-in-2023/) “new music” in her Wrapped video message to fans.) \n\n3) __Introduce yourself as an artist.__ This is a great video to have on your artist profile any time a new listener discovers you. Share a little bit about you, your music, and who you are as an artist to help listeners build a personal connection with the artist behind the new music they just discovered. It’s a great way to connect with new listeners and will give your superfans one more peek inside your world.  \n\n4) __Feature a collaborator.__ Create a video together with a fellow artist, producer, or songwriter you’ve worked with to hype up both of your fanbases for a new or upcoming release. Take fans into your world and show them how collaboration comes together behind the scenes.\n\n5) __Show off your new merch.__ Walk fans through your latest merch drop and get them hyped to buy your new tee, crew, vinyl, or lava lamp (you do you). Make sure you’re set up to sell merch through Spotify for Artists so you can point fans to go purchase right through your artist profile or release pages. \n\nThose are just five examples of Clips you could create, but the possibilities are truly endless. You can upload anything from a GRWM (get ready with me) or pre-show ritual to a deep, multi-Clip walkthrough of your album. You can announce a new tour, celebrate an anniversary or milestone, take fans backstage, rate your own lyrics, share the meaning behind a song name, and more. You’re also welcome to include music in your Clips, as long as it is pre-cleared by your licensor. \n\nFor more inspiration, see how [Omar Apollo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5FxD8fkQZ6KcsSYupDVoSO?si=9DbVyDF_SsigldatjdvxGg) told the story behind his most recent hit, how [mehro](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ZwhhTSUPr7EBZHd1GjOT7?si=nwh6mrNdQmikwuRD-CKw-w) previewed his upcoming live performance, or how [Tove Lo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4NHQUGzhtTLFvgF5SZesLK?si=mjyc9HfNQpmGt-qowITLeQ) used Clips to tell a story and hype up her new music.

Today, [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-marquee) gets listeners into your new releases right when they open the app and [playlist pitching](https://artists.spotify.com/playlisting) gets your unreleased music in front of Spotify editors to consider for editorial programming. \n\nBut artists and their teams want even more flexibility when it comes to surfacing the right music to the right fans at the right time — whether that’s reaching new listeners with a trending song, engaging super listeners with an anniversary album, or targeting previously active listeners with a reminder of your tour. \n\nWith a rise in the [popularity of catalog music,](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/edition/catalog) it’s also increasingly important to revitalize your body of work as a crucial aspect to building and maintaining your fanbase. From 2020 to 2022, the portion of our Global Weekly Top Songs Chart represented by catalog (18+ months) increased by 155%. Promoting new releases also remains critical, but not only during the release moment: On average, 75% of a release’s first-year streams happen after the first month.\n\nThat’s why we built [Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/page/showcase), a new campaign tool that gives artists and their teams even more ways to get your new and catalog music in front of the right listeners, right when it counts. With Showcase, you'll be able to develop fans in ways that have never been possible before — by giving your music its moment on Home.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/aEWIa9PyQjrfFUmC4D0Sf/cf4af4200d202a794f593aa0397f1156/Asset_5_1280x720.gif)\n\n## What is Showcase and how does it work?\n\nShowcase is a sponsored recommendation that helps you share your music — whether it’s your newest release, your deepest catalog cut, or anything in between — at any time to likely listeners across Spotify. It appears as a mobile banner at the top of Spotify’s Home — the most visited place on Spotify, where millions of listeners come to decide what to listen to, resulting in billions of streams each day. Additionally, on average, people who see a Showcase are [6x more likely to stream the promoted release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZjOjrTvBEY).\n\nWhat’s more, Showcase gives artists and their teams the option to book multiple campaigns for the same release. For example, the tool allows you to spotlight a single, EP, or album with multiple campaigns to reach different goals, each targeting different markets or listener segments.\n\nBelow are a few other examples of how Showcase gives you an opportunity to develop your audience in new and meaningful ways: \n- Hyping up your fans with an old favorite to build excitement for an upcoming release\n- Putting a seasonal hit in front of new listeners during a holiday moment \n- Re-engaging listeners you haven't reached in a while with a new release\n\nNo matter what your goal is, Showcase is the tool to help build your audience at the moments that best support your music and your career.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1lX7aDdpLhS5oiTNCVQB7o/8d23b5d3fe09718954725a51bdd5ee39/Asset_2_1280x720.gif)\n\n## When is the best moment to spotlight my music? \n\nWith Showcase, you can promote your music at any time, so it’s never too late to give your release its moment on Home. Plus you can add a headline to give listeners helpful context to the music you’re promoting. Here are a few examples of headlines and how you could use them:\n\n__Releasing music soon__\n\n  Tap into the pre-release hype by promoting existing music with this headline. This can help prime your audience while letting them know to look out for your new music. \n\n__New music__\n\n  Use this headline to make a splash when you’re dropping new music.  You can also use [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-marquee) alongside Showcase for a new release, or you can use either tool on its own.\n\n__Recently released__\n\n  Once the launch moment has died down, use this headline to extend your promotional cycle and keep your latest music top of mind for potential fans.\n\n__On tour__\n\n  Want to build excitement for a new tour and help drum up interest in the [tickets on your artist profile](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery) and Now Playing view? You can use this option to engage listeners before they see you live.\n\n__Release anniversary__\n\n  Use this headline to celebrate a milestone anniversary for one of your timeless releases and give listeners a reason to dive back in. \n\n__Getting buzz__\n\n  It’s exciting to see your music trending, and this option allows you to seize the moment and build off the momentum to bring new listeners to your music. \n\n__Seasonal vibes__\n\n  This is a great way to promote a seasonal song during a holiday or specific time of year. A spooky song, a festive favorite, or a new love song primed for Valentine’s Day — they all fall under “Seasonal vibes.”\n\nWhat’s important is that you have the freedom to choose the headline (and the moment) that matters most for your music. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/120x513Bwqxai5t3enSVxs/76c5d43b6792a7f1d15feb2146cc2c1f/Asset_4_1280x720.gif)\n\n## Who can I reach with Showcase?\n\nShowcase lets you reach listeners in over [30 markets](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/campaign-targeting-and-destinations/), helping you develop a global fanbase. By default, campaigns reach listeners who are most likely to stream your release — including those who have streamed you before and people who are new to your music. You can also choose to target specific segments of your audience based on real streaming behaviors:\n\n__Active audience__\n\nThese are valuable listeners who have intentionally streamed your music in the past 28 days from active sources like your artist profile, album and release pages, and their own library and playlists. Within the active audience there are three segments:\n\n- __Super listeners:__ Your most dedicated active listeners in the last 28 days. They’re also the most likely to keep streaming your music.\n\n- __Moderate listeners:__ Active listeners who intentionally streamed your music many times in the past 28 days, and could still develop into super listeners.\n\n- __Light listeners:__ Active listeners who intentionally streamed your music once or a couple times in the past 28 days, and could develop into moderate listeners.\n\n__Previously active audience__\n\nListeners who used to be in your active audience but haven’t intentionally streamed your music in at least 28 days. They may still stream your music from programmed sources.\n\n__Programmed audience__ \n\nListeners who only streamed your music from programmed sources like editorial playlists, Discover Weekly, Radio, Autoplay, or playlists by other listeners at least once in the last 2 years.\n\n__Potential audience__\n\nListeners who aren't currently in your total audience. Based on their listening habits, they may stream your promoted release.\n\n## How does Showcase reporting work?\nTwenty-four hours after your campaign starts, you’ll be able to access detailed reporting so you can see how your campaign drove engagement with the release you’re promoting, as well as with the rest of your catalog.\n\nWe already talked about how people who see a Showcase are six times more likely to stream the promoted release, but the effects can be seen even beyond that initial listen. Our reporting metrics measure how your campaigns are growing your audience and developing deeper fans over time. Whether your marketing goals include audience engagement, reactivation, or growth, Showcase reports measure the success of those goals by tracking how campaigns grew your amplified, reactivated, and new active listeners.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of each metric: \n\n- __Amplified listeners:__ Listeners from your active audience who intentionally streamed your promoted release for the first time after seeing your campaign.\n\n- __Reactivated listeners:__ Listeners who rejoined your active audience after intentionally streaming your promoted release.\n\n- __New active listeners:__ Listeners who joined your active audience for the first time by intentionally streaming your promoted release – including __new listeners__ who hadn’t streamed your music anywhere in the past two years.\n\nLastly, Showcase reporting can help you understand how listeners may intend to stream you in the long run by highlighting metrics live saves, playlist adds, and intent rate. Our research shows that saves and playlist adds correlate with a 2.5x increase in streaming of an artist six months later.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZjOjrTvBEY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## How do I set a campaign budget?\n\nBudgets for Showcase campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists and run until you either spend your budget or 14 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Showcase is priced on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis starting at a $0.40 CPC, we only spend your budget when people actually click on the Showcase.\n\nIn order to maximize the value of your spend, Showcase filters out people who have already intentionally streamed the promoted release in the past 21 days. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n## How do I run a Showcase campaign?\n\nTo be eligible to book a Showcase, artists must have at least 1,000 streams over the past 28 days in at least one of the available [target markets](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/campaign-targeting-and-destinations/), and the artist team’s billing country must be set to the U.S.\n\nIf you meet these requirements, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign. \n1. Log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop and head to the Campaigns tab.\n2. Locate the Showcase tab. \n3. Select an eligible release.\n4. Follow the instructions to set up your campaign, and you’re on your way!\n\nOver the next few weeks we will roll out Showcase within the [Campaigns tab](https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/campaigns/showcase) for eligible artists in the U.S., and in the coming months, we’ll continue to expand access to more artists around the world. We’re excited to share more updates so you can bring your own personalized strategy to the releases you want, when you want, and you can give your music its moment on Home, with Showcase.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/177j82KNVu5E4kdv4cA4n2/792f059ba8770b3da07c5338df577f68/Asset_3_1280x720-272kb__1_.gif)\n","modules":[{"title":"Showcase Recirculation Module ","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"More ways to promote your music ","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","description":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in Radio and Autoplay before the album dropped.","urlSlug":"how-magic-city-hippies-sequenced-marquee-canvas-and-discovery-mode","releaseDate":"2022-07-14T11:50-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"2Cj16pKHMvqeP8RUlrASiu"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in [Discovery Mode contexts](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/discovery-mode-contexts/) before the album dropped.","article":"Miami’s [Magic City Hippies](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ikg4sypcURm8Vy5GP68xb) have brought their breezy alt-funk to the party since they formed in 2015, but when the pandemic changed the game, the indie trio got innovative with how they recorded their sophomore album, *[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/album/0r0l3PRmsPwylAZQM16e7a?si=gQt1zxLQTCeUTYD3KROItQ)*, and how they made sure it reached more listeners than the band ever had before.\n\nWritten and recorded in 2021 with band members Robby Hunter, Pat Howard, and John Coughlin all hunkered down in different parts of the country, the album’s title explains the 11 songs’ overarching theme of “taking care of yourself and taking care of your loved ones,” says manager Brad Desmond. “It’s something that the guys felt was missing from their lives before the pandemic.”\n\nWhen Magic City Hippies began planning *Water Your Garden*’s release, the band had nearly 650,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and it had been two years since their debut, *Modern Animal*. So when it came to developing *Garden*’s release strategy, it was all about working to reconnect with existing listeners and reaching new ones. To accomplish this, they planned to release singles over the course of the nine months in advance of the full album — building awareness so that the fanbase was ready to jump in eagerly when the album came out. \n\n\"You only get so many opportunities to release an album,” says Desmond. “I don't want to miss a single potential listener: it's a potential ticket buyer, a potential person who's going to tell 10 of their friends.\"\n\nTo meet their goal of “making it as easy as possible for [listeners] to get to” the new music, Desmond says, they utilized several Spotify for Artists tools, including [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode) in a multi-faceted long-lead approach that activated their audience pre-release, made noise when the release dropped, and kept the momentum going post-release. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1IplhgDMzRfPLCwLBng81H/6fba941d3f94cd41f81cec9807061a05/Blog_1_new-12-6-2023.png)\n\n“Our audience is [on Spotify]. It’s how people discover us,” says Desmond. “It’s our main way of communicating with fans.... So it’s always our priority to play in the sandbox there, to use whatever marketing tools are available to us to provide the best experience possible.”\n\nWith Marquee and Canvas, they primed their listeners for the album with a series of singles beginning months ahead of the January 2022 album release. With Discovery Mode, they worked to expand their audience further, right before and after the album dropped — and just ahead of their tour. \n\n*Read on to learn exactly how they used each tool to exceed their goals.*\n\n## Marquee Engaged Listeners Pre-Album\n__*People who saw the Marquees were four times more likely to stream the singles.*__\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/676oBg3mfgAUbZdNrFej6C/ddc82582d9ae6c47f78e4d00e2c957d4/Blog_2.png)\n\n*Water Your Garden*’s first pre-release single, “[Diamond](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ghj9ln405TCxVrlEuVnGA?si=988361c03b174e64),” arrived nine months before the album, in April of 2021. Since it had been two years since their last album, the Magic City Hippies team decided to try a [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) targeting their lapsed listeners because, “It fit the release strategy by helping reach our goal of reengaging with fans,” says Iona Casta, paid media and digital marketing lead at Create Music Group, the band’s distributor. The Marquee drove 25% of their lapsed listeners to actively stream the band for the first time in more than six months. “Once we saw those results, we decided to use the tool for every release.” \n\nThroughout the rest of the year, they served up five more singles — “[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/track/0CVaDx0YP1nMwZd1eg88cX?si=b80d7601e1594d6e),” “[Queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zFXDAZ2V52022GPNYOxyH?si=6475e492b9ab4d98),” “[High Beams](https://open.spotify.com/track/28r57p0khZL2C2tpeKENXi?si=321dbcb92edc4a56),” “[Ghost on the Mend](https://open.spotify.com/track/32bZRcF2imSuRHdpodPEbQ?si=a8808a0f5ea54029),” and “[Champagne on the Rider](https://open.spotify.com/track/4u8traGW2bhMIfE8RibuKr?si=46d81537aaa5457a)” — and they used Marquee to promote all of them. They even had a cheeky inside joke about it. “Brad and I called it ‘foreplay’ for the album,” says Create Music Group project manager Anna Antoniadis. On average, 24% of people who streamed the pre-album singles after seeing the Marquee saved them to their personal libraries for future streaming.  \n\n“It’s the most effective strategy to actually increase streaming numbers because it’s in-app,” Casta continues. “It gives fans direct access to actually listen to the music, save it, and come back to it later. Even if I optimize other ads for conversions, it takes several steps for people to stream and save it.”\n\nUsing Marquee to target Magic City Hippies’ recently interested, casual, and lapsed listeners resulted in listener familiarity with over half of *Water Your Garden* before it even dropped. \n\n“Our biggest challenge,” says Desmond, “is making sure that all of our fanbase is aware of what we’re doing… and Marquee is a home run for doing that.”\n\n## Canvas Extended the Aesthetic\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3MblUuhlhDz1DX9KIrgKzf/15ad49f0db1ac3185247375ad7b22ee6/Blog_3.png)\n\nMagic City Hippies’ comprehensive use of [Canvas](http://canvas.spotify.com) — the Spotify for Artists tool for short, looping visuals — ensured that listeners who clicked the Marquee also got a taste of their creative world. The band invested in videos for every *Water Your Garden* single, and they made a Canvas for each. “Canvas allowed us to bring that visual into the Spotify platform, and to really give a deeper, more immersive listening experience to our fans,” Desmond explains. “The other thing I love about Canvas is, when it’s shared to Instagram Stories, which is something that we really look out for and encourage our fans to do… It just makes it that much more engaging for them.”\n\n“In some instances, we used a little bit of B-roll to provide a little Easter egg for fans who maybe are obsessed with the music video and are coming to Spotify to listen to the song,” Desmond continues. “On the non-single tracks, we used more B-roll from the other videos. One video, we had the director do a lot of slow-motion shots of flowers, and that was on-brand for the album title.” B-roll from another video was turned into “kind of like a psychedelic visualizer” Canvas for another song. \n\n## Discovery Mode Helped Expand Their Reach\n__*The trio more than tripled their audience in Discovery Mode contexts across more than 100 markets, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before.*__ \n\nIn December, the month before the album arrived and the tour began, the team looked to reach new listeners by turning on [Discovery Mode](http://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode), a marketing tool that helps artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery. Discovery Mode allows distributors to select music they want to prioritize in select personalized sessions. This increases the likelihood a track reaches listeners in those contexts. \n\n“It was kind of a no-brainer in that period, to say, ‘Let’s give a shot at reaching as many people as possible’,” says Desmond. “Especially in a month like December, which is traditionally considered a down month,” seeing the band’s audience triple within Discovery Mode contexts, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before, was “beyond what we expected.” \n\nThe team was surprised at first to see particular uplift for two of the songs they selected, with streams of “Ghost on the Mend” and “Diamond” doubling in Discovery Mode contexts when they turned on Discovery Mode for those tracks compared to the month prior. “Once we looked at a lot of the data, it ended up making sense,” explains Antoniadis. \n\n“I thought ‘Queen’ would've done better because it's shorter and hookier,” says Desmond. “‘Diamond’ and ‘Ghost on the Mend’ are really dynamic, and it was a surprise, but I think it was really cool. On our end, it was cool to see the impact. It's always cool to see the backend data, but specifically with Discovery Mode… it gave us some really interesting insight.” \n\nOverall, the band found Discovery Mode a powerful way to understand what people connect with, “because it’s coming up in algorithmic playlists,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, I heard this super-randomly on a radio, and I added it to my playlist, and I listen to it all the time now.’ That was an interesting, different way to see how things connect.”\n\nFor Desmond, “as an independent artist, to be able to have that kind of audience insight, it’s really incredible.”\n\n## Making Noise On Release Day and Beyond \n\nHaving expanded their audience through Discovery Mode, the band was ready to promote the album, *Water Your Garden*, with Marquee once more. To build on the momentum, they booked a Marquee campaign targeting recently interested listeners — listeners who actively streamed their music in the last 28 days.\n\nIt drove an average of 13.5 streams of the new release per listener, over three times more streams per listener than their album at large. \n\nThat, “shows how reliably it converts, and, at the end of the day, it’s conversion, conversion, conversion,” says Antoniadis. “No matter how many clicks you get on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn’t necessarily mean the user’s gonna go stream the song… As data people, I love being able to see the actual conversion into streams.” \n\nWith Marquee, the album also reached their highest intent rate yet: 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the album to their library or added it to a personal playlist. Plus, 20% of their Marquee listeners also streamed from their older releases like 2019’s *[Modern Animal](https://open.spotify.com/album/6y5roSQsSbhNcVfIkhF7wL?si=sCjy4GBqSx2X7K47ecANYw)*. \n\nBecause “fans are still connecting with it,” months after the album’s release day, Desmond says the team will return to Discovery Mode for *Garden* tracks that weren’t previously turned on.\n\n“One of my goals in general—and especially with an album rollout—is extending the release period the day after the release,” adds Antoniadis. “It doesn’t end there for anyone, and you can continue pushing it in different ways. Discovery Mode [is] an amazing tool for just that.”\n\n“It was a bigger, more professional release this time around,” Desmond says. “We always try to leave no stone unturned, and with these [three] tools, we were able to do a better job of that.”\n\nThe band is excited to continue building on the success of this release as their 2022 tour kicks into high gear, including a stop at Firefly Music Festival in September. “They worked really hard for a couple years to take that sound that’s very unique to them, that they create in the studio, and… bring it on the stage and still perform it live,” Desmond says.","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"6GJZemISJ94qf0Z7O57fLq"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"oxbqgOYOtbh56EDVgbAoN"}}],"indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"30R9sSwX2mwikPrD0cYxpo","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"Video ","articleLink":{"title":"How thuy’s Team Used Discovery Mode and Marquee to Grow Her Audience on Spotify","description":"See how independent artist thuy’s team (manager Anh Vu and Venice Music’s Isobel Kelly) used Discovery Mode and Marquee over the course of 15 months and multiple releases to grow her audience.","urlSlug":"thuy-how-to-grow-audience-spotify-discovery-mode-marquee-case-study","video":{"title":"thuy Discovery Mode Case Study Video ","headline":"How thuy’s Team Used Discovery Mode and Marquee to Grow Her Audience on Spotify","subtext":"See how independent artist thuy’s team (manager Anh Vu and Venice Music’s Isobel Kelly) used Discovery Mode and Marquee over the course of 15 months and multiple releases to grow her audience.","useCustomCta":true,"ctaText":"Learn more about Discovery Mode","ctaLink":"https://artists.spotify.com/en/discovery-mode?utm_campaign=organic_s4a_trf_us-en_thuy_crossdevice_none_disco_lp\u0026utm_medium=organic\u0026utm_source=s4a","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58rQ1x5v8Y4","id":"1tiUUkQeuGcy2DQrvqlw1y","contentType":"videoModule"},"thumbnailImage":{"title":"thuy Case Study ","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3gv10eD6iHa33qGiMvQ0vO/0785e45967f6d4c81b85fd5a37266707/Screenshot_2023-08-09_at_12.01.15_PM.png","details":{"size":5581114,"image":{"width":2874,"height":1598}},"fileName":"Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 12.01.15 PM.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"modules":[{"title":"Thuy Case Study Recirculation Module (Discovery Mode / Marquee)","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

But today artists and their teams are often promoting releases on social media — platforms that weren't made for streaming music. Among the top questions we get from them is whether these social media ads actually drive engagement on Spotify, especially given the guesswork of trying to target real music fans and capture their attention in a busy social feed.\n\nWith Marquee, artists and their teams got a powerful new way to understand what their marketing spend drove on Spotify. But since they can't attribute streaming results to ad spend on social platforms, they've wanted to know how to compare returns from social ads to Marquee.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/IWDxZkUW4ymLVkTOWpNGv/5f8b5d6c69b1b343c8083dbb63314eca/Marquee_Vs_OffPlatform_Blog_1280x700_Comparison_Chart.gif)\n\nIn short: The study showed that Marquee delivers an average of 10x more Spotify listeners for every dollar spent on similar social ads. Now let's get into the details.\n\n## Designing the Study\n\nWe partnered with eight labels and distributors to select a wide range of artists with upcoming releases. Ten new releases were featured in the study, and they included a mix of release types (albums, EPs, and singles), a mix of artists' audience sizes (from 300,000 to 16 million monthly listeners), and a mix of genres (e.g. rap, electronic, indie, and rock).\n\nAfter working with partners to identify the right releases, they created ads to run on the most popular social media marketing platforms. To help ensure that their ads were set up in a similar way to Marquee, we applied the following study requirements:\n\n-   Ads promoted the same release as Marquee. \n-   Similar to Marquee, ads targeted artists' core audiences (e.g. people who have liked or engaged with the artist), with no expanded targeting. \n-   Ads targeted mobile users only, since Marquee only reaches mobile listeners.\n-   Ads targeted the same countries as Marquee. \n-   Ads were optimized for driving clicks or conversions to the Spotify mobile app, whichever the partner typically used to drive listening on digital streaming platforms.\n-   Ads' schedules matched Marquee: Campaigns started up to 20 days after release and ended no more than 10 days after start.\n-   Ads' minimum spends matched Marquee: Campaigns booked budgets for at least $100 per campaign.\n\nWe also wanted to make sure the comparison was as apples-to-apples as possible by attributing results in similar ways across all platforms. For Marquee, we measured the number of people who listened to the promoted release within 14 days of clicking on the Marquee. For all other advertising tools, we measured the number of people who listened to the promoted release on the Spotify mobile app within 14 days of clicking on the social ad.\n\n## The Results\n![While Marquee gets listeners into your new release when they're already on Spotify, social ads involve many more steps and high potential for dropoff before listeners get to Spotify.](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6JRfrgfje4NXLWm5Gv6gTH/86eb1183c117e1bee9048b1396e76acd/comparison_phones.png)\n\nOn average, Marquee delivered 10x more Spotify listeners for every dollar spent on similar social ads. While this was the average, even the release with the lowest rate in the study showed that Marquee reported 5x more Spotify listeners per dollar spent on social ads. Not only did Marquee deliver more listeners on average per dollar, it also resulted in more listeners per click: Marquee delivered a 100% higher click-to-listen-rate, on average, than similar social ads.\n\n\u003e \"We believed in the efficacy of on-platform Marquee campaigns vs paid social, but the results of this study were even more definitive than we expected.\" -Whitaker Elledge, VP of Artist Development at Dualtone Music Group\n\nFor Dualtone Music Group's Elledge, the study showed the value of marketing music directly on Spotify: \"It's clear that Marquee not only drives streams at a higher conversion rate and a lower cost [per listener] — it helps us foster meaningful, long term connections between fans and our artists. That's our core mission.\"\n\nSocial ads target listeners based on proxy metrics, making it easy to reach broad audiences, but difficult to be sure you are reaching listeners — especially those listeners who have the potential to become fans. They also reach listeners out of context (while they're scrolling and reading, next to other ads), not when they're ready to listen. And because they're separate platforms, they can't directly attribute marketing spend to listening behavior.\n\nMarquee is made for marketing music, meaning it:\n-   Lets you target Spotify listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests \n-   Reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to stream, rather than when they're scrolling a feed \n-   Provides reporting that shows how people who saw the Marquee engaged with the promoted release and broader artist catalog for up to 14 days after the campaign ends (e.g. listeners, streams per listener, saves, engagement with other releases)\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/5A0SlRnWQSFqhKaFb6iEyx/ab636e50c613a09800a38a430b231d25/Marquee_vs_Offplatform_Value_Prop_Blog_1280x700.png)\n\nThe Marquee results were a win-win for YMU US Music Head of Marketing SuzAnn Brantner. \"We have always questioned whether our social ads were truly driving engagement on Spotify,\" Brantner says. \"With these results from Steve Aoki's single, 'Just Us Two,' we were able to see the value in marketing directly on a music platform over social ads — our Marquee campaign was over 20x times more cost-efficient than our social ads promoting the single.\"\n\n## What's Next\n\nReady to drive more listeners and spend your marketing budgets more effectively?

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

But today artists and their teams are often promoting releases on social media — platforms that weren't made for streaming music. Among the top questions we get from them is whether these social media ads actually drive engagement on Spotify, especially given the guesswork of trying to target real music fans and capture their attention in a busy social feed.\n\nWith Marquee, artists and their teams got a powerful new way to understand what their marketing spend drove on Spotify. But since they can't attribute streaming results to ad spend on social platforms, they've wanted to know how to compare returns from social ads to Marquee.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/IWDxZkUW4ymLVkTOWpNGv/5f8b5d6c69b1b343c8083dbb63314eca/Marquee_Vs_OffPlatform_Blog_1280x700_Comparison_Chart.gif)\n\nIn short: The study showed that Marquee delivers an average of 10x more Spotify listeners for every dollar spent on similar social ads. Now let's get into the details.\n\n## Designing the Study\n\nWe partnered with eight labels and distributors to select a wide range of artists with upcoming releases. Ten new releases were featured in the study, and they included a mix of release types (albums, EPs, and singles), a mix of artists' audience sizes (from 300,000 to 16 million monthly listeners), and a mix of genres (e.g. rap, electronic, indie, and rock).\n\nAfter working with partners to identify the right releases, they created ads to run on the most popular social media marketing platforms. To help ensure that their ads were set up in a similar way to Marquee, we applied the following study requirements:\n\n-   Ads promoted the same release as Marquee. \n-   Similar to Marquee, ads targeted artists' core audiences (e.g. people who have liked or engaged with the artist), with no expanded targeting. \n-   Ads targeted mobile users only, since Marquee only reaches mobile listeners.\n-   Ads targeted the same countries as Marquee. \n-   Ads were optimized for driving clicks or conversions to the Spotify mobile app, whichever the partner typically used to drive listening on digital streaming platforms.\n-   Ads' schedules matched Marquee: Campaigns started up to 20 days after release and ended no more than 10 days after start.\n-   Ads' minimum spends matched Marquee: Campaigns booked budgets for at least $100 per campaign.\n\nWe also wanted to make sure the comparison was as apples-to-apples as possible by attributing results in similar ways across all platforms. For Marquee, we measured the number of people who listened to the promoted release within 14 days of clicking on the Marquee. For all other advertising tools, we measured the number of people who listened to the promoted release on the Spotify mobile app within 14 days of clicking on the social ad.\n\n## The Results\n![While Marquee gets listeners into your new release when they're already on Spotify, social ads involve many more steps and high potential for dropoff before listeners get to Spotify.](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6JRfrgfje4NXLWm5Gv6gTH/86eb1183c117e1bee9048b1396e76acd/comparison_phones.png)\n\nOn average, Marquee delivered 10x more Spotify listeners for every dollar spent on similar social ads. While this was the average, even the release with the lowest rate in the study showed that Marquee reported 5x more Spotify listeners per dollar spent on social ads. Not only did Marquee deliver more listeners on average per dollar, it also resulted in more listeners per click: Marquee delivered a 100% higher click-to-listen-rate, on average, than similar social ads.\n\n\u003e \"We believed in the efficacy of on-platform Marquee campaigns vs paid social, but the results of this study were even more definitive than we expected.\" -Whitaker Elledge, VP of Artist Development at Dualtone Music Group\n\nFor Dualtone Music Group's Elledge, the study showed the value of marketing music directly on Spotify: \"It's clear that Marquee not only drives streams at a higher conversion rate and a lower cost [per listener] — it helps us foster meaningful, long term connections between fans and our artists. That's our core mission.\"\n\nSocial ads target listeners based on proxy metrics, making it easy to reach broad audiences, but difficult to be sure you are reaching listeners — especially those listeners who have the potential to become fans. They also reach listeners out of context (while they're scrolling and reading, next to other ads), not when they're ready to listen. And because they're separate platforms, they can't directly attribute marketing spend to listening behavior.\n\nMarquee is made for marketing music, meaning it:\n-   Lets you target Spotify listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests \n-   Reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to stream, rather than when they're scrolling a feed \n-   Provides reporting that shows how people who saw the Marquee engaged with the promoted release and broader artist catalog for up to 14 days after the campaign ends (e.g. listeners, streams per listener, saves, engagement with other releases)\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/5A0SlRnWQSFqhKaFb6iEyx/ab636e50c613a09800a38a430b231d25/Marquee_vs_Offplatform_Value_Prop_Blog_1280x700.png)\n\nThe Marquee results were a win-win for YMU US Music Head of Marketing SuzAnn Brantner. \"We have always questioned whether our social ads were truly driving engagement on Spotify,\" Brantner says. \"With these results from Steve Aoki's single, 'Just Us Two,' we were able to see the value in marketing directly on a music platform over social ads — our Marquee campaign was over 20x times more cost-efficient than our social ads promoting the single.\"\n\n## What's Next\n\nReady to drive more listeners and spend your marketing budgets more effectively?

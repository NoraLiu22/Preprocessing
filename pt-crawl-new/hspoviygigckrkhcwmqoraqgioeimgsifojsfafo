Is it possible to earn a six-figure income on a part-time schedule? Find out what my students and I are doing without using our own money or credit to flip real estate!

I avoid the old-school tips and trick approach to sales and instead create a sales and buying pattern map which enables salespeople to understand the selling and buying pattern. My clients are rewarded with over a 300% increase in new business and a 30% reduction in the time it takes to close business.

The company was valued at $47 billion dollars, ready for a huge IPO, and its charismatic CEO Adam Neumann believed he was going to change the world. Adam and his wife Rebekah had a prophet-like vision—but did it ever match the company's reality? Now the inspiration for a new AppleTV+ series starring Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway, WeCrashed: The Director’s Cut is a complete refresh of our original six-part series. Hosted by David Brown of the hit podcast Business Wars, this six-part series includes new interviews and new discoveries about the rise and fall of WeWork. It’s a story of hope and hubris, big money and bigger screwups, and the lengths people will go to chase “unicorns\".\n\nYou can binge all episodes of WeCrashed exclusively and ad-free on Wondery+.

Small businesses are the heart and soul of this country, but it takes a brave individual to start and run a company of their own. From mom-and-pop coffee shops to auto-detailing garages -- no matter the type of industry you’re in, every small business owner knows that the journey is full of the unexpected. A single moment may even change the course of your business forever. Those who stand firm in their resolve have a special name, we call them - The Unshakeables. These are their stories.\n\nJoin Ben Walter, CEO of Chase for Business, and Tanya Nebo, a lawyer and business consultant, as they share stories of real small business owners across America who’ve gone through some of the most unexpected situations anyone can face and walked away stronger for it. These aren’t stories about the darlings of Silicon Valley or titans of Wall Street -- these are real stories from the real people behind the small companies that power their communities every day. \n\nThe speakers’ opinions belong to them and may differ from opinions of J.P.

If you're ready to break free from traditional career paths and master your future, you've found the right place!\n\nVince Chan: mastering 18 career shifts in 36 years\n\nI am your host, Vince Chan. My life story is a testament to overcoming fears and mastering futures on my own terms. Since the age of 15, I've navigated 18 career transitions across 36 years. I've weathered six economic crises, adapted to life in over 10 cities, and overcome battles with mental illness. But I've done more than just survive—I've thrived. From managing billion-dollar funds and publishing two books to navigating the academic halls of Yale and Chicago Booth and speaking on global education technology stages, I bring you wisdom not just from my victories but from the challenges I’ve faced, each time emerging stronger.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n\nTo help you get unstuck, minimize risks, and conquer fears—so you can reshape your career on your own terms, with resilience and intelligence—I created the \"Chief Change Officer\" podcast.\n\nHere, I don’t just celebrate superficial success or gloss over painful failures—I share time-tested, real-life stories of career transformation that are both lived and learnable.\n\nThe centerpiece of the podcast is the learnable career story told by real-life role models, akin to the business cases used in the HBS Case Method, a century-old educational standard still revered in top modern business schools. Each episode is crafted to deliver practical insights you can immediately apply to your own career.\n\nGuests: credible and diverse role models\n\nI meticulously select the most credible global figures for you to learn from. This careful curation ensures that every episode not only expands your understanding but also maximises your ability to supercharge your own incredible careers.\n\nMy guests range from the youngest Singaporean parliamentarian at 30, who shares her candid experiences overcoming ageism in politics and social media attacks, to a trailblazing LGBT tech CEO at 60, discussing her transformation from oboe musician to sales and revenue technology leader. You’ll also hear from a polyglot Russian diplomat turned energy innovator in Cincinnati at 50, who explores the self-starter skills needed to pivot industries successfully, and a Parisian lawyer who left banking at 40 to dedicate herself to building the youth economy in Senegal, offering insights into global entrepreneurship.\n\nBonus: No Ads, Just Pure Inspiration: An added bonus—my podcast features no ads, no political, corporate, or sales talk, ensuring authentic and uninterrupted conversations.\n\nJoin Our Community of Career Masters: Engage with @thevincechan on Linkedin and Threads.

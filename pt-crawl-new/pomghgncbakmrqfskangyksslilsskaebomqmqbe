Filing of Restated Annual Report with S.E.C.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>CAMBRIDGE,
Mass.&#151;March&nbsp;15, 2005&#151;Aspen Technology,&nbsp;Inc. (Nasdaq: AZPNE), the leading provider of software and services to the process industries, today announced
that the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has completed its previously announced financial review and the Company has restated its financials for each of the fiscal years ended
June&nbsp;30, 2000 through June&nbsp;30, 2004. In connection with the restatement, the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an amendment to its Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2004. The Company also has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Quarterly Reports on Form&nbsp;10-Q
for the quarters ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 and December&nbsp;31, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company believes that it has now complied with the March&nbsp;15 filing deadline set forth by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel in granting the Company's request for continued listing on
the Nasdaq National Market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>On
October&nbsp;27, 2004, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had commenced a detailed investigation of the Company's accounting for certain software license and service agreement
transactions entered into with certain alliance partners and other customers during fiscal years 2000 through 2002. The scope of the Audit Committee's investigation was later expanded to include
certain transactions entered into during fiscal years 1999, 2003 and 2004. Based upon the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company determined that certain license transactions entered into in
fiscal years 1999 through 2002 were accounted for improperly, and concluded that license revenues associated with the transactions were misstated in fiscal years 1999 through 2004. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition, and based on information discovered during the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company determined that accounting for software license sales to resellers should have been recorded on
a sell-through, or consignment, basis, rather than a sell-in, or upfront, basis resulting in the deferral of license revenues from the period in which they were originally
recorded to the period in which the software licenses were sold by the resellers to end users. As a result of the foregoing, the financial statements for the fiscal years 2000 through 2004 have been
restated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company has also determined that accounting for tax withholdings involving transactions in Japan and an associated change in Japanese tax law required restatement, that the timing of certain
reductions in software license revenues should be restated, and that equity in earnings from joint ventures and loss (gain) on sales and disposals of assets should be reclassified. The restatement
also includes the recording of previously identified errors that were previously not recorded because in each case and in aggregate the Company believed the amount of any such error was not material
to the Company's consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>As
a result of these restatements, total revenues for fiscal 2004 increased by $7.3&nbsp;million or 2%; total revenues for fiscal year 2003 increased by $23.7&nbsp;million or 7%; total revenues
for fiscal year 2002 increased by $1.8&nbsp;million or 1%; total revenues for fiscal year 2001 decreased $12.5&nbsp;million or 4%; and total revenue for fiscal year 2000 decreased
$7.0&nbsp;million or 3%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
restatement adjustments resulted in increases in net income of $6.8&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004, $21.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003, and $1.2&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2002. Net
income in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 decreased by $16.4&nbsp;million and $8.7&nbsp;million, respectively. Restatement adjustments for fiscal year 1999 resulted in increases to the opening balance
of the accrued deficit account in fiscal year 2000 by $6.8&nbsp;million. The revenue restatements did not have an affect on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, or short term investments. </FONT></P>

additional details pertaining to the Company's financial restatements, investors are encouraged to refer to the Company's recently filed amendment to its Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2004. For additional details pertaining to the Company's status with respect to its </FONT></P>

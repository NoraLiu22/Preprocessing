Arisa Trew, age 13 years, 2 months, won both Women’s Skateboard Vert (where she landed the first women’s 720 in a contest) and Park, smashing a record Shaun White owned for 20 years: youngest X Games double gold medalist. Tony Hawk competed in Skateboard Vert Best Trick for the second straight X Games, but it was 14-year-old Gui Khury who took his second gold in the discipline. Ryan Williams and Kevin Peraza both collected two gold and a silver, becoming the first BMX athletes with three medals at the same X Games since 2006.","_key":"944c90545f0b0"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"df292d87d6f5","markDefs":[]}],"_key":"66ab8da7276a","title":[{"children":[{"_key":"8b88d341c3a7","_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"2023"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"4d9d1e8c56c8","markDefs":[]}],"colorScheme":"dark","columns":false,"_type":"headlineWithText"}],"parentEvent":null,"_rev":"KLSLZpLmklhPvlfWZTEZjM","_id":"57670e96-cdd3-4234-bf46-d89fc96be985","_updatedAt":"2023-12-04T21:16:32Z"},"linkText":"Our History","linkType":"internal"},{"_type":"customLink","internalLink":{"modules":[{"eyebrow":"Careers","_key":"489c8f5936d0","body":"Careers and opportunities with the X Games group","desktopImage":{"image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-cc596e0429c62dfdda738731cbc98cc457c45428-3000x2000-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"_type":"assetImage"},"_type":"hero","cta":{"_type":"customLink","linkText":"Visit Our Greenhouse Job Board","linkType":"external","href":"https://boards.greenhouse.io/xgames"},"mobileImage":{"image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-988a22d5cd999ba8417f93b3702d6f9bf6cf4ca6-750x1000-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"_type":"assetImage"},"alternate":false,"textColor":"white","headline":[{"style":"normal","_key":"49abea58519f","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_key":"9d80531528a8","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Working at X Games"}],"_type":"block"}]},{"_key":"f420b25f961f","title":[{"markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Jobs and Careers with X Games","_key":"6c550b9c711c"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"01c8df4ba9d2"}],"colorScheme":"dark","cta":{"_type":"customLink","linkText":"Visit Our Greenhouse Job Board","linkType":"external","href":"https://boards.greenhouse.io/xgames"},"columns":false,"_type":"headlineWithText","text":[{"markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The X Games is reinvigorated with new leadership and a refocused energy, committed to growing our brand and future events to provide the best opportunities for our athletes and fans across the globe.

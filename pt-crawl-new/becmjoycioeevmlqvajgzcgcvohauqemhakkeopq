<IMG height=240 vspace=10 hspace=10 width=240 alt="Keyboard Kaleidoscope cover" src="images/hyman.jpg" align=right><FONT size=18px>T</FONT>he ultimate musical chameleon.  Dick Hyman's fame for being able to perform in virtually any musical style on any keyboard instrument has come to overshadow his accomplishments as a musician and arranger in his own right.  Hyman studied at Columbia University and played with Teddy Wilson, Red Norvo, Benny Goodman, and other jazz greats, but he says his best musical education came from working as a studio musician on radio and television in the 1950s, when he had to shift from one style to another as shows came and went throughout the day, and exceptional sight-reading and impromptu composition were essential survival skills.  No one has kept track of many different recordings Hyman made under how many different names--ragtime piano as "Knuckles O'Toole," polka, light classical, "Living Trio" <A href="threesun.htm">Three Suns</A> clones are only a few. 
<P>
He also recorded under his own name, beginning in the mid-1950s for MGM.  His cover of "Moritat," on harpsichord with his trio, sold over a million copies in 1956 and was the most successful recording of the tune until Bobby Darin did it as "Mack the Knife."  He was the musical director of "The Arthur Godfrey Show" from 1958 to 1961.  He was an early staple of <A href="light.htm">Enoch Light's</A> Command label, for which he recorded light classical, swinging harpsichord, funky organ, and <A href="whatis.htm">"now sound"</A> combo albums.  He also demonstrated his continuing interest in new keyboard instruments, releasing two of the earliest Moog albums.  Hyman has stayed in demand as much as any
musician around, working for TV, scoring film soundtracks for Woody Allen, and, more recently, as a jazz pianist and organist.

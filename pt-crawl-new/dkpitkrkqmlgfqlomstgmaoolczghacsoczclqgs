              <h5>Additional Appropriation:</h5>
              <p>An appropriation made subsequent to the passage of regular appropriations for a purpose for which either no appropriation was originally made or where the General Assembly deems it desirable but not mandatory that an original appropriation be increased in the current fiscal period.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Agency Program Plan — (APP):</h5>
              <p>A document consisting of program and financial information projected over a five-year period. It thus serves as the agency input into the Commonwealth Program Plan.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Allocation:</h5>
              <p>An administrative breakdown of an appropriation after such appropriation has been made by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor. The allocation assigns specific amounts of money to appropriate major objects and is the spending plan for the entire fiscal year. It is an authorization to spend. In the case of those agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction, the allocation is approved by the Office of the Budget. In the case of independently elected officials it is made internally in those offices.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Allotment:</h5>
              <p>A further breakdown of an appropriation and allocation by minor object and also by quarters or other periods of time within the fiscal period. Allotments are aimed at controlling the appropriateness and rate of expenditure so as to avoid the depletion of funds before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
              <p>In Pennsylvania, because of other expenditure controls, the allotment is primarily a planning and cost control tool at the agency level. The movement of funds among the minor objects can be done at the agency’s discretion without Office of the Budget approval.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Appropriation:</h5>
              <p>Legislation requiring the Governor’s approval authorizing an agency, department, board, commission, or institution to spend a specified amount of money for a stated purpose or purposes during a particular period of time, usually one fiscal year.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Appropriation Deficiency:</h5>
              <p>A deficiency which occurs when an original appropriation is insufficient to meet the requirements of a program during the entire fiscal year. A deficiency appropriation normally is approved only to provide for such requirements as debt service, mandated subsidy payments or to continue minimum standards of protection or patient care.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Augmentation:</h5>
              <p>Monies such as institutional billings or fees which are credited to a specific appropriation of State revenues. An augmentation can usually be spent for those purposes authorized for the appropriation which it augments. Although augmentations usually are appropriated in general terms with no specific dollar limits, Federal aid monies must be appropriated specifically.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Balanced Budget: </h5>
              <p>A budget in which proposed expenditures equal actual and estimated revenues and surplus. The Pennsylvania Constitution requires the Governor to submit a balanced budget and prohibits the Governor from approving appropriations in excess of actual and estimated revenues and surplus.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Budget: </h5>
              <p>A statement of the State’s program plan, the resources necessary to support that plan, a description of how and for what purposes the resources are to be used, and a projection of the effects of the programs on people and the environment.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Capital Authorization:</h5>
              <p>The debt authorization and/or appropriations authorized in the Capital Budget to fund any permitted capital program.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Capital Budget:</h5>
              <p>The capital budget is that portion of the State Budget that deals with projects for the construction, renovation, improvement, acquisition and original furniture and equipment of any building, structure, facility, land or land rights. Projects must have an estimated useful life in excess of five years and an estimated cost in excess of $100,000. Most of the capital budget projects in the past have been paid from monies raised by the sale of bonds.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Cash Deficiency:</h5>
              <p>Insufficient cash to meet necessary payments at a given time. It does not necessarily imply insufficient revenue over the course of a fiscal year nor does it imply the lack of sufficient appropriation authority.

It is intended for agencies that have little to no need to access the assets in the short term. The primary purpose of Pool 198 is achieving, at least, long-term preservation of purchasing power. Pool 198 can diversify across a wide variety of asset classes to preserve and enhance the value of Pool 198 through asset appreciation and income generation while maintaining a reasonable investment risk profile.  The variable NAV is calculated daily and gains or losses are realized when shares are liquidated.  Monthly income is distributed to participants.

        <p><strong>Tuition Account Program Guaranteed Savings Plan (TAP GSP)</strong> - The GSP is a diversified portfolio of investments designed for families saving for qualified education expenses. To achieve this objective, the GSP will invest in a suitable mix of marketable assets that could provide a long-term competitive rate of return that is equal to or greater than the Actuarial Target Rate of Return.

      <div class="col-sm-12 pt-2" >
        <h7>Additional Appropriation:</h7>
        <p>An appropriation made subsequent to the passage of regular appropriations for a purpose for which either no appropriation was originally made or where the General Assembly deems it desirable but not mandatory that an original appropriation be increased in the current fiscal period.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Agency Program Plan — (APP):</h7>
        <p>A document consisting of program and financial information projected over a five-year period. It thus serves as the agency input into the Commonwealth Program Plan.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Allocation:</h7>
        <p>An administrative breakdown of an appropriation after such appropriation has been made by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor. The allocation assigns specific amounts of money to appropriate major objects and is the spending plan for the entire fiscal year. It is an authorization to spend. In the case of those agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction, the allocation is approved by the Office of the Budget. In the case of independently elected officials it is made internally in those offices.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Allotment:</h7>
        <p>A further breakdown of an appropriation and allocation by minor object and also by quarters or other periods of time within the fiscal period. Allotments are aimed at controlling the appropriateness and rate of expenditure so as to avoid the depletion of funds before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
        <p>In Pennsylvania, because of other expenditure controls, the allotment is primarily a planning and cost control tool at the agency level. The movement of funds among the minor objects can be done at the agency’s discretion without Office of the Budget approval.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Appropriation:</h7>
        <p>Legislation requiring the Governor’s approval authorizing an agency, department, board, commission, or institution to spend a specified amount of money for a stated purpose or purposes during a particular period of time, usually one fiscal year.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Appropriation Deficiency:</h7>
        <p>A deficiency which occurs when an original appropriation is insufficient to meet the requirements of a program during the entire fiscal year. A deficiency appropriation normally is approved only to provide for such requirements as debt service, mandated subsidy payments or to continue minimum standards of protection or patient care.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Augmentation:</h7>
        <p>Monies such as institutional billings or fees which are credited to a specific appropriation of State revenues. An augmentation can usually be spent for those purposes authorized for the appropriation which it augments. Although augmentations usually are appropriated in general terms with no specific dollar limits, Federal aid monies must be appropriated specifically.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Balanced Budget: </h7>
        <p>A budget in which proposed expenditures equal actual and estimated revenues and surplus. The Pennsylvania Constitution requires the Governor to submit a balanced budget and prohibits the Governor from approving appropriations in excess of actual and estimated revenues and surplus.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Budget: </h7>
        <p>A statement of the State’s program plan, the resources necessary to support that plan, a description of how and for what purposes the resources are to be used, and a projection of the effects of the programs on people and the environment.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Capital Authorization:</h7>
        <p>The debt authorization and/or appropriations authorized in the Capital Budget to fund any permitted capital program.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Capital Budget:</h7>
        <p>The capital budget is that portion of the State Budget that deals with projects for the construction, renovation, improvement, acquisition and original furniture and equipment of any building, structure, facility, land or land rights. Projects must have an estimated useful life in excess of five years and an estimated cost in excess of $100,000. Most of the capital budget projects in the past have been paid from monies raised by the sale of bonds.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Cash Deficiency:</h7>
        <p>Insufficient cash to meet necessary payments at a given time. It does not necessarily imply insufficient revenue over the course of a fiscal year nor does it imply the lack of sufficient appropriation authority. Short term borrowing (less than a year) is usually used to supply needed cash.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Character of Expenditure:</h7>
        <p>A classification of appropriations according to their general purpose: general government, institutional, grants and subsidies, capital improvements, and debt service.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Commonwealth Program Plan—(CPP):</h7>
        <p>An aggregation of the Agency Program Plan (APP) within the framework of the Commonwealth program structure.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Contingent Commitment:</h7>
        <p>An authorization made by proper authority for a spending agency to commit monies for a future year expenditure from a future year appropriation. It is contingent upon the eventual passage of an appropriation for the purpose. Money may not be paid out for goods or services delivered until such an appropriation has been made. It is usually used in the last months of a fiscal year for items ordered for delivery in the summer. It is the first item of encumbrance set up against a new appropriation once it is passed.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Continuing Appropriation:</h7>
        <p>An appropriation that does not specify the time limit (with some exceptions) within which the money must be spent or encumbered. Specific action must be taken, either by the Office of the Budget or the General Assembly to lapse it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR):</h7>
        <p>A set of government financial statements that complies with accounting requirements prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board and provides information about the financial condition of the commonwealth. It is prepared primarily by accounting staff in the Office of Comptroller Operations and audited by independent auditors using GASB requirements.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Current Commitment:</h7>
        <p>Budget projections are controlled by the concept of current commitment. Projections under current commitment show the future implications of current decisions, assuming no new aspirations and applying only those cost escalators which are a natural characteristic of the program’s operation.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Deficiency Appropriation:</h7>
        <p>An appropriation providing supplemental funding in the event that the original appropriation is not sufficient to meet required spending to the end of the fiscal year.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Deficit:</h7>
        <p>A fiscal condition that occurs at the end of a fiscal year, whereby expenditures for a fiscal year exceed the actual cash intake of revenues during the same period plus the prior year surplus. The deficit must be paid from the next year’s revenues.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Disbursement:</h7>
        <p>As contrasted with expenditure, a disbursement refers to the paying out of cash (or check) only from the Treasury; it does not include any encumbrance.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Encumbrance:</h7>
        <p>That portion of an appropriation that represents an expenditure pursuant to a contract, a purchase order, or a known demonstrable bill but where an actual disbursement has not been made. In accrual accounting it is treated as a debit against the appropriation in the same manner as a disbursement of cash.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Escheat:</h7>
        <p>The reversion of property to the State. Under the laws of the Commonwealth unclaimed money or property becomes the property of the State.</p>
        <hr>

                <p>RTK dramatically revised prior Pennsylvania law regulating the rights of the public to obtain information from government about its activities. </p>
                <p>The new law expands the information that must be made available to the public, specifically identifies all of the grounds upon which a government agency might deny a request for information, places the requirement for explanation of the denial of information upon the agency wishing to deny a request, and establishes more specific procedures for persons to seek review of information request denials. In addition, RTK enlarges the number of government agencies, boards, commissions and other bodies that are subject to requirements to make information available to the public.</p>

                <p>Chapter 17 of RTK directs Treasury to make certain government contract information available for public inspection by posting it on a publicly accessible Web site. It also specifies those government agencies that need to provide contract information for inclusion in the Contracts e-Library, the types of contracts required for submission, and the type of contract information or content that must be provided for public access.</p>

                <p>Chapter 17 of RTK requires Commonwealth agencies, legislative agencies and judicial agencies to file with Treasury any contract involving any real, personal or mixed property of any kind or description, and any contract for personal services where the consideration involved in the contract is $5,000 or greater. It is important to note, however, that RTK specifically exempts contracts for services that are protected by a privilege, such as the attorney-client privilege, from the requirement to be filed with Treasury.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Agencies must file contracts meeting the statutory description no later than ten days after the contract is fully executed. The Chapter 17 provisions of RTK establishing the contract filing requirements and operation of the publicly accessible Web site apply to contracts entered into or renewed on or after July 1, 2008.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition, agencies must file a summary with Treasury along with each contract they submit. The summary will provide the following information: date of the contract’s execution, amount of the contract, beginning date of the contract, end date of the contract, if applicable, name of the agency entering into the contract, name of all other parties executing the contract, and the subject matter of the contract.</p>

                <p>RTK identifies approximately 30 exceptions to the general rule it establishes that public records must be made available for inspection and copying. Beyond these specific exemptions, RTK also recognizes that other state and federal laws, as well as regulations and court decisions, may make certain kinds of information not subject to disclosure as public records.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Chapter 17 requires agencies to redact contracts, or remove sensitive or nonpublic information from contracts, in accordance with the exemption provisions of RTK prior to submitting them to Treasury for the publicly accessible Web site. It is important to note, however, that RTK specifically exempts contracts for services that are protected by a privilege, such as the attorney-client privilege, from the requirements to be filed with Treasury. Agencies submitting contracts are specifically responsible under RTK for the accuracy and completeness of the contracts that they file with Treasury.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Those reviewing contract information obtained from the Contracts e-Library may not agree that agencies originally filing the contracts with Treasury have redacted them in accordance with the various exceptions and provisions of RTK. In such instances, members of the public can request copies of contracts under the regular provisions of RTK directly from the contracting agency and evaluate whether they wish to pursue the remedies provided in RTK for the denial of any requested information.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court amended Pennsylvania Rule of Judicial Administration No. 509 on June 23, 2008, to provide, among other things, that the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts will make contract information “available on the website of the Unified Judicial System.” The Court acted in reliance upon its authority under the Pennsylvania Constitution and Section 304 of RTK. Accordingly, contracts entered into by judicial agencies will not be available from the Contracts e-Library.</p>

                <p>Up until June 30, 2008, the Treasury Department served as the public repository for certain state contracts involving any real, personal or mixed property of any kind and any contract for personal services where the amount of the contracts is $5000 or more in accordance with the requirements of Section 1104 of the Administrative Code. Chapter 17 of Act 3 of 2008 repealed Section 1104 effective July 1, 2008.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the present, Treasury will continue to retain a limited repository of contracts entered into by state agencies prior to July 1, 2008. If you would like a copy of a particular pre-July 1, 2008, state contract, please send a request under RTK identifying the specific contract to contractinfo@patreasury.gov or call the Contracts e-Library staff at 800-252-4700. You may also make a request for such contract to the appropriate contact identified in the Right-to-Know Agency Contact List.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It is important for persons seeking pre-July 1, 2008, state contracts to recognize that many government contracts may not be included in Treasury’s limited repository, either because they were outside the scope of Section 1104 of the Administrative Code, or because the responsible government agency -- for whatever reason -- failed to file it with Treasury. Persons unable to obtain pre-July 1, 2008, contracts that they believe exist are encouraged to make direct requests to the contracting agencies under the regular provisions of RTK.</p>

                <p>RTK was enacted on February 14, 2008, and the Contracts e-Library is the first component of the new law to be implemented. Contract summaries, which have been specifically designed and prepared for viewing in the e-Library, are available for immediate review. Agencies and Treasury are still developing and evaluating procedures to insure that the actual contracts are in electronic formats that are compatible with the e-Library’s software and that redaction practices are effective in protecting sensitive and confidential information from being inadvertently disclosed. For now, Treasury is taking additional steps when requests to view individual contracts are made to insure that these documents are able to be displayed properly on the web site. Once a contract has been made available for viewing in the e-Library in response to a specific request, it will remain available for immediate viewing in response to all subsequent requests for that contract.</p>

                <p>The Contracts e-Library Web site utilizes a dynamic design, which means that it is continually updating itself as agencies supply new contract information to Treasury. That information is made available to the public essentially immediately upon its submission to and review by Treasury, not simply once or twice per day at arbitrarily fixed times. Contract information that was unavailable when a person begins a search may even become available before he or she finishes using the e-Library. The dynamic nature of the e-Library, however, means that brief delays can sometimes be encountered as the site incorporates or searches for recently added information.</p>

                <p>Some grants may contain begin dates that become retroactively effective only once the grants are fully executed. This practice might allow a grantee to secure matching funds or obtain reimbursement for services or supplies provided after a prior grant has expired and before the next grant is fully executed. In most instances, however, the execution date for a contract precedes its begin date. The e-Library system is designed to facilitate agency filing of conventional contracts, and to prevent agencies from inadvertently submitting summaries whose begin dates are earlier than their execution dates. To address the grants situation, Treasury has requested agencies to use the execution date for both dates in summaries in those instances where begin dates in fact precede execution dates. In these cases, the actual begin dates will be reflected correctly in the e-Library on the grants themselves.</p>

When agencies prepare summaries for these contracts, they convert their values to dollars (as of the time of filing with Treasury) to facilitate the ability of public users to search for such contracts utilizing e-Library's search tools (which include a field that allows searching by contract dollar amount).</p>

        <h7>Contracts e-Library</h7>
        <p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Right to Know Law (RTK), Act 3 of 2008, mandated that the Pennsylvania State Treasury create a web-based library that would be available to the general public. On July 1, 2008, e-library was established to enable the public to retrieve information regarding state contracts valued at $5,000 and above, which were issued after that date. Each agency within the Commonwealth is mandated from that date forward to place on this website all of their Contracts and Purchase Orders.</p>
        <p>E-library offers exceptional access to public information by providing an on-line central source for state contracts. Since its inception, there have been 418,290 contracts made available on e-library by 1,117 agency users. The web site offers a list of answers to Frequently Asked Questions as well as public and agency user manuals. For contracts executed before July 1, 2008, interested parties can contact the Right-To-Know officer for the department, which holds those contracts.</p>
        <hr>
        <h7>Disclaimer</h7>
        <p>The Contracts e-Library rests upon a collaborative relationship between the Treasury Department and the many agencies responsible for the content made available through it. While the Right-to-Know Law ("RTK") entrusts the Treasury Department with the responsibility to receive contract information and make it accessible to the public consistent with Chapter 17, the obligation to submit contracts and summaries in compliance with the law rests entirely with the agencies identified in the law. Although Treasury has notified all agencies that it believes are subject to the Chapter 17 contract filing requirements, each agency has made an independent determination whether it is required to file contracts with the Treasury Department. The statutory definition of Commonwealth agencies, legislative agencies and judicial agencies in RTK is available by <a href="/pdf/right-to-know/RightToKnow-RequestLaw.pdf" target="_blank">clicking here</a> or by examining those definitions directly in the RTK itself. The list of agencies that have advised Treasury that they will be filing contracts and summaries for the Contracts e-Library can be found by clicking the button in the Agency field on the Search page.</p>
        <p>Agencies are also responsible for determining which contracts must be filed with Treasury. It is possible that different agencies will reach different conclusions regarding whether RTK requires any particular kind of contract to be filed with the Treasury Department. As a result, the kinds of contract information available from the Contracts e-Library may not be identical for different agencies that have filed information.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, it is important for persons seeking contract information to recognize that some government contract information may not be included in the Contracts e-Library, either because it is outside the scope of the Chapter 17 requirements or because an agency has – for whatever reason – failed to file it with the Treasury Department. Persons unable to find information in the Contracts e-Library about contracts that they believe exist are encouraged to make direct requests to the contracting agencies under the regular provisions of RTK.</p>
        <p>Some agencies have suggested to the Treasury Department that they will file contracts and summaries for contracts executed prior to the effective date of Chapter 17. For the most part, however, the Contracts e-Library will only have information about contracts executed on or after July 1, 2008. Thus, the actual contents of the Contracts e-Library will be very modest in the period immediately following the effective date. Over time, the contents will grow much larger as agencies file more contracts and summaries.</p>

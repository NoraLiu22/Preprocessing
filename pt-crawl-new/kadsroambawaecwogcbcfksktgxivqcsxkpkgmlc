and theories of some of the most remarkable people on planet earth. 

As well as delving into the lives of truly fascinating people, Dan asks his guests a maverick tour of questions known as The Batshit Survey. Do they believe in Ghosts? Déjà vu? Telepathy? Premonitions? Déjà vu? 

Either way, everyone has theories they are transfixed by, or a mystery in their own life that they’re trying to solve. Dan leaves no rock unturned – and he’ll share plenty of his own mind-blowing facts and theories too.

Bonus episodes, ‘The Rough Corner’, hear from YOU – your wild ideas, odd theories and unexplainable experiences.

Let’s create a global community of likeminded weirdos!

Expect new episodes every Thursday. Bonus episodes land on Tuesday.</div></div><div><p class="podcast-show_episodeTitles__2SeXD" data-testid="podcast-show__episodes__title">Episodes</p><div class="style_podcastEpisode__APEZP style_episode__oJHJb style_full__AZeBE" data-testid="episode"><div class="style_episodeArtworkContainer__mXuSe"><button class="style_episodeArtwork__pWlew" data-testid="episode__artwork" aria-pressed="false"><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></div></button><button class="style_unstyled__jdW3p style_dark__iFDAw style_actionButton__2TSQx" aria-label="Play #51 Down the Rabbit Hole of Conspiracy: Danny Wallace and the Soup Spoon Spirit from We Can Be Weirdos" aria-pressed="false" data-testid="play-button" title="Play #51 Down the Rabbit Hole of Conspiracy: Danny Wallace and the Soup Spoon Spirit from We Can Be Weirdos" style="width:26px;height:26px;position:absolute;bottom:5px;right:5px;cursor:pointer"><span class="style_icon__gsGve"><span class="icon style_icon__VMfKE "><svg fill="" viewBox="0 0 30 32"><use xlink:href="#player-play-b35cfb43--sprite"></use></svg></span></span></button></div><div class="style_episodeText__Ppy1R"><h4 class="style_episodeTextTitle__2VQgE style_episodeTextTitleMultiLine__lVLaX" title="#51 Down the Rabbit Hole of Conspiracy: Danny Wallace and the Soup Spoon Spirit"><a href="/podcasts/episodes/7DriQZK/">#51 Down the Rabbit Hole of Conspiracy: Danny Wallace and the Soup Spoon Spirit</a></h4><div class="style_episodeTextDescription__WjfCe" title="&quot;Make a &#x27;fun investment&#x27;... do something pointless that tickles you in some way&quot;Danny Wallace is a bestselling author, as well as a BAFTA, Arqiva and Sony-winning performer and presenter.

Tannerin</b> is an electronic instrument that produces a pure sine wave,
variable over three or four octaves.&nbsp; It is played by sliding a knob
along the length of the instrument, on some models starting and stopping
the tone with a contact switch located on the pitch knob and operated by
one's forefinger.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000066"><font size="-1">Like the <a href="http://www.electrotheremin.com/thereminpage.html">theremin</a>,
the Tannerin is a portamento instrument. Unlike the theremin, the <a href="http://www.electrotheremin.com/PTE-TPage.html">Tannerin</a>
has fixed reference points on a mock keyboard so the musician knows exactly
where notes can be found.&nbsp; Also, unlike the theremin, the Tannerin's
contact switch can allow for staccato notes, which can be played as fast
as the forefinger can move.&nbsp; The attacks are naturally hard, but can
be softened by quick rotation of the volume control.</font></font></font>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Early in 2016, in preparation for Brian's European tour
and at the tour manager's request, Probyn Gregory contacted me to build
a backup instrument. &nbsp;Having been the Tannerin player since 1999,
Probyn is intimately familiar with its needs. &nbsp;He's used my 18"
versions and likes the 24" size.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The
original 24" instrument has held up remarkably over 18 years, needing
my adjustment only twice. &nbsp;However, conceived and built in a
hurry,&nbsp;I never was satisfied with it. I was particularly bothered
by the uneven key width on the dummy keyboard. &nbsp;Over the years
I've figured out various ways to fix that.&nbsp; This new instrument is
designed to be as bulletproof as the original, yet it's enhanced by a
perfectly linear keyboard, full four octave range, and improved
aesthetics.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't have much more than a couple
months to get it ready. &nbsp;I couln't keep taking off work to meet
the deadline, so to make the wooden case, I enlisted the help of my
work associate, Jeff Stewart. &nbsp;Jeff is a woodworker hobbyist who
has a professional shop. &nbsp;I gave him a mock up made of scrap wood
and needed dimensions, and he did the rest. &nbsp;He presented me with
this beautiful cabinet with solid red oak sides.<br>&nbsp;</span></small><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"></span></td></tr>

--</b><font size="-1">meeting Brian Wilson</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thrilled
to learn that Brian Wilson was bringing his "Pet Sounds Live" tour to Austin,
because I would finally get to meet Darian Sahanaja (Brian's music director)
who actually commissioned the instrument I built.&nbsp; I hoped to meet
Brian!&nbsp;</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darian contacted
me ahead of time requesting a refurbishing of the instrument.&nbsp; I took
the whole day off from work and met Darian at his hotel.&nbsp; Darian introduced
me to some of the musicians, particularly Probyn Gregory, who is the one
who actually plays the instrument.&nbsp; We made arrangements for me to
show up at the 3:00 sound check with the refurbished instrument.&nbsp;
I took it to my workshop and got to work.</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circuitry
was completely redesigned to fix some stability problems.&nbsp; My job
was to replace the tone production module and the job was going well.&nbsp;
Around 1:00 I was about to put the instrument back together when I broke
the main linkage that connects the slide to the pitch module.&nbsp; I was
both horrified and gratified, horrified because this was a several hour
job to repair, gratified because it had weakened and would have broken
in another city if I'd not broken it here.&nbsp; The repair caused a two
hour delay, and I arrived at the sound check at 5:00 instead of the agreed
3:00.</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected
to find some disappointed and nervous musicians.&nbsp; Instead I got treated
like royalty.&nbsp; I cannot say enough about how warm and respectful Brian's
and Darian's musicians are.&nbsp; ("You're Tom Polk?&nbsp; Hey, everyone,
here's <i>the man</i>!" ) They were glad to have the instrument back, put
it on-stage, and marched me backstage where they laminated an "all pass"
badge, complete with my photograph.&nbsp; I got to finish hearing a preview
of the show at sound check, then Darian invited me to eat BBQ with Brian
and the crew.</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were
wonderful conversations with Darian, Probyn Gregory (who plays the instrument),
Paul Mertens (formerly of Poi Dog Pondering, and who did much of the orchestration),
David Leaf (Brian's biographer), and even Brian's wife, Melinda.&nbsp;
We talked about children and fun stuff.&nbsp; Then Darian asked me if I'd
like to meet Brian.&nbsp; Of course you know the answer.&nbsp; Darian led
me to a small room in a kind of basement of The Backyard, where I heard
some piano riffs floating down the hall.&nbsp; When he opened the door,
there was Brian, doing his thing, working something out on an old upright
piano.&nbsp; Darian introduced me to Brian, took our picture, and Brian
said some very kind words about the instrument.&nbsp; I was in heaven!</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I met
my wife and daughter to enjoy the show.&nbsp; After the show, we went backstage
where there were tables of snacks set up for the musicians and guests.&nbsp;
I was particularly impressed with Taylor Mills taking the time to talk
to my teenager, making her instantly comfortable in what could have been
an intimidating setting.&nbsp;&nbsp; My family got to meet Brian, too.</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience
was repeated almost exactly in October 2004, when Brian brought his "Smile"
tour again to The Backyard.&nbsp; Again, we were treated like royalty.&nbsp;
This time my brother, who first introduced me to the Beach Boys, got to
meet Brian.&nbsp; What an experience.&nbsp; And this time my younger daughter
got to come.&nbsp; She fell in love with Scott Bennett, "the good looking
one," who made her day by giving her a hug.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are good
people.</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time
I didn't need to refurbish the instrument.&nbsp; It continues to work well,
and has stood the test of time.&nbsp; I feel gratified by it all.&nbsp;</font></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many thanks
to Darian for crediting me on the program and CD.</font></font>

used to produce the "woo-woo" sound in the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations"

Vibrations" was a Heathkit tube-type audio oscillator coupled to a mechanical
action that allowed the player to mark notes along a ruler-type scale where
notes could be located quickly and precisely.&nbsp;&nbsp; For live performance,
this configuration outperforms a Theremin probably 10-1.&nbsp; The one

tour.&nbsp; My instrument has held up well and continues to be played on
Brian's "Smile" tour.&nbsp; The instrument is called either a slide theremin
or a Tannerin, respectfully named after its originator, Paul Tanner.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months
ago, the Broadway Production of the musical &#8220;Good Vibrations&#8221; contacted
me, wanting a couple of authentic slide theremins for their show at the
old and classy Eugene O'Neill Theater.&nbsp; I built them as fast as I
could&nbsp; (they look like <a href="#Twin Sisters">twin sisters</a> with
slight differences) and shipped them off.&nbsp; Little did I know that
my daughter's high school band would be performing in Carnegie Hall not
too long after the opening of the show.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in late
March I made the trip to NYC with my daughter and her 200 classmates. We
decided to go see Good Vibrations.&nbsp; David Holcenberg, the musical
director of the show, was gracious enough to get tickets for us.&nbsp;
In short, <b>GOOD VIBRATIONS IS FABULOUS.</b></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It puzzles
me that some snooty NYC reviewers panned the show.&nbsp; All I can figure
is that these writers must be way out of step with theater-goers, or they
must have some agenda.&nbsp; Boy, were they wrong!&nbsp; The theater was
PACKED, standing room only.&nbsp; Thirty of the the best of Brian's and
the Beach Boys' songs crammed into two acts, crowds singing and clapping,
ovations after almost every song.&nbsp;&nbsp; I confess, my mind wandered
during the dark &#8220;Phantom of the Opera&#8221;, but not at &#8220;Good Vibrations.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My eyes and ears were riveted.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a simple story (apparently critics
can't handle that), but just perfect for promoting the MUSIC, which was
crystal clear, brilliantly arranged and performed, faithful to Brian's
vision.&nbsp; I know why some fans see it over and over.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During intermission,
I found the stage manager, introduced myself, and asked him what the chances
were of meeting the musicians so I could check on how the instruments were
working out for them.&nbsp; He cordially told me he'd see what he could
do, and suggested that I check with him after the show.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had excellent
seats near the front.&nbsp; At intermission's end, I struck up a conversation
with the couple sitting by me, asking them what compelled them to see this
particular show. Turns out they were childhood friends of the writer, Richard
Dresser.&nbsp; They'd had dinner with him earlier that evening.&nbsp; When
they learned of my connection, they insisted on introducing me to Richard.&nbsp;
So after the show, I met him, and he very graciously told me how much the
slide theremin adds to the production and how much he appreciates it.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked
him if my daughter and I could talk to the musicians.&nbsp; He replied,
&#8220;Of course!&#8221; and led us backstage.&nbsp; Backstage was really downstairs.&nbsp;
Very cramped downstairs.&nbsp; Richard introduced me to Henry Aranson,
who plays the instrument.&nbsp; Henry was already expecting us and gladly
told me all about his experiences with the instrument, how it was perfect,
except for the bottom plate warping a bit (dadburn particle board!)&nbsp;
He likes the slide action, and he keeps the second instrument only as a
backup.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was intrigued
that the keyboards (and slide theremin) were in one cramped room, the guitars
and drums in another (actually staying on a lift that brought them up to
stage level), and the saxophone player in his own little room with the
door shut, all connected by audio and video terminals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
I recalled, upon leaving the stage area, I noticed a couple of video monitors
on the front face of the balcony.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the monitors, I had seen
gray-haired woman playing a keyboard and conducting the closing sequence
Paul Schaeffer style.&nbsp; I saw her cut off the band, close her music
folder, get up and leave, oblivious to any audience that could turn around
and see what was going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then realized that that&#8217;s how
the stage performers get their cues.&nbsp; Nifty.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My teenaged
daughter had other plans.&nbsp; She proceeded to get the autograph of the
lovely Amanda Kloots (Bikini Girl) for her boyfriend, who had seen Ms.
Kloots in costume on a poster and thinks she&#8217;s hot.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a thrilling
end to the evening!&nbsp; Amanda was very sweet and appreciative.&nbsp;
Stunning beauty, too, absolutely radiant during the show.</font></font>

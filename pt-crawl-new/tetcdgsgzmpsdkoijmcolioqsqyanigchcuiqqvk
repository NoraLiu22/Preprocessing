<h2>SURVEYS AND CONTESTS</h2>

<p>From time-to-time, our Website requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information.</p>

<h2>HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</h2>

<p>We may use personally identifying information you supply through the Website to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to our forum, we may use your e-mail address to send you periodic e-mails. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail.</p>

<p>We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. We reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times contain sufficient information for us to be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.</p>

<p>As our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by the Service Provider, its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about our Website users may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<h2>AFFILIATED SITES, LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS</h2>

<p>We expect our partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our business partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our Website, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visits to our Website you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Website page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through a page on the Website you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. We are not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>

<p>While on our Website, our advertisers, business partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising may be served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our Website, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. We do not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>

<p>Our Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.</p>

<h2>CHILDREN</h2>

<p>This Website is not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums and chats. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>

<p>Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Service Provider can not guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website. We take precautions to protect your personally identifiable information but no computer system is completely secure. Due to this, we cannot guarantee the safety of your personally identifiable information. &nbsp;In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).</p>

<h2>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

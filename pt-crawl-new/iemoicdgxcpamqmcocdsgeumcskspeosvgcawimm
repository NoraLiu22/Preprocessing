          text was originally published in 1907 by the Bureau of American Ethnology 
          as part of its <em>Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico</em>. 
          It was later reproduced, in 1913, by the Geographic Board of Canada. 
          The work done by the American Bureau was monumental, well informed and 
          incorporated the most advanced scholarship available at the time. In 
          many respects, the information is still useful today, although prudence 
          should be exercised and the reader should consult some of the contemporary 
          texts on the history and the anthropology of the North American Indians 
          suggested in the bibliographic introduction to this section. The articles 
          were not completely devoid of the paternalism and the prejudices prevalent 
          at the time. While some of the terminology used would not pass the test 
          of our "politically correct" era, most terms have been left unchanged 
          by the editor. If a change in the original text has been effected it 
          will be found between brackets [.] The original work contained long 
          bibliographies that have not been reproduced for this web edition. For 
          the full citation, see the end of the text.] </font></p>

        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">Among 
          the many birds held in superstitious and appreciative regard by the 
          aborigines of North America, the eagle, by reason of its majestic, solitary, 
          and mysterious nature, became an especial object of worship. This is 
          expressed in the employment of the eagle by the Indian for religious 
          and aesthetic purposes only. The wing bones were fashioned into whistles 
          to be carried by warriors or used in ceremonies, and the talons formed 
          powerful amulets or fetishes, having secondary value as ornaments; the 
          feathers were, however, of the greatest importance. The capture of eagles 
          for their feathers was a hazardous branch of hunting, requiring great 
          skill. Among some tribes eagle-killing was delegated to certain men. 
          Owing to the difficulty of getting within bowshot of the bird, it was 
          often trapped, or the eyrie was visited to secure the young. Eagles 
          are still kept in captivity by the Pueblo Indians as in the time of 
          Coronado (<em>14th Rep. B. A. E </em>., 516, 1896). The striking war 
          bonnet of the Plains tribes was made of eagle feathers and was highly 
          valued, for it is said that one pony was the price of a perfect tail 
          of 12 feathers of the "war eagle;" i. e., the white plumes with black 
          tips. Other varieties, with bars across the feathers, are regarded as 
          inferior (Mooney). Warriors of the Plains tribes usually wore the feathers 
          of the golden eagle only, and it is probable that the customs of many 
          tribes prescribed like discriminations as to feathers of different species. 
          Many tribes wore one or more eagle feathers in the hair, and these feathers 
          were often cut, coloured, or otherwise decorated with some cognizance 
          of the wearer. It was the custom of the Pillager Chippewa to allow a 
          warrior who scalped an enemy to wear on his head two eagle feathers, 
          and the act of capturing a wounded prisoner on the battlefield earned 
          the distinction of wearing five. Fans made of the primary feathers of 
          the eagle formed an accessory to the costume of the Sioux and other 
          tribes. Eagle feathers were also attached as ornaments to the buckskin 
          shirts worn by men, and war costumes and paraphernalia, including shields, 
          were ornamented with them. As one of the prominent totemic animals, 
          the eagle gave its name to many clans and religious fraternities. It 
          is probable that nearly every tribe in the United States recognising 
          clan or gentile organization had an eagle clan or gens at some period 
          in its history: </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; 
          </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
          eagle held an important place in symbolic art. It was depicted by all 
          the methods of art expression known to the Indian, appearing on pottery, 
          basketry, textiles, beadwork, quillwork, shields, create, totem poles, 
          house and grave posts, pipes, rattles, and objects pertaining to cult 
          and ceremony. It was also represented in the primitive drama connected 
          with ceremonies. Many tribes possessed eagle deities, as the Kwahu, 
          the eagle kachina of the Hopi of Arizona, and the Eagle god of the Miwok 
          of California. </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; 
          </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">Among 
          the Haida, passes made with eagle fans were thought to be effectual 
          in conjuring, and this use reappears in many tribes. The wing-bones 
          were often employed as sucking tubes, with which medicine-men pretended 
          to remove disease. The Tlingit and other North Pacific tribes used eagle 
          down for ceremonial sprinkling on the hair, masks, and dance costume; 
          it was also scattered in the air, being blown through a tube or sprinkled 
          by hand. The Pawnee and other Plains tribes as well as the Pueblos also 
          used the down in ceremonies, and it was probably a general custom. Among 
          the Hopi the eagle is generally associated with the Sky god, and its 
          feathers are used with discs to represent the Sun god (Fewkes). </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; 
          </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
          use of eagle feathers in religion is nowhere better shown than among 
          the Pueblos, when downy plumes are attached to masks, rattles, prayer-sticks, 
          and other cult objects entering into ceremonies. For this purpose a 
          great quantity of feathers is yearly required. The Hopi clans claimed 
          the eagle nests is the localities where they formerly resided, and caught 
          in traps or took from the nests eaglets, whose down was used in ceremonies. 
          The eaglets, when required for feathers, have their heads washed; they 
          are killed by pressure on the thorax, and buried with appropriate rites 
          in special cemeteries, in which offerings of small wooden images and 
          bows and arrows are yearly deposited. The interior Salish also are said 
          by Teit to have property in eagles. Near the present Hopi villages there 
          are shrines in which offerings of eagle eggs carved from wood are placed 
          during the winter solstice for the increase of eagles. Among the Zu&ntilde;i, 
          feathers shed by their captive eagles have special significance, though 
          the feathers are also regularly plucked and form a staple article of 
          trade. </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; 
          </font></p>
        <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Arial" size="2">Then 
          mythology of almost every tribe is replete with eagle beings, and the 
          wide-spread thunderbird myth relates in some cases to the eagle. In 
          Hopi myth the Man-eagle is a sky being who lays aside his plumage after 
          flights in which he spreads devastation, and the hero who slays him 
          is carried to the house in the sky by eagles of several species, each 
          one in its turn bearing him higher. The Man-eagle myth is widely diffused, 
          most tribes regarding this being as a manifestation of either helpful 
          or maleficent power. </font></p>

KidCutUp provided some great DJ tunes before GroupLove, Brandi Carlile, and Pink. Kept the crowd excited, dancing and singing along.  GroupLove was good (my first time to hear them). Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins were fantastic!  Sang all her hits and joined Pink during her set for “No One Compares 2 You” in a tribute to the great Sinead O’Connor. Brandi ended her set with Queen’s “We Are the Champions” in a rousing audience participation song fest. Then came Pink. Energy-filled, spectacular with great songs and physical feats, along with pyrotechnics!  Kicked out a disruptive concert-goer, but then went right back to singing and dancing.

The musicians, dancers, everyone involved created an experience above and beyond. Opening acts were excellent as well. 5 stars all around\r\n\r\nVenue - the lack of accessible water refill stations was extremely disappointing. They knew it was going to be hot, and failed, in my opinion to make them readily available to the masses. Maybe they were underprepared, but definitely should be addressed for future performances at this venue. Also the method of moving people to the seats on the \"floor\" aka outfield, needs to be further reviewed - bottlenecks and delays didn't help the standing in line situations. Applaud the ease of the Grab and Go water/alcohol options, was relatively quick and efficient. 2.5 stars based on the water issue, the grab and go was redeeming.","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Charles Schwab Field Omaha","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Omaha, NE","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"August 22nd 2023","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Brooke","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/03.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/01.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.png","rating":5,"comment":"WOWED  & AMAZED!!!

Rounded out with a STELLAR band, we had ourselves one heck of a show.\n\nKid Cut Up, Grouplove, Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo kicked it off and did not disappoint!! \nThe evening was magical!!!\n\nIf you get the opportunity,  get to this show!","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Target Field","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Minneapolis, MN","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"August 12th 2023","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Tracee","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/07.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.png","rating":5,"comment":"We loved Brandi Carlisle and Pink but, in my opinion,  Grouplove should change their name to, \"Sour Note.\" We were questioning how were a part of such a great line-up otherwise.\n THE best part was when Brandi said what she was doing, singing in a stadium of people, was not reality but a dream that you have when you first pick up a guitar. Right after that, she started singing and a rainbw came across the sky, one end disappearing right behind the stage. I really hope one of the stage people caught it and showed it to her later.\nWe are huge fans of Pink's performances and her music who paid and planned to be there to just  have fun and forget the b.s. going on in our lives and everywhere.  I mean, the tour is \"Summer Carnival\" that screams fun!! Respectfully, I wish she would remember that when choosing a song list.  There's enough doom and gloom, that's why we wanted to see her. To laugh and enjoy and escape for a few hours before going right back out into it.","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Great American Ballpark","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Cincinnati, OH","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"July 27th 2023","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Leslie","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.png","rating":4,"comment":"Pink herself was brilliant.

Food available was hot dogs or sausage rolls (no chips, pizza, burgers, nuggets etc). The gig opened at 4.30 so it was a long day to be stuck in a small area with limited food choices. Prices were ludicrous but we expected that. There was no access to merchandise in the arena other than the standing area that can’t be accessed by anyone in the seats. We had hoped to buy our T-shirts in there and wear them but had to get them after the gig. Women’s toilets were limited, queues were huge!!! Thankfully they did have portaloos outside the venue for those queuing.

But nothing prepared me for last night. Not only does she entertain with a well-choreographed show, she’s humble, she’s funny and the show brims with passion. This is a well-rehearsed production, yet she still makes it feel spontaneous. There are lots of fast rock-out songs with pyrotechnics but also quiet moments where her voice shines during the ballads. Highlights for me were the nod to Gwen Stefani/No Doubt blend of Just a Girl with her own Funhouse and her flying all around the arena like Tinkerbell during So What. What a phenomenal show. What a phenomenal performance. P!nk sure gives you your money’s worth. I tend to avoid big stadium concerts, but for P!nk I’ll gladly make an exception. Go see her!

I had priority entry, got in got a space made friends with the people around me and by the time the act started everyone had pushed to the front injuring us and causing overcrowding. Gold tickets had a separate section I think priority should have it’s own section then general admission. I saw one too many people having to be carried out due to pushing and crowding which would have been easily avoided. \n\nHyde park- do better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":3.5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Holly"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"P!nk","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"},"genre":"Pop-rock","sameAs":"https://www.instagram.com/pink/","description":"Since her debut in 2000, P!NK has released 9 studio albums, 1 greatest hits album, sold over 60 million albums equivalents worldwide, 15 singles in the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (four at #1),and has sold out arenas and stadiums all over the world.

Food available was hot dogs or sausage rolls (no chips, pizza, burgers, nuggets etc). The gig opened at 4.30 so it was a long day to be stuck in a small area with limited food choices. Prices were ludicrous but we expected that. There was no access to merchandise in the arena other than the standing area that can’t be accessed by anyone in the seats. We had hoped to buy our T-shirts in there and wear them but had to get them after the gig. Women’s toilets were limited, queues were huge!!! Thankfully they did have portaloos outside the venue for those queuing.

But nothing prepared me for last night. Not only does she entertain with a well-choreographed show, she’s humble, she’s funny and the show brims with passion. This is a well-rehearsed production, yet she still makes it feel spontaneous. There are lots of fast rock-out songs with pyrotechnics but also quiet moments where her voice shines during the ballads. Highlights for me were the nod to Gwen Stefani/No Doubt blend of Just a Girl with her own Funhouse and her flying all around the arena like Tinkerbell during So What. What a phenomenal show. What a phenomenal performance. P!nk sure gives you your money’s worth. I tend to avoid big stadium concerts, but for P!nk I’ll gladly make an exception. Go see her!

her show that I COULD SEE. We sat on level 1 Aisle 40 and I thought it would be far out enough to see everything on stage but the stage had a partial blind spot with the back half in a tunnel shape so we missed all the activity going on at the back of stage including the trampolining stunts for Trustfall. I&#x27;m disappointed in the Event Organiser for selling us $305 tickets for a partial view.

Amway was not.

It&#x27;s truly a privilege to be able to follow an artist as complete and talented as she is.

The combination of her incredible voice, captivating performance, and meaningful lyrics made for an unforgettable night. I feel so fortunate to have been part of the audience, and I can&#x27;t wait for the next opportunity to see her in concert again. 

Thank you, Pink, for sharing your amazing talent with the world!

KidCutUp provided some great DJ tunes before GroupLove, Brandi Carlile, and Pink. Kept the crowd excited, dancing and singing along.  GroupLove was good (my first time to hear them). Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins were fantastic!  Sang all her hits and joined Pink during her set for “No One Compares 2 You” in a tribute to the great Sinead O’Connor. Brandi ended her set with Queen’s “We Are the Champions” in a rousing audience participation song fest. Then came Pink. Energy-filled, spectacular with great songs and physical feats, along with pyrotechnics!  Kicked out a disruptive concert-goer, but then went right back to singing and dancing.

Venue - the lack of accessible water refill stations was extremely disappointing. They knew it was going to be hot, and failed, in my opinion to make them readily available to the masses. Maybe they were underprepared, but definitely should be addressed for future performances at this venue. Also the method of moving people to the seats on the &quot;floor&quot; aka outfield, needs to be further reviewed - bottlenecks and delays didn&#x27;t help the standing in line situations.

 THE best part was when Brandi said what she was doing, singing in a stadium of people, was not reality but a dream that you have when you first pick up a guitar. Right after that, she started singing and a rainbw came across the sky, one end disappearing right behind the stage. I really hope one of the stage people caught it and showed it to her later.
We are huge fans of Pink&#x27;s performances and her music who paid and planned to be there to just  have fun and forget the b.s. going on in our lives and everywhere.

I had priority entry, got in got a space made friends with the people around me and by the time the act started everyone had pushed to the front injuring us and causing overcrowding. Gold tickets had a separate section I think priority should have it’s own section then general admission. I saw one too many people having to be carried out due to pushing and crowding which would have been easily avoided.

Food available was hot dogs or sausage rolls (no chips, pizza, burgers, nuggets etc). The gig opened at 4.30 so it was a long day to be stuck in a small area with limited food choices. Prices were ludicrous but we expected that. There was no access to merchandise in the arena other than the standing area that can’t be accessed by anyone in the seats. We had hoped to buy our T-shirts in there and wear them but had to get them after the gig. Women’s toilets were limited, queues were huge!!!

P!nk put on one hell of a show which included a surprise. Normally she ends a gig with So What! But this time she finished with Glitter In The Air, which is another favourite of mine.

But nothing prepared me for last night. Not only does she entertain with a well-choreographed show, she’s humble, she’s funny and the show brims with passion. This is a well-rehearsed production, yet she still makes it feel spontaneous. There are lots of fast rock-out songs with pyrotechnics but also quiet moments where her voice shines during the ballads. Highlights for me were the nod to Gwen Stefani/No Doubt blend of Just a Girl with her own Funhouse and her flying all around the arena like Tinkerbell during So What. What a phenomenal show. What a phenomenal performance. P!nk sure gives you your money’s worth. I tend to avoid big stadium concerts, but for P!nk I’ll gladly make an exception. Go see her!

We sat on level 1 Aisle 40 and I thought it would be far out enough to see everything on stage but the stage had a partial blind spot with the back half in a tunnel shape so we missed all the activity going on at the back of stage including the trampolining stunts for Trustfall.

Amway was not.

It&#x27;s truly a privilege to be able to follow an artist as complete and talented as she is.

The combination of her incredible voice, captivating performance, and meaningful lyrics made for an unforgettable night. I feel so fortunate to have been part of the audience, and I can&#x27;t wait for the next opportunity to see her in concert again. 

Thank you, Pink, for sharing your amazing talent with the world!

KidCutUp provided some great DJ tunes before GroupLove, Brandi Carlile, and Pink. Kept the crowd excited, dancing and singing along.  GroupLove was good (my first time to hear them). Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins were fantastic!  Sang all her hits and joined Pink during her set for “No One Compares 2 You” in a tribute to the great Sinead O’Connor. Brandi ended her set with Queen’s “We Are the Champions” in a rousing audience participation song fest. Then came Pink. Energy-filled, spectacular with great songs and physical feats, along with pyrotechnics!  Kicked out a disruptive concert-goer, but then went right back to singing and dancing.

Venue - the lack of accessible water refill stations was extremely disappointing. They knew it was going to be hot, and failed, in my opinion to make them readily available to the masses. Maybe they were underprepared, but definitely should be addressed for future performances at this venue. Also the method of moving people to the seats on the &quot;floor&quot; aka outfield, needs to be further reviewed - bottlenecks and delays didn&#x27;t help the standing in line situations. Applaud the ease of the Grab and Go water/alcohol options, was relatively quick and efficient. 2.5 stars based on the water issue, the grab and go was redeeming.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Omaha, NE</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Charles Schwab Field Omaha</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/01.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/03.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Brooke</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">August 12th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">WOWED  &amp; AMAZED!!!

Dance moves as always were on point. Costumes were gorgeous &amp; FuN. Her backup singers and dancers are the BEST.  Rounded out with a STELLAR band, we had ourselves one heck of a show.

 THE best part was when Brandi said what she was doing, singing in a stadium of people, was not reality but a dream that you have when you first pick up a guitar. Right after that, she started singing and a rainbw came across the sky, one end disappearing right behind the stage. I really hope one of the stage people caught it and showed it to her later.
We are huge fans of Pink&#x27;s performances and her music who paid and planned to be there to just  have fun and forget the b.s. going on in our lives and everywhere.  I mean, the tour is &quot;Summer Carnival&quot; that screams fun!! Respectfully, I wish she would remember that when choosing a song list.  There&#x27;s enough doom and gloom, that&#x27;s why we wanted to see her.

The other acts, including Gwen Stefani, didn&#x27;t energise the crowd like the main act, and the interim music between acts was old and dull. And I&#x27;m not exactly a youth myself! But worst of all were 1) the horrible delay between the sound and screen visuals and 2) the ridiculous queues for water!

I had priority entry, got in got a space made friends with the people around me and by the time the act started everyone had pushed to the front injuring us and causing overcrowding. Gold tickets had a separate section I think priority should have it’s own section then general admission. I saw one too many people having to be carried out due to pushing and crowding which would have been easily avoided.

Food available was hot dogs or sausage rolls (no chips, pizza, burgers, nuggets etc). The gig opened at 4.30 so it was a long day to be stuck in a small area with limited food choices. Prices were ludicrous but we expected that. There was no access to merchandise in the arena other than the standing area that can’t be accessed by anyone in the seats. We had hoped to buy our T-shirts in there and wear them but had to get them after the gig. Women’s toilets were limited, queues were huge!!!

But nothing prepared me for last night. Not only does she entertain with a well-choreographed show, she’s humble, she’s funny and the show brims with passion. This is a well-rehearsed production, yet she still makes it feel spontaneous. There are lots of fast rock-out songs with pyrotechnics but also quiet moments where her voice shines during the ballads. Highlights for me were the nod to Gwen Stefani/No Doubt blend of Just a Girl with her own Funhouse and her flying all around the arena like Tinkerbell during So What. What a phenomenal show. What a phenomenal performance. P!nk sure gives you your money’s worth. I tend to avoid big stadium concerts, but for P!nk I’ll gladly make an exception. Go see her!

They knew it was going to be hot, and failed, in my opinion to make them readily available to the masses. Maybe they were underprepared, but definitely should be addressed for future performances at this venue. Also the method of moving people to the seats on the \"floor\" aka outfield, needs to be further reviewed - bottlenecks and delays didn't help the standing in line situations.

Right after that, she started singing and a rainbw came across the sky, one end disappearing right behind the stage.

But this time she finished with Glitter In The Air, which is another favourite of mine.\nAll in all another superb gig.\nI will definitely be going for a golden circle ticket when she is next touring the UK.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ian"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"P!nk","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"},"genre":"Pop-rock","sameAs":"https://www.instagram.com/pink/","description":"Since her debut in 2000, P!NK has released 9 studio albums, 1 greatest hits album, sold over 60 million albums equivalents worldwide, 15 singles in the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (four at #1),and has sold out arenas and stadiums all over the world.

But nothing prepared me for last night. Not only does she entertain with a well-choreographed show, she’s humble, she’s funny and the show brims with passion. This is a well-rehearsed production, yet she still makes it feel spontaneous. There are lots of fast rock-out songs with pyrotechnics but also quiet moments where her voice shines during the ballads. Highlights for me were the nod to Gwen Stefani/No Doubt blend of Just a Girl with her own Funhouse and her flying all around the arena like Tinkerbell during So What. What a phenomenal show. What a phenomenal performance. P!nk sure gives you your money’s worth. I tend to avoid big stadium concerts, but for P!nk I’ll gladly make an exception. Go see her! You won’t regret it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gina"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"P!nk","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"},"genre":"Pop-rock","sameAs":"https://www.instagram.com/pink/","description":"Since her debut in 2000, P!NK has released 9 studio albums, 1 greatest hits album, sold over 60 million albums equivalents worldwide, 15 singles in the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (four at #1),and has sold out arenas and stadiums all over the world.

I’ve heard she’s great but nothing compares to being there. As a fellow Eastern PA gal and musician, I’ve followed her for 16 years and finally got the chance to see her in person. She’s a wonderful human and an incredible entertainer. From the sets to the costume changes to the dance routines to the acrobatics... she did not disappoint!!  She’s still humble and grateful for her fans. And we even were blessed with a brief appearance from Willow. 🙂","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer"}}]</script>

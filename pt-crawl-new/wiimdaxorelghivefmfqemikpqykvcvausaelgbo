<p>The early days of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's <em>perestroika</em> in
        Belorussia were highlighted by two major events: the Chornobyl' disaster
        of April 26, 1986 (the Belorussian SSR absorbed 70 percent of the
        radioactive contaminants spewed out by the reactor), and a December 1986
        petition sent by twenty-eight intellectuals to Gorbachev expressing the
        Belorussian people's fundamental grievances in the field of culture
        (&quot;a cultural Chornobyl'&quot;).
        <p>Whereas the full impact of the physical effects of Chornobyl' was
        kept secret for more than three years, the &quot;cultural
        Chornobyl'&quot; became a subject of hot discussion and an inspiration
        for considerable political activity. The petition pleaded with Gorbachev
        to prevent the &quot;spiritual extinction&quot; of the Belorussian
        nation and laid out measures for the introduction of Belorussian as a
        working language in party, state, and local government bodies and at all
        levels of education, publishing, mass media, and other fields.
        <p>The document embodied the aspirations of a considerable part of the
        national intelligentsia, who, having received no positive answer from
        the CPSU leadership either in Moscow or in Minsk, took to the streets. A
        number of independent youth groups sprang up, many of which embraced the
        national cause. In July 1988, the Organizational Committee of the
        Confederation of Belorussian Youth Associations called for &quot;support
        of the radical restructuring of Belorussia.&quot;
        <p>In June 1988, mass graves, allegedly with up to 250,000 of Stalin's
        victims, were found near Minsk at Kurapaty. This sensational discovery
        fueled denunciations of the old regime and brought demands for reforms.
        An October demonstration, attended by about 10,000 people and dispersed
        by riot police, commemorated these victims as well as expressing support
        for the Belarusian Popular Front (BPF), which had been formed earlier in
        the month in hopes of encouraging reform.
        <p>The group of activists who called for reform was relatively small;
        most people, although angry about the graves, remained both attached to
        Soviet ways and politically apathetic, believing that all these public
        activities would make no difference in the long run. The March 4, 1990,
        elections to the republic's Supreme Soviet illustrated the extent of
        political apathy and ideological inertia. Of the 360 seats in the
        legislature, fifteen were unfilled (at least eleven remained so more
        than a year later); of those elected, 86 percent belonged to the
        Communist Party of Belorussia (CPB). This conservative majority was not
        alone in slowing the pace of reforms. A majority of the republic's
        population, 83 percent, also voted conservatively in the March 17
        all-union referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union, even
        though the Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR adopted the Declaration
        of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic on June
        27, 1990 (following the Russian example of some two weeks earlier).
        <p>A series of strikes in April 1991 put an end to the Belorussian SSR's
        reputation as the quietest of the European Soviet republics. The demands
        were mainly economic (higher wages and cancellation of a new sales tax),
        but some were also political (resignation of the Belorussian government
        and depoliticization of republic institutions). Certain economic demands
        were met, but the political ones were not. However, increasing dissent
        within the party led to thirty-three CPB deputies joining the opposition
        as the Communists for Democracy faction one month later.</p>

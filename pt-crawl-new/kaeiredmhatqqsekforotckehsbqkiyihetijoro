								</h4>

							<div id="accordion1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><p>The current Right-to-Know Law was introduced by Senator Dominic Pileggi as Senate Bill 1 on&nbsp;March 29, 2007. It was signed into law&nbsp;on Feb.&nbsp;14, 2008. Most of the current RTKL&nbsp;took effect on Jan.&nbsp;1, 2009, but the entire law took effect in three stages:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On Feb.&nbsp;14, 2008, the title and&nbsp;definitions went into effect and the Office of Open Records was officially created.</li>
	<li>On July 1, 2008, the law required all state contracts exceeding $5,000 to be posted on the&nbsp;<a href="http://contracts.patreasury.gov/search.aspx">Pennsylvania Treasury&#39;s website</a>.</li>
	<li>On Jan.&nbsp;1, 2009, the remaining portions of the law went into effect.</li>

								</h4>
							</div>
							<div id="accordion2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><p>Under the current RTKL, all state and local government agency records are presumed to be public. This means that if an agency wants to withhold a record, it must prove that it is entitled to do so under the RTKL, another law or regulation, privilege (such as attorney-client privilege), or court order. Also, the current law established the Office of Open Records which makes it simple and free for a requester to appeal an agency denial.</p>

<p>Under the old law, the burden was on a requester to establish why a&nbsp;record was public. Also, all appeals went to court, which can be expensive and tends to be a far more time-consuming process than an appeal to the OOR.</p>

									<p><p>The OOR has prepared an entire page to answer this question: <a href="http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/RTKL/HowToFile.cfm">How to File a Right-to-Know Request</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, the best way to request records from a state or local agency in Pennsylvania is to use the OOR&#39;s&nbsp;Standard RTK Request Form, which&nbsp;must be accepted by all agencies. (You can find a link to the form on the <a href="http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/RTKL/HowToFile.cfm">How to File a Right-to-Know Request</a> page.)&nbsp;Some agencies also have their own forms, which&nbsp;you may find to be&nbsp;more useful.&nbsp;However, all agencies must accept the OOR&#39;s Standard&nbsp;Request Form.</p>

<p>You might also find it helpful to search the OOR&#39;s <a href="https://www.openrecords.pa.gov/RTKL/AOROSearch.cfm">database of agency open records officers</a> to find the best person to direct your request to.</p>

								</h4>
							</div>
							<div id="accordion5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><p>An agency can ask, but the requester is not required to answer.</p>

<p>The law prohibits an agency from requiring a person to disclose the purpose or motive in requesting access to records. If you request records and are asked why, but you don&#39;t want to answer, one good approach is to politely remind the agency that your motive is not relevant to the request and to then respectfully decline to answer.</p>

<p>However, in some cases knowing the answer could actually help an agency better respond to a request. So, depending on the circumstances, a requester may want to provide the information even though you are not required to do so.</p>

								</h4>
							</div>
							<div id="accordion6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><p>The Right-to-Know Law defines &quot;requester&quot; as &quot;a person that is a legal resident of the United States and requests records pursuant to this act.&quot; Thus, any&nbsp;legal resident of the United States can file a request under the RTKL.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that while the RTKL does not define &quot;person,&quot; that term is defined in&nbsp;the Statutory Construction Act as &quot;a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, other association, government entity (other than the Commonwealth), estate, trust, foundation or natural person.&quot;</p>

								</h4>
							</div>
							<div id="accordion7" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><p>The Office of Open Records has established an <a href="http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/RTKL/FeeStructure.cfm">Official Fee Structure</a> which governs the fees an agency may charge under the Right-to-Know Law.&nbsp;Generally, agencies cannot charge other fees. The RTKL states that,&nbsp;except as otherwise provided by statute, no other fees may be imposed unless the agency necessarily incurs costs for complying with the request, and such fees must be reasonable. No fee may be imposed for an agency&#39;s review of a record to determine whether the record is subject to access under the RTKL.</p>

<p>If a separate statute authorizes an agency to charge a set amount for a certain type of record, the agency may charge no more than that statutory amount. For example, a Recorder of Deeds may charge a copy fee of $0.50 per uncertified page and $1.50 per certified page under 42 P.S. &sect; 21051.</p>

								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><p>Here are several basic steps every agency should take:</p>

<p>Appoint a good Agency Open Records Officer. Make sure this person can effectively manage requests and deal with the public. Make sure the AORO is registered with the OOR.</p>

<p>Review your records management policy and ensure that all employees comply with it. (If you don&#39;t have a records management policy, create one.)</p>

<p>Organize your records to help speed responses to RTKL requests.</p>

<p>Encourage&nbsp;all employees to make RTK requests a priority and let them know that the OOR is a good resource if they have questions. (We receive multiple emails and calls every day from agency employees, and we&#39;re always happy to answer.)</p>

<p>Attend one or more training sessions, or contact the OOR to request that one be scheduled in your area.</p>

									<p><p>They can be.</p>

<p>The RTKL&nbsp;does not distinguish between various types of records (e.g., printed letters and memos, electronic databases, emails, itemized cell phone bills, etc.). Every record goes through the same two-part analysis to determine whether it is a public record and subject to release:</p>

<p>1. Is it a record? (In other words, does it document a transaction or activity of an agency?)</p>

<p>2. If so, is it a public record? (Or can it be withheld under the RTKL, another law or regulation, a privilege, or a court order?)</p>

<p>As a general rule, agencies must provide aggregated data and financial records.</p>

							<div id="accordion19" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><p>No. But their records are subject to the law and must be made available as follows.</p>

<p>Local tax collectors are not considered &quot;agencies&quot; under the RTKL due to the Pennsylvania Local Tax Collection Law, 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. 5511.1-5511.42. 72 P.S. 5511.4c. entitled &quot;Tax collection records&quot; states as follows: &quot;(c) This section shall not be construed to do any of the following: (1) Make a tax collector an &quot;agency&quot; or authorize requests of the tax collector for records pursuant to the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L. 390, No. 212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law.&quot;</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Court in <em>Current Status Inc. v. Hykel</em>, 778 A.2d 781 (Pa. Cmwlth.) specifically addressed that question under the old RTKL concluding that local tax collectors are not subject to the RTKL. However, while the local tax collector is not itself an agency, the tax records that are maintained by that collector remain agency records, whether of the township, municipality or school district on whose behalf s/he collects.</p>

<p>In <em>Hykel</em>, the Commonwealth Court carefully explained that the records of tax collectors are public and can be obtained directly from governmental units that qualify as agencies under the RTKL, just not directly from the tax collector. The records are public and must be provided by the agency to the extent not otherwise protected from disclosure. The agencies have delegated the task of tax collection to the collectors, as a third party, and the records attendant to performing that governmental function cannot be shielded from view even though the tax collector is not itself an agency. It remains the agencys responsibility to respond to the requester and to furnish copies or perform redaction if needed for any non-public parts of the records.</p>

<p>The OOR does not maintain or control the records of any local or Commonwealth agency. You must first direct your request to the appropriate office when seeking records.

<p>If you send the original request to the OOR (unless you are actually seeking OOR records), you will only delay the process.</p>

Jim asks Jack and Kelly about their “altruistic” motives for doing the show, and as a result, learns some of the unforeseen consequences derived from the show’s massive success. The family also discusses the perils of mixing business with family, with the example of when Sharon threw Caviar at Jack on Christmas Day. Jim explores the Osbournes life-style post-TV show and how embracing their flaws didn’t just make for great TV, it also reminded us why we fell in love with them in the first place.  Hosted on Acast.

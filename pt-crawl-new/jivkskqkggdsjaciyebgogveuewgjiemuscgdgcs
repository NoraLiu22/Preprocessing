<p>Monday, January 1, 2024 – The Supreme Court of Israel has struck down a judicial reform that triggered nationwide protests last year. The change would have put a limit on the power of the Supreme Court regarding overturning laws that were deemed unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In July 2023, the Israeli government passed a bill known as the “reasonableness bill” into law. The bill removed the power of the Supreme Court and other lower courts in Israel to cancel decisions that were made by the government that it deemed to be extremely unreasonable.</p>

<p>8 out of the 15 judges in the Supreme Court ruled against the law. Minister for Justice in Israel, Yariv Levin, who is the architect of the law criticized the judges and accused them of taking all the powers into their hands, and said their decision was undemocratic.</p>

<p>Monday, January 1, 2024 – The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed on Monday that Russia launched a total of 90 Shahed-type drones over Ukraine in the early hours of the new year.

<p>The aerial strikes come after a series of heavy aerial bombardments that started on Friday when Russia unleashed an 18-hour attack on Ukraine. Not less than 49 people were killed due to the bombardment. Ukraine also launched an attack on Saturday in the center of Belgorod, which killed 21 people.</p>

<p>Wednesday, January 3, 2024 – Not less than 95 people were killed by two bomb explosions near the tomb of Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani. The explosion comes as the people gathered there for the fourth anniversary of his assassination by the United States. Several others were also wounded when the blast hit a procession close to a mosque in the city of Kerman.</p>

<p>No groups have taken responsibility for the attack, which is believed to have been the deadliest in Iran in 42 years. The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed that the attack would be met with harsh response.</p>

<p>The first bomb detonated around 15:00 local time on the outskirts of Kerman. The second bomb went off about 15 minutes after the first, targeting the people who had fled the first.</p>

<p>Thursday, January 4, 2024 – The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has signed into law, an order that gives him lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution. The law also prevents opposition leaders who are living in exile from running in future presidential elections.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the law applies to any former president and members of his or her family. However, the law only applies to Lukashenko, a 69-year-old opposition leader who ruled the country with an iron fist for cost to 30 years. The new law eliminates any potential challenger in the country’s next presidential election in 2025.</p>

<p>With the new law, the president and members of his family will be provided with lifelong state protection, medical care, and life and health insurance. The president, after his resignation, will also become a permanent lifelong member of the upper house of parliament.</p>

<p>Monday, January 8, 2024 – The Prime Minister of France, Elisabeth Borne has resigned, after less than two years in office. Her resignation comes as the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, is widely expected to reshuffle his top team ahead of the election in the European Parliament later this year.</p>

<p>According to a statement from the Elysee Palace, Ms. Borne will remain in post until a new Prime Minister is appointed. She was the second female Prime Minister in France, and longest serving, outlasting Edith Cresson who served from 1991-1992.</p>

<p>The minister for education, Gabriel Attal, is the frontrunner for the job. If appointed, he would be the youngest Prime Minister ever appointed in France. In 2022, the party of Mr. Macron lost its parliamentary majority, which means the new prime minister will face opposition to turning the President’s policies into law.</p>

<p>Tuesday, January 9, 2024 – The Police in Poland have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw. Last month, Mariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wasik were both sentenced to two years in jail for abuse of power when they led an anti-corruption office in 2007.</p>

<p>The court issued a warrant on Monday evening for police to detain the men. Despite the warrant, Mr. Duda invited both men to Warsaw’s Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning to attend a ceremony to swear in two of their former colleagues as presidential advisers.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, while speaking at a news conference described the situation as “unbelievable”. He insists that the ruling of the court must be respected and that President Duda is trying to help the men evade justice.</p>

<p>Wednesday, January 10, 2024 – According to the local governor in Papua New Guinea, people have been killed and shops and businesses were set on fire in the capital of the country after the police went on strike. The governor said in a radio broadcast that opportunists had looted the property in Port Moresby when things went out of control.</p>

<p>The commissioner of police, David Manning, said that extra police were being deployed into Port Moresby from regional areas. Defense forces are also being relocated to the city to reinforce officers on the ground.</p>

<p>Police embarked on a strike on Wednesday morning after they discovered a reduction in their pay packets. The government then circulated messages across social media, denying that they had imposed a new tax on the police. The Prime Minister, James Marape, promised to fix any administrative error that led to the pay shortfall.</p>

<p>Friday, January 12, 2024 – The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak, during a visit to Kyiv on Friday made a £2.5bn commitment to the defense of Ukraine. He also pledged that the United Kingdom would not stop its support at a time when military aid from the United States has stalled.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak met with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and addressed the parliament. After talks were held between the two leaders, a new UK-Ukrainian security treaty was signed. The treaty guarantees that the United Kingdom will provide “swift and sustained” help in case Russia attacks Ukraine again.</p>

<p>The latest U.K. military pledge to Ukraine is worth £2.5bn in 2024-2025, which sees an increment of £200m in the previous two years. The package features thousands of shells, long-range missiles, and training for the Ukrainian military.</p>

<p>Saturday, January 13, 2024 – Voters in Taiwan have chosen William Lai as their president. His victory cements a path that is increasingly divergent from China. The result of the election did not sit well with China, which issued a statement shortly after, saying that “Taiwan is part of China”.</p>

<p>Mr. Lai broke new ground by winning an unprecedented third consecutive presidential term for his party. In his first remark after his opponent conceded, he said “The country will continue to walk on the right path forward and pledged that they would not turn around or look backward”.</p>

<p>While giving his speech, he also called for peace and stability with Beijing. He added that he would maintain the cross-strait quo, neither seeking independence nor unification with China. He also promised to protect Taiwan from Chinese threats.</p>

<p>Sunday, January 14, 2024 – The King of Denmark, Frederik X has taken the throne after the abdication of his mother, Queen Margrethe II. Queen Margrethe's abdication after more than five decades on the throne was a shock for everybody. Her decision paved the way for her son, former Crown Prince Frederik, to succeed her.</p>

<p>The handover took place at a cabinet meeting at Christiansburg Palace in the capital Copenhagen. Queen Margrethe signed a declaration of her abdication, which officially transferred the crown to Frederik.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen publicly proclaimed the King’s accession from the balcony of the palace. After the proclamation, Frederik gave a short speech before he was joined by his wife, Queen Mary, and their four children. The King of the United Kingdom, King Charles III congratulated the new king and queen.</p>

<p>Monday, January 15, 2024 – Days after Taiwan elected a new president, one of the country’s last diplomatic allies has cut ties with the island in favor of Beijing. Taiwan suggests that the decision of Nauru was because of the weekend’s election result. China which sees Taiwan as a breakaway province welcomes the decision of Nauru to become its ally. </p>

<p>After Nauru confirmed that it would no longer recognize Taiwan as a separate country, Taiwanese officials said, “The timing is not only China’s retaliation against their democratic election but also a direct challenge to the international order.” In 2002, Nauru made a similar decision to cut ties with Taiwan but later restored it in May 2005.</p>

<p>Nauru is one of the 12 countries that kept diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Each of Taiwan’s remaining allies becomes more important as they claim their sovereignty. </p>

<p>Friday, January 19, 2024 – Officials have confirmed that the fire that broke out over a large area of an oil storage depot in southern Russia was due to a hit by a Ukrainian drone. According to Russian media, four oil tanks caught alight and the fire then spread over an area of 10,763 sq. feet.</p>

<p>The governor of Bryansk confirmed that they intercepted the drone near the town of Klintsy, but its explosives fell on the oil depot. A major oil loading terminal in Russia, in St. Petersburg, was also attacked on Thursday. The recent attack makes it the second attack on Russian oil facilities in two days.</p>

<p>Intelligence in Ukraine confirmed that there would be further attacks on military targets inside Russia as most of their air defense and electronic warfare systems had been concentrated in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Sunday, January 21, 2024 – The Nigeria police have confirmed that they have rescued five sisters who were held hostage after they were kidnapped in the country’s capital. The girls were freed after a joint police-army operation in a forest in northern Nigeria.</p>

<p>The girls were abducted from their home in Abuja earlier this month, alongside another sister who has been killed. According to the Nigerian police, the girls have been reunited with their families,</p>

<p>The six sisters were taken from their home, alongside their father, Mansoor Al-Kadriyar. The kidnappers released their father on the condition that he raise a large amount of money. However, his 21-year-old daughter, who was a final-year university student was killed as a warning. The ransom for returning the girls was set at ₦65m  ($68,000), which led to donations from several Nigerians.</p>

<p>Monday, January 22, 2024 – Australia has abolished its "golden visa" program, which allowed wealthy foreign investors to live in the country, due to poor economic outcomes. The program, which was Launched in 2012 to attract foreign business, has attracted significant investors, with over 85% of successful applicants coming from China.</p>

<p>The government, after multiple reviews, aims to replace it with skilled-worker visas. The government said that the program has failed to meet its core objectives. The minister for Home Affairs, Clare O’Neil, said that for years, it has been evident that the visa is not delivering what the economy of the country needs.</p>

<p>According to the government inquiry, it was discovered that the visas were bringing people into Australia with less business acumen than would have otherwise arrived while offering tax concessions that were costing the public.</p>

<p>Tuesday, January 23, 2024 – The Turkish parliament has approved Sweden's membership in NATO, which brings the Nordic country closer to joining the Western military alliance. Three months after the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan submitted the bill, 287 of 346 MPs voted in favor, 35 against, and the rest abstained.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, was very quick to react to the news, saying, "Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO." Turkey's approval leaves Hungary as the only remaining country to ratify Swedish membership. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the vote, emphasizing that Sweden's membership strengthens NATO and enhances global security.</p>

<p>Sweden applied to join NATO in May 2022, prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, has hinted at progress, inviting Kristersson for negotiations.</p>

<p>Wednesday, January 24, 2024 – Officials confirm that at least 40 people have been reported dead following a tunnel collapse in a gold mine in Mali's southwestern Koulikoro region. According to the official, it started with a noise, then the earth began to shake.</p>

<p>The number of casualties from the incident has not been reported yet, with initial reports stating over 70 casualties, and local official, Oumar Sidibe, confirming the discovery of 73 bodies among the more than 200 gold miners at the site.</p>

<p>The spokesperson of Mali's mining ministry, Baye Coulibaly, suggests a provisional death toll exceeding 40. The government expressed condolences to the families and the Malian people at large. Mining accidents are frequent in Mali due to unsafe practices by unregulated miners seeking gold. Mali is one of the largest exporters of gold in the world.</p>

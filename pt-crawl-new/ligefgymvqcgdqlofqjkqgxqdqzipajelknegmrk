The NBPA exists to protect and support the interests of all 450 NBA players – both as individual players and as a collective. Adherence to league gambling policies is paramount to maintaining the integrity of our athletes and protecting the future of the sport. 

The NBPA will make sure Jontay has access to the resources he needs during this time, in light of the NBA’s decision. All players, including Jontay, should be afforded appropriate due process and opportunity to answer to any charges brought against them.

The NBPA will continue to provide all players with training materials to ensure they understand how to properly navigate the complex sports betting landscape.

                                                    <p>In 1954, Bob Cousy of the Boston Celtics began to organize the
                                                        players by writing to an established player from each team,
                                                        seeking
                                                        their input and support for a formal union to represent players’
                                                        interests. Soon, the National Basketball Players Association was
                                                        created, and Cousy became its first President. In January of
                                                        1955,
                                                        Cousy went to NBA President Maurice Podoloff with a list of
                                                        demands:
                                                        payment of back salaries to the members of the defunct Baltimore
                                                        Bullets club; abolition of the secretive $15 fine for a

                                                        foul” that referees could quietly place on players during a
                                                        game;
                                                        establishment of a 20-game limit on exhibition games, after

                                                        the players could share in the profits; establishment of an
                                                        impartial board of arbitration to settle player-owner disputes;
                                                        payment of $25 for public appearance expenses other than radio,
                                                        television and charitable functions; and moving expenses for

                                                        with the owners over a player pension program with the details

                                                        a goal of $100 a month for players over age 65 with five years

                                                        this
                                                        trend, the NBA soon opened discussions with the ABA over a
                                                        possible
                                                        merger which would eliminate this healthy competition for player
                                                        services. In response, the players filed the “Oscar Robertson
                                                        Suit”
                                                        under the antitrust laws in 1970. Through the lawsuit, the
                                                        players
                                                        hoped to block the merger and also ease the burden of various
                                                        other
                                                        player restraints, including the option clause that bound
                                                        players to
                                                        a team in perpetuity. The NBPA won a restraining order to block
                                                        the
                                                        merger, and the owners came to the table, though not before
                                                        unsuccessfully attempting to gain Congressional approval for a
                                                        merger. New president Paul Silas used leverage from the court
                                                        victory to secure a new agreement with the NBA. The new deal
                                                        gave
                                                        players a limited form of free agency, eliminating the option
                                                        clause
                                                        in all contracts. In addition, the owners paid 500 players a

                                                        of $4.3 million as a settlement and the union $1 million for

                                                        finally merged, but by that time, the collective bargaining
                                                        agreement had brought the players an increase in the minimum

                                                    <h5>NBA alleged violation of its revenue sharing obligation</h5>
                                                    <p>Tensions arose again in 1991, when the NBPA alleged that the
                                                        owners
                                                        were violating the revenue sharing agreement by underreporting
                                                        their
                                                        income, and thereby artificially depressing the Salary Cap and
                                                        the
                                                        players’ guaranteed share of revenues. In a major grievance, the
                                                        players claimed the owners were improperly excluding revenues
                                                        relating to luxury suite and arena signage rentals,
                                                        international
                                                        television broadcasts, related party transactions, and other
                                                        sources. The dispute severely dampened the degree of trust the
                                                        parties felt with each other. With a potentially damaging and

                                                        out litigation on the horizon, the NBA reached a settlement with
                                                        the
                                                        NBPA valued at $62 million for the players. Isiah Thomas, who
                                                        had
                                                        earlier taken over the presidency from Alex English, presided at

                                                    <p>Following the 1995 NBA Finals, for the first time ever, the
                                                        owners
                                                        imposed a lockout, shutting down the business. No basketball
                                                        activity took place during the summer of 1995, as the union
                                                        fought
                                                        two major battles – one with the owners, and the other among
                                                        itself.
                                                        The owners were holding firm to their position that the players
                                                        had
                                                        to accept concessions and tighten up the salary system. The

                                                        differed among themselves as to the best way to fight back.
                                                        Seeing
                                                        that the chances were slim of reaching a fair agreement without
                                                        having to endure a long work stoppage, a large group of players
                                                        felt
                                                        that it would be best to decertify the union, and proceed in
                                                        court
                                                        against the owners; they claimed that the antitrust laws were

                                                        best weapon to stop the owners from imposing restrictive terms

                                                        a tougher salary cap and free agency system. The players
                                                        believed
                                                        they could get a court to order the lockout unlawful, and play
                                                        while
                                                        the claims were litigated. Other players were unsure and uneasy
                                                        about the concept of decertification. Nonetheless, the threat of
                                                        decertification was a very real one. Faced with the prospect of
                                                        another litigation and the uncertainty brought about by the
                                                        proposed
                                                        decertification, the owners agreed to modify their harsh
                                                        demands,
                                                        and a new agreement was reached. The agreement, negotiated under
                                                        President Buck Williams, contained elements for both sides. For
                                                        the
                                                        owners, the agreement eliminated or softened many of the
                                                        multitude
                                                        of salary cap exceptions that had allowed the teams to amass
                                                        large
                                                        payrolls. It also contained a rookie wage scale, with a pre-set
                                                        salary range. In addition, the allowable percentage increase in
                                                        multi-year contracts was reduced from 30% to 20%, and limits
                                                        were
                                                        placed on the length of a contract. Still, for the players, the
                                                        agreement retained the all-important Larry Bird exception,
                                                        allowing
                                                        a team to exceed the Cap to re-sign its own free agent. It also
                                                        eliminated entirely the concept of restricted free agency, with
                                                        unrestricted free agency granted to all players after their
                                                        contract
                                                        expired. In addition, in response to the earlier revenue sharing
                                                        dispute, the parties agreed to include new sources of revenue in

                                                        collectively earning $1 billion in salaries and benefits. In
                                                        March
                                                        of 1998, the owners exercised their option to terminate the
                                                        collective bargaining agreement at the conclusion of the season.
                                                        When the players again refused to accept unfavorable terms, the
                                                        league again locked the players out, shutting down the business
                                                        on
                                                        July 1, 1998. This time, the shutdown lasted far longer. With
                                                        the
                                                        owners seeking a “hard” salary cap that would lead to the
                                                        elimination of guaranteed contracts and the virtual elimination
                                                        of
                                                        the “middle class” of NBA earners, the players dug in and
                                                        refused to
                                                        concede. With no new agreement on the horizon, the League first
                                                        canceled the pre-season, then cancelled the first two months of
                                                        the
                                                        season, and then announced the cancellation of the All-Star
                                                        Game.
                                                        Finally, in January 1999, after a six-month lockout and on the
                                                        eve
                                                        of the “drop dead” date to end the season, the parties reached
                                                        an
                                                        agreement. Games began in early February, with each team playing
                                                        a
                                                        shortened 50 game schedule. The new agreement, negotiated under
                                                        President Patrick Ewing, did not include a hard cap, and instead
                                                        featured a series of trade-offs that the owners hoped would work
                                                        to
                                                        keep salaries down. Many of these terms are discussed below in
                                                        the
                                                        section on the NBA salary system. As it turned out, under the
                                                        1999
                                                        agreement, the players enjoyed an 80% increase in salaries and
                                                        benefits. In 2004-05, the last year of the 1999 CBA, the players
                                                        earned approximately $1.8 billion in salaries and revenues. The
                                                        average player salary rose to well over $4.5 million, and the
                                                        median
                                                        salary experienced unprecedented growth, doubling so that more
                                                        than
                                                        half of all NBA players earned at least $2.8 million.</p>

                                                        have not only accomplished that but we have also established the

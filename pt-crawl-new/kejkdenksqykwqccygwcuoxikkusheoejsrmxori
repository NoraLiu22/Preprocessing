      <p>In 1952, the Sight and Sound team had the novel idea of asking critics to name the greatest films of all time. The tradition became decennial, increasing in size and prestige as the decades passed.</p>
      <p>The Sight and Sound poll is now a major bellwether of critical opinion on cinema and this year’s edition (its eighth) is the largest ever, with 1,639 participating critics, programmers, curators, archivists and academics each submitting their top ten ballot. What has risen up the ranks? What has fallen? Has 2012’s winner Vertigo held on to its title?

With creature effects by the Oscar-winning creator of E.T, Carlos Rambaldi, Possession is filmmaking at its most frenzied, fraught and furious.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Andrzej Zulawski","producer":"Marie-Laure Reyre","writer":"Andrzej Zulawski","featuring":"Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Margit Carstensen"},"year":"1981","nameAndYear":"Possession (1981)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"France, Federal Republic of Germany","runningTime":127,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":243,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"ecba7a8f-50cd-5f8f-a071-a4bdda4519c3","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg/1920x1080-cropped/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg/960x540-cropped/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-12/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg/96x54-cropped/soleil-o-1967-puppeteers-beneath-africa-mural.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"Soleil Ô","url":"/film/ecba7a8f-50cd-5f8f-a071-a4bdda4519c3/soleil-o","summary":{"text":"A vibrant humanist statement on racism and immigration that remains pertinent today.","html":"<p>A vibrant humanist statement on racism and immigration that remains pertinent today.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Med Hondo","producer":"","writer":"","featuring":"Robert Liensol, Théo Legitimus, Yane Barry"},"year":"1970","nameAndYear":"Soleil Ô (1970)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":0,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":243,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"930b2196-1cac-5219-932f-353eff1c2cda","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg/960x540-cropped/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-12/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg/96x54-cropped/distant-voices-still-lives-1988-people-waving.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Distant Voices, Still Lives","url":"/film/930b2196-1cac-5219-932f-353eff1c2cda/distant-voices-still-lives","summary":{"text":"Post-war working-class Liverpool life is impressionistically evoked in Terence Davies’ two-part film, by turns lyrical, humorous and horrific.","html":"<p>Post-war working-class Liverpool life is impressionistically evoked in Terence Davies’ two-part film, by turns lyrical, humorous and horrific.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Set in a world before Elvis, a Liverpool before the Beatles, Terence Davies' debut feature is a remarkable evocation of working-class family life in the 40s and 50s and a visionary exploration of memory. These companion pieces, shot two years apart on tight budgets with BFI support, evoke his upbringing in Liverpool after the war in a working-class home dominated by the violence of his father, fearsomely played by then newcomer Pete Postlethwaite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davies achieves the rare feat of nostalgia without sentimentality, using dynamic lighting, a superb soundtrack and a fragmented structure to construct a distinctive drama suffused with both beauty and horror. From the home to the pub, the cinema to the beach, each locale suggests both charm and stifling limitation in a film that’s as concerned with the operation of memory as with its material

Griffith’s 1915 The Birth of a Nation was a milestone in narrative filmmaking and a popular sensation, but a film condemned for its sympathetic depiction of the Ku Klux Klan. In answer, Griffith conceived this study of intolerance throughout human history, interspersing a Babylonian story, the Christ story, the events of the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 16th-century France, and a modern American story in which moral puritanism leads to a disenfranchised man being mistakenly condemned to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film cuts between these stories with increasing rapidity as it builds to its exciting quadruple climax, though the complexity of this structure proved too enervating for contemporary audiences and the film was a commercial disaster.

back to his days as a dashing young officer in 1890s Vienna. What follows is a wondrously rich, witty, sympathetic yet surprisingly critical portrait of a man and the subtle changes in his personality and values that occur with the passing of time; crucially, his fateful encounters with Edith Hunter and Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff teach him that little is fair in love and war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Winston Churchill was famously tempted to suppress the film, it’s now acknowledged as a humanist testament and one of the finest British movies ever made, as deep, dark, delicately nuanced and quietly devastating as an Elgar symphony.

returned with an enigmatic film puzzle that has had critics and audiences arguing over its meaning (or lack of) ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing his affiliation with experimental Nouveau Roman writers, Marienbad is based on a screenplay by Alain Robbe-Grillet about a man, ‘X’, who meets a woman, ‘A’, at a gathering at a grand chateau and attempts to convince her that they met the previous year, probably at Marienbad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Featuring stately, gliding camera movements about the house and grounds, and a disconcerting fracturing of time which seems to collapse past and present,

Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1994, Pulp Fiction holds up as one of the most riotously entertaining nineties pictures, strewn with endlessly quotable dialogue and an array of career-defining performances from its ensemble cast, with Samuel L Jackson stealing the show as Biblical badass Jules Winnfield.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Quentin Tarantino","producer":"Lawrence Bender","writer":"Quentin Tarantino","featuring":"John Travolta, Samuel L.

Its original Thai title, Sud Pralad, in fact means something like ‘strange beast’. This is perhaps a more apt characterisation of a film that compels through fierce natural strangeness rather than intimations of illness per se. More is going on here in terms of story, sense perception, sexuality, identity and spirituality than is easily accessible to mainstream sensibilities. But if that speaks to malady, it seems less a matter of infection or disease than the disordered expectation that the world will constrain itself to conventionally limited and contingent ways of thinking, feeling and understanding. Strange beasts are best met on their own ground, on their own terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film is a diptych of sorts. The first part introduces us to soldier Keng (Banlop Lomnoi), part of a group assigned to a rural area where unsettling killings of animals have been noted, perhaps the work of an unquiet spirit – the strange beast. There, Keng meets Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee), a placid-seeming young man with whom he strikes up a flirtatious rapport. They spend time together in town and country, at the movies, taking a dog to the vet, exploring nearby shrines. In the second part, Keng is in the forest, alone, tracking and being tracked by the strange spirit, who seems to be at once Tong and a tiger. There are stalkings, struggles and submissions, encounters with ghost cows and clever monkeys. In both parts, transportive sound design and locked-off compositions frame interpersonal dynamics&nbsp;that tilt in unexpected ways. Queerness here is not only a matter of same-sex desire but of radical uncertainty, shifts between persons and worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a work that defies straightforward understanding and suggests that understandability may be overrated. (Benedict Anderson has argued that aspects of narrative, setting and character unfamiliar to the film’s cosmopolitan audiences are quite accessible to viewers from the region where the film was shot – yet even they were perplexed by other elements.) Apichatpong’s earlier features had won festival recognition but this was a breakthrough. In the years since, its calm indifference to staid forms of logic, hierarchy and desire have helped affirm it as a marvel of imaginative engagement with posthuman possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ben Walters</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","producer":"Charles de Meaux","writer":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","featuring":"Banlop Lomnoi, Sakda Kaewbuadee, Sirivech Jareonchon"},"year":"2004","nameAndYear":"Tropical Malady (2004)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"France, Thailand, Germany, Italy, Switzerland","runningTime":119,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5060114150270","name":"Tropical Malady (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/tropical-malady.html","price":"14.99"}]}},{"rank":95,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"81a56239-4e69-56b1-b2f0-128204576ae9","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/get-out-2017-daniel-kaluuya-tears.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/get-out-2017-daniel-kaluuya-tears.jpeg/1920x1080-cropped/get-out-2017-daniel-kaluuya-tears.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/get-out-2017-daniel-kaluuya-tears.jpeg/960x540-cropped/get-out-2017-daniel-kaluuya-tears.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/get-out-2017-daniel-kaluuya-tears.jpeg/96x54-cropped/get-out-2017-daniel-kaluuya-tears.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"Get Out","url":"/film/81a56239-4e69-56b1-b2f0-128204576ae9/get-out","summary":{"text":"A poster film for Black Lives Matter, Jordan Peele’s horror-satire of white vampirism gleefully needles America’s racial malaise.","html":"<p>A poster film for Black Lives Matter, Jordan Peele’s horror-satire of white vampirism gleefully needles America’s racial malaise.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>“Turning the creeping hypocrisy of modern racism into the scenario of a horror classic was a genius move by Jordan Peele.

Modern Times marked Chaplin’s first use of dialogue on screen, albeit in Chaplin’s typically adventurous, unconventional way: when the audience finally hears the Tramp’s voice, he’s singing gibberish as the character improvises the lyrics to a song. While the Tramp rotates between prison and employment and life seems a constant struggle, Modern Times remains stubbornly hopeful and hilarious.“ <strong>David West</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For releasing the human body into such kinetic chaos and comic élan, defying so many forces that would browbeat our bodies, our dreams, our movies into conformity.“ <strong>Nick Davis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The 20th century in 87 minutes.“ <strong>Paolo Mereghetti</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Charles Chaplin","producer":"Charles Chaplin","writer":"Charles Chaplin","featuring":"Charles Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman"},"year":"1936","nameAndYear":"Modern Times (1936)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":87,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5050629002737","name":"Modern Times (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/modern-times-blu-ray.html","price":"27.99"}]}},{"rank":78,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"f43ad3dd-1b5b-5f19-aa10-5f29d8f33da2","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2020-09/sunset-boulevard-1950-gloria-swanson-holding-hand-to-projector-light.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2020-09/sunset-boulevard-1950-gloria-swanson-holding-hand-to-projector-light.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/sunset-boulevard-1950-gloria-swanson-holding-hand-to-projector-light.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2020-09/sunset-boulevard-1950-gloria-swanson-holding-hand-to-projector-light.jpg/960x540-cropped/sunset-boulevard-1950-gloria-swanson-holding-hand-to-projector-light.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2020-09/sunset-boulevard-1950-gloria-swanson-holding-hand-to-projector-light.jpg/96x54-cropped/sunset-boulevard-1950-gloria-swanson-holding-hand-to-projector-light.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Sunset Blvd.","url":"/film/f43ad3dd-1b5b-5f19-aa10-5f29d8f33da2/sunset-blvd","summary":{"text":"Tinseltown’s greatest self-satire, a gothic requiem for big-screen bygones and the highs of screen stardom.","html":"<p>Tinseltown’s greatest self-satire, a gothic requiem for big-screen bygones and the highs of screen stardom.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Narrated in flashback by the corpse of luckless screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) floating facedown in a Los Angeles swimming pool, Wilder’s audaciously dark examination of the Hollywood dream factory cruelly casts faded silent-movie star Gloria Swanson as has-been silent star Norma Desmond.

Like Alfred Hitchcock in the same year’s Psycho, Michelangelo Antonioni upturned expectation by getting rid of his film’s ostensible protagonist early on. Unlike Hitchcock, however, Antonioni provided no explanation for this sudden disappearance of his female star, hinting only at the alienation and ennui that the film depicts as a characteristic of contemporary bourgeois society as a potential cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No less radical than this modernistic ambiguity was the Italian master’s controlled use of camera movement and visual composition to dramatise the emotional space between people. The film made a star of Monica Vitti, who plays Claudia, the missing woman’s friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Michelangelo Antonioni’s masterpiece changed the course of Italian neorealism and arthouse cinema. It injected a healthy dose of entropy into conventions of European cinema, where plot and story lost their preeminence, replaced by the potential of a searching, introverted, filmic gaze.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I first saw L’avventura, at film university, it made me contemplate the idea that a filmmaker could be deliberately obtuse, vague, mystifying, and that it could work so entirely in creating a mood of alienation. Moving on to La notte (1961), Blow-Up (1966) and The Passenger (1975), this was an artist who epitomised the auteurist possibility of a singular cinematic vision structured across an entire body of work. I later saw a documentary on Antonioni in which he described himself as the proponent of the “cinema of miscommunication” – a statement as insightful as it was self-aware. Ironically, his central insight is the modernist breakdown of coherence and unity, in cinema and life. Also, Monica Vitti.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Michelangelo Antonioni","producer":"Amato Pennasilico","writer":"Michelangelo Antonioni, Elio Bartolini, Tonino Guerra","featuring":"Gabriele Ferzetti, Monica Vitti, Lea Massari"},"year":"1960","nameAndYear":"L'avventura (1960)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"Italy, France","runningTime":144,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":72,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"e494631b-84a3-5fdb-96c2-7cb1b1f7c29d","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/journey-to-italy-1954-george-sanders-facing-ingrid-bergman-in-crowd.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/journey-to-italy-1954-george-sanders-facing-ingrid-bergman-in-crowd.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/journey-to-italy-1954-george-sanders-facing-ingrid-bergman-in-crowd.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/journey-to-italy-1954-george-sanders-facing-ingrid-bergman-in-crowd.jpg/960x540-cropped/journey-to-italy-1954-george-sanders-facing-ingrid-bergman-in-crowd.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/journey-to-italy-1954-george-sanders-facing-ingrid-bergman-in-crowd.jpg/96x54-cropped/journey-to-italy-1954-george-sanders-facing-ingrid-bergman-in-crowd.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Journey to Italy","url":"/film/e494631b-84a3-5fdb-96c2-7cb1b1f7c29d/journey-to-italy","summary":{"text":"Roberto Rossellini’s plaintively simple portrait of a marriage on the rocks, imprinted with the ghosts of love, cultures and civilisations.","html":"<p>Roberto Rossellini’s plaintively simple portrait of a marriage on the rocks, imprinted with the ghosts of love, cultures and civilisations.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>With a cycle of projects starring his wife Ingrid Bergman, Roberto Rossellini began to lose some of the critics whose attention he had grabbed with Rome: Open City (1945).

(His Oscar-winner Spirited Away, nearby in this poll, spills forth a phantasmic bathhouse of troubled ghouls.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Neighbour Totoro is his less-is-more work: a pastoral, pantheist chamber drama, where the ‘chamber’ lies under the canopy of a great camphor tree that lords over the woods behind a tumbledown farmhouse. Into this adventure realm move two sisters, pre-school Mei and preteen Satsuke, with their inattentive dad, to be nearer their hospitalised mum. Each in&nbsp;turn encounters the spirit of the woods: a giant, furry, ovoid mammal with mighty powers of flying, horticulture and slumber. (He comes with two smaller surrogates, who may or may not indicate a further world of totori.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The storytelling is as simple as Totoro is inscrutable, unfolding in a series of delightful, exquisitely constructed sequences: Satsuke and Mei discovering the farmhouse and its soot-sprite occupants; Mei tracking Totoro’s minions to his lair; the tired children, waiting in the rain for their dad at a bus stop, finding Totoro waiting too – for a twinkle-eyed cat bus; a village-wide hunt for Mei after a misunderstood message from hospital leads her to run away. My favourite is the nocturne in which the girls and Totoros conjure shoots from acorns with an incantatory dance, then soar triumphant through the trees on a spinning top.&nbsp;There’s no plot, just rousing impressions of innocence and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many films ask us to see the adult world through children’s eyes; My Neighbour Totoro summons wilder, wide-eyed wonder at the forces that inform us: life, nature, connection, change. And, of course, it hymns the uplift of imagination, with Joe Hisaishi’s entrancing synth tunes essential to the magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film got two votes in Sight and Sound’s 2002 poll, 11 in 2012. A swift hit in Japan, it has spread its spell steadily across the world ever since; a third of a century after its release, many younger critics have grown up with it. It’s clearly an antidote to urbanisation and technology, and a rebuke to a world of environmental breakdown. It’s also a comfort and a reassurance that shows we still have artists who can create something timeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nick Bradshaw</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Hayao Miyazaki","producer":"Toru Hara","writer":"Hayao Miyazaki","featuring":"Lisa Michaelson, Cheryl Chase, Gregory Snegoff"},"year":"1988","nameAndYear":"My Neighbour Totoro (1988)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"Japan","runningTime":87,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":67,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"3b330bf5-17bf-5fb6-8377-ccf367e58c15","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2023-09/the-red-shoes-1948-moira-shearer-in-distress-close-up.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2023-09/the-red-shoes-1948-moira-shearer-in-distress-close-up.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/the-red-shoes-1948-moira-shearer-in-distress-close-up.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2023-09/the-red-shoes-1948-moira-shearer-in-distress-close-up.jpg/960x540-cropped/the-red-shoes-1948-moira-shearer-in-distress-close-up.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2023-09/the-red-shoes-1948-moira-shearer-in-distress-close-up.jpg/96x54-cropped/the-red-shoes-1948-moira-shearer-in-distress-close-up.jpg","altText":null},"name":"The Red Shoes","url":"/film/3b330bf5-17bf-5fb6-8377-ccf367e58c15/the-red-shoes","summary":{"text":"The feverish Technicolor and astonishing ballet sequences for which this film is so renowned are as spellbinding as they are disturbing.","html":"<p>The feverish Technicolor and astonishing ballet sequences for which this film is so renowned are as spellbinding as they are disturbing.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>In Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s visually ravishing masterpiece, a young ballerina is torn between the demands of love and art.

Fittingly, it won Oscars for both art direction and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s hard to think of many films that match The Red Shoes for ferocity and passion, since in every costume, set, and streak of grease paint there is desire. Moira Shearer’s performance as an ambitious ballerina is a tour de force. Jack Cardiff ’s moody colour work takes on a life of its own on screen.

Black women, in whose image the 1991 feature was directly created, saw then what is now widely understood: Dash’s visionary visual marriage between Afrocentric aesthetics and the rich emotional depth of Black womanhood is a cinematic triumph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daughters rapidly engulfs you with the lush, matriarchal world of the Peazant family, residing in South Carolina’s Sea Islands at the turn of the 20th century. The fundamental crisis takes shape as the women-centred family is split between migrating north or staying in the South Carolina Lowcountry. Dash’s multilayered narrative unfolds by allowing the youngest member of the clan, an unborn child, and the eldest members, the ancestors, to weigh in, in an energetic display of shared narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a union of African diasporic storytelling techniques, visually arresting imagery (assisted by cinematographer and co-producer Arthur Jafa) and dynamic character scope, Daughters offers a deep reading of how ancestry and the depth of Black souls are fractured between a longing for modernity and tending to their roots. As the women try to work towards a collective solution and honour their individual paths,&nbsp;Dash invites us through their interiority. By doing so, we are granted access to the cinematic language of Black women defining themselves for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film, which recently celebrated its 30th anniversary, remains an enduring symphony that sings, reframes and reignites a Black girl’s song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By refusing a Eurocentric understanding of African-American identity, Dash’s seminal work challenges us all to believe in cinema’s creation – and viewing – as an act of communal healing.

Leaving behind his small-scale, realism-rooted dramas of the 50s, this episodic story of a tabloid reporter’s comings and goings within the decadent upper reaches of modern Italian society found Fellini moving in a flamboyant new direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film’s atmosphere of moral lassitude, together with its then scandalous sexual frankness, created a popular sensation, introducing the world to the word paparazzi. Together with Antonioni’s L’avventura (1960), its modernity of form and subject matter ushered Italian arthouse cinema into the 1960s. The image of Anita Ekberg cavorting in the Trevi fountain is one of the era’s most iconic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Socially and historically a landmark film, sensing, influencing and ambivalently critiquing the role of media, gossip, hedonism and celebrity in modern culture – but all done with brio, scale and complexity achieved with an astonishing lightness of touch, utterly confident in itself as cinema.” <strong>Richard Dyer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sprawling, infuriating, profoundly inventive – a film world populated by beautiful and sinister creatures that never ceases to surprise.” <strong>Belén Vidal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“An acrid romp through a demi-monde choking to death on its own ennui-fuelled excess. We’re all still being deadened by the same cultural hollowness depicted here, just without any of the glamour, our present as garish and frightful as that fish on the beach.

While there is endless debate as to which is the funniest of Buster Keaton’s 1920s features, there’s little doubt as to which is the cleverest. Anticipating Jean-Luc Godard and postmodernism by decades, the detective fantasy Sherlock Jr. largely takes place inside the head of a hapless and wronged cinema projectionist (Keaton) who – in a sequence that’s a technical marvel to this day – dreams himself into the screen only to be flummoxed by the film’s editing. But that’s merely one relatively early set-piece out of dozens, including a stunt so dangerous that it broke Keaton’s neck – something he wouldn’t discover until a routine medical examination over a decade later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Always a fan of film technology, Keaton here pushes film special effects to their then limits, though some of the most effective moments make use of old-fashioned vaudeville stage mechanics – such as the moment when he leaps “through” his disguised assistant to evade pursuers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A clockwork machine of craftmanship, Sherlock Jr. is Keaton at his best. Precise gag construction, lots of laughs and a personal point of view make this film not only one of the best comedies of all time, but also an early reflection on the role of cinema and storytelling in our personal lives.” <strong>Paula Feliz-Didier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Few captured the majesty of our cinema dream-life as well as Buster Keaton. Here, the movie is the movie is the movie. That each of us could enter and indulge in a redemptive dream life was the tacit promise of the medium and Buster made good on that promise with pathetic nobility.” <strong>Steve Seid</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Buster Keaton","producer":"Joseph M.

With typical perversity, Godard compromised by adding an explicit scene of Camille (Bardot) naked on a bed as screenwriter-husband Paul (Michel Piccoli) lists her attractive features. The anecdote is appropriate for a film that features an American film producer (Jack Palance) exerting his crass influence over the Grecian epic being made by German genius Fritz Lang (playing himself).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While filled with playful cinematic references, Le Mépris is perhaps Godard’s most emotionally direct film, particularly intense in the long central apartment scene – masterfully shot by Raoul Coutard – in which the fractures in Paul and Camille’s marriage come to seem irreversible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Godard’s finest film is a deeply cynical study of the loss of artistic integrity and the loss of respect that comes from it, a warning to every artist who chooses to sell out for financial gain.” <strong>David Flint</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The ideal balance between a Godard work’s self-reflexivity and its penchant for the elegiac and transcendent.

Three years after the deep-space horror of Alien (1979), Ridley Scott imagined an urban future to rival Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. The ghost of Raymond Chandler’s bygone LA haunts its story of a Marlowe-like former detective (Harrison Ford) assigned to track down escaped ‘replicants’ – biologically engineered beings employed as slaves by their human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially a critical and commercial flop, Blade Runner developed a huge cult following. Countless science-fiction blockbusters have tried to replicate it, but Scott’s original retains an unrepeatable intrigue in the central ambiguity of Deckard’s own identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Science-fiction cinema is transformed forever in the furnace of production design.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Blade Runner distils the iconographies of dystopian science-fiction and transmogrifies them to produce the blueprint for seemingly every example of the genre to follow. As we have moved into the digital age and passed 2019, the year the film is set, Blade Runner’s analogue materiality now looks thoroughly retro-dystopian. But our deepest anxieties about the integrity of the self, our technology-constituted experience, environmental apocalypse and a polarised society in extremis have never felt more relevant.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lawrence G.

The titular musical instrument is both bargaining tool and an outlet for private passions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So hard to choose just one Jane Campion film, but The Piano still resonates for me and hits the sweet spot thanks to an unbeatable combination of talents, from Campion herself and the stars to Michael Nyman’s transcendent compositions.” <strong>Leslie Felperin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Piano is a film about passion and love for life, for music, for the essence. It is about the clash between form and content, love and possession, illusion and triviality. It is about uncompromising will and the choice to live one’s own way, at any cost.” <strong>Suncica Unevska</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The image of Ada (Holly Hunter) on the beach, a black umbrella in her hand, her daughter on her lap, her piano on the sand, is unforgettable. Every shot in this film evokes painting. Every image is a shock. We go through all the emotions: it is a tortured film, a tale about emancipation, passion, fantasies.” <strong>Ava Cahen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A complex masterpiece full of cinematic language that reflects how women’s rights in the world can be applied to contemporary society.” <strong>Anchalee Chaiworaporn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jane Campion is arguably one of the few directors who has managed to engender a new humanist vision for cinema at the point of modernity’s decline. Her Piano is a vaccine that has helped cinema’s relevance survive well into the 21st century.” <strong>Vigen Galstyan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the most visceral film experiences I had as an 11-year-old moviegoer and the impression has stayed intact. Hunter’s performance and Stuart Dryburgh’s cinematography are something from another world.” <strong>Bruno Oseguera Pizaña</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Piano is a film that springs to mind every time I find myself on a rainy beach or with a hole in my tights. Two hours of perfect, voluptuous repression and desire.” <strong>Nazmia Jamal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oceanic cinema at its most all-consuming: a singular, senses-stunning wave of eroticism entwined with tragedy, played out on a canvas that demands the biggest screen while piercing the heart with tiny details. You feel something new with each viewing. Campion is also a pioneer in the field of showcasing male nudity in mainstream film, redressing a sexist imbalance that has diminished the artform for decades (and continues to do so).

With Gertrud, it represents the apotheosis of his controlled visual style, consisting of long, uninterrupted takes, with one shot often sufficing for an entire sequence. The 124-minute running time contains only 114 shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film focuses on a devout parson and his three sons, the eldest of whom, Mikkel (Emil Hass Christensen), has rejected God altogether, while his sibling Johannes (Preben Lerdorff Rye) has had a breakdown and thinks himself to be Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on a 1932 play by Kaj Munk, the material is transformed by Dreyer into uniquely slow, hypnotic cinema that examines the nature of believing. The ending ranks among the medium’s most beautiful and mysterious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This film is the high watermark of spiritual or transcendental cinema. Strangely atmospheric and exceptionally intense, Ordet ’s discomforting meditation on the nature of real faith is served by Dreyer’s masterful handling of camerawork, staging, physical detail and sound, and builds to a climax that is arguably the most astonishing and moving in all cinema.” <strong>Jonathan Owen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s hard to think of another film that more exquisitely captures the perpetual heartbreak of being among other people, the distances of understanding that linger in the spaces between figures in a single shot.

The operative word however, is widely: it got great reviews from its moment of premiere in 1978. So why the recognition gap? In some ways it’s a story that parallels the film itself: it simply lacked the cultural benefits of more privileged contemporary productions.  Killer of Sheep was made on shoestring while writer/director Charles Burnett was still a student at UCLA, studying under luminaries including Basil Wright and Elyseo Taylor. Despite the looming presence of Hollywood, Burnett found inspiration in the Italian Neorealist films he saw in class, and defying expectations, adapted the department’s resources to tell tales of a previously undocumented America: everyday lives amongst the black community he knew in East Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just as the film’s subjects were in a sense ghetto-ized, so was the film. Without funds available music rights couldn’t be cleared, and the film spent several decades as highly lauded marginalia. I first saw it in a poor-quality 16mm print in the mid 1980’s: the only way it could be seen at the time. The picture was soft and the dialogue muffled, leaving me with the memory of a feeling as much as anything else. It wasn’t till I was fortunate to restore the film for the UCLA Film & Television Archive in the early 2000’s – when improved laboratory techniques allowing Burnett’s brilliant photography and dialogue to emerge – that I realized its true genius. The visionary team at Milestone Films concurred, going through Herculean battles to clear the music rights, and launched its first international 35mm release in 2007, a full thirty years after its completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly wide audiences throughout the world were seeing scenes that have since been etched forever in our collective memory: young children filmed from below as the leap across the gap between tenement rooftops; a hard-won car engine teetering precariously on the edge of a departing truck, the sad lonely dance of slaughterhouse worker Henry Sanders and his wife, Kaycee Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon the restoration’s premiere, I was occasionally fortunate to present the film with Charles in attendance, and would introduce him not as one of America’s “great black directors” but rather as one of the “great American directors.”  It’s true he’s spent a career championing black lives in his storytelling, but I always felt the former term was not enough, and implied a privileging the work decried. Now I think it’s probably time to omit the true but limiting  American descriptor as well: he’s simply one of “the world’s great directors.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ross Lipman</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Charles Burnett","producer":"Charles Burnett","writer":"Charles Burnett","featuring":"Henry G.

In this case, the mystery relates to the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife in 11th century Japan, events which are relayed in wildly differing versions by those present: the bandit, the treacherous wife, a passing woodcutter and the spirit of the dead samurai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This radically non-linear structure, with its profound implications about the fallibility of perspective, impressed judges at the 1951 Venice Film Festival. They awarded Akira Kurosawa’s film the Golden Lion, helping to encourage a broader interest in Japanese film in the west. With its snaking bolero-like score and poetic use of dappled forest light, Rashomon is a work of enduring ambiguity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What is the truth – the perceived, or the real? What is justice?

Like the wartime trilogy that Roberto Rossellini began with Rome: Open City (1945), it heralded a new kind of cinematic naturalism, employing non-professionals as actors and taking the camera out onto the streets to faithfully record the social realities of a Europe struggling to get back on its feet after WWII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapted from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, the quiet tragedy of a father’s desperate hunt for a stolen bicycle that he depends on for his work has a fable-like simplicity.

The closing shot, after it dawns on the girl who her sponsor really was, counts among the cinema’s most moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The balance between humour and drama that’s so effective in [Charlie] Chaplin’s work has its roots not just in his undoubted talent but in the real sympathy he felt for characters on the fringes of society.

Encouraged by Jean Renoir, whom he assisted during the filming of The River (1951), Ray set to work on an adaptation of a 1929 novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay about a young boy growing up in an impoverished rural community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distinct from the more commercial Hindi films of the time, Pather Panchali announced the arrival of a humanistic, Calcutta-centred Indian art cinema, ultimately paving the way for the emergence of the Parallel Cinema movement of the 1960s. Among the film’s intensely memorable moments is a scene in which Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his sister run through a paddy field to catch a glimpse of a passing train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Here is a cinema of awakenings.” <strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A tour de force of humanist cinema, looking at a rural family which faces tragedies as well as stolen moments of happiness and togetherness. The influence of Jean Renoir, coupled with a fierce originality in its black-and-white visuals, still mark it out as the best Indian film ever made – and all achieved at a negligible budget.” <strong>Khalid Mohamed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ray’s classic was hailed internationally as a realist masterpiece but dismissed in India by some eminent citizens (who should have known better) as a film that did nothing but highlight Indian poverty for Western eyes.

After the popular and critical success of his state-of-the-nation paparazzi drama La dolce vita (1960), Federico Fellini found himself at an artistic impasse. The fog lifted when he turned to his own situation for inspiration, casting Marcello Mastroianni as his alter ego, famous Italian director Guido Anselmi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking its title from the number of films Fellini had completed up to this point (including some short segments for anthology films), 8½ features Guido being besieged by sycophants and collaborators as he struggles to get started on an unwieldy science-fiction epic. Frequently digressing into surreal and erotic dream sequences, Fellini’s self-reflexive movie about movie-making climaxes with an exuberant parade in which Guido directs the colourful cast of characters who have played supporting roles in his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“8½ is a synthesis of modern cinema in terms of narrative invention and reflexivity. The filmmaker’s crisis allows for a glimpse of the doubts, weaknesses and ghosts involved in the creative process, calling into question the idea of an omniscient author secure in their métier. Fellini also develops a penetrating study of the artist’s psychology, projecting it on to his alter ego, played by Marcello Mastroianni. The film condenses several elements typical of the Fellinian universe, such as mass communication, the circus, the game of affections and the artificial world provided by art.” <strong>Carlos Alberto Mattos</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The best film about filmmaking ever made.” <strong>Bina Paul Venugopal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The character of Guido Anselmi (Mastroianni) is the perfect incarnation of the artist devoured by his demons, alone and helpless in front of his artwork.” <strong>Mustapha Benfodil</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Federico Fellini","producer":"Angelo Rizzoli","writer":"Federico Fellini, Tullio Pinelli, Ennio Flaiano, Brunello Rondi","featuring":"Marcello Mastroianni, Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimée"},"year":"1963","nameAndYear":"8½ (1963)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-8-12-1963-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-8-12-1963-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/87","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"Italy, France","runningTime":138,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5060485803126","name":"Fellini's 8 ½ (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/fellini-s-8-and-a-half-blu-ray.html","price":"10.99"}]}},{"rank":31,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"18313136-53d5-53d4-a89b-1d19d24a30f2","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-02/psycho-1960-peeping-eye.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-02/psycho-1960-peeping-eye.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/psycho-1960-peeping-eye.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-02/psycho-1960-peeping-eye.jpg/960x540-cropped/psycho-1960-peeping-eye.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-02/psycho-1960-peeping-eye.jpg/96x54-cropped/psycho-1960-peeping-eye.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Psycho","url":"/film/18313136-53d5-53d4-a89b-1d19d24a30f2/psycho","summary":{"text":"Alfred Hitchcock’s unsparing wrong-motel shocker starring Janet Leigh is a watershed for mainstream horror and still seminal in its suspense games.","html":"<p>Alfred Hitchcock’s unsparing wrong-motel shocker starring Janet Leigh is a watershed for mainstream horror and still seminal in its suspense games.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>When Marion Crane steals some money from her workplace and takes flight for California, she little realises the consequences of checking into the Bates Motel...

Her first three films, Water Lilies (2007), Tomboy (2011) and Girlhood (2014), did much to redefine coming-of-age narratives, opening new horizons on youth and queer desire while manifesting a coherent stylistic vision, characterised notably by pareddown visuals. As a result, Sciamma, an alumna of the prestigious Paris film school La Fémis, swiftly rose to the pantheon of French auteur cinema (she scripts all her films). Unusually in the French context, she adroitly coordinated this cinephile pedigree with her lesbian identity and strongly articulated political – including feminist – positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portrait of a Lady on Fire brought Sciamma’s work and status to another level. Her first costume film, set on a remote Breton island in the late 18th century, charts in a series of exquisite tableaux the intense passion between two women, a painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), and her model Héloïse (Adèle Haenel). Héloïse is to be married against her will to a rich man on the strength of the portrait. After initial resistance on both women’s parts, the painting becomes the conductor for their love for each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Portrait, Sciamma fights patriarchal oppression first of all by creating a utopian, if temporary, all-women’s world. More fundamentally, the relationship between the two women develops as one of reciprocity and equality. The film thus rejects a hierarchical vision of desire and in the process updates the relationship between artist and model and the fetishised figure of the ‘muse’. Portrait’s egalitarian ethos evidently echoes Sciamma’s own commitment – among other things she is deeply involved in the Collectif 50/50, which fights for gender equality in the French film industry. But the film resonated with the ambient culture in other ways. When it came out in France in the autumn of 2019, Portrait appeared as the perfect illustration of the female gaze, a concept newly ‘discovered’ in a country that was still coming to terms, only slowly, with the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, about which both Sciamma and Haenel (formerly a couple) spoke out in various contexts. Portrait of a Lady on Fire demonstrates Sciamma’s ability to make a timelessly beautiful film that also crystallises the gender politics of her era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ginette Vincendeau</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Céline Sciamma","producer":"Bénédicte Couvreur","writer":"Céline Sciamma","featuring":"Merlant, Noémie, Adèle Haenel, Bajrami, Luana"},"year":"2019","nameAndYear":"Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-2019-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-2019-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/15801","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":122,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5021866889306","name":"Portrait of a Lady On Fire (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-dvd.html","price":"8.99"}]}},{"rank":29,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"d964bfb7-729b-5181-85f8-35b1bd3a21a3","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg/960x540-cropped/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2023-01/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg/96x54-cropped/taxi-driver-1976-yellow-taxi-neon-lights.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Taxi Driver","url":"/film/d964bfb7-729b-5181-85f8-35b1bd3a21a3/taxi-driver","summary":{"text":"Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader’s high-art vigilante movie for fallen times, with a coiled Robert De Niro as psycho-saviour of an infernal NYC.","html":"<p>Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader’s high-art vigilante movie for fallen times, with a coiled Robert De Niro as psycho-saviour of an infernal NYC.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Screenwriter Paul Schrader drew on the mythology of 1940s film noir thrillers for this story of Vietnam vet Travis Bickle’s increasingly psychotic disgust at the nocturnal New York street life he observes from his taxi.

An adaptation of Davis Grubb’s novel, the film is refined to a lucid allegory. Evil, in the form of fake preacher Robert Mitchum, is visited upon a woman and two innocent children until they’re rescued by Good, in the form of frail Lillian Gish. In its intensely visual treatment of the story it harks back to the great silent films, thanks to former Orson Welles collaborator Stanley Cortez’s marvellously expressive black-and-white cinematography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the former criminal convinced that his executed cellmate’s loot is in the possession of his widow (Shelley Winters) – whom he marries purely in order to get his hands on it – Mitchum was never better: charismatic and charming, vicious and violent, his symbolic ‘duel’ between two sets of tattooed knuckles (‘LOVE’ and ‘HATE’) provided American cinema with one of its indelible images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A mystical slice of Americana noir, this fable about the innate unreliability of adults and the tragic spectrum of human nature sticks in the memory like a stone in the craw. ‘It’s a hard world for the little things.’” <strong>Gemma Files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Night of the Hunter knows just how unsettling the perversion of innocence can be, building on this premise to create a poisoned fairytale. With his only film, Laughton set out to film fear, and he succeeded.” <strong>Pedro Adrián Zuluaga</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Robert Mitchum was the master of the languid gaze, a couldn’tcare- less attitude that, in Laughton’s hands, made the allure of evil totally understandable. Shelley Winters’ Willa might have been a foolish woman for falling under the spell of the preacher with ‘love’ and ‘hate’ tattooed on his knuckles, but he offered her something otherwise unimaginable in her small Depression-era West Virginian town. Laughton’s masterpiece was immediately dismissed by audience and critics alike: its visual compositions led it to be suspected of artistry, while its refusal to conform to genre was box-office death. The dreamlike sequences of the children’s escape down the river viewed through an enormous spider’s web contrasted with the angular shadows of the light falling into their room, and all pathways lead to Lillian Gish’s final appearance, cradling a gun on the veranda as she waits, singing hymns, for Mitchum to come for his prey.” <strong>Ruth Barton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Laughton’s career-length frustrations at cinema’s expressive limitations are here redeemed. A journey through the heart of darkness, in which heart and dark have equal weight – just as in Laughton’s acting.” <strong>James Swanton</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Charles Laughton","producer":"Paul Gregory","writer":"James Agee","featuring":"Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish"},"year":"1955","nameAndYear":"The Night of the Hunter (1955)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":92,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":25,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"3fc31e95-d0aa-5a28-a8d4-4d3c8a3d50a9","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-03/au-hasard-balthazar-1966-girl-donkey.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-03/au-hasard-balthazar-1966-girl-donkey.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/au-hasard-balthazar-1966-girl-donkey.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-03/au-hasard-balthazar-1966-girl-donkey.jpg/960x540-cropped/au-hasard-balthazar-1966-girl-donkey.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-03/au-hasard-balthazar-1966-girl-donkey.jpg/96x54-cropped/au-hasard-balthazar-1966-girl-donkey.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Au hasard Balthazar","url":"/film/3fc31e95-d0aa-5a28-a8d4-4d3c8a3d50a9/au-hasard-balthazar","summary":{"text":"Robert Bresson gave us a typically stark vision of humanity as experienced by a put-upon, maltreated beast of burden that passes from owner to owner.","html":"<p>Robert Bresson gave us a typically stark vision of humanity as experienced by a put-upon, maltreated beast of burden that passes from owner to owner.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Animal protagonists are traditionally the preserve of sentimental stories for children, but while Robert Bresson’s tragic masterpiece about the travails of a donkey has the simple force of a fable, it presents a brutally pessimistic vision. Punished, maltreated, used, loved, Balthazar is put to work by one keeper after another, bearing silent witness to the folly and petty cruelties of his human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bresson was a Catholic filmmaker, and his story has been interpreted as a Christian allegory by some critics. The director’s austerely concentrated shots, restricted to details of scenes in order to elucidate the whole, and his controlled use of sound to imply off-screen activity, make for a uniquely dense, richly textured film. Jean-Luc Godard was to suggest that Balthazar contained “the world in an hour and a half”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bresson’s minimalist masterpiece brings to life with unequalled power the story of an abused donkey whose depth of suffering illuminates the cruelty of the human world towards other species and humanity’s unexamined belief in its own superiority.” <strong>Barbara Creed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The reverse of Disneyfication: a parable of animal sacrifice and the price of human foibles.” <strong>Barrett Hodsdon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Robert Bresson drafted the rules of a new cinema and realised them in Au hasard Balthazar, his masterpiece. This seemingly aloof, cold film, inspired by a passage in Dostoevsky’s 1868 novel The Idiot, burns with a yearning for justice and beauty. Bresson’s disciplined portraiture of a donkey and the way of life in the French countryside is a lesson in seeing the world anew through the cinema and noticing the potential that endeavour contains.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Few have changed the face of cinema like Bresson, proposing a wholly new understanding of cinematic time, performance, découpage and the fiction/nonfiction dichotomy. Au hasard Balthazar is the finest work to have ever shifted from the human to the non-human and back again.” <strong>Flavia Dima</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bresson’s stillness is a limpid and natural act of consciousness in front of an impassive world.

A film about minor embarrassments and fleeting connections between strangers, it begins in alienation and builds to a transcendent vision of communal harmony. Gruelling labour went into each seemingly effortless grace note, as Tati the performer drifts in aimless bewilderment through the world that Tati the director obsessively controls.

You can summarise the plot of Late Spring in a couple of lines: the professor (Chishū Ryū) lives happily with his daughter Noriko; her aunt announces Noriko must marry before she is too old; the professor pretends he will marry so Noriko will not feel guilty about leaving him on his own. She marries. Even this is enough to understand that Ozu’s preoccupation with the precarity of happiness frames his greatest works. Just a glance – the professor’s at Mrs Miwa (Miyake Kuniko) during the Noh performance he attends with Noriko (Hara Setsuko) – is enough for a swirl of connections to run through Noriko’s mind.

Based on the record of the 15th-century trial and execution of Joan of Arc, the film focuses on an extraordinarily concentrated central performance from Renée Falconetti, allegedly the result of merciless needling from Dreyer during the filming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous for its spare visual style, Dreyer’s film creates compelling drama from its looming facial close-ups, interspersing the plaintive Joan with the penetrating gazes of her zealous inquisitors. Watching the flickers of anguish and resolve across Falconetti’s features, registered in stark detail by Rudolph Maté’s cinematography, is one of cinema’s most purely moving experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Renée Falconetti gives the most impressive performance ever recorded on film in this silent classic. Carl Theodor Dreyer expanded the potential of the close-up in this chronicle of Joan of Arc’s trial and execution. This “hymn to the triumph of the soul over life”, as Dreyer called it, re-emerges in Vivre sa vie (1962), Jean-Luc Godard’s masterpiece, in which a devastated Anna Karina watches Joan’s pains in a film theatre and cries with her.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s in the last decade that Dreyer’s somehow rapturously austere work of historical cinema shifted from being a film that enthralled me as a scholar to one that fully involved and moved me as a viewer – and of course, finally seeing it in an enveloping cinema environment, rather than a university lecture theatre or my own living room, was the instigating factor. You don’t absolutely need to see every crisply restored pore on Falconetti’s extraordinary face to viscerally feel her pain, but it certainly doesn’t hurt.” <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Simply the best (silent) film about (silent) resistance.” <strong>Anton Dolin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A dream and a nightmare of spiritual ecstasy. Dreyer and his design collaborators create an amalgam of the 14th and 20th centuries, and somehow reach into the future with every stroke. Renée Falconetti’s performance: incomparable, unbeatable, anguished and enough to make an atheist think things over.” <strong>Michael Phillips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A quote from Jean Epstein’s 1921 essay ‘Magnification’ is relevant here: ‘The close-up is an intensifying agent because of its size alone... whatever its numerical value, this magnification acts on one’s feelings more to transform than to confirm them, and personally, it makes me uneasy... The close-up modifies the drama by the impact of proximity. Pain is within reach. If I stretch out my arm I touch you, and that is intimacy. I can count the eyelashes of this suffering. I would be able to taste the tears.‘” <strong>Anne Gjelsvik</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Carl Th. Dreyer","producer":"","writer":"Carl Th.

Strongly influenced by the poetic westerns of John Ford, Kurosawa’s story of farmers recruiting a motley troupe of samurai to help them fend off bandits in turn had a huge impact on subsequent westerns and action films – from Hollywood remake The Magnificent Seven (1961) onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early section’s gathering together of the diversely talented fighters is a trope in action movies to this day, while the restrained use of slow-motion in the frenzied final faceoff has since been abused to far less subtle ends. Kurosawa expertly sustains the suspense over a lengthy duration, instilling the story with an almost Shakespearian grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So ambitious and successful in its ambition that it seems to embody the most exciting aspects of the cinematic medium: epic sweep, not of place but of classes, from samurai to peasant to bandit to outsider; stunning photography that recreates 16th-century Japan, from its beautiful heights (the flower-picking scene) to its muddy depths (the final, agonising battle); wonderful performances, not only by Mifune Toshirō as the intense outsider who yearns to be a samurai, but also by Shimura Takashi as the samurai’s canny, world-weary leader and the finefeatured Miyaguchi Seiji, whom I refer to as Cool Old Guy. And with a moving, indeed shattering finale that suggests the sorrow of war both on the personal and on the historical side.” <strong>Susan Napier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My list is light on epics, in part because depth of character impresses me more than scope. But Kurosawa gives us both.” <strong>Peter Debruge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Exciting and moving, its handling of characters and story makes it maybe the best film school that cinema has to offer.” <strong>Mårten Blomkvist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I was a kid, I watched an episode of the TV programme Movie Masterclass (1988), presented by Mamoun Hassan, that analysed this film’s framing, movement and editing, scene by scene. It blew my mind. Decades on, Kurosawa’s dynamism still leads the way.” <strong>Leigh Singer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Because Kurosawa transcended action cinema even as he invented it. Because he made it rain and rain. And because of his gaggle of ohso- human heroes: Shimura, Inaba, Katō, Miyaguchi, Chiaki, Kimura – and Mifune Toshirō like a cat on a hotplate.” <strong>Ian Nathan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Seven Samurai reminds us how moving pictures move. The whole film celebrates thrilling energy with compassion and empathy for the underprivileged.” <strong>Peggy Chiao</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The intricacy, ferocity and poignancy of Seven Samurai enable it to define a genre.” <strong>Katie Smith-Wong</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kurosawa is Eisenstein’s principal heir and the genius of Japanese cinema.” <strong>Joan Mellen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The eastern to top all westerns. Kurosawa’s absolute highlight and a film to be studied in terms of blending the exterior and the interior, the grand and the small, the there-and-then and the timeless.” <strong>Andrei Liimets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sixty-eight years after its release, Kurosawa’s masterpiece still defines everything that I want an action film to possess – a meaningful story with deep characterisations, beautiful shots and purposeful action, and a rhythm that immerses me in its every moment. There are very few action films that achieve this tapestry and Seven Samurai remains the best of them all.” <strong>Richard Propes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kurosawa’s samurai epic marked a peak in the influential Japanese filmmaker’s most critically appreciated period. Together with star Mifune Toshirō, theirs was a collaboration which produced 17 years of films that belong in any catalogue of the greatest films ever made.” <strong>Tambay Obenson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where would cinema be without Kurosawa Akira?” <strong>James Harrison</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Akira Kurosawa","producer":"Sojiro Motoki","writer":"Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni, Akira Kurosawa","featuring":"Takashi Shimura, Toshiro Mifune, Seiji Miyaguchi"},"year":"1954","nameAndYear":"Seven Samurai (1954)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-seven-samurai-1954-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-seven-samurai-1954-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/62","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"Japan","runningTime":200,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5035673020043","name":"Seven Samurai (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/seven-samurai.html","price":"9.99"},{"sku":"5035673011997","name":"Seven Samurai (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/seven-samurai-blu-ray.html","price":"16.99"}]}},{"rank":19,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"732cc9f4-21a6-5356-bb18-9130f750f332","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-10/apocalypse-now-1979-martin-sheen-with-mud-mask.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-10/apocalypse-now-1979-martin-sheen-with-mud-mask.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/apocalypse-now-1979-martin-sheen-with-mud-mask.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-10/apocalypse-now-1979-martin-sheen-with-mud-mask.jpg/960x540-cropped/apocalypse-now-1979-martin-sheen-with-mud-mask.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-10/apocalypse-now-1979-martin-sheen-with-mud-mask.jpg/96x54-cropped/apocalypse-now-1979-martin-sheen-with-mud-mask.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Apocalypse Now","url":"/film/732cc9f4-21a6-5356-bb18-9130f750f332/apocalypse-now","summary":{"text":"Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War blowout, a hell-trip through the smoke and dazzle of imperial America’s most grandstanding rogue show.","html":"<p>Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War blowout, a hell-trip through the smoke and dazzle of imperial America’s most grandstanding rogue show.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Transplanting the story of Joseph Conrad’s colonial-era novel Heart of Darkness to Vietnam, Francis Ford Coppola created a visually mesmerising fantasia on the spectacle of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shy of controversy, Hollywood steered clear of tackling the war in Vietnam until the conflict was over. In the late 1970s, emboldened by the critical successes of his two Godfather films, Francis Ford Coppola famously spent a vast amount of time and money in the jungles of Southeast Asia to bring to life the story of an American officer (Martin Sheen), sent up river to bring the wayward, megalomaniac Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) to ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troubled production – beset by a typhoon, a heart attack (Sheen’s) and the perils of excess – has entered film-making lore, but the resulting film rivals Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 (1968) for its hallucinatory visuals and grandness of conception. Coppola defined its uniquely unhinged genius best: “My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This raw, ragged Vietnam War epic remains Coppola’s most ambitious and original work. It doesn’t have the classical poise of The Godfather (1972) but offers so much more in its impressionistic, wild-ride, river-road-movie journey, a post-60s version of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness (1899). The set pieces, music and performances are exemplary. This is haunting, ravishing cinema on a rare size and scale.” <strong>Adrian Wootton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Apocalypse Now is cinema in its purest form.” <strong>Pablo Scholz</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With innovative sound design by the threetime Oscar-winning genius Walter Murch, Apocalypse Now tells the story of a journey into the Cambodian jungle by US Special Forces Captain Willard (Martin Sheen). His mental and physical mission, to “terminate” the dangerously lawless Colonel Kurtz, who has set himself up as the god of a local tribe, soon becomes a process of self-discovery, ending with an outstanding, memorable performance from Marlon Brando.” <strong>Nico Marzano</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The insanity of war has seldom been portrayed so vividly.” <strong>Christian Monggaard</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This is a film about the hell of war and the lost meaning of glory through that journey into the abyss. It’s about agony, misery and the fall of concepts, principles and ideals. All this is achieved with such visual and poetic power. Each sequence speaks volumes on the human (or rather inhuman) condition, through the main character and all who surround him. These sequences are not necessarily present to develop the story, but to give the audience samples and examples of what it’s all about to be in hell.” <strong>Mohammed Rouda</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The greatest war movie ever made, Apocalypse Now will leave you shaking. No other film has explored the human soul quite like this one.” <strong>Emily Murray</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Vittorio Storaro's cinematography on Apocalypse Now imbues me with a sense of awe – that image of a fat, bald Brando swallowed up by impermeable darkness as he intones cryptic aphorisms, this jungle sage, this mad god.” <strong>Greg Cwik</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Perhaps the most perfect rendition of parallel internal and external journeys that I have ever seen.” <strong>Naman Ramachandran</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Coppola is one of the greatest film artists and I could submit a top-five-of-all-time list composed solely of his films.” <strong>Yael Shuv</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Francis Ford Coppola","producer":"Francis Ford Coppola, Francis Ford Coppola, Kim Aubry","writer":"John Milius, Francis Ford Coppola, Francis Ford Coppola","featuring":"Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen"},"year":"1979","nameAndYear":"Apocalypse Now (1979)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-apocalypse-now-1979-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-apocalypse-now-1979-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/125","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":141,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":18,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"d58fc7f8-fd9a-5f17-88e8-c87f27856486","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg/960x540-cropped/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg/96x54-cropped/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Persona","url":"/film/d58fc7f8-fd9a-5f17-88e8-c87f27856486/persona","summary":{"text":"Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory filmmaking.","html":"<p>Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory filmmaking.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Ingmar Bergman’s Persona can be seen as the apex of his cinematic career – at one point in the film, even the celluloid itself appears to burn up in the projector, as if there was nowhere further to go. Like his Italian counterpart Fellini, Bergman achieved fame in European art cinema in the 1950s and early 60s but unexpectedly made his masterpiece out of a creative crisis. After the collapse of a project focusing on two actresses, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann (who both had intimate relationships with the director), Bergman spent time in hospital, where he came up with a fresh idea. Struck by the women’s physical likeness, he planned to explore questions of identity through the encounter between a great stage actress (Ullmann) who has inexplicably fallen silent and the insecure, garrulous nurse (Andersson) assigned to look after her. Secluded on the barren island of Fårö (which became Bergman’s favourite location and main home), the protagonists – both brilliantly played – engage in a battle of wills, their divergent attitudes towards sex and motherhood merging in disturbing ways. The erotic intensity and rawness of Persona was challenging in 1966, and remains so – few film ‘classics’ still feel so modern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory nature of the filmmaking. Bergman begins the film with a violent, fractured opening montage illustrating the nature of cinema itself and keeps ratcheting up the ambiguities by blurring realism and fantasy. Self-reflexivity never seemed so seductive, as the film freely plays with ideas of public masks and inner secrets, vampirism physical and metaphysical, and the fine line between screen performance and real lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persona has virtually defined the outer reaches of subsequent ‘art’ cinema, influencing visionary directors from Robert Altman and Nicolas Roeg to David Lynch and Olivier Assayas. Its iconography has become pervasive – Andersson’s cool blackrimmed sunglasses, the haunting images of the two women facing the camera, all beautifully rendered in the velvety monochrome photography of Sven Nykvist. The film’s overtly Jungian aspects and slippery narrative have provoked many questions and debates; Bergman gave little away, preferring audiences to draw their own conclusions. He followed Persona with some great films, but nothing quite as audacious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David Thompson</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Ingmar Bergman","producer":"","writer":"Ingmar Bergman","featuring":"Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Margareta Krook"},"year":"1966","nameAndYear":"Persona (1966)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-persona-1966-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-persona-1966-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15480","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"Sweden","runningTime":81,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5035673014639","name":"Ingmar Bergman: Volume 3 (5-Disc Blu-ray Box Set) ","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/ingmar-bergman-volume-three-5-disc-blu-ray-box-set-1.html","price":"54.99"}]}},{"rank":17,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"3b863389-5735-5b97-86c2-7e52217a7517","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg/1920x1080-cropped/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg/960x540-cropped/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg/96x54-cropped/close-up-1990-character-sits-tight.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"Close-up","url":"/film/3b863389-5735-5b97-86c2-7e52217a7517/close-up","summary":{"text":"The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised.","html":"<p>The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>From the mid-1990s until his death in 2016, Abbas Kiarostami was widely regarded as one of the most original, innovative and important filmmakers around, an audacious, idiosyncratic artist with a profoundly humane but highly distinctive view of the world. Close-Up is often seen not only as a turning-point in the Iranian’s career – it cemented his confidence in blurring the distinction between ‘documentary’ and ‘fiction’ – but as the film most representative of his aims and achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could have been a straightforward record of the court case of an unemployed print worker accused of impersonating filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf with the intent of fraudulently obtaining money from a well-to-do family. But in relating the story of Hossein Sabzian’s encounter with the Ahankhahs, Kiarostami characteristically opts for anything but an obvious linear narrative. Mixing 16mm footage of the trial (in which Kiarostami himself seems to ask as many questions as the judge) with recreations of events performed by the family, Sabzian and others playing themselves, he fragments the story into diverse meandering strands that frequently frustrate expectations while still remaining intelligible and engrossing. ‘Important’ events may be left unseen; in their place, sequences in which nothing of any clear consequence happens. Re-enactments occur without giving away whose point of view they represent. The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised. The plot thickens – except that we do, eventually, understand that the accused, for all his strange, seemingly unmotivated deceptions, is undoubtedly a decent human being, worthy of our attention, sympathy and respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though formally inventive, Close-Up confirms that its creator is no formalist. The film is driven both by deep, unsentimental compassion and by genuine philosophical curiosity; it explores the fraught relationships between truth and falsehood, film and ‘reality’, intention and action, and acknowledges, from start to finish, the role and responsibility of the director in his engagement with the people in his film. Also admirably typical of Kiarostami’s best work is his admission – indeed, insistence – that the film is incomplete until viewers respond by engaging with its artifice and actively using their imaginations. For Kiarostami, the unshown, the unsaid, the unknown were crucially important; meaning was inextricably linked to mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Abbas Kiarostami","producer":"","writer":"Abbas Kiarostami","featuring":"Hossein Sabziyan, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Abolfazl Ahankhah"},"year":"1989","nameAndYear":"Close-up (1989)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"Iran","runningTime":100,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":16,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"7c5a18ae-b5ba-5a7b-b43f-e9c1895e2f17","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg/1920x1080-cropped/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg/960x540-cropped/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg/96x54-cropped/meshes-of-the-afternoon-1943-sleep.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"Meshes of the Afternoon","url":"/film/7c5a18ae-b5ba-5a7b-b43f-e9c1895e2f17/meshes-of-the-afternoon","summary":{"text":"Had Californian sunlight ever looked as suggestive or sinister before the sharply etched dreamworld of Meshes of the Afternoon?","html":"<p>Had Californian sunlight ever looked as suggestive or sinister before the sharply etched dreamworld of Meshes of the Afternoon?</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Had Californian sunlight ever looked as suggestive or sinister before the sharply etched dream world of Meshes of the Afternoon? Certainly, it soon would, in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944) and many later films noirs. That affiliation was first proposed by J. Hoberman in the 1970s. But Meshes has been invoked as seminal by many traditions over eight decades. For years, this 14-minute film was claimed as a founding inspiration of a distinctively American form of highly personal poetic psychodrama, typified by Stan Brakhage, who hailed Deren as “the mother of us all”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deren’s hands-on promotion of her work became a model for the co-operative movement of the 1960s. Rising interest in women’s cinema would later refocus attention on her pioneering role. Today, she is the only woman among seven experimental filmmakers featured on the front page of the New York Filmmakers Co-op website, while the haunting image of her at a window must be one of the most widely reproduced stills from any avant-garde film. And rising interest in women’s film after the 1970s would focus attention on her aesthetic of ‘vertical cinema’, creating an emotional and intellectual density within rather than between images, as Barbara Hammer has described it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Deren and her co-director Alexander Hammid (originally Hackenschmied) were immigrants from Eastern Europe. She came from a Jewish family background in Ukraine, heavily involved in psychiatry, and he from experimental photography and film in Czechoslovakia. Deren would indignantly reject suggestions of influence from two earlier European avant-garde landmarks, Buñuel and Dalí’s Un chien andalou (1928) and Cocteau’s The Blood of a Poet (Le Sang d’un poète, 1930). But for all its cool originality, the eerie game of repeated symbols that its maker-protagonists play out in their West Hollywood home and garden – with a flower, key and knife linking Deren’s divided self and a sinister mirror-faced figure – has undoubtedly extended the legacy of those earlier works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meshes has never reached the top 100 before in the S&amp;S poll (despite some interesting previous backers, such as Derek Jarman in 1992). So this year’s result must reflect some significant shifts in taste – most obviously the recognition of female creativity apparent in the poll leaders, but perhaps also a renewed interest in the phantasmagoric, as explored by Deren’s most consistent fans among contemporary filmmakers, the David Lynch of Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr., and Jordan Peele.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ian Christie</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Maya Deren, Alexander Hackenschmied","producer":"","writer":"","featuring":null},"year":"1943","nameAndYear":"Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":[],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":0,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":15,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"cc32fc72-48ae-5450-886d-0d032a6986c5","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/the-searchers-1956-altercation.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/the-searchers-1956-altercation.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/the-searchers-1956-altercation.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/the-searchers-1956-altercation.jpg/960x540-cropped/the-searchers-1956-altercation.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/the-searchers-1956-altercation.jpg/96x54-cropped/the-searchers-1956-altercation.jpg","altText":null},"name":"The Searchers","url":"/film/cc32fc72-48ae-5450-886d-0d032a6986c5/the-searchers","summary":{"text":"This poll’s last western standing, John Ford’s sweeping, stirring rescue-or-revenge quest remains a film of magnificent mystery and poetry.","html":"<p>This poll’s last western standing, John Ford’s sweeping, stirring rescue-or-revenge quest remains a film of magnificent mystery and poetry.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Cinema’s poet of the Wild West, John Ford already had countless westerns (among over 100 films) under his belt before reteaming with regular star John Wayne for this disturbing story of racism, obsession and revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intending to kill his kidnapped niece (Natalie Wood) when he finds her, assuming her long since defiled by her Comanche kidnappers, morally complex Ethan Edwards is the role that convinced many that Wayne could truly act. Ford sets the hulking actor against the awe-inspiringly rugged terrain of Arizona’s Monument Valley and, in the iconic final shot, frames him within the doorway of a homestead, standing outside on the cusp of a civilisation where he can never fit in. It is one of the medium’s most unforgettable images of isolation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The iconic image of Ethan Edwards framed in the doorway, the expanse of the West stretching behind him, is as lyrical as it is telling. A relic of the past, he cannot cross over the threshold into the civilised world. He has helped to preserve a world he cannot be a part of any longer. Racist and unyielding, Ethan is not likeable and his redemption seems impossible. But Ford holds audiences in his visual and narrative thrall to the very end so that when the door shuts on Ethan, it's hard not to think about those who get left behind when the world moves on.” <strong>Domino Renee Perez</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Still mesmerising and full of mystery.” <strong>Christian Viviani</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Perhaps the first, and greatest, revisionist western.” <strong>Jon Towlson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I cannot imagine American cinema without John Ford who, among other things, created and defined the western. This is the supreme masterpiece of the genre, forever compelling and moving, superb in every department, including John Wayne’s greatest performance and arguably the most memorable final shot in all of cinema.” <strong>Angie Errigo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In The Searchers, Ford not only achieves the pinnacle of the western – the most influential and exemplary movie genre in history, to which no other director contributed nearly as many canonical texts – but also inscribes within the film an astonishing critique of his own life’s work up until that point. A grand, brutal and fearless work.” <strong>James Schamus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It has me the moment the door opens.

When was this immaculate feature film, Agnès Varda’s essay on time and space, love and death, ever not on our minds?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving with the first surge of the French New Wave, Cléo from 5 to 7 crackles with the energy and modernity of that cinephile movement, but it’s ultimately an introspective piece, characterised by the philosophical preoccupations of Varda’s Left Bank peers. Corinne Marchand plays Cléo, a blonde pop singer whose vanity relaxes as her anxieties swell. As the film begins, she visits a tarot reader, hoping for good news about the medical test results she is awaiting – but the cards spell only death, and transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Cléo’s mind is fixed on the future, Varda’s camera captures her in the present tense, killing time in Paris as she ponders her own decay. Echoing Marcel Duchamp’s 1912 painting Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, Varda dissects a trip down the stairs to emphasise the moment as it passes, one we would otherwise have missed. As Cléo, a Parisian Mrs Dalloway, walks the streets of her city, Varda also captures a broader sense of time, an era in history: Paris in the early 1960s, with its crowds, cafés, shops, music, fashion and cinema. The geography is precise: Varda called the film “the portrait of a woman painted on to a documentary about Paris”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film shifts from colour to blackand- white to remind us that this is what cinema does – it transforms life. A film within the film turns the idea into a joke: life makes no sense in monochrome. But Cléo is transformed by the film, by these 90 minutes and the images of herself and her future that confront her everywhere. In real time, Cléo becomes more real, more subject than object, more human, more in tune with the city. She discards her whipped-cream wig and polka dots for a simple black shift. She performs less and feels more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the kind of playfulness that Varda enjoyed so much, we could call this ticking- clock film timeless. From the feminist analysis of a woman’s commodified beauty and a celebrity’s self-regarding narcissism to the vulnerable heroine acting out her messy emotions in public, the spectre of war and the fear of disease darkening a midsummer day, Cléo from 5 to 7 feels pertinent to the modern moment. It always will. Marchand’s Cléo was pinned in a point in time, but the film marches on, playing on a loop in our imaginations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pamela Hutchinson</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Agnès Varda","producer":"Georges de Beauregard, Carlo Ponti","writer":"Agnès Varda","featuring":"Corinne Marchand, Antoine Bourseiller, Dominique Davray"},"year":"1962","nameAndYear":"Cléo from 5 to 7 (1962)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-cleo-from-5-to-7-1962-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-cleo-from-5-to-7-1962-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/14968","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"France, Italy","runningTime":90,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[]}},{"rank":13,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"725ff1e4-895e-5c6e-8a6e-b03825197e99","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg/960x540-cropped/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg/96x54-cropped/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","altText":null},"name":"La Règle du jeu","url":"/film/725ff1e4-895e-5c6e-8a6e-b03825197e99/la-regle-du-jeu","summary":{"text":"Huge-spirited and sharp-eyed, Jean Renoir’s French-society fresco gathers high classes and low for a weekend of country-house fallout.","html":"<p>Huge-spirited and sharp-eyed, Jean Renoir’s French-society fresco gathers high classes and low for a weekend of country-house fallout.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Made on the cusp of WWII, Jean Renoir’s satire of the upper-middle classes was banned as demoralising by the French government for two decades after its release. Renoir, a director associated with the left wing Popular Front, turned his gaze away from working people to the haute bourgeoisie. Taking its cue from the classic stage farces of Musset and Beaumarchais, Renoir sets his action during a shooting weekend at a country house. It’s an upstairs-downstairs world where servants and masters become enmeshed in a tangle of desire, a jumble of motivations in which, in the film’s famous phrase, “Everyone has their reasons”. At the film’s centre is the amiable Octave (played by Renoir), whose best intentions lead to tragedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shot in long, controlled takes that stress the depth of vision, Renoir’s depiction of an intransigent society teetering blithely into disaster was derided upon release and only later acclaimed as one of cinema’s most vital films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A lesson in life in every word of dialogue, a piece of cinema in every frame.

A masterful comedy of manners replete with unexpected twists and turns.” <strong>Jan Olsson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A stunning panorama of metropolitan and provincial, aristocrat and peasant, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, and a tale of two marriages that seems to sum up life in Europe just before World War II.” <strong>Carrie Rickey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In this film we can find everything: the decadence of European culture before the war, the creative freedom of a film director both modern and primitive, the infinite potential of filming in deep-focus and long shots to grab and replicate the complexity, the openness, the elusiveness of reality.” <strong>Roberto Manassero</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Probably the best example of the Renoir style, combining graceful mise en scène, seamless plotting and the peerless command of cinematic technique.” <strong>Charles Ramírez Berg</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No more devastatingly ironic and subtle critique of wealth, power and privilege has ever been made.

One of the world’s great filmmakers, and this is his greatest achievement.” <strong>Eddie Muller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Deceptively light-handed charm throughout the upstairs, downstairs antics in a country house doesn’t obscure Jean Renoir’s contempt for the underlying darkness and his prescience of what was to imminently befall such people.

Hollywood movies are an artform and a mass entertainment, the product of a singular vision and of a ruthless industry, the work of great directors and the alchemical result of a thousand collaborations, coincidences and backsagainst- the-wall snap decisions. The Godfather is all of the above and more – an unimaginably dark story that begins with the hopeful sentence “I believe in America,” a fat, full saga that, two years after its release, revealed itself to be merely the middle of a fatter, fuller saga, and a work the creation of which has generated its own mythic origin stories, from the director who wouldn’t compromise to the leading man nobody was sure could pull it off. It is enduring and defining art, alchemically transmuted from the pages of an OK bestseller and the imaginations of everyone involved, first among them its great co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola. As James Caan’s Sonny Corleone says in one of the film’s most enduring scenes, “This is business, and this man is takin’ it very, very personal.” So much of the most brilliant work from Hollywood emerged from the conviction that a movie could be both. Every scene of The Godfather makes the case for that belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie exists on countless timelines – it was an early peak for its director, given his big studio shot at the unimaginable age of 32; a mind-blowing return to form for Marlon Brando; a stunning launch for Al Pacino; a benchmark achievement of New Hollywood; and a gauntlet thrown down by its cinematographer Gordon Willis, whose brown-black-and-blacker lighting and compositions changed the look of movies. Its most experienced actor made his debut in the 1930s; its newcomers are still working today. While no movie can be said to gather both the past and the future of filmmaking into itself, The Godfather comes thrillingly close. It’s a crime story, a family story that plunders the word ‘family’ for comedy, emotion and profound horror, an immigrant story and a cautionary tale about the American hunger for power; it contains multitudes. Were the screen suddenly to triple in size, as it does in Abel Gance’s 1927 epic Napoléon (a film Coppola reveres), you sense that a teeming world would reveal itself as always having been there. But the world within Coppola’s frame is big enough; half a century later, we can still walk around in it and discover something new about moviemaking and life with every visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mark Harris</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Francis Ford Coppola","producer":"Albert S.

Huge and intimate and lovely.” <strong>Chloe Walker</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Film language reached such exciting heights in the hands of Lang, Murnau and other silent expressionists, it’s almost a shame that sound came along.” <strong>Peter Debruge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The supreme example of what was at risk of being lost when the talkies arrived. Thank God that Murnau slipped this one under the wire.” <strong>James Swanton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s quite possible that cinema peaked in 1927, and considering the greatness of Sunrise there’s not even any shame in that.” <strong>Eric Hynes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The summit of the then-new artform. Since then, in so many ways, it’s been a downhill road for American filmmaking.” <strong>Joseph McBride</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the finest silent films. Stunning cinematography, perfect direction, excellent acting. Still moving today.” <strong>Jean-Marc Leveratto</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How hatred and romance are intertwined, as are beauty and death.” <strong>Charlotte Garson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sunrise is the perfect match between the German way of framing and lighting emotions and a simple, moving, universal love story.” <strong>Carlo Chatrian</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For the sophistication, the poetry and the tears. The most beautiful film ever, as Truffaut rightly stated.” <strong>Claude Bertemes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Murnau is an absolute genius of images and his first American picture is probably the most beautiful and moving silent film in the world, and the most moving love drama ever made.” <strong>Frédéric Maire</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the most beautiful films ever made. Murnau’s mise en scène is brilliant; he truly understood the essence of the cinematographic image.” <strong>Miquel Escudero Diéguez</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Murnau really was able to express everything with the cinematographic means available. He needed no sound and hardly any intertitles, yet his storytelling is crystal clear.” <strong>René Wolf</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As its subtitle says, it’s just “a tale of two humans”, but the whole world of humanity is in this film.” <strong>Peter Hourigan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For being as sexy, slippery, gorgeous and inventive now as it was then, and for refusing to simplistically take sides between pastoral nostalgia and bewitching novelty.” <strong>Nick Davis</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"F.W.

The film’s ascent almost feels like a given, due to the effervescence that may be its defining characteristic and the scarcity of that quality in our trying times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, typically for anything that seems so effortless, Kelly and Donen’s achievement was in fact the product of an enormous amount of toil and trouble. At the project’s outset, the legendary writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green tried and failed to get out of the gig when MGM musical head Arthur Freed ordered them to build a new movie on top of a batch of tunes by Freed and his partner Nacio Herb Brown that were gathering dust. (Indeed, ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ itself had made its screen debut in The Hollywood Revue of 1929.) Debbie Reynolds’ ordeal filming the ‘Good Morning’ tap-dance number famously left her with bloody feet. As for the title song, six months of rehearsal culminated in Gene Kelly gamely splashing about while running a high fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of that suffering is discernible on screen, which is one of the many delightful ironies about Hollywood’s most deeply cherished movie about the making of a Hollywood movie. Pulling back the curtain to show yet more dazzling drapery, Comden and Green celebrate an earlier era of Tinseltown chancers and hustlers with a tale of a production caught between the silent and sound eras. Kelly’s plucky hoofer and stuntman-turned-star Don Lockwood leads the charge to retrofit a swashbuckler picture named The Duelling Cavalier to take advantage of the new vogue for sound, with his new sweetie Kathy (Reynolds) being his best means of disguising the squawky voice of his leading lady Lina (a hilarious Jean Hagen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several movies besides Don’s latest somehow contained within the text of Singin’ in the Rain (including, if we are to believe the deliciously meta billboard in the final shot, Singin’ in the Rain). Cheekily purporting to reveal its own means of production while still delivering one unabashedly theatrical showstopper after another, Kelly and Donen’s masterwork anticipates the brassy postmodernism of Moulin Rouge! (2001). But like such fellow homage-payers as The Artist (2011) and La La Land (2016), Baz Luhrmann’s rendition feels meagre compared to the original and its seemingly inexhaustible bounty of ingenuity, bravado and sheer unabashed joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jason Anderson</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen","producer":"Arthur Freed","writer":"Adolph Green, Betty Comden","featuring":"Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds"},"year":"1951","nameAndYear":"Singin' in the Rain (1951)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14090","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":102,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5051892082150","name":"Singin' in the Rain (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/singin-in-the-rain-dvd.html","price":"5.99"},{"sku":"5051892074391","name":"Singin' in the Rain (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/singin-in-the-rain-blu-ray.html","price":"12.99"}]}},{"rank":9,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"cacbb2df-be18-5e59-b5c3-f0eb9ea3a90d","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg/960x540-cropped/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-02/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg/96x54-cropped/man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-kino-eye.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Man with a Movie Camera","url":"/film/cacbb2df-be18-5e59-b5c3-f0eb9ea3a90d/man-with-a-movie-camera","summary":{"text":"Bottomless invention and frenetic, dizzying montage make this city symphony one of cinema’s sharpest, most exciting experiences nearly a century after its release.","html":"<p>Bottomless invention and frenetic, dizzying montage make this city symphony one of cinema’s sharpest, most exciting experiences nearly a century after its release.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>A decade into his career as both filmmaker and theorist, Dziga Vertov made his best-known and most widely distributed film. This narrative-free portrait of city life – three unidentified cities provided the locations – is propelled by an effervescent delight in the possibilities of film, with its unexpected angles and clashing juxtapositions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vertov deliberately shunned what he saw as hidebound theatrical conventions such as intertitles and actors – the film’s only real protagonist is the cameraman himself. This could easily be an indulgent mess, but Vertov’s grasp of his medium is so philosophically sure-footed that it’s just as stimulating many decades later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“David Abelevich Kaufman, also known as Dziga Vertov (a Ukrainian phrase roughly meaning ‘spinning top’), was born in 1896 into a Jewish book-dealer’s family in the city of Białystok, then part of the Russian Empire, in modernday Poland. He understood Lenin’s philosophy that film was the most important of all the propaganda forms (especially among a largely illiterate population) and his Anniversary of the Revolution (1918), which may be the first documentary ever made, should be studied in every film school. Though none of us have truly experienced Man with a Movie Camera – which has not been seen in its original form since the 1930s due to it being widely replicated and distributed at an inaccurate speed, significantly changing its rhythm and accents in a way that does not match its original score – I’m still dazzled by its artistry and anticipate the forthcoming restoration.” <strong>Dorota Lech</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“‘Down with bourgeois fairytale plots and scenarios – long live life as it is!’ So said Dziga Vertov, for whom documentary was the only true revolutionary form as it freed film from false scenarios and performing actors. Man with a Movie Camera, about life in a Soviet city from dawn to dusk, was certainly revolutionary in its approach to image creation, which continually undermines and extends itself to dazzling and witty effect. As well as Vertov, the Kino-Eye Council of Three – which attempted to engender a new kind of perception through cinematic montage – comprised Vertov’s editor wife, Elizaveta Svilova, and his camera operator brother, Mikhail Kaufman. All three deserve authorship credit for the film.” <strong>Helen DeWitt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The defining aspirational work of documentary cinema, this film understands and celebrates the power of cinematic manipulation to uncover profound artistic, emotional and existential truths.” <strong>Alan Mattli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The dynamism of Vertov’s camerawork and montage reflect the enthusiasm of the era for speed and movement, presuppositions of urban modernity.” <strong>Carlos Alberto Mattos</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This dynamic documentary is much more than a great city symphony. It is an ode to cinema and its infinite possibilities as well as the clearest example of how even the reality that nonfiction films return to us is always constructed, the outcome of manipulation.” <strong>Cristina Formenti</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Dziga Vertov","producer":"","writer":"","featuring":"Mikhail Kaufman"},"year":"1929","nameAndYear":"Man with a Movie Camera (1929)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-man-with-a-movie-camera-1929-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/108","pillar":"subscription","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"Ukrainian SSR, USSR","runningTime":67,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5035673005835","name":"La Regle du Jeu (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/la-regle-du-jeu-dvd.html","price":"14.99"},{"sku":"5035673012130","name":"Man With a Movie Camera (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/man-with-a-movie-camera-blu-ray.html","price":"16.99"}]}},{"rank":8,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"784b550c-9db8-568a-8078-32b4957e2bbb","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg/960x540-cropped/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg/96x54-cropped/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Mulholland Dr.","url":"/film/784b550c-9db8-568a-8078-32b4957e2bbb/mulholland-dr","summary":{"text":"Hollywood is dark and dangerous, yet alluring, in David Lynch’s acclaimed thriller.","html":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hollywood is dark and dangerous, yet alluring, in David Lynch’s acclaimed thriller.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Defiantly sui generis and unorthodox as he’s always seemed, it may be that David Lynch has by now become a paradigmatic voice of our times. What has long been labelled ‘Lynchian’, instead of merely ruling over our culture’s more delicious margins, might be instead how modern life feels for most of us – a clotted dream of irrational seizures and psychosexual secrets and desires wracked by incomprehensible forces. Certainly, the rise of his crepuscular masterpiece Mulholland Dr. up the new poll’s canonical ladder – 20 rungs, from 28 in 2012 – suggests that we’re coming around to accepting Lynch’s disorienting voice as paradigmatic, even necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having begun as a post-Twin Peaks TV pilot, dumped by ABC and expanded upon into something completely different, Lynch’s film is his gay Anna Karenina (1878), his Hollywood death dive, his final salute to the legacy mysteries of Vertigo (1958) and his deepest dish of metaphysical tragedy. In the deftest of the filmmaker’s gnomic bifurcations, the movie’s flow runs from network-gloss irony, through a tunnel of angst, to a Sapphic wander through Desolation Row, with its two heroines (Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) also doubled up, playing out two contrasting narratives, each potentially and mysteriously the psychic B-side of the other. Identity, in Hollywood, is a quantum reality, a fact that meets Lynch’s lust for instability head on. Perhaps that is the resonating clue as to the film’s ascendant critical regard: its essential, unreasonable slipperiness, its fierce embrace of uncertainty and the indeterminate, speaks more to our fraught present, 21 years later, than it did to its heyday during the pre-9/11 Bush administration. (Not that it wasn’t beloved then, reaping dozens of criticgroup awards and getting Lynch an Oscar nomination for Best Director.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film’s unironic payload of wrenching heartbreak, swimming up from a swampy dream of ironic strangeness, is singular in his oeuvre, as if the vulnerabilities of young women in the twisty roads and dusty hills of the American movie struck him in ways that the dark plight of smalltown Lumberton/ Twin Peaks high-schoolers didn’t quite? Perhaps. But it’s still a maddening, freaky, mysterious thing, seductively interpretable but, ultimately, Lynchianly resistant to final readings. That’s integral to its allure, too. It’s like a hieroglyph you’re always on the verge of translating or a lover’s sphinx-like expression in bed that suggests betrayal, devotion or something in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Michael Atkinson</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"David Lynch","producer":"Mary Sweeney, Alain Sarde, Neal Edelstein, Michael Polaire, Tony Krantz, Joyce Eliason","writer":"David Lynch","featuring":"Justin Theroux, Naomi Watts, Laura Harring"},"year":"2001","nameAndYear":"Mulholland Dr. (2001)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-mulholland-dr-2001-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-mulholland-dr-2001-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14931","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"tags":["BFI Player","Shop"],"productionCountries":"France, USA","runningTime":146,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5055201803931","name":"David Lynch: The Collection (DVD Box Set)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/david-lynch-the-collection.html","price":"15.99"},{"sku":"5055201848475","name":"Mulholland Drive (DVD)","format":"DVD","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/mulholland-drive-dvd.html","price":"6.99"}]}},{"rank":7,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"bc9dc6fa-0761-553d-8324-f1fbd4bd2005","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg/960x540-cropped/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg/96x54-cropped/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Beau travail","url":"/film/bc9dc6fa-0761-553d-8324-f1fbd4bd2005/beau-travail","summary":{"text":"Claire Denis’s great gift is to evoke emotion with gesture and juxtaposition.

My face split into a grin of disbelief as the credits rolled and I rewound the final scene. More than 20 years after its initial release, that set piece, soundtracked by Corona’s 90s Eurodance hit ‘The Rhythm of the Night’, with its climactic burst of feeling, is as well-known as the film itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started as a sort of joke. Claire Denis was commissioned by the TV network Arte to make a film about foreignness and so, wryly, provocatively, she made a movie in which her own people were the foreigners. In Marseille, Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant) reflects on his time as ‘a perfect legionnaire’ in Djibouti, East Africa, serving the French Foreign Legion. He and his soldiers, including the undeniably pretty and unusually well-liked Gilles Sentain (Grégoire Colin), perform highly choreographed military drills in the desert heat. Under the blazing sun, resentments simmer. In the evenings, the men dance at a nightclub with the local women, who are beautiful, modern and ambivalent. Djibouti, a former French colony, gained independence in 1977. These soldiers are irrelevant; the colonial project is obsolete. ‘Unfit for life, unfit for civilian life’ is how Galoup describes himself in his diary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But feeling unmoored from one’s purpose – feeling like a foreigner to your own life – is a timeless conundrum, and one that seems to resonate with both film lovers and filmmakers (Barry Jenkins has mentioned its influence on 2016’s Moonlight). It remains Denis’s only true crowd-pleaser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denis’s great gift is her ability to evoke emotion with gesture and juxtaposition. In the Djibouti desert, water shimmers and ripples, naked shoulders perspire and black mosquito nets recall sheer lingerie. In a Claire Denis film, dialogue is sparse, but images are charged with meaning. ‘Making films, for me, is to get rid of explanation,’ she told the Guardian back in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final scene is pure release: a wordless explanation after 90 minutes of tension. Visual references travel through quotations in other works and, in recent times, through the internet. Films are portioned up and divorced from their original contexts, re-appropriated and shared as memes. I wonder if the renewed popularity of Beau travail in this decade’s Greatest Films poll is a result of its increased visibility among a younger generation, many of whom have likely encountered, or at least revisited, its euphoric dancefloor-set conclusion via their computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Simran Hans</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Claire Denis","producer":"Jérôme Minet, Patrick Grandperret","writer":"Jean-Pol Fargeau, Claire Denis","featuring":"Denis Lavant, Michel Subor, Grégoire Colin"},"year":"1998","nameAndYear":"Beau travail (1998)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":93,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5050629865233","name":"Beau Travail (Blu-ray) ","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/beau-travail-blu-ray.html","price":"21.99"}]}},{"rank":6,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"cefccdb2-b558-5623-9c17-72b4be7bd4c1","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg/960x540-cropped/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2021-11/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg/96x54-cropped/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-keir-dullea-helmet-red-light.jpg","altText":null},"name":"2001: A Space Odyssey","url":"/film/cefccdb2-b558-5623-9c17-72b4be7bd4c1/2001-a-space-odyssey","summary":{"text":"Stanley Kubrick’s grand vision of mankind’s journey from its hominid beginnings to its star-child evolution is a towering achievement of science-fiction cinema.","html":"<p>Stanley Kubrick’s grand vision of mankind’s journey from its hominid beginnings to its star-child evolution is a towering achievement of science-fiction cinema.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>A year before the first moon landing, Stanley Kubrick envisioned an outer space where vast spacecraft revolve weightlessly to the strains of Johann Strauss’s Blue Danube waltz. 2001 revolutionised the depiction of the cosmos on film, at the same time – with the HAL-9000 computer that fatally malfunctions during a mission to Jupiter – sounding a warning about unbridled technological advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning with primordial apes discovering tools and climaxing with astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) travelling beyond the limits of the known universe, Kubrick’s film was an intellectual (and psychedelic) event in the late 1960s. A ‘match cut’ which quickly replaces a bone thrown upwards by an ape with a similarly shaped spaceship floating through space, thereby compressing millennia of human evolution, is justly celebrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“‘If Kubrick could get rid of the human element, he could make the perfect film,’ joked Malcolm McDowell. But here, he almost does. By acting, arrogantly, as if nobody had ever made a really good science-fiction film before, Kubrick solves all the genre’s problems methodically but also pushes it into epic, mythic, spiritual terrain. It’s stately, bold, astonishingly beautiful. The great rationalist suddenly blasts us off into a psychedelic experience which doesn’t yield fully to reason.

Ten years ago, it stood out as the best-performing film of the 21st century in the critics’ list, landing in 24th place. With a fresh generation of critics chiming in – one that cinematically came of age when Wong’s film had already attained modern-classic status – it was sure to rise up the ranks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Mood for Love’s spectacular top five placement, however, demonstrates the broadly seductive allure of a mid-century Hong Kong period piece that looks both forward and back, wallowing in nostalgia for a purer, lusher form of cinematic romanticism while carving out more modern, even avant-garde forms of sensual and psychological expression from its saturated style. It’s a film that invites you to think, “They don’t make them like they used to” – even though you know they never quite made them quite like this. The film’s essential romantic narrative of forbidden yearnings and missed connections may be the stuff of vintage melodrama, but less familiar is the way Wong expands the simple anatomy of a thwarted love affair into an elastic meditation on personal unrest, political statelessness and the violence of time’s unrelenting passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film never tells you it’s about any of that, of course. Wong’s porous, often headily non-verbal filmmaking trusts us to feel the lovers’ ennui and melancholy – and further, to identify it within ourselves – via its sheer accumulation of sounds, images and sense memories: be it the damp wraiths of steam swirling from an opened noodle container, the warm, vinyl-roughened croon of Nat King Cole on the soundtrack or the impossible lobby-card beauty of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, both preserved here in their ravishing prime, and somehow convincing as ordinary mortals made movie-star beautiful by love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re living through a fairly stifled age of visual storytelling, as the televisual pull of streaming culture encourages filmmakers to think smaller and more literal. As moving as its relationship study is, anybody who thinks of In the Mood for Love, however, thinks first of those sensory flourishes and grace notes – it’s a film that even, somehow, has a signature scent. Its visual and sonic fragments cumulatively evoke not just a firmly past time and place but a mood, a feeling, a sorrow that drifts from the film’s world to ours. That must account for its enduring, even increasing, popularity: it lingers like an unrequited crush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Wong Kar Wai","producer":"Wong Kar Wai","writer":"Wong Kar Wai","featuring":"Maggie Cheung Man-yuk, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Rebecca Pan Di-hua"},"year":"2000","nameAndYear":"In the Mood for Love (2000)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"Hong Kong, France","runningTime":98,"sightAndSound":null,"products":[{"sku":"5050629592436","name":"In the Mood for Love (Blu-ray)","format":"Blu-Ray","url":"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/dvd-blu-ray/sight-and-sound-100-greatest-films-of-all-time/in-the-mood-for-love-blu-ray.html","price":"28.99"}]}},{"rank":4,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"65edaa59-6546-57b5-9fa3-9409f93d1383","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg/1920x1080-cropped/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg/960x540-cropped/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg/96x54-cropped/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Tokyo Story","url":"/film/65edaa59-6546-57b5-9fa3-9409f93d1383/tokyo-story","summary":{"text":"Told in Yasujirō Ozu’s simple and elegant style, this story of intergenerational discord is heartbreaking and deeply human.","html":"<p>Told in Yasujirō Ozu’s simple and elegant style, this story of intergenerational discord is heartbreaking and deeply human.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>The later films of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu are marked by a striking uniformity of theme and form. These are stories of family life involving inevitable rupture, as things change, daughters marry, widowers grow old. Ozu films this bittersweet natural progression in his unmistakably controlled, minimal style, typified by head-on shots with the camera at the height of a seated observer. Tokyo Story is the best known (in the West) of this extraordinary cycle, a quietly tragic tale of an ageing couple coming to the painful realisation that their family no longer needs them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luminous Ozu regular Setsuko Hara plays daughter-in-law Noriko. Although not the same character as the Norikos she plays in Late Spring (1949) and Early Summer (1951), the films are considered a loose trilogy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A brilliant film on generational change, a society in transition and what it means to feel you are no longer needed. Ozu is always the filmmaker to turn to if you want to see how to do more with less – the filmmaker of the quotidian, melding economy and intensity to extraordinary effect.” <strong>Maria Delgado</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The evocative power of this film remains intact. The soft melancholy, the passage of time, the understanding of life as a spiritual adventure. All from the adventures and misadventures of a family. So simple, so complex.” <strong>Pedro Adrián Zuluaga</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A profound film. Ozu’s Zen style at its simplest and most sublime.” <strong>Patrick McGilligan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film full of wisdom, understanding and acceptance of life that never ceases to move and amaze. A beautiful heartbreak of a movie.” <strong>José Arroyo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A psychologically healing film, a magically calming one.” <strong>Saleem Albeik</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This extraordinary study of ageing, mortality and family life (among other things) has that unforgettable moment: ‘Isn’t life disappointing?’ – ‘Yes’ (with a smile).” <strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Its reputation for greatness is beyond deserved but canonisation also risks smothering its still live charge, pinning behind glass a work of art that still has the power to astonish, disrupt and shatter. Few works have ever been as capable of expressing the exquisite beauty and prevailing intolerability of living.” <strong>Eric Hynes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Poignancy, regret and sadness come through all the keener by virtue of the restraint of performance, composition and editing.” <strong>Richard Dyer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film brimming with restrained emotion, which is unleashed through a level of unparalleled film craftsmanship. The model on which many of the world’s greatest films are based.” <strong>Akira Mizuta Lippit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ozu’s films always feel deceptively simple, despite their unusual framing and editing structures. It’s not just his mastery of cinema as a form that’s so impressive but the sheer humanity and compassion with which he manages to fill his films.” <strong>David Morrison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A gently tragic film about the wheel turning.” <strong>Tom Ryan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As you watch, it seems nothing is happening.

Charting the rise of Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles himself) – who decides to start a newspaper with his inherited fortune – Welles’ film is a classic story of the corrupting effects of power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of deep-focus photography (keeping both foreground and background in focus) and abstracted camera angles, the non-chronological narrative structure and overlapping dialogue, were just some of the myriad formal innovations that Welles brought together for his groundbreaking debut. Such novelty and controversy proved a curse for Welles, whose career never enjoyed such indulgence again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Citizen Kane remains the ultimate commentary on American culture since the early 20th century. It conveys America’s inherent polarities (individualism vs collective impulses; libertarianism vs puritanism; innocence vs corruption; the underdog mentality to rebel against oppression vs the impulse to rule over the masses through duping strategies) via a deft synergy of form and content. It has never been more rewarding to screen and talk about this film than in our current political moment.” <strong>Roy Grundmann</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The former champion still feels like a grand summation of film’s early development as an artform and a glimpse of the future, too. At the same time, it’s a hugely entertaining portrait of the media narcissism and demagoguery that underscore American politics.” <strong>Scott Tobias</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It still amazes for its formal bravado, a barrage of cinematographic strategies which retain their innovative resonances. The film’s reputation as representing the apogee of an ossified ‘canon’ of outstanding films should not minimise its qualities – it deserves to be so recognised. It combines the restless energy of its subject with formal experimentation which demonstrates the artistry of filmmaking as a collaborative enterprise when new technical approaches were being explored.” <strong>Sarah Street</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sadly, it’s fashionable now to chip away at its greatness. This temptation should be resisted. The audacious American masterpiece of the 20th century, not only for its cinematic innovations and storytelling vigour, but for how accurately it dissects the ‘American character’.” <strong>Eddie Muller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What else is there to say about Kane? It will always be remembered for novelty, for vision, for the sheer audacity of its existence.” <strong>Oris Aigbokhaevbolo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The ultimate in movie baroque. Welles’s film is a twisted pearl – glorious, florid, overweening – about crazed ambition and the virtues and innocences it crushes in its wake.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film that amply rewards repeated viewings, revealing new depths, new nuanced details, new mysteries. There is no greatest film, but if there were, for me this would surely be the strongest contender.” <strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What, I’m going to leave this off, so I can look more like a wild individualist? A brilliant cinematic mind jumps into the medium, determined to see what he can make it do.

Of all the films that could surmount this poll (there have now been four, across eight decades), it seems apt that Alfred Hitchcock’s woozy psychoromance should lose its grip as soon as it reached the summit – that this delirious maunder with James Stewart’s acrophobic, impressionable detective through an absurd murder-seduction intrigue in a winding San Francisco wonderland should place less steadily than the obdurate Citizen Kane (1941), previously enshrined on high for 40 years. Still, its fall has been less steep than that of Bicycle Thieves (1948), which sank from first to seventh between 1952 and 1962, or this year’s plunge of Jean Renoir’s La Règle du jeu (1939), previously a top-ten perennial, from fourth to 13th. Vertigo came just seven votes short of the top spot – proportionally closer than in 2002, when it missed deposing Orson Welles’s reigning champ by only four votes – while the distance between it and Kane (now third) has grown since 2012, from 34 votes to 45. This is not a film in rapid descent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of last year, Vertigo’s 1958 release date puts it in the first half of cinema’s history. As that history extends, and this poll grows, so the greater diversity of latter-day filmmaking stretches the voting. In 2012 the film led with 191 votes – meaning it was included in almost a quarter of the entries; this year its 208 votes amounted to half that proportion, 12 per cent. Lifting the lid of the poll, though, shows a more fluid story than just new voters moving on from the old. Vertigo lost nearly three-quarters (139) of its 2012 electors: three-fifths of them to voter attrition (those voters who for whatever reason didn’t show up in 2022), but more turned away from Vertigo (57) than stuck with it (54). Sixteen swung behind it this year after choosing otherwise in 2012. Meanwhile 140 of its 208 votes came from new – and presumably younger – recruits to the electorate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a decade of debate about the justices of cinematic representation, I’d wondered how Hitchcock’s frayed, pessimistic thriller of estrangement would now strike people. Filtering Pygmalion myths of idealisation and exploitation through Proustian memory games – with Bernard Herrmann’s score adding top notes of Wagnerian tragedy – it’s hardly a film that promises hope or amelioration, more a darkly, bottomlessly reflexive portrait of private vices and compulsions; a vortex of perspective-stretching, misdirection and disorientation; a whirlpool of obscure, consuming desire. It seems many of us are still plunging in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nick Bradshaw</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Alfred Hitchcock","producer":"","writer":"Alec Coppel, Samuel A.

Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) heads the 2022 list. No other film made by a woman has ever even reached the top ten. In the first instance, this is unsurprising: women film directors have always, obviously, been few and far between; equally obviously, the contributing critics have been predominantly male. It was when Sight and Sound expanded the critics’ pool in 2012 that Jeanne Dielman first entered the list, at number 35; its rise to the top now is a triumph for women’s cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But perhaps the ultimate surprise goes even further: the film that collected the most votes in 2022 is made with a cinematic style and strategy closer to avantgarde than mainstream traditions and, furthermore, at just under three and a half hours, demands dedicated viewing. Although confrontational, idiosyncratic and extraordinary films have consistently appeared lower in the lists, the experimental tradition, to which Jeanne Dielman belongs, is – apart perhaps from the recent appearance of Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera (1929) – absent. While it has brought this tradition to the top of the list, Jeanne Dielman is inescapably a woman’s film, consciously feminist in its turn to the avant garde.

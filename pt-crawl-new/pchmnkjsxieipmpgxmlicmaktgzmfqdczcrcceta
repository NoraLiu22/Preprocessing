<p>The series of events that led to Belarus's independence began with
        the explosion at the Chornobyl' nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986.
        The foot-dragging of the government in Moscow in even announcing that
        the accident had occurred, let alone evacuating people from affected
        areas and providing funds for the cleanup, greatly angered the
        Belorussian people, most of whom had no political aspirations for
        independence.
        <p>In 1988 Zyanon Paznyak, an archagologist who would later play a role
        in national politics, revealed the discovery of mass graves of some
        250,000 of Stalin's victims at Kurapaty. Many Belorussians were deeply
        shaken by this news, and some demanded accountability from the central
        authorities in Moscow. Reformers created the Belarusian Popular Front
        (BPF) in October after several mass demonstrations and clashes with the
        authorities. Paznyak became the spokesman for the reform movement and
        nationalist aspirations, and he emerged as the BPF chairman.
        <p>The March 4, 1990, elections to the republic's Supreme Soviet gave
        the country a legislature that was little different from previous
        legislatures: only 10 percent of the deputies were members of the
        opposition. But for the most part, the populace seemed satisfied with
        the new deputies, and the BPF's calls for independence and efforts at
        nation-building failed to stir up the same strong emotions as movements
        in neighboring Ukraine and the Baltic republics. Although the Supreme
        Soviet of the Belorussian SSR adopted the Declaration of State
        Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic on June 27, 1990
        (some two weeks after Russia had declared its own sovereignty), the
        March 1991 referendum held throughout the Soviet Union showed that 83
        percent of Belorussians wanted to preserve the Soviet Union.
        <p>Political change in Belarus came about only after the August 1991
        coup d'état in Moscow and a display of satisfaction by the Central
        Committee of the CPB at the coup attempt--it never issued a condemnation
        of the coup plotters. Following the coup's collapse and declarations of
        independence by Estonia, Latvia, and Ukraine, Belarus declared its own
        independence on August 25 by giving its declaration of sovereignty the
        status of a constitutional document. On August 28, Belarus's prime
        minister, Vyachaslaw Kyebich, declared that he and his entire cabinet
        had &quot;suspended&quot; their CPB membership. The next day, both the
        Russian and the Belarusian governments suspended the activities of the
        communist party.
        <p>Liberals and nationalist reformers used this period of political
        confusion to advance their cause. On September 18, the parliament
        dismissed its chairman, Mikalay Dzyemyantsyey, for siding with the coup
        and replaced him with his deputy, Stanislaw Shushkyevich. The next day,
        pressed by the small but vocal democratic opposition, the parliament
        changed the state's name from the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic
        to the Republic of Belarus. A new national flag (three horizontal
        stripes, white- red-white) was adopted, along with a new coat of arms (a
        mounted knight, St. George, Patron Saint of Belarus, with a drawn sword,
        the emblem of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). On December 8, Belarus
        joined Russia and Ukraine in signing the Minsk Agreement to form the CIS, which formally put an end to the Soviet Union.
        On December 21, Belarus signed the Alma-Ata Declaration, which expanded the CIS membership from the original three
        signatories of the Minsk Agreement to eleven states. And it was agreed
        that the headquarters of the CIS was to be in Minsk, a move that the
        government of Belarus welcomed as a means of attracting foreign
        attention.
        <p>The democratic opposition in the Supreme Soviet, led by the
        twenty-seven-member BPF faction and some of its allies, continued
        pressing for a referendum on the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet and
        for new elections. The electorate seemed to be responsive. More than
        442,000 signatures in support of the move were collected within three
        months, but the initiators had underestimated the conservativism of the
        Supreme Soviet.
        <p>Meeting in mid-October 1992 and encouraged by the electoral victory
        of former communists in Lithuania and growing resistance to President
        Boris N. Yeltsin's reforms in Russia, the Supreme Soviet solidly
        rejected the demand for a referendum. Claiming violations in the
        signature collection drive, 202 deputies voted against the referendum;
        only thirty-five deputies supported it, and another thirty-five
        abstained. In view of the fact that in May 1992 the Central Referendum
        Commission had validated 384,000 of the 442,000 signatures collected
        (exceeding the 350,000 signatures required by law), the BPF opposition
        accused the Supreme Soviet's conservative majority of an open violation
        of the republic's constitution and of an attempt to retain power by
        illegal means. Nonetheless, the opposition won a small victory in this
        tug-of-war: the parliament agreed to shorten its five-year term by one
        year and scheduled the next elections for the spring of 1994.
        <p>The Belarusian government headed by Prime Minister Kyebich consisted
        of former CPB functionaries and took a very conservative approach to
        economic and political reforms. Kyebich himself characterized his policy
        as &quot;traditional&quot; and warned about taking &quot;extreme&quot;
        positions.
        <p>Belarus's conservative Supreme Soviet continued to put obstacles in
        the path of reform. A privatization law was finally passed in July 1993,
        but it allowed collective and state farms to continue to exist and
        operate. Privatization of state-owned enterprises had barely begun in
        mid-1995, despite earlier efforts by Shushkyevich, who was largely a
        figurehead, to move along reform efforts. Conservative Kyebich, who
        actually controlled the ministries, was a temporary victor, when, in
        January 1994, he survived a no-confidence vote that ousted Shushkyevich
        and replaced him with a Kyebich crony, Myechyslaw Hryb.
        <p>In the meantime, the Supreme Soviet adopted a constitution that went
        into effect on March 30, 1994, and created the office of president, who
        would now be the head of government instead of the prime minister. A
        quickly organized election was held in June, and a runoff election
        between the two highest vote-getters was held in July; in a surprise
        result, Kyebich was soundly beaten by anticorruption crusader Alyaksandr
        Lukashyenka. Both Kyebich and Lukashyenka took pro-Russian stands on
        economic and political matters, and both supported a quick monetary
        union with Russia. Lukashyenka even called for outright unification with
        Russia, but it was his anticorruption stance that won him more than 80
        percent of the vote.
        <p>After Lukashyenka achieved his victory, the BPF granted him a
        three-month grace period during which it did not openly criticize his
        policies. Because his campaign promises had often been vague, he had
        great latitude within which to operate. And because Kyebich resigned
        after the election, taking his government with him, there were no
        problems in removing ministers.
        <p>Lukashyenka's presidency was one of contradictions from the start.
        His cabinet was composed of young, talented newcomers as well as Kyebich
        veterans who had not fully supported Kyebich. As a reward to the
        parliament for confirming his appointees, Lukashyenka supported the move
        to postpone the parliamentary elections until May 1995.
        <p>Lukashyenka's government was also plagued by corrupt members.
        Lukashyenka fired the minister of defense, the armed forces chief of
        staff, the head of the border guards, and the minister of forestry.
        Following resignations among reformists in Lukashyenka's cabinet,
        parliamentary deputy Syarhey Antonchyk read a report in parliament on
        December 20, 1994, about corruption in the administration. Although
        Lukashyenka refused to accept the resignations that followed, the
        government attempted to censor the report, fueling the opposition's
        criticism of Lukashyenka.
        <p>Lukashyenka went to Russia in August 1994 on his first official visit
        abroad as head of state. There he came to realize that Russia would not
        make any unusual efforts to accommodate Belarus, especially its economic
        needs. Nevertheless, Lukashyenka kept trying; in February 1995, Belarus
        signed the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation with Russia, making many
        concessions to Russia, such as allowing the stationing of Russian troops
        in Belarus, in hopes that Russia would return the favor by charging
        Belarus lower prices for fuels. However, because the treaty included no
        such provision, there was little hope of realizing this objective.
        <p>Lukashyenka had several disputes with parliament, mainly over the
        limits of presidential power (such as whether the president has the
        right to dissolve parliament). A hunger strike by opposition deputies,
        led by Zyanon Paznyak, began on April 11, 1995, after Lukashyenka
        proposed four questions for a referendum and then stated that the
        referendum would be held regardless of parliament's vote. The protest
        ended when the striking deputies, forcibly evicted in the middle of the
        night during a search for an alleged bomb, found that the national
        television and radio building had been cordoned off as well because of
        another alleged bomb threat. After this incident, the parliament gave in
        on a number of matters, including the four referendum questions, because
        word of their strike now could not be publicized.
        <p>The parliamentary elections held in May 1995 were less than
        successful or democratic. The restrictions placed on the mass media and
        on the candidates' expenditures during the campaign led to a shortage of
        information about the candidates and almost no political debate before
        the elections. In several cases, no one candidate received the necessary
        majority of the votes in the May 14 elections, prompting another round
        on May 28. The main problem in the second round was the lack of voter
        turnout. After the second round, parliament was in limbo because it had
        only 120 elected deputies--it was still short of the 174 members
        necessary to seat a new legislature. Another round of elections was
        discussed, probably near the end of the year, but the government claimed
        to have no money to finance them.</p>

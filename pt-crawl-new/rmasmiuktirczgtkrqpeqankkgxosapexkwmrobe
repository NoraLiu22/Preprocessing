Users search by location (address, city, zip code, or place name) to view point features on the interactive mapping visualization of traffic records. Clicking on a point of interest or grouping multiple points on the map yields traffic count information tables, which includes: Date of Counnt ; DVRPC File # ; Type ; Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) ; Municipality ; Route Number ; Road Name ; Count Direction ; and From/To Locations, as well as a link to the detailed (hourly) report. Data tables are exportable as .CSV and detailed reports are available for export in multiple formats (including basic .doc and .rtf outputs.) Traffic count data is collected by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and other agencies.</p>

             <p>Freight Data Portal for the Delaware Valley.</p>

<p>The Delaware Valley is a premier freight transportation gateway. It possesses one of the world’s busiest freshwater ports; rail freight service from two large Class I railroads and 12 smaller short lines; an airport with expanding international cargo services; an excellent highway and connector network; and numerous rail and port intermodal terminals.</p>

<p>The performance of this extraordinary network helps promote and support a thriving economy. PhillyFreightFinder is a resource for exploring and tracking the Philadelphia-Camden-Trenton regional freight network.</p>

<p>Open Freight App is a project by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) to share with regional and national transportation planning partners the framework that is the basis for the PhillyFreightFinder web mapping and data application. Through this effort, DVRPC hopes that county planning agencies, metropolitan planning organizations and state departments of transportation, and economic development agencies can leverage this framework to further their efforts in making freight transportation data public. By utilizing the Open Freight App framework, rather than building from scratch, planning agencies can focus their time and resources on the development of data sets that can serve to improve the access to information on freight facilities and their role in economic development and transportation across the country. Open Freight App would serve as a self-hosted solution to offer these datasets to other planners, economic developers, public officials, decision-makers and the general public.</p>

The direction is demarcated as either Northbound or Southbound. The directions are obviously not geographical references, but rather a reference to the old Reading and Pennsy Railroads. The key to understanding the direction is by using Suburban Station as a starting point: Any trains that move eastbound towards Market East are all considered Northbound; trains going from suburban t o 30th St are all Southbound. The path field describes more accurately the path of travel along various branches. Every regional stop is a valid parameter.

             <p>SEPTA SMS Transit enables users to request scheduled trip information via text message. Users subscribe to the service via text. After setting up an account, users can receive schedule information by texting the Stop ID number for a bus, trolley, or subway stop to 41411. They will receive a return text with information on the four next scheduled trips from that stop. Users can include the specific route designation in the text to receive information on a certain route if the stop serves multiple routes. In addition to using the SMS, there is also a simulator which people can use to experiment at no cost.
Finally, the SMS data can be accessed from an API.  The data returned by the API is currently text format, separated.  The API can be accessed in the format: https://www3.septa.org/sms/var1/var2/var3/var4/var5  <br />
[var1] = stop id <br /> [var2] = route id  OR  i/o for inbound/outbound <br /> [var3] = i/o for inbound/outbound only if route id is supplied <br /> [var4] = returns schedule times on or after specified date, format: MM/DD/YYYY. Defaults to current day. <br /> [var5] = returns schedule times on or after specified time, format: HH:mm:ss. Defaults to current time. <br /> <br /> Stops fall into one of three categories, here is an explanation with some sample links:</p>
<ol> <li>Stops with service provided by only one route, stop is not the first or last stop andall travel is in a single direction:
<br /><br />[https://www3.septa.org/sms/321](https://www3.septa.org/sms/321)<br /> Returns the next 4 scheduled trolleys (All Route 13) at Chester Ave &amp; 49th St.</li>
<li>Stops with service provided by multiple routes, but all travel is in one direction: <br /><br />
https://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/<br /> Returns the next 4 scheduled trolleys at 22nd St. Station. Note the results shows trolleys regardless or route.  To grep just a single route, for a multi-route, uni-directional stop, add another var: <br />
https://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/13/<br /> Returns only the Route 13 trolleys at 22nd St. Station</li>
<li>Stops with travel in multi-directions.  This is usually end points, like the trolley loop at Juniper and they may or may not have multiple routes. For example:<br />
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283 <br /> Returns the next 2 inbound and 2 outbound times for all routes
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283/13/<br /> Returns the next 2 inbound and 2 outbound times for only Route 13
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283/o <br /> Returns the next 4 outbound times for all routes
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283/13/o <br /> Returns the next 4 outbound times for only Route 13 </li>

             <h3><a href="/datasets/traffic-calming/">Traffic Calming Devices</a></h3>
             <p>Point-based dataset showing the approximate locations where Traffic Calming Devices exist in the street to reduce speeding of motor vehicles. Traffic Calming Devices examples are speed cushions, speed humps, and speed tables. These devices could be made of asphalt or rubber materials.</p>

             <h3><a href="/datasets/traffic-preventative-maintenance-districts/">Traffic Preventative Maintenance Districts</a></h3>
             <p>This layer was developed to aid the Traffic Division in planning, organizing, and maintaining traffic flow within the City of Philadelphia.  Examples include:  the maintenance and placing of stop signs and signals and monitoring street travel direction. This polygon layer has an accompanying arc layer. Certain arcs in the arc layer contain data signifying information relating it to the polygon layer. It can tell you if both sides of the arc belong to one of the bounding polygons.  All the arcs, including those with no boundary info, have naming attributes for labeling the polygon borders.  Contact the Streets GIS unit for public consumption of the corresponding arc layer.</p>

             <h3><a href="/datasets/walk-score-phila-only/">Walk Score (Phila. only)</a></h3>
             <p>An online application, which enables users to view calculated walkability ranks and related neighborhood metrics, such as proximity of nearby businesses, service providers, and recreational/outdoor spaces. Users can select geographic parameters (neighborhood names), or search for specific locations (addresses), to access mobility data, which is also visualized on a heat map tool with marked features. In addition to walkability, the application also gauges biking and transit scores, which measure the convenience/proximity to bikability and public transit opportunities. Users can also access walking, biking, and transit score through an API.  More information about the Walk Score is available <a href="https://www.redfin.com/how-walk-score-works">through Redfin</a>.</p>

    </span></b></a><b><span
lang=EN-GB>The Primal Chaos</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to speak about bodies 
    changed into new forms. You, gods, since you are the ones who alter these, 
    and all other things, inspire my attempt, and spin out a continuous thread 
    of words, from the world's first origins to my own time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before there was earth or sea 
    or the sky that covers everything, Nature appeared the same throughout the 
    whole world: what we call chaos: a raw confused mass, nothing but inert matter, 
    badly combined discordant atoms of things, confused in the one place. There 
    was no <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Titan','window90')">Titan</a> yet, shining his light 
    on the world, or waxing Phoebe renewing her white horns, or the earth hovering 
    in surrounding air balanced by her own weight, or watery <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Amphititre','window90')">Amphitrite</a> stretching out her arms along the 
    vast shores of the world. Though there was land and sea and air, it was unstable 
    land, unswimmable water, air needing light. Nothing retained its shape, one 
    thing obstructed another, because in the one body, cold fought with heat, 
    moist with dry, soft with hard, and weight with weightless things.</span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381089"></a><a name=Bkone21><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:21-31 
    </span></b></a><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Separation of the elements</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conflict was ended by a 
    god and a greater order of nature, since he split off the earth from the sky, 
    and the sea from the land, and divided the transparent heavens from the dense 
    air. When he had disentangled the elements, and freed them from the obscure 
    mass, he fixed them in separate spaces in harmonious peace. The weightless 
    fire, that forms the heavens, darted upwards to make its home in the furthest 
    heights. Next came air in lightness and place. Earth, heavier than either 
    of these, drew down the largest elements, and was compressed by its own weight. 
    The surrounding water took up the last space and enclosed the solid world. 
    </span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381090"></a><a name=Bkone32><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:32-51 
    </span></b></a><b><span
lang=EN-GB>The earth and sea. The five zones.</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When whichever god it was had 
    ordered and divided the mass, and collected it into separate parts, he first 
    gathered the earth into a great ball so that it was uniform on all sides. 
    Then he ordered the seas to spread and rise in waves in the flowing winds 
    and pour around the coasts of the encircled land. He added springs and standing 
    pools and lakes, and contained in shelving banks the widely separated rivers, 
    some of which are swallowed by the earth itself, others of which reach the 
    sea and entering the expanse of open waters beat against coastlines instead 
    of riverbanks. He ordered the plains to extend, the valleys to subside, leaves 
    to hide the trees, stony mountains to rise: and just as the heavens are divided 
    into two zones to the north and two to the south, with a fifth and hotter 
    between them, so the god carefully marked out the enclosed matter with the 
    same number, and described as many regions on the earth. The equatorial zone 
    is too hot to be habitable; the two poles are covered by deep snow; and he 
    placed two regions between and gave them a temperate climate mixing heat and 
    cold.  </span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381091"></a><a name=Bkone52><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:52-68 
    </span></b></a><b><span
lang=EN-GB>The four winds</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air overhangs them, heavier than 
    fire by as much as water’s weight is lighter than earth. There he ordered 
    the clouds and vapours to exist, and thunder to shake the minds of human beings, 
    and winds that create lightning-bolts and flashes. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world’s maker did not allow 
    these, either, to possess the air indiscriminately; as it is they are scarcely 
    prevented from tearing the world apart, each with its blasts steering a separate 
    course: like the discord between brothers. <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Eurus','window90')">Eurus</a>, the east wind, drew back to the realms 
    of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Aurora','window90')">Aurora</a>, to Nabatea, Persia, and the 
    heights under the morning light: Evening, and the coasts that cool in the 
    setting sun, are close to <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Zephyrus','window90')">Zephyrus</a>, 
    the west wind. Chill <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Boreas','window90')">Boreas</a>, the north 
    wind, seized <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Scythia','window90')">Scythia</a> and the seven 
    stars of the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Plough','window90')">Plough</a>: while the south wind, 
    <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Auster','window90')">Auster</a>, drenches the lands opposite with incessant 
    clouds and rain. Above these he placed the transparent, weightless heavens 
    free of the dross of earth.</span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381092"></a><a name=Bkone68><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:68-88 
    </span></b></a><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Humankind</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had barely separated out everything 
    within fixed limits when the constellations that had been hidden for a long 
    time in dark fog began to blaze out throughout the whole sky. And so that 
    no region might lack its own animate beings, the stars and the forms of gods 
    occupied the floor of heaven, the sea gave a home to the shining fish, earth 
    took the wild animals, and the light air flying things. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As yet there was no animal capable 
    of higher thought that could be ruler of all the rest. Then Humankind was 
    born. Either the creator god, source of a better world, seeded it from the 
    divine, or the newborn earth just drawn from the highest heavens still contained 
    fragments related to the skies, so that <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Prometheus','window90')">Prometheus</a>, blending them with streams of 
    rain, moulded them into an image of the all-controlling gods. While other 
    animals look downwards at the ground, he gave human beings an upturned aspect, 
    commanding them to look towards the skies, and, upright, raise their face 
    to the stars. So the earth, that had been, a moment ago, uncarved and imageless, 
    changed and assumed the unknown shapes of human beings. </span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381093"></a><a name=Bkone89><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:89-112 
    </span></b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB>The Golden Age</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the Golden Age that, 
    without coercion, without laws, spontaneously nurtured the good and the true. 
    There was no fear or punishment: there were no threatening words to be read, 
    fixed in bronze, no crowd of suppliants fearing the judge’s face: they lived 
    safely without protection. No pine tree felled in the mountains had yet reached 
    the flowing waves to travel to other lands: human beings only knew their own 
    shores. There were no steep ditches surrounding towns, no straight war-trumpets, 
    no coiled horns, no swords and helmets. Without the use of armies, people 
    passed their lives in gentle peace and security. The earth herself also, freely, 
    without the scars of ploughs, untouched by hoes, produced everything from 
    herself. Contented with food that grew without cultivation, they collected 
    mountain strawberries and the fruit of the strawberry tree, wild cherries, 
    blackberries clinging to the tough brambles, and acorns fallen from <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iupitter','window90')">Jupiter</a>’s spreading oak-tree. Spring was 
    eternal, and gentle breezes caressed with warm air the flowers that grew without 
    being seeded. Then the untilled earth gave of its produce and, without needing 
    renewal, the fields whitened with heavy ears of corn. Sometimes rivers of 
    milk flowed, sometimes streams of nectar, and golden honey trickled from the 
    green holm oak.</span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381094"></a><a name=Bkone113><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:113-124 
    </span></b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB>The Silver Age</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Saturn','window90')">Saturn</a> was banished to gloomy <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Tartarus','window90')">Tartarus</a>, and <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iupitter','window90')">Jupiter</a> ruled the world, then came the people 
    of the age of silver that is inferior to gold, more valuable than yellow bronze. 
    Jupiter shortened spring’s first duration and made the year consist of four 
    seasons, winter, summer, changeable autumn, and brief spring. Then parched 
    air first glowed white scorched with the heat, and ice hung down frozen by 
    the wind. Then houses were first made for shelter: before that homes had been 
    made in caves, and dense thickets, or under branches fastened with bark. Then 
    seeds of corn were first buried in the long furrows, and bullocks groaned, 
    burdened under the yoke. </span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381095"></a><a name=Bkone125><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:125-150 
    </span></b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB>The Bronze Age</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third came the people of the 
    bronze age, with fiercer natures, readier to indulge in savage warfare, but 
    not yet vicious. The harsh iron age was last. Immediately every kind of wickedness 
    erupted into this age of baser natures: truth, shame and honour vanished; 
    in their place were fraud, deceit, and trickery, violence and pernicious desires. 
    They set sails to the wind, though as yet the seamen had poor knowledge of 
    their use, and the ships’ keels that once were trees standing amongst high 
    mountains, now leaped through uncharted waves. The land that was once common 
    to all, as the light of the sun is, and the air, was marked out, to its furthest 
    boundaries, by wary surveyors. Not only did they demand the crops and the 
    food the rich soil owed them, but they entered the bowels of the earth, and 
    excavating brought up the wealth it had concealed in <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Styx','window90')">Stygian</a> shade, wealth that incites men to 
    crime. And now harmful iron appeared, and gold more harmful than iron.   War 
    came, whose struggles employ both, waving clashing arms with bloodstained 
    hands. They lived on plunder: friend was not safe with friend, relative with 
    relative, kindness was rare between brothers. Husbands longed for the death 
    of their wives, wives for the death of their husbands. Murderous stepmothers 
    mixed deadly aconite, and sons inquired into their father’s years before their 
    time. Piety was dead, and virgin <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Astrea','window90')">Astraea</a>, 
    last of all the immortals to depart, herself abandoned the blood-drenched 
    earth. </span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381096"></a><a name=Bkone151><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:151-176 
    </span></b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB>The giants</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rendering the heights of heaven 
    no safer than the earth, they say the giants attempted to take the Celestial 
    kingdom, piling mountains up to the distant stars. Then the all-powerful father 
    of the gods hurled his bolt of lightning, fractured <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Olympus','window90')">Olympus</a> and threw Mount <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Pelion','window90')">Pelion</a> down from <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Ossa','window90')">Ossa</a> 
    below. Her sons’ dreadful bodies, buried by that mass, drenched Earth with 
    streams of blood, and they say she warmed it to new life, so that a trace 
    of her children might remain, transforming it into the shape of human beings. 
    But these progeny also despising the gods were savage, violent, and eager 
    for slaughter, so that you might know they were born from blood. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Saturn’s son, the father 
    of the gods, saw this from his highest citadel, he groaned, and recalling 
    the vile feast at <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Lycaon','window90')">Lycaon</a>’s table, so 
    recent it was still unknown, his mind filled with a great anger fitting for 
    Jupiter, and he called the gods to council, a summons that brooked no delay.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high track, seen when 
    the sky is clear, called the Milky Way, and known for its brightness. This 
    way the gods pass to the palaces and halls of the mighty Thunderer. To right 
    and left are the houses of the greater gods, doors open and crowded. The lesser 
    gods live elsewhere. Here the powerful and distinguished have made their home. 
    This is the place, if I were to be bold, I would not be afraid to call high 
    heaven’s <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Palatium','window90')">Palatine</a>.</span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381097"></a><a name=Bkone177><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:177-198 
    </span></b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB>Jupiter threatens to destroy humankind</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gods had taken 
    their seats in the marble council chamber their king, sitting high above them, 
    leaning on his ivory sceptre, shook his formidable mane three times and then 
    a fourth, disturbing the earth, sea and stars. Then he opened his lips in 
    indignation and spoke. ‘I was not more troubled than I am now concerning the 
    world’s sovereignty than when each of the snake-footed giants prepared to 
    throw his hundred arms around the imprisoned sky. Though they were fierce 
    enemies, still their attack came in one body and from one source. Now I must 
    destroy the human race, wherever <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Nereus','window90')">Nereus</a> 
    sounds, throughout the world. I swear it by the infernal streams, that glide 
    below the earth through the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Styx','window90')">Stygian</a> 
    groves. All means should first be tried, but the incurable flesh must be excised 
    by the knife, so that the healthy part is not infected. Mine are the demigods, 
    the wild spirits, <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Nymphae','window90')">nymphs</a>, <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Fauni','window90')">fauns</a> and <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Satyri','window90')">satyrs</a>, and sylvan deities of the hills. 
    Since we have not yet thought them worth a place in heaven let us at least 
    allow them to live in safety in the lands we have given them. Perhaps you 
    gods believe they will be safe, even when <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Lycaon','window90')">Lycaon</a>, 
    known for his savagery, plays tricks against me, who holds the thunderbolt, 
    and reigns over you.’ </span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381098"></a><a name=Bkone199><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:199-243 
    </span></b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB>Lycaon is turned into a wolf</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gods murmured aloud and, 
    zealously and eagerly, demanded punishment of the man who committed such actions. 
    When the impious band of conspirators were burning to drown the name of Rome 
    in Caesar’s blood, the human race was suddenly terrified by fear of just such 
    a disaster, and the whole world shuddered with horror. Your subjects’ loyalty 
    is no less pleasing to you, Augustus, than theirs was to <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iupitter','window90')">Jupiter</a>. After he had checked their murmuring 
    with voice and gesture, they were all silent. When the noise had subsided, 
    quieted by his royal authority, Jupiter again broke the silence with these 
    words: ‘Have no fear, he has indeed been punished, but I will tell you his 
    crime, and what the penalty was. News of these evil times had reached my ears. 
    Hoping it false I left <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Olympus','window90')">Olympus</a>’s heights, 
    and travelled the earth, a god in human form. It would take too long to tell 
    what wickedness I found everywhere. Those rumours were even milder than the 
    truth. I had crossed <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Maenalos','window90')">Maenala</a>, those 
    mountains bristling with wild beasts’ lairs, <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Cyllene','window90')">Cyllene</a>, 
    and the pinewoods of chill <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Lycaeus','window90')">Lycaeus</a>. 
    Then, as the last shadows gave way to night, I entered the inhospitable house 
    of the Arcadian king. I gave them signs that a god had come, and the people 
    began to worship me. At first <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Lycaon','window90')">Lycaon</a> 
    ridiculed their piety, then exclaimed ‘I will prove by a straightforward test 
    whether he is a god or a mortal. The truth will not be in doubt.’ He planned 
    to destroy me in the depths of sleep, unexpectedly, by night. That is how 
    he resolved to prove the truth. Not satisfied with this he took a hostage 
    sent by the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Molossus','window90')">Molossi</a>, opened his throat with a knife, and 
    made some of the still warm limbs tender in seething water, roasting others 
    in the fire. No sooner were these placed on the table than I brought the roof 
    down on the household gods, with my avenging flames, those gods worthy of 
    such a master. He himself ran in terror, and reaching the silent fields howled 
    aloud, frustrated of speech. Foaming at the mouth, and greedy as ever for 
    killing, he turned against the sheep, still delighting in blood. His clothes 
    became bristling hair, his arms became legs. He was a wolf, but kept some 
    vestige of his former shape. There were the same grey hairs, the same violent 
    face, the same glittering eyes, the same savage image. One house has fallen, 
    but others deserve to also. Wherever the earth extends the avenging furies 
    rule. You would think men were sworn to crime! Let them all pay the penalty 
    they deserve, and quickly. That is my intent.’</span></p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had spoken, some of the 
    gods encouraged <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iupitter','window90')">Jupiter</a>’s anger, 
    shouting their approval of his words, while others consented silently. They 
    were all saddened though at this destruction of the human species, and questioned 
    what the future of the world would be free of humanity. Who would honour their 
    altars with incense? Did he mean to surrender the world to the ravages of 
    wild creatures? In answer the king of the gods calmed their anxiety, the rest 
    would be his concern, and he promised them a people different from the first, 
    of a marvellous creation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he was ready to hurl his 
    lightning-bolts at the whole world but feared that the sacred heavens might 
    burst into flame from the fires below, and burn to the furthest pole: and 
    he remembered that a time was fated to come when sea and land, and the untouched 
    courts of the skies would ignite, and the troubled mass of the world be besieged 
    by fire. So he set aside the weapons the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Cyclopes','window90')">Cyclopes</a> forged, and resolved on a different 
    punishment, to send down rain from the whole sky and drown humanity beneath 
    the waves.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight away he shut up the 
    north winds in <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Aeolus','window90')">Aeolus</a>’s caves, with the 
    gales that disperse the gathering clouds, and let loose the south wind, he 
    who flies with dripping wings, his terrible aspect shrouded in pitch-black 
    darkness. His beard is heavy with rain, water streams from his grey hair, 
    mists wreathe his forehead, and his feathers and the folds of his robes distil 
    the dew. When he crushes the hanging clouds in his outstretched hand there 
    is a crash, and the dense vapours pour down rain from heaven. <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iris','window90')">Iris</a>, <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iuno','window90')">Juno</a>’s

    the crops, the object of their prayers, are ruined, and the long year’s labour 
    wasted. </span></p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iupitter','window90')">Jupiter</a>’s anger is not satisfied with only 
    his own aerial waters: his brother the sea-god helps him, with the ocean waves. 
    He calls the rivers to council, and when they have entered their ruler’s house, 
    says ‘Now is not the time for long speeches! Exert all your strength. That 
    is what is needed. Throw open your doors, drain the dams, and loose the reins 
    of all your streams!’ Those are his commands. The rivers return and uncurb 
    their fountains’ mouths, and race an unbridled course to the sea. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Neptunus','window90')">Neptune</a> himself strikes the ground with his 
    trident, so that it trembles, and with that blow opens up channels for the 
    waters. Overflowing, the rivers rush across the open plains, sweeping away 
    at the same time not just orchards, flocks, houses and human beings, but sacred 
    temples and their contents. Any building that has stood firm, surviving the 
    great disaster undamaged, still has its roof drowned by the highest waves, 
    and its towers buried below the flood.  And now the land and sea are not distinct, 
    all is the sea, the sea without a shore.</span></p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There one man escapes to a hilltop, 
    while another seated in his rowing boat pulls the oars over places where lately 
    he was ploughing. One man sails over his cornfields or over the roof of his 
    drowned farmhouse, while another man fishes in the topmost branches of an 
    elm. Sometimes, by chance, an anchor embeds itself in a green meadow, or the 
    curved boats graze the tops of vineyards. Where lately lean goats browsed 
    shapeless seals play. The <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Nereids','window90')">Nereids</a> are 
    astonished to see woodlands, houses and whole towns under the water. There 
    are dolphins in the trees: disturbing the upper branches and stirring the 
    oak-trees as they brush against them. Wolves swim among the sheep, and the 
    waves carry tigers and tawny lions. The boar has no use for his powerful tusks, 
    the deer for its quick legs, both are swept away together, and the circling 
    bird, after a long search for a place to land, falls on tired wings into the 
    water. The sea in unchecked freedom has buried the hills, and fresh waves 
    beat against the mountaintops. The waters wash away most living things, and 
    those the sea spares, lacking food, are defeated by slow starvation.</span></p>

    goddess of the oracles, prophetic <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Themis','window90')">Themis</a>. 
    No one was more virtuous or fonder of justice than he was, and no woman showed 
    greater reverence for the gods. When <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iupitter','window90')">Jupiter</a> 
    saw the earth covered with the clear waters, and that only one man was left 
    of all those thousands of men, only one woman left of all those thousands 
    of women, both innocent and both worshippers of the gods, he scattered the 
    clouds and mist, with the north wind, and revealed the heavens to the earth 
    and the earth to the sky.  It was no longer an angry sea, since the king of 
    the oceans putting aside his three-pronged spear calmed the waves, and called 
    sea-dark <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Triton','window90')">Triton</a>, showing from the depths his shoulders 
    thick with shells, to blow into his echoing conch and give the rivers and 
    streams the signal to return. He lifted the hollow shell that coils from its 
    base in broad spirals, that shell that filled with his breath in mid-ocean 
    makes the eastern and the western shores sound. So now when it touched the 
    god’s mouth, and dripping beard, and sounded out the order for retreat, it 
    was heard by all the waters on earth and in the ocean, and all the waters 
    hearing it were checked. Now the sea has shorelines, the brimming rivers keep 
    to their channels, the floods subside, and hills appear. Earth rises, the

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was restored. 
    But when <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Deucalion','window90')">Deucalion</a> saw its emptiness, 
    and the deep silence of the desolate lands, he spoke to <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Pyrrha','window90')">Pyrrha</a>, through welling tears. ‘Wife, cousin, 
    sole surviving woman, joined to me by our shared race, our family origins, 
    then by the marriage bed, and now joined to me in danger, we two are the people 
    of all the countries seen by the setting and the rising sun, the sea took 
    all the rest. Even now our lives are not guaranteed with certainty: the storm 
    clouds still terrify my mind. How would you feel now, poor soul, if the fates 
    had willed you to be saved, but not me? How could you endure your fear alone? 
    Who would comfort your tears? Believe me, dear wife, if the sea had you, I 
    would follow you, and the sea would have me too. If only I, by my father’s 
    arts, could recreate earth’s peoples, and breathe life into the shaping clay! 
    The human race remains in us. The gods willed it that we are the only examples 
    of mankind left behind.’ He spoke and they wept, resolving to appeal to the 
    sky-god, and ask his help by sacred oracles. Immediately they went side by 
    side to the springs of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Cephisus','window90')">Cephisus</a> that, 
    though still unclear, flowed in its usual course. When they had sprinkled 
    their heads and clothing with its watery libations, they traced their steps 
    to the temple of the sacred goddess, whose pediments were green with disfiguring 
    moss, her altars without fire. When they reached the steps of the sanctuary 
    they fell forward together and lay prone on the ground, and kissing the cold 
    rock with trembling lips, said ‘If the gods wills soften, appeased by the 
    prayers of the just, if in this way their anger can be deflected, <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Themis','window90')">Themis</a> tell us by what art the damage to 
    our race can be repaired, and bring help, most gentle one, to this drowned 
    world!’ </span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381104"></a><a name=Bkone381><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:381-415 
    </span></b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB>The human race is re-created</span></b></h4>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess was moved, and 
    uttered oracular speech: ‘Leave the temple and with veiled heads and loosened 
    clothes throw behind you the bones of your great mother!’ For a long time 
    they stand there, dumbfounded. <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Pyrrha','window90')">Pyrrha</a> 
    is first to break the silence: she refuses to obey the goddess’s command. 
    Her lips trembling she asks for pardon, fearing to offend her mother’s spirit 
    by scattering her bones. Meanwhile they reconsider the dark words the oracle 
    gave, and their uncertain meaning, turning them over and over in their minds. 
    Then <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Prometheus','window90')">Prometheus</a>’s son comforted <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Epimetheus','window90')">Epimetheus</a>’s daughter with quiet words: 
    ‘Either this idea is wrong, or, since oracles are godly and never urge evil, 
    our great mother must be the earth: I think the bones she spoke about are 
    stones in the body of the earth. It is these we are told to throw behind us.’</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Titan','window90')">Titan</a>’s daughter is stirred by her husband’s 
    thoughts, still hope is uncertain: they are both so unsure of the divine promptings; 
    but what harm can it do to try? They descended the steps, covered their heads 
    and loosened their clothes, and threw the stones needed behind them. The stones, 
    and who would believe it if it were not for ancient tradition, began to lose 
    their rigidity and hardness, and after a while softened, and once softened 
    acquired new form. Then after growing, and ripening in nature, a certain likeness 
    to a human shape could be vaguely seen, like marble statues at first inexact 
    and roughly carved. The earthy part, however, wet with moisture, turned to 
    flesh; what was solid and inflexible mutated to bone; the veins stayed veins; 
    and quickly, through the power of the gods, stones the man threw took on the 
    shapes of men, and women were remade from those thrown by the woman.  So the 
    toughness of our race, our ability to endure hard labour, and the proof we 
    give of the source from which we are sprung.</span></p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth spontaneously created 
    other diverse forms of animal life. After the remaining moisture had warmed 
    in the sun’s fire, the wet mud of the marshlands swelled with heat, and the 
    fertile seeds of things, nourished by life-giving soil as if in a mother’s 
    womb, grew, and in time acquired a nature. So, when the seven-mouthed <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Nilus','window90')">Nile</a> retreats from the drowned fields and returns 
    to its former bed, and the fresh mud boils in the sun, farmers find many creatures 
    as they turn the lumps of earth. Amongst them they see some just spawned, 
    on the edge of life, some with incomplete bodies and number of limbs, and 
    often in the same matter one part is alive and the other is raw earth. In 
    fact when heat and moisture are mixed they conceive, and from these two things 
    the whole of life originates. And though fire and water fight each other, 
    heat and moisture create everything, and this discordant union is suitable 
    for growth. So when the earth muddied from the recent flood glowed again heated 
    by the deep heaven-sent light of the sun she produced innumerable species, 
    partly remaking previous forms, partly creating new monsters.</span></p>

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, though she would

    slopes, a snake not known before, a terror to the new race of men. The archer 
    god, with lethal shafts that he had only used before on fleeing red deer and 
    roe deer, with a thousand arrows, almost emptying his quiver, destroyed the 
    creature, the venom running out from its black wounds. Then he founded the 
    sacred <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Python','window90')">Pythian</a> games, celebrated by contests, 
    named from the serpent he had conquered. There the young winners in boxing,

    as yet, so <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Phoebus','window90')">Phoebus</a> crowned his temples, 
    his handsome curling hair, with leaves of any tree.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phoebus’s first love was <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Daphne','window90')">Daphne</a>, 
    daughter of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Peneus','window90')">Peneus</a>, and not through chance but because of 
    <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Cupid','window90')">Cupid</a>’s fierce anger. Recently the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Delos','window90')">Delian</a> god, exulting at his victory over the 
    serpent, had seen him bending his tightly strung bow and said ‘Impudent boy, 
    what are you doing with a man’s weapons? That one is suited to my shoulders, 
    since I can hit wild beasts of a certainty, and wound my enemies, and not 
    long ago destroyed with countless arrows the swollen Python that covered many 
    acres with its plague-ridden belly. You should be intent on stirring the concealed 
    fires of love with your burning brand, not laying claim to my glories!’ <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Venus','window90')">Venus</a>’s son replied ‘You may hit every other

    you: to the degree that all living creatures are less than gods, by that degree

    beating wings, he landed on the shady peak of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Parnassus','window90')">Parnassus</a>, and took two arrows with opposite 
    effects from his full quiver: one kindles love, the other dispels it. The 
    one that kindles is golden with a sharp glistening point, the one that dispels 
    is blunt with lead beneath its shaft. With the second he transfixed <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Peneus','window90')">Peneus</a>’s daughter, but with the first he wounded

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the one loved, and the other fled

    of the wild beasts she caught, emulating virgin <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Phoebe','window90')">Phoebe</a>, a careless ribbon holding back her hair. 
    Many courted her, but she, averse to being wooed, free from men and unable 
    to endure them, roamed the pathless woods, careless of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Hymen','window90')">Hymen</a> or <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Amor','window90')">Amor</a>, 
    or whatever marriage might be. Her father often said ‘Girl you owe me a son-in-law’, 
    and again often  ‘Daughter, you owe me grandsons.’ But, hating the wedding 
    torch as if it smacked of crime she would blush red with shame all over her 
    beautiful face, and clinging to her father’s neck with coaxing arms, she would 
    say ‘ Dearest father, let me be a virgin for ever! <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Diana','window90')">Diana</a>’s father granted it to her.’ He yields 
    to that plea, but your beauty itself, <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Daphne','window90')">Daphne</a>, 
    prevents your wish, and your loveliness opposes your prayer.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Phoebus','window90')">Phoebus</a> loves her at first sight, and desires 
    to wed her, and hopes for what he desires, but his own oracular powers fail 
    him. As the light stubble of an empty cornfield blazes; as sparks fire a hedge 
    when a traveller, by mischance, lets them get too close, or forgets them in 
    the morning; so the god was altered by the flames, and all his heart burned, 
    feeding his useless desire with hope. He sees her disordered hair hanging 
    about her neck and sighs ‘What if it were properly dressed?’ He gazes at her 
    eyes sparkling with the brightness of starlight. He gazes on her lips, where mere gazing does not satisfy. He praises her wrists and 
    hands and fingers, and her arms bare to the shoulder: whatever is hidden, 
    he imagines more beautiful. But she flees swifter than the lightest breath 
    of air, and resists his words calling her back again.</span></p>

    the light airs threw her streaming hair behind her, her beauty enhanced by 
    flight. But the young god could no longer waste time on further blandishments, 
    urged on by <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Amor','window90')">Amor</a>, he ran on at full speed. 
    Like a hound of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Gaul','window90')">Gaul</a> starting a hare 
    in an empty field, that heads for its prey, she for safety: he, seeming about 
    to clutch her, thinks now, or now, he has her fast, grazing her heels with 
    his outstretched jaws, while she uncertain whether she is already caught, 
    escaping his bite, spurts from the muzzle touching her. So the virgin and 
    the god: he driven by desire, she by fear. He ran faster, Amor giving him 
    wings, and allowed her no rest, hung on her fleeing shoulders, breathed on 
    the hair flying round her neck. Her strength was gone, she grew pale, overcome 
    by the effort of her rapid flight, and seeing Peneus’s waters near cried out 
    ‘Help me father! If your streams have divine powers change me, destroy this 
    beauty that pleases too well!’ Her prayer was scarcely done when a heavy numbness 
    seized her limbs, thin bark closed over her breast, her hair turned into leaves, 
    her arms into branches, her feet so swift a moment ago stuck fast in slow-growing 
    roots, her face was lost in the canopy. Only her shining beauty was left.</span></p>

    not by any lesser god, but by the one who holds the sceptre of heaven in his

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iuno','window90')">Juno</a> 
    looked down into the heart of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Argos','window90')">Argos</a>, surprised that rapid mists had created night

    not find him in the skies, she said ‘Either I am wrong, or being wronged’ 
    and gliding down from heaven’s peak, she stood on earth ordering the clouds

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though her rival was

    and afraid of his trickery, until she had given <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Io','window90')">Io</a>

    that took their rest two at a time in succession while the others kept watch 
    and stayed on guard. Wherever he stood he was looking at Io, and had Io in 
    front of his eyes when his back was turned. He let her graze in the light, 
    but when the sun sank below the earth, he penned her, and fastened a rope 
    round her innocent neck. She grazed on the leaves of trees and bitter herbs. 
    She often lay on the bare ground, and the poor thing drank water from muddy 
    streams. When she wished to stretch her arms out to Argus in supplication, 
    she had no arms to stretch. Trying to complain, a lowing came from her mouth, 
    and she was alarmed and frightened by the sound of her own voice. When she 
    came to <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Inachus','window90')">Inachus</a>’s riverbanks where she often used 
    to play and saw her gaping mouth and her new horns in the water, she grew 
    frightened and fled terrified of herself.</span></p>
  <h4><a name="488381115"></a><a name=Bkone642><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bk I:642-667

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Naiades','window90')">naiads</a> 
    did not know her: <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Inachus','window90')">Inachus</a> himself did not know her, but she 
    followed her father, followed her sisters, allowing herself to be petted, 
    and offering herself to be admired. Old Inachus pulled some grasses and held 
    them out to her: she licked her father’s hand and kissed his palm, could not 
    hold back her tears, and if only words could have come she would have begged 
    for help, telling her name and her distress. With letters drawn in the dust 
    with her hoof, instead of words, she traced the sad story of her changed form. 
    ‘Pity me!’ said her father Inachus, clinging to the groaning heifer’s horns 
    and snow-white neck, ‘Pity me!’ he sighed; ‘Are you really my daughter I searched 
    the wide world for? There was less sadness with you lost than found! Without 
    speech, you do not answer in words to mine, only heave deep sighs from your 
    breast, and all you can do is low in reply to me.  Unknowingly I was arranging 
    marriage and a marriage-bed for you, hoping for a son-in-law first and then 
    grandchildren. Now you must find a mate from the herd, and from the herd get 
    you a son. I am not allowed by dying to end such sorrow; it is hard to be 
    a god, the door of death closed to me, my grief goes on immortal for ever.’ 
    As he mourned, Argus with his star-like eyes drove her to distant pastures, 
    dragging her out of her father’s arms. There, sitting at a distance he occupied 
    a high peak of the mountain, where resting he could keep a watch on every 
    side. </span></p>

    father’s stronghold. There he takes off his cap, and doffs his wings, only 
    keeping his wand. Taking this, disguised as a shepherd, he drives she-goats, 
    stolen on the way, through solitary lanes, and plays his reed pipe as he goes. 
    <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iuno','window90')">Juno</a>’s guard is captivated by this new sound. 
    ‘You there, whoever you are’ Argus calls ‘you could sit here beside me on

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descendant of <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Atlas','window90')">Atlas</a> 
    sits down, and passes the day in conversation, talking of many things, and 
    playing on his reed pipe, trying to conquer those watching eyes. Argus however 
    fights to overcome gentle sleep, and though he allows some of his eyes to 
    close, the rest stay vigilant. He even asks, since the reed pipe has only

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the god explained 
    ‘On <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Arcadia','window90')">Arcadia</a>’s cold mountain slopes among 
    the wood nymphs, the hamadryads, of Mount <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Nonacria','window90')">Nonacris</a>, one was the most celebrated: the 
    nymphs called her <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Syrinx','window90')">Syrinx</a>. She had 
    often escaped from the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Satyri','window90')">satyrs</a> chasing 
    her, and from others of the demi-gods that live in shadowy woods and fertile 
    fields. But she followed the worship of the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Ortygia','window90')">Ortygian</a> 
    goddess in staying virgin. Her dress caught up like <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Diana','window90')">Diana</a> she deceives the eye, and could be mistaken 
    for <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Latona','window90')">Leto</a>’s daughter, except that her 
    bow is of horn, and the other’s is of gold. Even so she is deceptive. <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexOP.htm#Pan','window90')">Pan</a>, whose head is crowned with a wreath of sharp 
    pine shoots, saw her, coming from Mount <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Lycaeus','window90')">Lycaeus</a>, 
    and spoke to her.’ Now Mercury still had to relate what Pan said, and how 
    the nymph, despising his entreaties, ran through the wilds till she came to 
    the calm waters of sandy <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Ladon','window90')">Ladon</a>; and how 
    when the river stopped her flight she begged her sisters of the stream to 
    change her; and how Pan, when he thought he now had Syrinx, found that instead 
    of the nymph’s body he only held reeds from the marsh; and, while he sighed 
    there, the wind in the reeds, moving, gave out a clear, plaintive sound. Charmed 
    by this new art and its sweet tones the god said ‘This way of communing with 
    you is still left to me’ So unequal lengths of reed, joined together with 
    wax, preserved the girl’s name.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About to tell all this, 
    <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Cyllene','window90')">Cyllenian</a> Mercury saw that every eye 
    had succumbed and their light was lost in sleep. Quickly he stops speaking 
    and deepens their rest, caressing those drowsy eyes with touches of his magic 
    wand. Then straightaway he strikes the nodding head, where it joins the neck, 
    with his curved sword, and sends it bloody down the rocks, staining the steep 
    cliff. <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Argus','window90')">Argus</a>, you are overthrown, the light 
    of your many eyes is extinguished, and one dark sleeps under so many eyelids.</span></p>

    she blazed with anger, and did not hold back from its consequences. She set 
    a terrifying <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Erinys','window90')">Fury</a> in front of the eyes 
    and mind of that ‘slut’ from the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexA.htm#Argolis','window90')">Argolis</a>, 
    buried a tormenting restlessness in her breast, and drove her as a fugitive 
    through the world. You, <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Nilus','window90')">Nile</a>, put an end 
    to her immeasurable suffering. When she reached you, she fell forward onto 
    her knees on the riverbank and turning back her long neck with her face upwards, 
    in the only way she could, looked to the sky, and with groans and tears and 
    sad lowing seemed to reproach <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexEFGHI.htm#Iupitter','window90')">Jupiter</a> 
    and beg him to end her troubles. Jupiter threw his arms round his wife’s neck 
    and pleaded for an end to vengeance, saying ‘Do not fear, in future she will 
    never be a source of pain’ and he called the <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexQRSTUVXZ.htm#Styx','window90')">Stygian</a> 
    waters to witness his words. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the goddess grows

    and becomes what she once was. The rough hair leaves her body, the horns disappear, 
    the great eyes grow smaller, the gaping mouth shrinks, the shoulders and hands 
    return, and the hooves vanish, each hoof changing back into five nails. Nothing 
    of the heifer is left except her whiteness. Able to stand on two feet she 
    raises herself erect and fearing to speak in case she lows like a heifer, 
    timidly attempts long neglected words.</span></p>

    went to his mother <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexBCD.htm#Clymene','window90')">Clymene</a> with Inachus’s 
    reproof. ‘To sadden you more, mother, I the free, proud, spirit was silent! 
    I am ashamed that such a reproach can be spoken and not answered. But if I 
    am born at all of divine stock, give me some proof of my high birth, and let

    entreating her, by his own and her husband <a href="javascript:newwindow('MetindexLMN.htm#Merops','window90')">Merops</a>’s

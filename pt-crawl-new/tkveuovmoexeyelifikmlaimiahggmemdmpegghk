<p><strong>Section 26 GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION/ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</strong></p>
<p>26.1<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><u>Applicable Law</u></strong>: You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and the Policies and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between You and the Company, except as otherwise stated in the Policies.</p>
<p>26.2<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><u>Agreement to Arbitrate</u></strong>: Except for any claim for emergency injunctive relief, any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between You and the Company relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the Agreement, Your use of or access to Member Benefits, Premium Services, or membership shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate under procedures as set forth herein.</p>
<p>26.3<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><u>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</u>: YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER MEMBERS.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to Your and the Company’s right to appeal the court’s decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>
<p>26.4<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><u>Arbitration Procedures</u></strong>: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of this Agreement, and/or the Policies as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 26.3, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word “arbitrator” in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over arbitration; rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
<p>A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. In the event the Company initiates arbitration against You, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with Your membership. Any settlement offer made by You or the Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>
<p>The arbitration hearing shall be held in New York County, New York. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, You or the Company may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on You and the Company subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.

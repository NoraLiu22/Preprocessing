<h4><a id="5-sharing-of-information" href="#5-sharing-of-information">5. Sharing of Information</a></h4>
<p>With respect to personal data we are controllers of, we may share or disclose the data under the following circumstances, or as otherwise described in this Policy:</p>
<ul>
 <li><u>Within the Spotify group of companies</u>. We may share your personal data with Spotify affiliates to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Services and our affiliates' products and services.</li>
 <li><u>Service Providers</u>. We may share your information with our agents and service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as to host our Services, manage databases, or send communications for us. We have direct relationships with certain advertising, marketing and analytics services (including some of our measurement partners) who also are our service providers that help us collect and analyze personal data.</li>
 <li><u>In connection with a transfer of assets</u>. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your personal data to one or more third parties as part of that transaction;</li>
 <li><u>To comply with legal requirements</u>. We will share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to a valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena. We also will also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party's legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.</li>
 <li><u>Other parties with your consent</u>. We may share information about you with third parties when you consent to such sharing.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="6-opt-outs" href="#6-opt-outs">6. Opt-Outs.</a></h4>
<p><u>Promotional Communications</u>. If you are a subscriber to our email newsletter, you may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those messages or by contacting us at any time. If you opt out from promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.</p>
<h4><a id="7-data-security" href="#7-data-security">7. Data Security</a></h4>
<p>We are committed to protecting the personal data in our systems. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.</p>
<p>If you are a Platform User and have an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any access to or use of your account using your password, whether or not authorized by you. Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.</p>
<h4><a id="8-data-retention-and-deletion" href="#8-data-retention-and-deletion">8. Data Retention and Deletion</a></h4>
<p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service</li>
 <li>making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings</li>
 <li>complying with our legal obligations</li>
 <li>resolving disputes</li>
</ul>
<p>When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of information, the nature and length of our relationship with you, the impact on such relationship if data is deleted, mandatory retention periods provided by law or statute of limitations.</p>
<h4><a id="9-international-transfers" href="#9-international-transfers">9. International Transfers</a></h4>
<p>Because of the global nature of our business, we share personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law</li>
 <li>help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="10-changes-to-this-policy" href="#10-changes-to-this-policy">10. Changes to this Policy</a></h4>
<p>We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in case of material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

the population with socialist values and practices. “In many ways, the Bolsheviks’ nationality policy worked as intended—in the sense that it helped to integrate non-Russian peoples into the evolving Soviet state, society, economy and culture,” she says. “But it also relentlessly demanded that Soviet people think about themselves in national terms, and it placed ethnicity at the center of Soviet politics.”</p><p>O’Keeffe says that when the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/the-soviet-unions-final-hours">Soviet Union broke apart along</a> national lines in 1991, “politicians and ordinary

dissolved, its preeminent republic endured political dysfunction and struggled to privatize its central command economy. While oligarchs accumulated great wealth, most Russians faced high inflation and supply shortages. A year after Russian Federation President <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/russia/boris-yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> ended a 1993 constitutional crisis by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/05/world/showdown-moscow-overview-russian-army-routs-rebels-parliament-yeltsin-takes.html">ordering the army</a> to shell the country’s legislative building, he launched a disastrous war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. </p><p>Following a cease-fire in 1997, Yeltsin’s government ordered a second invasion of Chechnya in 1999 after Russian authorities asserted that <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-russia-president-1999-chechnya-apartment-bombings/30097551.html">bombings in Moscow and other cities</a> were linked to Chechen militants. Then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin led the military response against Chechnya. </p><p>On December 31, 1999, Yeltsin announced his resignation and named Putin acting president. Since taking office and serving as president, prime minister and again as president, Putin has consolidated authority by controlling the media and removing presidential term limits while political opponents have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/26/1075710006/russia-named-jailed-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-terrorist">jailed</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielcassady/2020/08/21/navalny-is-the-latest-in-a-grim-line-of-putin-opponents-believed-to-have-been-poisoned/">poisoned</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/23/here-are-ten-critics-of-vladimir-putin-who-died-violently-or-in-suspicious-ways/">killed</a>.

Since independence, the country’s politics have lurched between pro-Russian and pro-European governments. In 1994 Ukraine became the first former Soviet republic to peaceably transfer power through an election, and it transitioned toward capitalism over the next decade.</p><p>After pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych declared victory in a presidential election <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182830">beset by fraud</a> in 2004, the peaceful Orange Revolution forced a new vote that was won by pro-Western candidate Viktor Yushchenko, who sought membership in the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/formation-of-nato-and-warsaw-pact">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</a>. When Yanukovych, who subsequently won the presidency in 2010, backed away from signing an association agreement with the European Union (EU) in 2014, the Maidan street protests forced him to flee to Russia as a pro-Western coalition took power. Weeks later, Russia annexed Crimea while pro-Russian rebels launched an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. In 2019, a former actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-poland-europe-c270027c825e009ed66988bb98a3476e">elected the nation's new president</a>. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/putin-ukraine-speech.html">televised address</a> on February 21, 2022, Russian President Putin falsely claimed that Ukraine never had stable statehood&nbsp;and said the country was instead part of Russia’s “own history, culture, spiritual space.” Days later, Russia attacked Ukraine in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-orders-military-operations-ukraine-demands-kyiv-forces-surrender-2022-02-24/">largest European military operation</a> since <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/world-war-ii-history">World War II</a>. </p><p>“From the Orange Revolution to the Maidan to the Ukrainian people’s extraordinary resolve to defend their nation against Russia’s military invasion, what we have seen is a sovereign people charting its own path against the backdrop of a complex Soviet legacy,” O’Keeffe says. “This is one of the reasons why Putin has been so obsessed, alarmed and repulsed by modern Ukraine as an independent nation-state on the other side of Russia’s border.”</p><h2 id="belarus">Belarus</h2><p>Soviet vestiges such as the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/russia/kgb">KGB</a> and a highly centralized economy have endured in post-independence Belarus. The country’s only post-Soviet president, Alexander Lukashenko, consolidated near-absolute power through a repressive regime that has allegedly <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-09-01/belarus-poll-workers-describe-fraud-presidential-election">rigged elections</a>, jailed political opponents and silenced the press. A founding republic of the USSR, Belarus has resisted privatization and maintains close ties with Russia.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="moldova">Moldova</h2><p>The Moldavian SSR joined the Soviet Union in 1940 after the USSR annexed it following its secret <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/german-soviet-nonaggression-pact">1939 non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany</a>. After independence, pro-Russian and pro-EU politicians have vied for control of Moldova. While political turmoil and endemic corruption have kept Moldova among Europe’s poorest countries, it has moved cautiously toward market capitalism and full EU membership.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</h2><p>Under the rule of <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/nikita-sergeyevich-khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, the Kazakh SSR, which became a republic in 1936, was colonized with Slavic settlers who farmed wheat on its grasslands and became the epicenter of the country’s space program. Following independence, Kazakhstan privatized its economy, which grew tenfold in two decades due to oil reserves larger than those of any former Soviet republic except Russia. </p><p>Proclaimed the “father of the nation,” Nursultan Nazarbayev held the presidency for nearly 30 years. In addition to <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/28012022-kazakhstan-making-sense-of-the-protests-analysis/">suppressing political opposition</a>, the autocrat revived Kazakh culture and engineered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/25/world/europe/kazakhstan-nur-sultan.html">construction of a new national capital</a>, now named in his honor.

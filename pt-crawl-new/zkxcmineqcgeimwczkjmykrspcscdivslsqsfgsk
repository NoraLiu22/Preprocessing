<li><a

Taanila</a> has directed a documentary film on Erkki 
Kurenniemi, who built his legendary DIMI synthesizers in the
late 60s, and has probably also created the first digital 
synthesizer in the world. The title is <a

Future Is Not What It Used To Be</i></a>, premiere November 2002, and it
is
accompanied by a 
compilation of Kurenniemi's previously unpublished electronic 
compositions from the 1960s on Love Records. A DVD version (June 2003)
entitled
<i>The Dawn of DIMI</i> contains the documentary, plus Kurenniemi's
various short films and animations and concert footage from
the early 70s.

Dance of the Antropoids (Excerpt) 1.09 <br> 
1968 
<p>
One of the undeniable pioneers of Finnish electronic music is Erkki 
Kurenniemi (b. 1941), who founded The University of Helsinki 
Electronic Music Studio in the early 1960's. Kurenniemi
built his own series of synthesizers,
named as DIMI, which are nowadays mostly possessed by Swedish
collector and
electronic musician Ralph Lundsten, and published some of his
experimental
compositions like 'Dance of the Antropoids'. Alongside such
Finnish pioneers as Eino
Ruutsalo (for whose short films Kurenniemi composed music), 
Kurenniemi
also did some early work on the field of <a 
href="http://www.uiah.fi/art2/art2_194/treasury.html">Finnish media
art</a> and contributed to Finnish <a
href="http://www.av-arkki.fi/web/historia.html">video
art</a> and <a
href="http://www.jyu.fi/~tiiukois/musiikki.htm">happenings</a>. Kurenniemi 
created the first commercially manufactured and marketed microcomputer already 
in 1973 -- two years before the American MITS Altair. These days Kurenniemi works as
an
independent researcher, specialising in such subjects as artificial intelligence. 
<p>
The 
full-length version of this composition can be found on the <a
href="/early/love/">Love Records</a> 
album <i>Perspectives '68 - Music From Finland</i> and also the 1998
collection <i>Love Proge 2</i>. This excerpt of
'Dance of the Antropoids' comes from 
the LP <i>Tombstone Valentine</i> by 
Finnish progressive rock band Wigwam. <a

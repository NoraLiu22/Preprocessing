The Royal Albert Hall is a great venue, Ed was GREAT (as always, I’ve been to many of his concerts) and all in all a great night. Can’t say Bess Attwell inspired me much and wasn’t sure they were the best opening act he could have chosen (didn’t really get the crowd going, very singer-songwriter).\n\nI went in not knowing it would be the last time the album was played in full (that weekend was the only time, the Saturday and then this concert) but being there for that felt really special.\n\nSo happy he played some other songs too and got us on our feet, I was exhausted by the end, exhausted but so so happy.\n\nWell done Ed.

Similar to Taylor Swift the merchandise van was outside in the stadium lot.  We stood in line for an hour at 4:30pm, one half hour less than Taylor Swift.  There were reports of Ed himself appearing at the van at 1:30pm and performing one of his new songs for those waiting to buy his merchandise before the show.  \r\nThe concert started on time with opening British act Maisie Peters, who told the audience she had just released her second album. She performed for 30 minutes, with a 30 minute pause between acts.  The second warm up act was RUSS, a rap artist that performed for 45 minutes.  Sorry, not into rap.  His songs about how tired he is of texting his girlfriend, and slow driving were maddening in repetition.  He rejoined later to perform one of his songs with Ed later.\r\nEd started at 8:15 and ended his single encore at about 10:30.\r\nThe thing that distinguished this performance was how much of Ed’s back we saw.  The only place Ed was stationary while singing was facing the other half of the stadium (west).  When he faced the rest of the stadium he would step on a conveyer belt which would double time him in a circle until he got back to his original position.  So it was very, very difficult to get a photo of someone in constant motion when you did see his face.  Other artists facing the round give all audiences some song face time, entire song face time, not fractions. \r\nThe second thing that was different about this show was a back-up band during some songs.  The band was split up into four corners of the stage…drums, keyboards, and two guitars….to give some sort of surround sound I would think.  Ed Sheeran had previously made a name for himself as a one man show with rhythm machine.\r\nThe third thing that was different about this show was the insertion of songs a lot of the fans did not know throughout the show.  Made it difficult for Ed to build momentum with his fan b","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Levi's Stadium","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Santa Clara, CA","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"September 20th 2023","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Kellie","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.png","rating":5,"comment":"Ed Sheeran was amazing!

Ed Sheeran is among the most talented singers (perfect pitch even live), performers, writers and collaborators alive today!  He stands on a wheel-type stage that rotates so fans from every angle can see him, and he literally uses a mixer to create beats, pulses, and harmonies right before he sings.  From “A Team” to his new multiply album, Sheeran is outstanding.  That he doesn’t allow 3rd party up charges on tickets is icing on the cake.

While I clearly know who he is, I'm not so familiar with Ed Sheeran that I can sing through all his songs. As I'm more of a casual fan than a diehard, attending this show was a new kind of concert experience for me. Even without being able to sing every song, it was so entertaining from start to finish. I missed the first opener but really enjoyed John Mayer as a surprise guest filling in for Khalid. (Get better soon!) When Ed came out, he immediately engaged the crowd and somehow made the whole show feel intimate setting despite being at Gillette. The stories he told in between songs made me appreciate his artistry that much more. I'd definitely recommend seeing him live to anyone who has an opportunity.

The stormy night made the light show so cool! It was a cool feature until we were trying to get to our cars. Also, there were at least 3 different groups in front of us that kept moving seats. The first group, four girls, were at the front of the balcony with the fence when we arrived. They looked like those were their seats. Then when people with the “right” seats came they moved away to two rows in front of us. I said “right” in quotes bc those were not in fact, their seats. Then to the row in front of us. AND THEN, went way behind of to their proper seats. And this was the same from 2 more groups. That final group had changed around seats towards the end of the concert and blocked our view.\n\nBasically, 3 different groups of people came and went to someone else’s seats twice and finally settled down on the third but kept being distracting.\n\nOther than that, it was quite enjoyable.","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"AT&T Stadium","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Arlington, TX","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"May 7th 2023","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Terris","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/03.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.png","rating":5,"comment":"Honestly I knew Ed Sheeran was talented but after seeing him live he exceeded expectations.

Similar to Taylor Swift the merchandise van was outside in the stadium lot.  We stood in line for an hour at 4:30pm, one half hour less than Taylor Swift.  There were reports of Ed himself appearing at the van at 1:30pm and performing one of his new songs for those waiting to buy his merchandise before the show.  \r\nThe concert started on time with opening British act Maisie Peters, who told the audience she had just released her second album. She performed for 30 minutes, with a 30 minute pause between acts.  The second warm up act was RUSS, a rap artist that performed for 45 minutes.  Sorry, not into rap.  His songs about how tired he is of texting his girlfriend, and slow driving were maddening in repetition.  He rejoined later to perform one of his songs with Ed later.\r\nEd started at 8:15 and ended his single encore at about 10:30.\r\nThe thing that distinguished this performance was how much of Ed’s back we saw.  The only place Ed was stationary while singing was facing the other half of the stadium (west).  When he faced the rest of the stadium he would step on a conveyer belt which would double time him in a circle until he got back to his original position.  So it was very, very difficult to get a photo of someone in constant motion when you did see his face.  Other artists facing the round give all audiences some song face time, entire song face time, not fractions. \r\nThe second thing that was different about this show was a back-up band during some songs.  The band was split up into four corners of the stage…drums, keyboards, and two guitars….to give some sort of surround sound I would think.  Ed Sheeran had previously made a name for himself as a one man show with rhythm machine.\r\nThe third thing that was different about this show was the insertion of songs a lot of the fans did not know throughout the show.  Made it difficult for Ed to build momentum with his fan b","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bob"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

Ed Sheeran is among the most talented singers (perfect pitch even live), performers, writers and collaborators alive today!  He stands on a wheel-type stage that rotates so fans from every angle can see him, and he literally uses a mixer to create beats, pulses, and harmonies right before he sings.  From “A Team” to his new multiply album, Sheeran is outstanding.  That he doesn’t allow 3rd party up charges on tickets is icing on the cake.

Was super chill and up close and personal compared to his big concert shows which I love too. Loved how he told the story behind each of his songs for the - album which just helped to show how human he is. Only downside I would say was there was only 1 merch seller which made the line wrap around the whole inside and all the merch was pretty generic - album tour stuff (only found out later there was a poster also for sell that wasn’t hung up that had the dates of the event and location). Wasn’t able to purchase anything for this reason and hate it since this was a more “exclusive” event in a way.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4.5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brianna"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

While I clearly know who he is, I'm not so familiar with Ed Sheeran that I can sing through all his songs. As I'm more of a casual fan than a diehard, attending this show was a new kind of concert experience for me. Even without being able to sing every song, it was so entertaining from start to finish. I missed the first opener but really enjoyed John Mayer as a surprise guest filling in for Khalid. (Get better soon!) When Ed came out, he immediately engaged the crowd and somehow made the whole show feel intimate setting despite being at Gillette. The stories he told in between songs made me appreciate his artistry that much more. I'd definitely recommend seeing him live to anyone who has an opportunity.

The stormy night made the light show so cool! It was a cool feature until we were trying to get to our cars. Also, there were at least 3 different groups in front of us that kept moving seats. The first group, four girls, were at the front of the balcony with the fence when we arrived. They looked like those were their seats. Then when people with the “right” seats came they moved away to two rows in front of us. I said “right” in quotes bc those were not in fact, their seats. Then to the row in front of us. AND THEN, went way behind of to their proper seats. And this was the same from 2 more groups. That final group had changed around seats towards the end of the concert and blocked our view.\n\nBasically, 3 different groups of people came and went to someone else’s seats twice and finally settled down on the third but kept being distracting.\n\nOther than that, it was quite enjoyable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4.5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bella"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

He was very interactive with the crowd and it sounded like he had an entire band with him but it was just him, his guitar, and loop pedal and it was absolutely wonderful. I would recommend absolutely anyone and everyone to see him.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"anonymous"}}]},"metaTagsData":{"twitter":{"cardContent1":"app","cardContent2":"summary_large_image","appNameIphoneContent":"Bandsintown Concerts","appIdIphoneContent":"471394851","appUrlIphoneContent":"bitcon://deeplink?artist_name=Ed%20Sheeran&amp;controller=ArtistDetailViewController&amp;artist_id=190899","appNameIpadContent":"Bandsintown Concerts","appIdIpadContent":"471394851","appUrlIpadContent":"bitcon://deeplink?artist_name=Ed%20Sheeran&amp;controller=ArtistDetailViewController&amp;artist_id=190899","appNameGooglePlayContent":"Bandsintown Concerts","appIdGooglePlayContent":"com.bandsintown","appUrlGooglePlayContent":"bitintent://www.bandsintown.com/androidapp?artist=Ed%20Sheeran&amp;artist_id=190899","titleContent":"Ed Sheeran Tour Dates","imageContent":"https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/16588187.jpeg","description":"Follow Ed Sheeran and be the first to get notified about new concerts in your area, buy official tickets, and more."},"al":{"iphoneAppNameContent":"Bandsintown Concerts","iphoneAppStoreIdContent":"471394851","iphoneUrlContent":"bitcon://deeplink?artist_name=Ed%20Sheeran&amp;controller=ArtistDetailViewController&amp;artist_id=190899","ipadAppNameContent":"Bandsintown Concerts","ipadAppStoreIdContent":"471394851","ipadUrlContent":"bitcon://deeplink?artist_name=Ed%20Sheeran&amp;controller=ArtistDetailViewController&amp;artist_id=190899","iosAppNameContent":"Bandsintown Concerts","iosAppStoreIdContent":"471394851","iosUrlContent":"bitcon://deeplink?artist_name=Ed%20Sheeran&amp;controller=ArtistDetailViewController&amp;artist_id=190899","androidAppNameContent":"Bandsintown Concerts","androidPackageContent":"com.bandsintown","androidUrlContent":"bitintent://www.bandsintown.com/androidapp?artist=Ed%20Sheeran&amp;artist_id=190899"},"og":{"urlContent":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/190899-ed-sheeran?utm_medium&utm_source&utm_campaign&came_from=251","descriptionContent":"Follow Ed Sheeran and be the first to get notified about new concerts in your area, buy official tickets, and more.","imageContent":"https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/16588187.jpeg","siteNameContent":"Bandsintown","titleContent":"Ed Sheeran","typeContent":"concertsbybit:artist","appIdContent":"123966167614127"},"miscellaneous":{"descriptionContent":"Find tickets for Ed Sheeran concerts near you.

The Royal Albert Hall is a great venue, Ed was GREAT (as always, I’ve been to many of his concerts) and all in all a great night. Can’t say Bess Attwell inspired me much and wasn’t sure they were the best opening act he could have chosen (didn’t really get the crowd going, very singer-songwriter).

I went in not knowing it would be the last time the album was played in full (that weekend was the only time, the Saturday and then this concert) but being there for that felt really special.

So happy he played some other songs too and got us on our feet, I was exhausted by the end, exhausted but so so happy.

Well done Ed. For a first solo show at the Royal Albert Hall, you should be very proud indeed</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">London, United Kingdom</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Royal Albert Hall</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:block"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/08.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/04.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Bob</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">September 20th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Ed Sheeran Concert Review- Levi Stadium, Santa Clara, CA   Sept 16, 2023 (4.5 stars)
Pre concert.  Similar to Taylor Swift the merchandise van was outside in the stadium lot.  We stood in line for an hour at 4:30pm, one half hour less than Taylor Swift.  There were reports of Ed himself appearing at the van at 1:30pm and performing one of his new songs for those waiting to buy his merchandise before the show.  
The concert started on time with opening British act Maisie Peters, who told the audience she had just released her second album. She performed for 30 minutes, with a 30 minute pause between acts.  The second warm up act was RUSS, a rap artist that performed for 45 minutes.  Sorry, not into rap.  His songs about how tired he is of texting his girlfriend, and slow driving were maddening in repetition.  He rejoined later to perform one of his songs with Ed later.
Ed started at 8:15 and ended his single encore at about 10:30.
The thing that distinguished this performance was how much of Ed’s back we saw.  The only place Ed was stationary while singing was facing the other half of the stadium (west).  When he faced the rest of the stadium he would step on a conveyer belt which would double time him in a circle until he got back to his original position.  So it was very, very difficult to get a photo of someone in constant motion when you did see his face.  Other artists facing the round give all audiences some song face time, entire song face time, not fractions. 
The second thing that was different about this show was a back-up band during some songs.  The band was split up into four corners of the stage…drums, keyboards, and two guitars….to give some sort of surround sound I would think.  Ed Sheeran had previously made a name for himself as a one man show with rhythm machine.
The third thing that was different about this show was the insertion of songs a lot of the fans did not know throughout the show.  Made it difficult for Ed to build momentum with his fan b</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Santa Clara, CA</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Levi&#x27;s Stadium</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Kellie</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">August 22nd 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Ed Sheeran was amazing!

Ed Sheeran is among the most talented singers (perfect pitch even live), performers, writers and collaborators alive today!  He stands on a wheel-type stage that rotates so fans from every angle can see him, and he literally uses a mixer to create beats, pulses, and harmonies right before he sings.  From “A Team” to his new multiply album, Sheeran is outstanding.  That he doesn’t allow 3rd party up charges on tickets is icing on the cake.

Only downside I would say was there was only 1 merch seller which made the line wrap around the whole inside and all the merch was pretty generic - album tour stuff (only found out later there was a poster also for sell that wasn’t hung up that had the dates of the event and location).

Even without being able to sing every song, it was so entertaining from start to finish. I missed the first opener but really enjoyed John Mayer as a surprise guest filling in for Khalid. (Get better soon!) When Ed came out, he immediately engaged the crowd and somehow made the whole show feel intimate setting despite being at Gillette. The stories he told in between songs made me appreciate his artistry that much more. I&#x27;d definitely recommend seeing him live to anyone who has an opportunity.

The stormy night made the light show so cool! It was a cool feature until we were trying to get to our cars. Also, there were at least 3 different groups in front of us that kept moving seats. The first group, four girls, were at the front of the balcony with the fence when we arrived. They looked like those were their seats. Then when people with the “right” seats came they moved away to two rows in front of us. I said “right” in quotes bc those were not in fact, their seats. Then to the row in front of us. AND THEN, went way behind of to their proper seats. And this was the same from 2 more groups. That final group had changed around seats towards the end of the concert and blocked our view.

Er ist super sympathisch und hat auch viele lustige private Storys erzählt.

When he was singing, it was just him and his guitar, no more no less. Its voice was just like in his albums, which means that he&#x27;s a true artist
He sang new songs but also many older, which was really convenient. 

Nevertheless, I think that I would prefer him in a smaller place like a closed room (Bercy or Bataclan for instance). Unfortunately, he&#x27;s so popular so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s still possible at this point.
Go Ed Sheeran!

The Royal Albert Hall is a great venue, Ed was GREAT (as always, I’ve been to many of his concerts) and all in all a great night. Can’t say Bess Attwell inspired me much and wasn’t sure they were the best opening act he could have chosen (didn’t really get the crowd going, very singer-songwriter).

I went in not knowing it would be the last time the album was played in full (that weekend was the only time, the Saturday and then this concert) but being there for that felt really special.

So happy he played some other songs too and got us on our feet, I was exhausted by the end, exhausted but so so happy.

Well done Ed. For a first solo show at the Royal Albert Hall, you should be very proud indeed</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">London, United Kingdom</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Royal Albert Hall</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:block"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/08.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/04.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Bob</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">September 20th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Ed Sheeran Concert Review- Levi Stadium, Santa Clara, CA   Sept 16, 2023 (4.5 stars)
Pre concert.  Similar to Taylor Swift the merchandise van was outside in the stadium lot.  We stood in line for an hour at 4:30pm, one half hour less than Taylor Swift.  There were reports of Ed himself appearing at the van at 1:30pm and performing one of his new songs for those waiting to buy his merchandise before the show.  
The concert started on time with opening British act Maisie Peters, who told the audience she had just released her second album. She performed for 30 minutes, with a 30 minute pause between acts.  The second warm up act was RUSS, a rap artist that performed for 45 minutes.  Sorry, not into rap.  His songs about how tired he is of texting his girlfriend, and slow driving were maddening in repetition.  He rejoined later to perform one of his songs with Ed later.
Ed started at 8:15 and ended his single encore at about 10:30.
The thing that distinguished this performance was how much of Ed’s back we saw.  The only place Ed was stationary while singing was facing the other half of the stadium (west).  When he faced the rest of the stadium he would step on a conveyer belt which would double time him in a circle until he got back to his original position.  So it was very, very difficult to get a photo of someone in constant motion when you did see his face.  Other artists facing the round give all audiences some song face time, entire song face time, not fractions. 
The second thing that was different about this show was a back-up band during some songs.  The band was split up into four corners of the stage…drums, keyboards, and two guitars….to give some sort of surround sound I would think.  Ed Sheeran had previously made a name for himself as a one man show with rhythm machine.
The third thing that was different about this show was the insertion of songs a lot of the fans did not know throughout the show.

Ed Sheeran is among the most talented singers (perfect pitch even live), performers, writers and collaborators alive today!  He stands on a wheel-type stage that rotates so fans from every angle can see him, and he literally uses a mixer to create beats, pulses, and harmonies right before he sings.  From “A Team” to his new multiply album, Sheeran is outstanding.  That he doesn’t allow 3rd party up charges on tickets is icing on the cake.  Sheeran puts on a first rate show!!</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Kansas City, MO</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Arrowhead Stadium</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/08.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Sehr</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">August 7th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Ed Sheeran was amazing.

Was super chill and up close and personal compared to his big concert shows which I love too. Loved how he told the story behind each of his songs for the - album which just helped to show how human he is. Only downside I would say was there was only 1 merch seller which made the line wrap around the whole inside and all the merch was pretty generic - album tour stuff (only found out later there was a poster also for sell that wasn’t hung up that had the dates of the event and location). Wasn’t able to purchase anything for this reason and hate it since this was a more “exclusive” event in a way.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Nashville, TN</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Ryman Auditorium</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://media.bandsintown.com/36x36/15088939.webp"/><img src="https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/15088939.jpeg" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Onehottamale25</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">July 1st 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">I loved every minute of this concert!

As I&#x27;m more of a casual fan than a diehard, attending this show was a new kind of concert experience for me. Even without being able to sing every song, it was so entertaining from start to finish. I missed the first opener but really enjoyed John Mayer as a surprise guest filling in for Khalid. (Get better soon!) When Ed came out, he immediately engaged the crowd and somehow made the whole show feel intimate setting despite being at Gillette. The stories he told in between songs made me appreciate his artistry that much more. I&#x27;d definitely recommend seeing him live to anyone who has an opportunity.

The stormy night made the light show so cool! It was a cool feature until we were trying to get to our cars. Also, there were at least 3 different groups in front of us that kept moving seats. The first group, four girls, were at the front of the balcony with the fence when we arrived. They looked like those were their seats. Then when people with the “right” seats came they moved away to two rows in front of us. I said “right” in quotes bc those were not in fact, their seats. Then to the row in front of us. AND THEN, went way behind of to their proper seats. And this was the same from 2 more groups. That final group had changed around seats towards the end of the concert and blocked our view.

Basically, 3 different groups of people came and went to someone else’s seats twice and finally settled down on the third but kept being distracting.

Other than that, it was quite enjoyable.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Arlington, TX</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">AT&amp;T Stadium</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/03.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Terris</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">May 7th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Honestly I knew Ed Sheeran was talented but after seeing him live he exceeded expectations.

When he was singing, it was just him and his guitar, no more no less. Its voice was just like in his albums, which means that he&#x27;s a true artist
He sang new songs but also many older, which was really convenient. 

Nevertheless, I think that I would prefer him in a smaller place like a closed room (Bercy or Bataclan for instance). Unfortunately, he&#x27;s so popular so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s still possible at this point.
Go Ed Sheeran!

I think that it may have been a pressure coming from the people managing AccorHotels arena. Yet Ed himself was amazing. But I really found out that the concert went by really fast like he would start a song after the other almost without breathing . It was a bit stressful.

Similar to Taylor Swift the merchandise van was outside in the stadium lot.  We stood in line for an hour at 4:30pm, one half hour less than Taylor Swift.  There were reports of Ed himself appearing at the van at 1:30pm and performing one of his new songs for those waiting to buy his merchandise before the show.  \r\nThe concert started on time with opening British act Maisie Peters, who told the audience she had just released her second album. She performed for 30 minutes, with a 30 minute pause between acts.  The second warm up act was RUSS, a rap artist that performed for 45 minutes.  Sorry, not into rap.  His songs about how tired he is of texting his girlfriend, and slow driving were maddening in repetition.  He rejoined later to perform one of his songs with Ed later.\r\nEd started at 8:15 and ended his single encore at about 10:30.\r\nThe thing that distinguished this performance was how much of Ed’s back we saw.  The only place Ed was stationary while singing was facing the other half of the stadium (west).  When he faced the rest of the stadium he would step on a conveyer belt which would double time him in a circle until he got back to his original position.  So it was very, very difficult to get a photo of someone in constant motion when you did see his face.  Other artists facing the round give all audiences some song face time, entire song face time, not fractions. \r\nThe second thing that was different about this show was a back-up band during some songs.  The band was split up into four corners of the stage…drums, keyboards, and two guitars….to give some sort of surround sound I would think.  Ed Sheeran had previously made a name for himself as a one man show with rhythm machine.\r\nThe third thing that was different about this show was the insertion of songs a lot of the fans did not know throughout the show.  Made it difficult for Ed to build momentum with his fan b","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bob"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

He stands on a wheel-type stage that rotates so fans from every angle can see him, and he literally uses a mixer to create beats, pulses, and harmonies right before he sings.  From “A Team” to his new multiply album, Sheeran is outstanding.  That he doesn’t allow 3rd party up charges on tickets is icing on the cake.

Loved how he told the story behind each of his songs for the - album which just helped to show how human he is. Only downside I would say was there was only 1 merch seller which made the line wrap around the whole inside and all the merch was pretty generic - album tour stuff (only found out later there was a poster also for sell that wasn’t hung up that had the dates of the event and location).

While I clearly know who he is, I'm not so familiar with Ed Sheeran that I can sing through all his songs. As I'm more of a casual fan than a diehard, attending this show was a new kind of concert experience for me. Even without being able to sing every song, it was so entertaining from start to finish. I missed the first opener but really enjoyed John Mayer as a surprise guest filling in for Khalid. (Get better soon!) When Ed came out, he immediately engaged the crowd and somehow made the whole show feel intimate setting despite being at Gillette. The stories he told in between songs made me appreciate his artistry that much more. I'd definitely recommend seeing him live to anyone who has an opportunity.

The first group, four girls, were at the front of the balcony with the fence when we arrived. They looked like those were their seats. Then when people with the “right” seats came they moved away to two rows in front of us. I said “right” in quotes bc those were not in fact, their seats. Then to the row in front of us. AND THEN, went way behind of to their proper seats. And this was the same from 2 more groups. That final group had changed around seats towards the end of the concert and blocked our view.\n\nBasically, 3 different groups of people came and went to someone else’s seats twice and finally settled down on the third but kept being distracting.\n\nOther than that, it was quite enjoyable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4.5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bella"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

When he was singing, it was just him and his guitar, no more no less. Its voice was just like in his albums, which means that he's a true artist\nHe sang new songs but also many older, which was really convenient. \n\nNevertheless, I think that I would prefer him in a smaller place like a closed room (Bercy or Bataclan for instance). Unfortunately, he's so popular so I don't think it's still possible at this point.\nGo Ed Sheeran!\n\nBest part : Nancy Mulligan ❤️","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julebox"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

Yet, i found it was not natural. Like if there was a lot of pressure on his shoulders so he couldn't be himself that much. I think that it may have been a pressure coming from the people managing AccorHotels arena. Yet Ed himself was amazing. But I really found out that the concert went by really fast like he would start a song after the other almost without breathing . It was a bit stressful. But Ed is AMAZING and I loved to see him in a concert!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":3.5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"anonymous"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

He does everything live and by himself, including ALL riffs, beats, backup singing, chorus, beat-boxing, and rap. It is absolutely incredible. He is pure talent. Also, the venue is so beautiful! Red rocks is my absolute favorite place to see shows. Rixton was a fantastic opening, too. They have so much energy and great stage presence. Definitely see this show if you get the chance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"user9639537"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Ed Sheeran","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"London, United Kingdom"},"genre":"Acoustic","sameAs":"https://twitter.com/edsheeran","description":"Ed Sheeran, born February 17, 1991, is an English singer-songwriter from Halifax, West Yorkshire.

It was really amazing. His performance was one of a kind. Just him and his guitar and a loopstation. There was a malfunction during Bloodstream, but when he came back he performed thr sing again. I actually thought it might be part of the show at first. Ed, as a singer and a musician, is just amazing! His songwriting is excellent and is his voice gives me eargasm.

He was very interactive with the crowd and it sounded like he had an entire band with him but it was just him, his guitar, and loop pedal and it was absolutely wonderful. I would recommend absolutely anyone and everyone to see him.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"anonymous"}}]</script>

      <p>OpenDataPhilly is a data catalog and portal that provides access to more than 300 data sets, applications, and APIs related to the Philadelphia region. Built by Azavea, a Philadelphia-based geospatial software firm, OpenDataPhilly is based on the idea that providing free and easy access to data information encourages better and more transparent government and a more engaged and informed citizenry.</p>

<p>OpenDataPhilly includes both municipal and non-municipal data and enables users to search for and locate data sets based on keyword and category searches. For each data set, application, or API, we’ve included accompanying information about the origins, update frequency, and other specifics of the data. The record for each data source also includes links for downloading the data or accessing the application or API.</p>

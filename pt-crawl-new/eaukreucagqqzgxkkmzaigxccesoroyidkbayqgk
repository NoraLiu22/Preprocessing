        <h3><a href="/datasets/childcare-map/">Childcare Map</a></h3>
        <p>Childcare Map helps Philadelphians make decisions about childcare.</p>

<p>Collection Process: TRF culled childcare data for the City of Philadelphia from various sources, and incorporated data from the Census related to demographics, income, poverty, and transportation. TRF also gathered overlays of various city boundaries from OpenDataPhilly and other local sources. More information on sources is available at http://www.policymap.com/files/ChildcareMapDataDirectory.pdf.</p>

<p>Data Purpose:  TRF collected the data to provide as clear a picture as possible of the supply of and demand for childcare in the city, and to better understand where the gaps are so that stakeholders can work to address them.
Intended Audience:  Childcare providers, investors, policy makers, and parents.
Why Collected:  High-quality childcare supports positive child development and prepares children for success in school and beyond.  As such, accessing high-quality care is important for the well-being of neighborhoods and families.  By identifying areas where shortages of high-quality childcare exist, policymakers and investors can work towards increasing access for all.</p>

        <p>DRB2070 Version 1.0 represents a baseline forecast of urban land cover in the Delaware River Basin (DRB) out to the year 2070. It was developed by the Delaware River Basin Land Use Dynamics Project at Shippensburg University. The forecasts were developed using a SLEUTH urban growth model for the 43 county region of the DRB over the 2001-2006 time period. The model was validated for the 2006-2011 time period. The modeling team used the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) urban classes to represent urban land cover as developed or not developed. The DRB was subdivided into eight modeling subregions in order to improve the quality of the modeling. Additional information is available at:</p>

1 - Water
2 - Emergent Wetlands
3 - Tree Canopy
4 - Scrub/Shrub
5 - Low Vegetation
6 - Barren

If you want to analyze the location of crashes in Philadelphia, use OTIS‚Äô dataset. If you want to understand the investigative outcomes of crashes, use the PPD dataset.</p>

The Philadelphia Healthy Chinese Take-out Initiative is working to prevent and control high blood pressure in Philadelphia residents by 1) reducing the sodium content in Chinese take-out dishes by 10-15% and 2) decreasing access to tobacco products. The initiative is a joint effort among Temple University‚Äôs Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Excess consumption of sodium (salt) and tobacco use are two major contributors to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Chinese take-out restaurant dishes can have large amounts of sodium mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. And Chinese take-out restaurants tend to have higher rates of illegal tobacco sales to minors than other retailers. To date, 200 Chinese take-out restaurants have enrolled in the initiative, participated in a low-sodium healthy cooking training with a professional chef, and received education about complying with the Tobacco Youth Sales Law.</p>

        <p>Founded as William Penn‚Äôs ‚ÄúHoly Experiment,‚Äù Philadelphia has a centuries-long history of fostering and constructing prominent houses of worship throughout the city. In recent decades, as congregations face declining membership and shifting neighborhood demographics, these historically- and architecturally-significant properties have often suffered from deferred maintenance, insensitive alterations, and partial or complete demolition.</p>

<p>Advocacy organizations like the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and Partners for Sacred Places have focused on this issue for years, highlighting the threats to Philadelphia‚Äôs neighborhoods and communities if these structures continue to be abandoned or lost. Over the summer of 2011, in order to more fully understand and address the issue, the Preservation Alliance partnered with Philadelphia Historical Commission and Partners for Sacred Places to develop a comprehensive index of historic churches covering the entire city. Compiling, verifying, and updating data from a number of different sources, University of Pennsylvania graduate student Molly Lester assembled a database which includes every purpose-built house of worship constructed in the city before 1960.</p>

<p>Data elements include:  current congregation, original congregation, address, year of construction, original architect and whether or not the build is on the Philadelphia or National Historic Registers.</p>

        <p>Mid-century modern architecture and buildings of the recent past are enjoying a resurgence of appreciation and interest nationwide, but here in Philadelphia, our eclectic collection of postwar buildings is often overlooked. To help identify and celebrate these emerging landmarks, the Preservation Alliance is compiling a list of notable structures built within the city between 1945 and 1980. The inclusion of a building in this inventory does not imply endorsement of it for designation or other purposes, nor does its absence imply a lack of significance. Rather, the list is meant to illustrate the breadth and depth of design from an era often overshadowed by earlier periods and styles.</p>

<p>The Delaware Valley is a premier freight transportation gateway. It possesses one of the world‚Äôs busiest freshwater ports; rail freight service from two large Class I railroads and 12 smaller short lines; an airport with expanding international cargo services; an excellent highway and connector network; and numerous rail and port intermodal terminals.</p>

<p>The performance of this extraordinary network helps promote and support a thriving economy. PhillyFreightFinder is a resource for exploring and tracking the Philadelphia-Camden-Trenton regional freight network.</p>

<p>Open Freight App is a project by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) to share with regional and national transportation planning partners the framework that is the basis for the PhillyFreightFinder web mapping and data application. Through this effort, DVRPC hopes that county planning agencies, metropolitan planning organizations and state departments of transportation, and economic development agencies can leverage this framework to further their efforts in making freight transportation data public. By utilizing the Open Freight App framework, rather than building from scratch, planning agencies can focus their time and resources on the development of data sets that can serve to improve the access to information on freight facilities and their role in economic development and transportation across the country. Open Freight App would serve as a self-hosted solution to offer these datasets to other planners, economic developers, public officials, decision-makers and the general public.</p>

        <h3><a href="/datasets/pwd-geotechnical-tests/">PWD Geotechnical Tests</a></h3>
        <p>BACKGROUND - The objective of geotechnical testing is to help determine the suitability of a site for green stormwater infrastructure. The tests are used to calculate infiltration rates at proposed green infrastructure locations and evaluate the lithology at depths sufficient to identify any hydraulically limiting layers that would inhibit vertical infiltration and potentially cause lateral flow. The testing includes drilling borings followed by infiltration testing within the footprint of each GSI system.</p>

<p>USING THE LAYER - The infiltration rates and subsurface lithology results such as depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater may be helpful for other users of this layer, but it is important to note that these values can vary widely from location to location, even for nearby sites.</p>

        <p>Overview:
The School Progress Report (SPR) is an innovative tool designed to help us support, respond to, and improve our schools. The SPR reflects our core belief that all students deserve to attend great schools and that we must hold ourselves to a standard of equitable educational excellence. The SPR enables us to both see whether we are meeting this standard, and to track progress and growth of students against the District‚Äôs anchor goals (outlined in Action Plan).</p>

<p>Key Features:
‚Ä¢ The SPR looks at schools across multiple dimensions, reflecting and appreciating the richness and complexity of the educational experience
‚Ä¢ Among these dimensions, the SPR puts the most emphasis on student growth, reflecting our focus on and commitment to ensuring that all of our students are learning
‚Ä¢ The SPR includes useful comparisons within ‚Äúpeer group‚Äù schools that are serving similar student populations
‚Ä¢ The SPR is a local management tool that is designed to be both fair and actionable across District and Charter Schools</p>

<p>Purpose and Use:
‚Ä¢ To identify and celebrate successes
‚Ä¢ To identify areas needing interventions and supports
‚Ä¢ To enable evidence-based decisions about intervention, replication, renewal, and expansion
‚Ä¢ To strategically focus resources for greatest impact on students
‚Ä¢ To track progress against the Action Plan anchor goals</p>

        <h3><a href="/datasets/septa-regional-rail-trainview/">SEPTA Regional Rail APIs</a></h3>
        <p>The TrainView API returns information on all current regional rail trains. <br /><br /> The NextToArrive API returns departure and arrival times between two different stations. Please refer to the Regional Rail Inputs page (see below) to see all valid inputs. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;req1 is the starting Regional Rail station&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;req2 is the ending Regional Rail station&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;req3 is an integer with the number of results to show&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; <br /><br /> The Arrival/Departure API returns a list/queue of regional rail trains to arrive at a station in two/both directions. The direction is demarcated as either Northbound or Southbound. The directions are obviously not geographical references, but rather a reference to the old Reading and Pennsy Railroads. The key to understanding the direction is by using Suburban Station as a starting point: Any trains that move eastbound towards Market East are all considered Northbound; trains going from suburban t o 30th St are all Southbound. The path field describes more accurately the path of travel along various branches. Every regional stop is a valid parameter. Please refer to the Regional Rail Inputs page (see below) to see all valid inputs.</p>

        <p>Stop summary files represent average daily ridership at the stop level over the course of the relevant period. Trolley ridership data was generated using automatic passenger counters (APCs). Bus data is calculated from a variety of sources depending on the route and year. The bus data files represent average daily fall ridership from 2014 ‚Äì present. Accurate weekend bus data was not available until 2017 at which point SEPTA had more widespread APC coverage. No bus data is available for Fall 2020 due to a malware attack.

        <h3><a href="/datasets/septa-sms-transit/">SEPTA SMS Transit</a></h3>
        <p>SEPTA SMS Transit enables users to request scheduled trip information via text message. Users subscribe to the service via text. After setting up an account, users can receive schedule information by texting the Stop ID number for a bus, trolley, or subway stop to 41411. They will receive a return text with information on the four next scheduled trips from that stop. Users can include the specific route designation in the text to receive information on a certain route if the stop serves multiple routes. In addition to using the SMS, there is also a simulator which people can use to experiment at no cost.
Finally, the SMS data can be accessed from an API.  The data returned by the API is currently text format, separated.  The API can be accessed in the format: https://www3.septa.org/sms/var1/var2/var3/var4/var5  <br />
[var1] = stop id <br /> [var2] = route id  OR  i/o for inbound/outbound <br /> [var3] = i/o for inbound/outbound only if route id is supplied <br /> [var4] = returns schedule times on or after specified date, format: MM/DD/YYYY. Defaults to current day. <br /> [var5] = returns schedule times on or after specified time, format: HH:mm:ss. Defaults to current time. <br /> <br /> Stops fall into one of three categories, here is an explanation with some sample links:</p>
<ol> <li>Stops with service provided by only one route, stop is not the first or last stop andall travel is in a single direction:
<br /><br />[https://www3.septa.org/sms/321](https://www3.septa.org/sms/321)<br /> Returns the next 4 scheduled trolleys (All Route 13) at Chester Ave &amp; 49th St.</li>
<li>Stops with service provided by multiple routes, but all travel is in one direction: <br /><br />
https://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/<br /> Returns the next 4 scheduled trolleys at 22nd St. Station. Note the results shows trolleys regardless or route.  To grep just a single route, for a multi-route, uni-directional stop, add another var: <br />
https://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/13/<br /> Returns only the Route 13 trolleys at 22nd St. Station</li>
<li>Stops with travel in multi-directions.  This is usually end points, like the trolley loop at Juniper and they may or may not have multiple routes. For example:<br />
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283 <br /> Returns the next 2 inbound and 2 outbound times for all routes
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283/13/<br /> Returns the next 2 inbound and 2 outbound times for only Route 13
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283/o <br /> Returns the next 4 outbound times for all routes
https://www3.septa.org/sms/283/13/o <br /> Returns the next 4 outbound times for only Route 13 </li>

        <h3><a href="/datasets/snow-emergency-routes/">Snow Emergency Routes</a></h3>
        <p>From the Streets Department snow emergency route page</p>

<p>When snow accumulations approach emergency status, the Managing Director may declare a snow emergency. Once emergency status is declared, the City‚Äôs 110 miles of Snow Emergency Routes receive priority. Owners of vehicles and dumpsters must move them to alternate parking spaces so City forces can clear snow from curb-to-curb on the emergency routes. Any vehicle remaining on a Snow Emergency Route during the declared Snow Emergency will be ticketed and towed. If your car is towed, call 215-686-SNOW for its location. Do NOT call 911.
The snow-emergency-routes.csv file was created from the table on the Streets Department snow emergency route page. I used this file to generate the snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file.</p>

<p>The snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file contains the IDs of all of the street segments that are classified as snow emergency routes. The snow emergency routes shapefile/geojson is built by filtering the street centerline layer to include only those rows where the seg_id is contained in this list.</p>

        <p>A scope of work was developed in response to a request by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The request was to perform a topographic change grid analysis for the Frankford 7.5-minute quadrangle, 1:24,000-scale topographic map, which includes the Wissinoming neighborhood, and the Germantown 7.5-minute quadrangle, which includes the Logan and Feltonville neighborhoods of the City of Philadelphia. The following tasks were performed under this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in elevation between the modern and historic surveys. Prior to release, the fully documented GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was reviewed for (1) com-pleteness of documentation and for (2) appropriate analysis and discussion of uncertainties. The following report is in fulfillment of the tasks outlined in this scope of work and was performed by the U. S. Geological Survey for the U. S.

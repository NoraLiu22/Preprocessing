Rates &amp; Costs</h2><ul><li>(a) Rates are quoted in the Rate Card exclusive of VAT and may be increased at any time upon 3 months' written notice, "written notice" for these purposes to include notice posted on this web page as part of these Terms &amp; Conditions.</li><li>(b) In addition to the Rates, if the Advertiser requires any Production Work to be performed by CNP, it shall pay CNP for the same at the cost quoted by CNP at the time of request, plus any applicable VAT or other sales tax at the prevailing rate.</li><li>(c) All rights, including all copyright, in any Production Work performed by CNP shall vest in CNP and the Advertiser may use the same solely for the limited purpose of publishing the associated Advertising Copy in the relevant CNP Publications pursuant and subject to these Terms and Conditions.

Advertising Copy which requires reformatting will be deemed to be Production Work and subject to an additional fee as set out in Section 2(b) above.

Orders</h2><ul><li>(a) Agents must disclose the name of their principals and nature of the advertised goods, services, Sales Promotions and Advertising Copy at time of booking. Any incomplete or misleading disclosure or failure fully to disclose, or any non-compliance of any matter with applicable regulation, entitles CNP to reject or cancel the order.</li><li>(b) The CNP Rate Card is not an offer to contract. A contract between CNP and the Advertiser (and CNP's obligation to publish any Advertising Copy on these Terms &amp; Conditions) arises only upon and subject to CNP's written acceptance of the Advertiser's order and additionally, in the case of financial advertising, the compliance of the relevant Advertising Copy with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</li><li>(c) Cancellations cannot be accepted from Advertisers within 2 months of the Publication Date of the conventional, print-media CNP Publication. Orders for Advertising Copy comprising covers and Sales Promotions are non-cancellable.</li><li>(d) Orders for next to or facing editorial positions can only be accepted subject to availability at the time of going to press.</li><li>(e) It is the Advertiser's responsibility to notify CNP within 7 days of receipt of CNP's written acceptance of the Advertiser's order for the publication of its Advertising Copy if the booking details set out in CNP's acceptance confirmation are incorrect.</li><li>(f) Advertisers are required to specify, in their orders, which CNP Publications (and which digital versions) they wish their Advertising Copy to appear in. Where a CNP Publication is published in both Digital and PDF Versions, CNP will, unless notified otherwise by the Advertiser, publish the Advertising Copy in all of the Digital Versions and PDF Versions of the relevant CNP Publication, to all of the compatible end-user devices. The Advertiser may, if it so specifies in its order to CNP, elect not to have its Advertising Copy published in the PDF Version of the relevant CNP Publication, but in this regard the Advertiser acknowledges that this 'opt-out' will be universal in respect of all PDF Versions across all end-user devices.</li></ul><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">4. Copy Artwork And Materials</h2><ul><li>(i) Print Advertising Copy</li><li>(a) All Advertising Copy (which must be in the form of PDF files and digital proofs) provided by or on behalf of the Advertiser to CNP must comply with CNP's Technical Specifications.

CNP accepts no responsibility and shall have no liability to the Advertiser for any of the consequences (including the state of the published Advertising Copy) where any materials provided to CNP do not comply with the 'Tablet Advertising Material Specifications' element of the Technical Specifications.</li><li>(d) If the Advertiser does not provide Advertising Copy compliant with this Section 4(ii) by the notified Press Date for the Digital Version CNP is entitled (but not obliged) to re-publish any previous Advertising Copy previously published in the relevant Digital Version.</li><li>(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any links embedded in any Advertising Copy for any Digital Version will only be enabled when the relevant end-user device is connected to the Web via WiFi or 3G.</li><li>(iii) General</li><li>(a) All Advertising Copy supplied by the Advertiser will be held by CNP at the owner's risk and should be insured against loss or damage and backup copies retained by the owner. Advertising Copy will be deleted and destroyed by CNP after 6 months of CNP's receipt of the same unless collected from CNP by the Advertiser.

General</h2><ul><li>(a) The Advertiser accepts that the Advertiser is a principal in law and accordingly warrants that all Advertising Copy (and its constituent parts) when submitted to CNP for production and upon publication shall: (i) be neither defamatory nor obscene, and shall comply in all respects with the requirements of the British Code of Advertising Practice and other relevant industry codes, and (ii) comply with and not contravene the requirements of (a) any Act of Parliament, statutory instrument, code of practice or regulation promulgated thereunder including any law of the European Community for the time being in force or applicable in the United Kingdom and (b) any acts, decrees, regulations or authorities in those markets in which the advertisement (and in particular comparative advertising) may be accessed: (iii) in the case of financial advertising comply with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and other relevant statutes and regulations issued pursuant to statute or by any regulatory body: (iv) not breach any contract or infringe or violate any copyright, trademark or any other personal or proprietary right of any person or entity or render CNP liable to any proceedings or liabilities whatsoever, wheresoever.</li><li>(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set out herein, CNP is entitled at its absolute discretion to reject or exclude any Advertising Copy submitted for publication notwithstanding: (i) CNP's previous acceptance of the relevant Advertiser's order; and (ii) whether or not the relevant Advertising Copy has been previously accepted for publication or published previously.</li><li>(c) The Advertiser will indemnify CNP fully in respect of any costs, claims, damages, losses or liabilities of any sort suffered or incurred by CNP arising directly or indirectly from the production or publication of any Advertising Copy which is in breach of any of the warranties set out in Section 6(a) above.</li><li>(d) Any complaint concerning the production or publication of any Advertising Copy must be notified in writing to CNP within 4 weeks of the relevant Publication Date.</li><li>(e) CNP will exercise reasonable care in preparing and publishing Advertising Copy but if any Advertising Copy is not published in accordance with the booking confirmation issued by CNP due to the act or omission of CNP, CNP's maximum liability shall be limited to the amount of any payment made for the relevant Advertising Copy. CNP shall not be liable in any manner to the Advertiser for any error, misprint or omission which does not materially detract from the look or meaning of any Advertising Copy nor shall CNP be liable to the Advertiser for any such error, misprint or omission to the extent attributable to the Advertiser's non-compliance with these Terms and Conditions. CNP may (subject to Section 6(b) above) at the Advertiser's request carry further or corrective Advertising Copy of a similar type and standard to the Advertising Copy which has not been published in accordance with the booking confirmation issued by CNP which shall be the Advertiser's sole and exclusive remedy.</li><li>(f) The Advertiser may not recharge a client for advertising space at an increased rate without CNP's written consent.</li><li>(g) For Advertising Copy including a Sales Promotion or a special offer the Advertiser must provide all details when placing its order.</li><li>(h) CNP and the Advertiser warrant that they will observe their respective obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 arising in connection with these Terms and Conditions.</li><li>(i) These Terms and Conditions shall be construed under and governed by the law of England and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.</li></ul></div></section></div></article><div class="column-navigation py-32 pl-4"><aside class="navigation"><div><h3>Important documents and links</h3><div><ul><li><a

class="rich-text"><p style="margin-left:0px;">The Condé Nast Publications Ltd.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Last Updated: 1 January 2024</p><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Introduction</h2><p>Condé Nast Britain is a subsidiary of Condé Nast International, a privately-owned company; we publish twelve of the world's leading multi-media brands in the UK, listed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.condenast.co.uk/">here</a>.</p><p>Condé Nast is renowned as the authority on the latest trends in beauty, fashion, interiors and luxury products, and for influential reporting - from cutting-edge exposés in current affairs to truthful views on travel experiences. Our portfolio includes VOGUE, GLAMOUR, HOUSE &amp; GARDEN, TATLER, GQ, WIRED, THE WORLD OF INTERIORS, VANITY FAIR, Condé Nast TRAVELLER, Condé Nast JOHANSENS, GQ Style and LOVE.</p><p>Data privacy and protection is very important to us for everyone who uses our products and services, and who entrusts us with their information. We have written this privacy notice so you can better understand how we collect data, what we do with it and how we look after it. We will tell you how long we keep data and what happens when we no longer need it. We will also outline what rights you have over your data and how we protect and facilitate those rights.</p><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Opting in and out of communications made easy</h2><p>Sometimes people want to read privacy notices because a business is asking for their permission to contact them for marketing. They want to be sure that, if they agree, it will be easy for them to withdraw permission in the future. We want you to be able to opt out as easily as you opted in. Any marketing email we send you will always have an "unsubscribe" link that will take you off that relevant marketing list. Please remember that you may have subscribed from another email address; you will only be able to use the link to "unsubscribe" from the address to which the marketing email has been sent. We make it easy for you to change your preferences for postal marketing as well, giving clear instructions for opting out on all direct mail.</p><p>If you want to change the preferences you have with us for email or for postal marketing, you can use our online form&nbsp;<a href="https://preferences.condenast.co.uk/preferences">here</a>.</p><p>If you do not have an email address associated with us, and you want to make a request to opt in or out of postal marketing you can do so with this&nbsp;<a href="https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/c7543215-252a-4de7-a3a9-a93c52733953/6d61210a-f90c-4cfc-988e-9618c2bcd289">form</a>.

What personal information do we collect from you?</h2><p style="margin-left:0px;">We collect information:</p><ul><li>when you pay for any of our products or services</li><li>when you register to receive one of our newsletters</li><li>when you use any of our websites</li><li>when you attend any of our events</li><li>if you participate in any research we undertake</li><li>if you join one of our communities or forums</li><li>when you enter a competition</li><li>if you contact us about a query or a complaint</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;">We collect the following types of information:</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Contact information</h3><p>When you use or subscribe to one of our services, such as purchasing a print or digital subscription, signing up to an email newsletter, entering a competition, joining one of our online communities or participating in any of our research projects, we will ask you to provide information such as your name, email and/or postal address so that we can provide you with the services requested.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">General personal information</h3><p>When conducting surveys or running competitions, in addition to contact information, we may collect other personal information such as your gender, date of birth, marital status, etc.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Payment details</h3><p>When you purchase a product or service from us, such as subscribing to one of our magazines or attending one of our events, we will also ask you for your payment details in addition to your contact information, in order to secure payment and to authorise access to our products and services.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Online identifiers</h3><p>When you visit one of our websites, we collect information about your web visit, such as how long you visited, what sites you visited or pages you looked at, your IP address and where you were when you visited, what sort of browser, operating system or device you were using when you visited (such as a mobile phone or type of desktop PC, Mac etc), and information identifying the language used by your Device.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Behavioural data</h3><p>When you visit one of our websites, we collect data on your online behaviour (eg time spent on website, the date and time you visited, items clicked on, etc).</p><p>When you buy a product or service from us, such as magazine subscription or a ticket to a Condé Nast event, we will collect information about what products and services you have bought from us.</p><p>When you register for a newsletter or take part in research, we may collect data about your preferences, tastes and interests.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">"Special" categories of data</h3><p>Sometimes, we may collect data in online surveys on what is called "special categories of data". These could be data sets such as biometric information (including voice samples, facial recognition, etc), or political opinions, religion, philosophical beliefs, health, sexual orientation, etc. Whenever we conduct research on these topics, it is always optional, and we will make sure we have your consent to process this data. We will remind you at the time of why and how we are processing this data and what additional safeguards are in place for using, storing and ultimately either deleting or anonymising this data.</p><hr><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">2. How do we use your personal information?</h2><p>At Condé Nast Britain we collect different types of information about people for four main reasons:</p><ol style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>To provide personalised services unique to individual users.</li><li>So we can monitor and improve the services we offer and keep our websites secure.</li><li>To sell advertising space and display ads on our websites (these will only be personalised ads where you have opted into the appropriate cookies) and to combat ad-related fraud. This helps us to keep our websites free for people who visit them.</li><li>To market products and services which we think would be relevant to you.</li></ol><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Newsletters</h3><p>When you sign up to one of our newsletters, you are giving consent for us to use the email address provided to send you relevant content for the brands you have signed up to. You can withdraw this consent for any newsletter by unsubscribing at any time.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Advertising</h3><p>We advertise on our site and in our newsletters to help keep most of the content free. We use cookies and similar technologies and work with trusted partners so that we can show you advertisements we believe might interest you, to control the number of times you see an ad and to measure the effectiveness of a campaign. If you are interested and want to learn more about these, including how to opt out, please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.condenast.co.uk/cookie-notice/">Cookie Policy</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note, opting out of cookies does not mean you will not see any advertisements. We work with advertising partners including Google to deliver and present non-personalised ads to our website visitors that have not opted into the appropriate cookies. To do this we use your IP address, information about the browser and operating system you are using to access the site, the language you are using, and the date and time of your visit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Security and fixing errors</h3><p>When you visit our website, we use your IP address, information about the browser and operating system you are using to access the site, the language you are using, and the date and time of your visit to ensure security and fix errors on our site, and to prevent and detect fraud.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Social Media Advertising</h3><p>We work with social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter to show you marketing content from our brands and selected advertisers if you have viewed a Condé Nast website and to make sure what we show you on these platforms is relevant to you. Data collected by these social media networks may also be anonymised and used in aggregate to help improve the quality and effectiveness of our websites and marketing efforts.</p><p>You can limit this kind of tracking and profiling by going to your account settings of Facebook and/or Twitter. You can also find out more about the pixels and cookies we use on our websites by reading our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.condenast.co.uk/cookie-notice/">Cookies policy</a>.</p><p>We may also participate in Facebook's 'Custom Audience' service from time to time. This service enables Condé Nast to display to you personalised advertisements when you visit Facebook’s social media platforms. It works by converting your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers that Facebook generates from email addresses of its users. Where we use Facebook Custom Audiences, we will only include you if you have consented to receive marketing from us. If you have given us your consent, you can change your mind at any time by unsubscribing (linked in any email we send you) or by adjusting your preferences in our&nbsp;<a href="https://preferences.condenast.co.uk/preferences">preference centre</a>.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Research &amp; Insight</h3><p>We run various user communities, forums and reader panels. We send out research invitations to our research communities, to people who pay for our products and services and to people who have opted in to receive communications from us.</p><p>We may sometimes use your gender and age range collected during a survey for building "look-a-like" models. This data is anonymously transmitted to our Data Management Platform (Permutive) and matched with our subscribers and members. This allows us to provide relevant and targeted advertising. If you are interested and want to learn more about these, including how to opt out, please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.condenast.co.uk/cookie-notice/">Cookie Policy</a>. Please note, opting out of cookies does not mean you will not see any advertisements.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Delivery of goods and services / Customer account management</h3><p>We will use the information you have provided for the provision of goods and/or services that you have requested and subsequently communicating with you about those products and services.</p><p>Please note too, that when you buy something from us - such as subscription or a ticket to an event - we may contact you about your registration details, to manage any account or subscription you have with us, or to provide customer service. This will be the case even if you have opted-out of, or declined to consent to, receiving promotional emails.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Competitions</h3><p>When you enter one of our online competitions, we will process your information for the purposes of picking a winner. If you have opted-in to receiving information from us about our products and services (eg receiving subscriptions offers, event invitations, signing up for editorial newsletters etc) then we will use the information you provide to make sure we offer you relevant products and services (based on where you live, your age, gender, tastes, preferences etc). If you have opted-in to receive news and offers from any competition sponsors, we will share your information with them.</p><p>Further details about this is outlined in the "who do we share information with" with section.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Partnerships programmes</h3><p>We work with our partners from the world of luxury goods, fashion, travel and retail so that we can present you with some outstanding offers and opportunities by either email or post.

Consumer Privacy.</strong> The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et. seq. ("CCPA"), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described in this Section X(A).</p><ol><li>California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Notice Coordinator by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:datacontroller@condenast.co.uk">datacontroller@condenast.co.uk</a>&nbsp;or phone at +1 888-914-9661, PIN: 867 610, or as described at the end of this document:<ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>Know the ways in which we acquire, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information</li><li>Know the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold</li><li>Request the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions, and</li><li>Not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights</li></ul></li><li>California residents also have the right to opt-out of the "sale" of their Personal Information. We put "sale" in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as "sales," even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. If we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information. Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren’t "sales," such as with our Service Providers.</li><li>Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your Personal Information for a "business purpose" (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:<ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>Identifiers</li><li>Protected characteristics</li><li>Commercial information</li><li>Geolocation data</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li><li>Financial, medical, or health insurance information</li><li>Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information</li><li>Professional information</li><li>Education information</li><li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</li></ul></li><li>Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have "sold" (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:<ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>Identifiers</li><li>Protected characteristics</li><li>Commercial information</li><li>Geolocation data</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li><li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories, along with the following categories: (i) financial, medical, or health insurance information; (ii) audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information; (iii) professional information, and (iv) education information.</li></ul></li></ol><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>B. Shine the Light.</strong> California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent our disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>C. Online Erasure.</strong> California’s "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of Content they post. If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Service that is directed to minors, you may request removal of the Content by contacting our Privacy Notice Coordinator by email at datacontroller@condenast.co.uk or as described at the end of this document. In response to your request, we may elect to make the Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the Content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the Content.</p><hr><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">11.

class="article-intro"><p>During the Cuban Missile Crisis, leaders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in a tense, 13-day political and military standoff in October 1962 over the installation of nuclear-armed Soviet missiles on Cuba, just 90 miles from U.S. shores. In a TV address on October 22, 1962, President <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/john-f-kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> (1917-63) notified Americans about the presence of the missiles, explained his decision to enact a naval blockade around Cuba and made it clear the U.S. was prepared to use military force if necessary to neutralize this perceived threat to national security. Following this news, many people feared the world was on the brink of nuclear war. However, disaster was avoided when the U.S. agreed to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s (1894-1971) offer to remove the Cuban missiles in exchange for the U.S. promising not to invade Cuba. Kennedy also secretly agreed to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey.</p></div></div><div class="article-content content"><h2 id="discovering-the-missiles">Discovering the Missiles </h2><p>After seizing power in the Caribbean island nation of Cuba in 1959, leftist revolutionary leader <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/fidel-castro">Fidel Castro</a> (1926-2016) aligned himself with the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/history-of-the-soviet-union">Soviet Union</a>.

From that launch point, they were capable of quickly reaching targets in the eastern U.S. If allowed to become operational, the missiles would fundamentally alter the complexion of the nuclear rivalry between the U.S. and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), which up to that point had been dominated by the Americans.</p><p>Soviet leader <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/nikita-sergeyevich-khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> had gambled on sending the missiles to Cuba with the specific goal of increasing his nation’s nuclear strike capability. The Soviets had long felt uneasy about the number of nuclear weapons that were targeted at them from sites in Western Europe and Turkey, and they saw the deployment of missiles in Cuba as a way to level the playing field. Another key factor in the Soviet missile scheme was the hostile relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. The Kennedy administration had already launched one attack on the island–the failed <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/bay-of-pigs-invasion">Bay of Pigs invasion</a> in 1961–and Castro and Khrushchev saw the missiles as a means of deterring further U.S. aggression.</p><div class="wp-block-columns article__contained"><div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center" style="flex-basis:33.33%"><div class="column-content content"><figure class="wp-block-image article__contained"><div class="wp-block-image__wrapper"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"><img style="display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271024%27%20height=%27576%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 704px, calc(100vw - 2.5rem)" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=1080&amp;height=608&amp;crop=1080%3A608%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1152&amp;crop=2048%3A1152%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2x" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=2048&amp;height=1152&amp;crop=2048%3A1152%2Csmart&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></div></figure></div></div><div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center" style="flex-basis:66.66%"><div class="column-content content"><h3 class="heading-4">Kennedy</h3><p>Watch the three-episode documentary event, <strong>Kennedy</strong>.

The challenge facing them was to orchestrate their removal without initiating a wider conflict–and possibly a nuclear war. In deliberations that stretched on for nearly a week, they came up with a variety of options, including a bombing attack on the missile sites and a full-scale invasion of Cuba. But Kennedy ultimately decided on a more measured approach. First, he would employ the U.S. Navy to establish a blockade, or quarantine, of the island to prevent the Soviets from delivering additional missiles and military equipment. Second, he would deliver an ultimatum that the existing missiles be removed.</p><p>In a television broadcast on October 22, 1962, the president notified Americans about the presence of the missiles, explained his decision to enact the blockade and made it clear that the U.S. was prepared to use military force if necessary to neutralize this perceived threat to national security. Following this public declaration, people around the globe nervously waited for the Soviet response. Some Americans, fearing their country was on the brink of nuclear war, hoarded food and gas.</p><div class="block-banner light-section"><div class="block-banner__image"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0"><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover"/><noscript><img alt="" sizes="(min-width: 850px) 400px, 72px" srcSet="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=16&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 16w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=32&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 32w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=48&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 48w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=64&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 64w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=96&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 96w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=128&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 128w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=256&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 256w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=392&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 392w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=640&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 640w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=750&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 750w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=828&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 828w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=1080&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1080w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=1248&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1248w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=1920&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1920w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=2048&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=3840&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp 3840w" src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Nuclear_Terror_3840x2160_NT-scaled-2.jpeg?width=3840&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></div><div class="block-banner__content"><h2 class="block-banner__heading">HISTORY Vault: Nuclear Terror</h2><div class="block-banner__text"><p>Now more than ever, terrorist groups are obtaining nuclear weapons.

An attempt by the Soviets to breach the blockade would likely have sparked a military confrontation that could have quickly escalated to a nuclear exchange. But the Soviet ships stopped short of the blockade.</p><p>Although the events at sea offered a positive sign that war could be averted, they did nothing to address the problem of the missiles already in Cuba. The tense standoff between the superpowers continued through the week, and on October 27, an American reconnaissance plane was shot down over Cuba, and a U.S. invasion force was readied in Florida. (The 35-year-old pilot of the downed plane, Major Rudolf Anderson, is considered the sole U.S. combat casualty of the Cuban missile crisis.) “I thought it was the last Saturday I would ever see,” recalled U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (1916-2009), as quoted by Martin Walker in “The Cold War.” A similar sense of doom was felt by other key players on both sides.</p><div class="block-story-grid"><div class="card-grid is-style-3-col"><div class="card-grid__container"></div></div></div><h2 id="a-deal-ends-the-standoff">A Deal Ends the Standoff </h2><p>Despite the enormous tension, Soviet and American leaders found a way out of the impasse. During the crisis, the Americans and Soviets had exchanged letters and other communications, and on October 26, Khrushchev sent a message to Kennedy in which he offered to remove the Cuban missiles in exchange for a promise by U.S. leaders not to invade Cuba. The following day, the Soviet leader sent a letter proposing that the USSR would dismantle its missiles in Cuba if the Americans removed their missile installations in Turkey.</p><p>Officially, the Kennedy administration decided to accept the terms of the first message and ignore the second Khrushchev letter entirely. Privately, however, American officials also agreed to withdraw their nation’s missiles from Turkey. U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy (1925-68) personally delivered the message to the Soviet ambassador in <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/washington">Washington</a>, and on October 28, the crisis drew to a close.</p><p>Both the Americans and Soviets were sobered by the Cuban Missile Crisis. The following year, a direct “hot line” communication link was installed between Washington and Moscow to help defuse similar situations, and the superpowers signed two treaties related to nuclear weapons. The Cold War was and the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/arms-race">nuclear arms race</a> was far from over, though. In fact, another legacy of the crisis was that it convinced the Soviets to increase their investment in an arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the U.S. from Soviet territory.</p></div><footer class="article-footer article-footer--topic"><div class="author-byline article__contained has-elevation"><div class="byline__content"><div class="byline__information"><div class="byline__author-wrapper"><p class="byline__author"><span aria-hidden="true">By: </span><a aria-label="Read more articles from History.com Editors" link-name="History.com Editors" href="/author/history">History.com Editors</a></p></div><div class="byline__description"><p><a href="http://history.com/">HISTORY.com</a> works with a wide range of writers and editors to create accurate and informative content.

From that launch point, they were capable of quickly reaching targets in the eastern U.S. If allowed to become operational, the missiles would fundamentally alter the complexion of the nuclear rivalry between the U.S. and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), which up to that point had been dominated by the Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSoviet leader \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/nikita-sergeyevich-khrushchev\"\u003eNikita Khrushchev\u003c/a\u003e had gambled on sending the missiles to Cuba with the specific goal of increasing his nation’s nuclear strike capability. The Soviets had long felt uneasy about the number of nuclear weapons that were targeted at them from sites in Western Europe and Turkey, and they saw the deployment of missiles in Cuba as a way to level the playing field. Another key factor in the Soviet missile scheme was the hostile relationship between the U.S. and Cuba.

The challenge facing them was to orchestrate their removal without initiating a wider conflict–and possibly a nuclear war. In deliberations that stretched on for nearly a week, they came up with a variety of options, including a bombing attack on the missile sites and a full-scale invasion of Cuba. But Kennedy ultimately decided on a more measured approach. First, he would employ the U.S. Navy to establish a blockade, or quarantine, of the island to prevent the Soviets from delivering additional missiles and military equipment. Second, he would deliver an ultimatum that the existing missiles be removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a television broadcast on October 22, 1962, the president notified Americans about the presence of the missiles, explained his decision to enact the blockade and made it clear that the U.S. was prepared to use military force if necessary to neutralize this perceived threat to national security. Following this public declaration, people around the globe nervously waited for the Soviet response. Some Americans, fearing their country was on the brink of nuclear war, hoarded food and gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-banner\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-banner__content\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003ch3 class=\"block-banner__heading h4\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\tHISTORY Vault: Nuclear Terror\t\t\t\t\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-banner__text\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eNow more than ever, terrorist groups are obtaining nuclear weapons.

An attempt by the Soviets to breach the blockade would likely have sparked a military confrontation that could have quickly escalated to a nuclear exchange. But the Soviet ships stopped short of the blockade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the events at sea offered a positive sign that war could be averted, they did nothing to address the problem of the missiles already in Cuba. The tense standoff between the superpowers continued through the week, and on October 27, an American reconnaissance plane was shot down over Cuba, and a U.S. invasion force was readied in Florida. (The 35-year-old pilot of the downed plane, Major Rudolf Anderson, is considered the sole U.S. combat casualty of the Cuban missile crisis.) “I thought it was the last Saturday I would ever see,” recalled U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (1916-2009), as quoted by Martin Walker in “The Cold War.” A similar sense of doom was felt by other key players on both

From that launch point, they were capable of quickly reaching targets in the eastern U.S. If allowed to become operational, the missiles would fundamentally alter the complexion of the nuclear rivalry between the U.S. and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), which up to that point had been dominated by the Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSoviet leader \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/nikita-sergeyevich-khrushchev\"\u003eNikita Khrushchev\u003c/a\u003e had gambled on sending the missiles to Cuba with the specific goal of increasing his nation’s nuclear strike capability. The Soviets had long felt uneasy about the number of nuclear weapons that were targeted at them from sites in Western Europe and Turkey, and they saw the deployment of missiles in Cuba as a way to level the playing field. Another key factor in the Soviet missile scheme was the hostile relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. The Kennedy administration had already launched one attack on the island–the failed \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/bay-of-pigs-invasion\"\u003eBay of Pigs invasion\u003c/a\u003e in 1961–and Castro and Khrushchev saw the missiles as a means of deterring further U.S. aggression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=1024\u0026amp;height=576\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-58792\" srcset=\"https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=300 300w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=1024 1024w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=1536 1536w, https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/10/kennedy-2048x1152-promo-16x9-1.jpg?width=2048 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-heading-4-font-size\"\u003eKennedy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWatch the three-episode documentary event, \u003cstrong\u003eKennedy\u003c/strong\u003e.

The challenge facing them was to orchestrate their removal without initiating a wider conflict–and possibly a nuclear war. In deliberations that stretched on for nearly a week, they came up with a variety of options, including a bombing attack on the missile sites and a full-scale invasion of Cuba. But Kennedy ultimately decided on a more measured approach. First, he would employ the U.S. Navy to establish a blockade, or quarantine, of the island to prevent the Soviets from delivering additional missiles and military equipment. Second, he would deliver an ultimatum that the existing missiles be removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a television broadcast on October 22, 1962, the president notified Americans about the presence of the missiles, explained his decision to enact the blockade and made it clear that the U.S. was prepared to use military force if necessary to neutralize this perceived threat to national security. Following this public declaration, people around the globe nervously waited for the Soviet response. Some Americans, fearing their country was on the brink of nuclear war, hoarded food and gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-banner\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-banner__content\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003ch3 class=\"block-banner__heading h4\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\tHISTORY Vault: Nuclear Terror\t\t\t\t\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"block-banner__text\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eNow more than ever, terrorist groups are obtaining nuclear weapons.

An attempt by the Soviets to breach the blockade would likely have sparked a military confrontation that could have quickly escalated to a nuclear exchange. But the Soviet ships stopped short of the blockade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the events at sea offered a positive sign that war could be averted, they did nothing to address the problem of the missiles already in Cuba. The tense standoff between the superpowers continued through the week, and on October 27, an American reconnaissance plane was shot down over Cuba, and a U.S. invasion force was readied in Florida. (The 35-year-old pilot of the downed plane, Major Rudolf Anderson, is considered the sole U.S. combat casualty of the Cuban missile crisis.) “I thought it was the last Saturday I would ever see,” recalled U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (1916-2009), as quoted by Martin Walker in “The Cold War.” A similar sense of doom was felt by other key players on both

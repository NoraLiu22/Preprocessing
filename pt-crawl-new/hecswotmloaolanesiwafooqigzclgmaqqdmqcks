The PA system/mix was tuned perfectly, the band was VERY tight and the song selection covered nearly entire 17 years they've been together.

It had been a bit of a wait as I had originally purchased tickets back in April of 2022 and the show ha been postponed nearly 10 months. In August 2022 Lady A announced they were putting their tour on hold in order to support Charles Kelley on his sobriety journey. Happy to report Kelly is nearing the one year mark of sobriety and in his own words, ‘feeling super-blessed’ and ‘really grateful’! With 9 studio albums and 25 charted singles including 11 #1’s there would be no lack of material for the Grammy and ACM/CMA award winning Grand Ole Opry members. The Peace Center Hall was the ideal venue and my seats 4th row upper balcony delivered great sound and a comprehensive overview of the stage. The stage L to R would have the three members in the forefront (Kelley, Haywood, Scott) with guitars and bass behind them to the wings, drums and keyboard on separate risers in the rear, the risers had illuminated lateral snowflake/asterisk symbols on the front. A diagonally facing piano was directly center stage and eight freestanding retro styled amber spotlights completed the background positioned in order of a candelabra (shortest at the ends, longest in the center). There were no video screens. The band took the stage at 8:30 for a 1.45 hour / 22 song set beginning hot with a pair of #1’s 2009’s ‘I Run To You’ and 2010’s ‘American Honey’! Charles addressed the audience, ‘We wanted to do something different this tour and we know that a lot of the songs too for you guys your favorites sometimes aren’t always the radio singles and so hence The Request Line Tour. So we took requests, we had people texting, and calling, as the kids call it “Slide in their DM’s”’. With that they played the first of two voice mails over the system and called out the name of the individual ‘Gloria’ to see if she was in attendance. Spotting her in one of the opera boxes Hillary dedicated the song 2010’s #22 ‘Wanted You More’ to her. Next Dave Hayward addressed us as the house lights shown, ‘Oh, there’s a second balcony’. Charles replied, ‘I didn’t even notice during our forty-five minute sound check’. A second voice mail came in this time from Zach as he was spotted in (you guessed it) the second balcony. ‘Somebody give Zachary better seats’, Charles advised. ‘What I’m Leaving For’ a #39 from 2020 was dedicated to Zach. They three were clearly having a good time Dave commenting on what a great town we have. Charles added, ‘This feels like a hometown show for us being from Augusta down the road’. There were family in the audience including Charles 4 1/2 year old nephew, Hillary’s daughter, and Dave’s wife and they had taken their kids to the Children’s Museum earlier in the day. They broke from set the entire show, trying to follow along from previous shows set lists proved a futile task. There was a notebook of all their songs placed a top the piano which they’ve had to use from time to time during the request tour as well as a bright yellow dial telephone. Later during the encore the phone was signed and given away to an audience member of Hillary’s daughter Eisele’s choice as she carried it into the audience in search of a lucky fan. The #1 ‘Just A Kiss’ was inserted perfectly mid-set to keep momentum going. During ‘Army’ (unreleased as a single) were the band intros, every member an accomplished musician with a resume’ beginning with Dennis on bass, then Jon on keys, Butch on guitar, and Ian on drums. The band’s lead guitarist Slim Gambill who states he loves ‘sideman land’ was next. His time with NBC's Last Call With Carson afforded him work on stage with John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5, Peter Frampton, Stevie Nicks and many more. He’s more than a great addition to Lady A, he showed himself as a 4th member of the group many times throughout the evening. Hillary spoke next, ‘We wanna take one of the songs y’all might now and “Operafi it”’. With banjo and accordion they turned their 2013’s #6  ‘Compass’ into a sing-along medley adding in Country standards ‘Meet In The Middle-Dust On The Bottle-Forever And Ever Amen-Jolene’. Next the lights dimmed and stools were brought out as Charles spoke, ‘I’ve been on a little journey myself these days, next week I will be celebrating one year of sobriety.’ ‘I wrote this “Goodbye Letter” to my drink of choice which is whiskey.’ Turned into a song titled ‘As Far As You Could’, the letter’s lyrics “Whiskey you took me as far as you could take me, now it’s time to let you go”’ were especially moving. The powerful moment came when he sang the line ‘Who’s standing now’ and rose to his feet, and so did the crowd. This was indeed a legit “Goodbye Letter to Alcohol” as I can arrest from experience having written one myself nine years ago in rehab. After a standing ovation for Charles the band had a little fun with a melody. ’There’s one song that any song can be sung over’ turned out it was Don Henley’s ‘The Boy’s Of Summer’ and they put it into a medley incorporating in ‘Shake It Off-Mmmbop-l Wanna Dance With Somebody-My Heart Will Go On. Hearing songs from Swift, Hanson, Whitney, and Celine was something I never expected at a Country show, but it worked! Concluding the regular set were #1 ‘We Owned The Night’, #2 ‘Downtown’, and #3 ‘Love Don’t Live Here’. The first of a two song encore was ‘A Love Song’, a yet to be released new single sung in a stripped down version with just the three of them. ’Need You Now’ brought the concert a grand conclusion, everyone on their feet. Noticeably missing from the set was 2011’s ‘Lookin For A Good Time’. In my quest these days to see artists that I’ve not yet seen LIVE before, it has been few and far between that I’ve seen ‘younger’ artists perform lately. Hillary Scott 37, Charles Kelley 41, and Dave Haywood 40 showed their youth in both their voices and their energy levels. There was an opener from Nashville, singer/songwriter Dave Barnes who took the stage in typical Peace Center regime precisely at 7:30. Capturing the crowds attention immediately he stated, ‘I do wanna thank Lady A for closing out the show for me tonight, it means a lot!’ The South Carolina native who is with Lady A for the duration of the tour is no newcomer to the music industry, his first of eight studio albums was released back in 2000. Playing a 6 song / 40 minute acoustic set from his Greatest Hits CD he seemed at times more of a stand up comedian spending equal time story telling as he did playing music. With tales of drunk angels, church gossip groups (‘wandering eyes lead to wandering thighs’) and an incident in Charleston where someone rushed the stage at him, the audience ate it up fueling hid comic relief. Ending his set to the surprise of everyone was a version of Blake Shelton’s #1 ‘God Gave Me You’ which David originally wrote back in 2010. Lady A brought him back on stage during their performance of ‘Walking In Memphis’ coining the addition to their line up as ‘The Double Daves’. To anyone who hasn’t seen Lady A, they’re a class act and they have the performance nailed down, nothing super-fancy, but it’ll make for a memorable evening with confidence that your ticket money was well spent. A quick word about the name change, the Nashville trio will always remain Lady Antebellum to me. It seems as if the name change brought on more controversy than the name itself. It was innocently chosen (search it out for yourself) and the change ensued a lawsuit with black gospel singer Anita White who had been using ‘Lady A’ for years along, with more allegations of racism. I can see both sides, and unfortunately it is what it is! Entering the venue the first thing I noted to my wife was, ‘This is the most “normal” looking crowd I’ve ever seen’. Then stepping back for a moment I added, ‘Except there is one thing missing, folk of a darker hue then that of ourselves’. t does makes one think!” Review and photo by DAve (Concert #788)","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Peace Concert Hall - Peace Center","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Greenville, SC","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"June 23rd 2023","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Martin","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/07.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/04.png","rating":5,"comment":"This was such a great show.

The PA system/mix was tuned perfectly, the band was VERY tight and the song selection covered nearly entire 17 years they've been together.

It had been a bit of a wait as I had originally purchased tickets back in April of 2022 and the show ha been postponed nearly 10 months. In August 2022 Lady A announced they were putting their tour on hold in order to support Charles Kelley on his sobriety journey. Happy to report Kelly is nearing the one year mark of sobriety and in his own words, ‘feeling super-blessed’ and ‘really grateful’! With 9 studio albums and 25 charted singles including 11 #1’s there would be no lack of material for the Grammy and ACM/CMA award winning Grand Ole Opry members. The Peace Center Hall was the ideal venue and my seats 4th row upper balcony delivered great sound and a comprehensive overview of the stage. The stage L to R would have the three members in the forefront (Kelley, Haywood, Scott) with guitars and bass behind them to the wings, drums and keyboard on separate risers in the rear, the risers had illuminated lateral snowflake/asterisk symbols on the front. A diagonally facing piano was directly center stage and eight freestanding retro styled amber spotlights completed the background positioned in order of a candelabra (shortest at the ends, longest in the center). There were no video screens. The band took the stage at 8:30 for a 1.45 hour / 22 song set beginning hot with a pair of #1’s 2009’s ‘I Run To You’ and 2010’s ‘American Honey’! Charles addressed the audience, ‘We wanted to do something different this tour and we know that a lot of the songs too for you guys your favorites sometimes aren’t always the radio singles and so hence The Request Line Tour. So we took requests, we had people texting, and calling, as the kids call it “Slide in their DM’s”’. With that they played the first of two voice mails over the system and called out the name of the individual ‘Gloria’ to see if she was in attendance. Spotting her in one of the opera boxes Hillary dedicated the song 2010’s #22 ‘Wanted You More’ to her. Next Dave Hayward addressed us as the house lights shown, ‘Oh, there’s a second balcony’. Charles replied, ‘I didn’t even notice during our forty-five minute sound check’. A second voice mail came in this time from Zach as he was spotted in (you guessed it) the second balcony. ‘Somebody give Zachary better seats’, Charles advised. ‘What I’m Leaving For’ a #39 from 2020 was dedicated to Zach. They three were clearly having a good time Dave commenting on what a great town we have. Charles added, ‘This feels like a hometown show for us being from Augusta down the road’. There were family in the audience including Charles 4 1/2 year old nephew, Hillary’s daughter, and Dave’s wife and they had taken their kids to the Children’s Museum earlier in the day. They broke from set the entire show, trying to follow along from previous shows set lists proved a futile task. There was a notebook of all their songs placed a top the piano which they’ve had to use from time to time during the request tour as well as a bright yellow dial telephone. Later during the encore the phone was signed and given away to an audience member of Hillary’s daughter Eisele’s choice as she carried it into the audience in search of a lucky fan. The #1 ‘Just A Kiss’ was inserted perfectly mid-set to keep momentum going. During ‘Army’ (unreleased as a single) were the band intros, every member an accomplished musician with a resume’ beginning with Dennis on bass, then Jon on keys, Butch on guitar, and Ian on drums. The band’s lead guitarist Slim Gambill who states he loves ‘sideman land’ was next. His time with NBC's Last Call With Carson afforded him work on stage with John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5, Peter Frampton, Stevie Nicks and many more. He’s more than a great addition to Lady A, he showed himself as a 4th member of the group many times throughout the evening. Hillary spoke next, ‘We wanna take one of the songs y’all might now and “Operafi it”’. With banjo and accordion they turned their 2013’s #6  ‘Compass’ into a sing-along medley adding in Country standards ‘Meet In The Middle-Dust On The Bottle-Forever And Ever Amen-Jolene’. Next the lights dimmed and stools were brought out as Charles spoke, ‘I’ve been on a little journey myself these days, next week I will be celebrating one year of sobriety.’ ‘I wrote this “Goodbye Letter” to my drink of choice which is whiskey.’ Turned into a song titled ‘As Far As You Could’, the letter’s lyrics “Whiskey you took me as far as you could take me, now it’s time to let you go”’ were especially moving. The powerful moment came when he sang the line ‘Who’s standing now’ and rose to his feet, and so did the crowd. This was indeed a legit “Goodbye Letter to Alcohol” as I can arrest from experience having written one myself nine years ago in rehab. After a standing ovation for Charles the band had a little fun with a melody. ’There’s one song that any song can be sung over’ turned out it was Don Henley’s ‘The Boy’s Of Summer’ and they put it into a medley incorporating in ‘Shake It Off-Mmmbop-l Wanna Dance With Somebody-My Heart Will Go On. Hearing songs from Swift, Hanson, Whitney, and Celine was something I never expected at a Country show, but it worked! Concluding the regular set were #1 ‘We Owned The Night’, #2 ‘Downtown’, and #3 ‘Love Don’t Live Here’. The first of a two song encore was ‘A Love Song’, a yet to be released new single sung in a stripped down version with just the three of them. ’Need You Now’ brought the concert a grand conclusion, everyone on their feet. Noticeably missing from the set was 2011’s ‘Lookin For A Good Time’. In my quest these days to see artists that I’ve not yet seen LIVE before, it has been few and far between that I’ve seen ‘younger’ artists perform lately. Hillary Scott 37, Charles Kelley 41, and Dave Haywood 40 showed their youth in both their voices and their energy levels. There was an opener from Nashville, singer/songwriter Dave Barnes who took the stage in typical Peace Center regime precisely at 7:30. Capturing the crowds attention immediately he stated, ‘I do wanna thank Lady A for closing out the show for me tonight, it means a lot!’ The South Carolina native who is with Lady A for the duration of the tour is no newcomer to the music industry, his first of eight studio albums was released back in 2000. Playing a 6 song / 40 minute acoustic set from his Greatest Hits CD he seemed at times more of a stand up comedian spending equal time story telling as he did playing music. With tales of drunk angels, church gossip groups (‘wandering eyes lead to wandering thighs’) and an incident in Charleston where someone rushed the stage at him, the audience ate it up fueling hid comic relief. Ending his set to the surprise of everyone was a version of Blake Shelton’s #1 ‘God Gave Me You’ which David originally wrote back in 2010. Lady A brought him back on stage during their performance of ‘Walking In Memphis’ coining the addition to their line up as ‘The Double Daves’. To anyone who hasn’t seen Lady A, they’re a class act and they have the performance nailed down, nothing super-fancy, but it’ll make for a memorable evening with confidence that your ticket money was well spent. A quick word about the name change, the Nashville trio will always remain Lady Antebellum to me. It seems as if the name change brought on more controversy than the name itself. It was innocently chosen (search it out for yourself) and the change ensued a lawsuit with black gospel singer Anita White who had been using ‘Lady A’ for years along, with more allegations of racism. I can see both sides, and unfortunately it is what it is! Entering the venue the first thing I noted to my wife was, ‘This is the most “normal” looking crowd I’ve ever seen’. Then stepping back for a moment I added, ‘Except there is one thing missing, folk of a darker hue then that of ourselves’. t does makes one think!” Review and photo by DAve (Concert #788)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"DAve"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Lady A","genre":"Country","sameAs":"http://facebook.com/ladyaband","description":"This vocal trio slammed into the Country Music scene with their self-titled debut CD on April 15, 2008.

This was show 4 or 5 for me & they never disappoint !! If there was one negative thing, it's that they only played 3 songs ( I think) from the new album. I get that the majority of ppl wouldn't like it if they did because they aren't familiar with it yet & wouldn't be able to sing along. Die hard fans like me, would've been able to though.The tribute 'midnight rider' to Gregg Alman was a nice addition to set list!All in all it was a great show & cant wait to see them again!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4.5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chris"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Lady A","genre":"Country","sameAs":"http://facebook.com/ladyaband","description":"This vocal trio slammed into the Country Music scene with their self-titled debut CD on April 15, 2008.

He is a really good performer and so is Hunter Hayes. He's so short it's adorable!! ?? Lady Antebellum's performance was absolutely AMAZING.

Joe Nichols, the opening act, was spot on. I knew many of his songs (Yeah, Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off, Sunny and 75 to name a couple). But Lady A played so wonderfully! They interacted with the crowd, told stories and sang beautifully. The set list was just to die for... I just fell in love with the band even more.

Lady A was amazing!!!!  We sat 4th row center. The view was awesome.  The acoustics were phenomenal.  The Met is beautiful.  I was close enough to look into Hillary Scott&#x27;s eyes and see just how amazingly beautiful she truly is.  I have seen Lady A 12 times before and they always put on an amazing show. 

The staff at the Met were so.kind and helpful.  I can&#x27;t wait tomeither see another band at the Met or Lady A again. Five stats aren&#x27;t enough.

In every category you can describe them they were fantastic!  They were personable, positive, and really seem to care about putting on a special show for those in attendance that evening.  The PA system/mix was tuned perfectly, the band was VERY tight and the song selection covered nearly entire 17 years they&#x27;ve been together.   We paid &quot;a lot&quot;of money to sit up front due to my poor eyes and yes, it was worth every cent!  What an incredible experience!

It had been a bit of a wait as I had originally purchased tickets back in April of 2022 and the show ha been postponed nearly 10 months. In August 2022 Lady A announced they were putting their tour on hold in order to support Charles Kelley on his sobriety journey. Happy to report Kelly is nearing the one year mark of sobriety and in his own words, ‘feeling super-blessed’ and ‘really grateful’! With 9 studio albums and 25 charted singles including 11 #1’s there would be no lack of material for the Grammy and ACM/CMA award winning Grand Ole Opry members. The Peace Center Hall was the ideal venue and my seats 4th row upper balcony delivered great sound and a comprehensive overview of the stage. The stage L to R would have the three members in the forefront (Kelley, Haywood, Scott) with guitars and bass behind them to the wings, drums and keyboard on separate risers in the rear, the risers had illuminated lateral snowflake/asterisk symbols on the front. A diagonally facing piano was directly center stage and eight freestanding retro styled amber spotlights completed the background positioned in order of a candelabra (shortest at the ends, longest in the center). There were no video screens. The band took the stage at 8:30 for a 1.45 hour / 22 song set beginning hot with a pair of #1’s 2009’s ‘I Run To You’ and 2010’s ‘American Honey’! Charles addressed the audience, ‘We wanted to do something different this tour and we know that a lot of the songs too for you guys your favorites sometimes aren’t always the radio singles and so hence The Request Line Tour. So we took requests, we had people texting, and calling, as the kids call it “Slide in their DM’s”’. With that they played the first of two voice mails over the system and called out the name of the individual ‘Gloria’ to see if she was in attendance. Spotting her in one of the opera boxes Hillary dedicated the song 2010’s #22 ‘Wanted You More’ to her. Next Dave Hayward addressed us as the house lights shown, ‘Oh, there’s a second balcony’. Charles replied, ‘I didn’t even notice during our forty-five minute sound check’. A second voice mail came in this time from Zach as he was spotted in (you guessed it) the second balcony. ‘Somebody give Zachary better seats’, Charles advised. ‘What I’m Leaving For’ a #39 from 2020 was dedicated to Zach. They three were clearly having a good time Dave commenting on what a great town we have. Charles added, ‘This feels like a hometown show for us being from Augusta down the road’. There were family in the audience including Charles 4 1/2 year old nephew, Hillary’s daughter, and Dave’s wife and they had taken their kids to the Children’s Museum earlier in the day. They broke from set the entire show, trying to follow along from previous shows set lists proved a futile task. There was a notebook of all their songs placed a top the piano which they’ve had to use from time to time during the request tour as well as a bright yellow dial telephone. Later during the encore the phone was signed and given away to an audience member of Hillary’s daughter Eisele’s choice as she carried it into the audience in search of a lucky fan. The #1 ‘Just A Kiss’ was inserted perfectly mid-set to keep momentum going. During ‘Army’ (unreleased as a single) were the band intros, every member an accomplished musician with a resume’ beginning with Dennis on bass, then Jon on keys, Butch on guitar, and Ian on drums. The band’s lead guitarist Slim Gambill who states he loves ‘sideman land’ was next. His time with NBC&#x27;s Last Call With Carson afforded him work on stage with John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5, Peter Frampton, Stevie Nicks and many more. He’s more than a great addition to Lady A, he showed himself as a 4th member of the group many times throughout the evening. Hillary spoke next, ‘We wanna take one of the songs y’all might now and “Operafi it”’. With banjo and accordion they turned their 2013’s #6  ‘Compass’ into a sing-along medley adding in Country standards ‘Meet In The Middle-Dust On The Bottle-Forever And Ever Amen-Jolene’. Next the lights dimmed and stools were brought out as Charles spoke, ‘I’ve been on a little journey myself these days, next week I will be celebrating one year of sobriety.’ ‘I wrote this “Goodbye Letter” to my drink of choice which is whiskey.’ Turned into a song titled ‘As Far As You Could’, the letter’s lyrics “Whiskey you took me as far as you could take me, now it’s time to let you go”’ were especially moving. The powerful moment came when he sang the line ‘Who’s standing now’ and rose to his feet, and so did the crowd. This was indeed a legit “Goodbye Letter to Alcohol” as I can arrest from experience having written one myself nine years ago in rehab. After a standing ovation for Charles the band had a little fun with a melody. ’There’s one song that any song can be sung over’ turned out it was Don Henley’s ‘The Boy’s Of Summer’ and they put it into a medley incorporating in ‘Shake It Off-Mmmbop-l Wanna Dance With Somebody-My Heart Will Go On. Hearing songs from Swift, Hanson, Whitney, and Celine was something I never expected at a Country show, but it worked! Concluding the regular set were #1 ‘We Owned The Night’, #2 ‘Downtown’, and #3 ‘Love Don’t Live Here’. The first of a two song encore was ‘A Love Song’, a yet to be released new single sung in a stripped down version with just the three of them. ’Need You Now’ brought the concert a grand conclusion, everyone on their feet. Noticeably missing from the set was 2011’s ‘Lookin For A Good Time’. In my quest these days to see artists that I’ve not yet seen LIVE before, it has been few and far between that I’ve seen ‘younger’ artists perform lately. Hillary Scott 37, Charles Kelley 41, and Dave Haywood 40 showed their youth in both their voices and their energy levels. There was an opener from Nashville, singer/songwriter Dave Barnes who took the stage in typical Peace Center regime precisely at 7:30. Capturing the crowds attention immediately he stated, ‘I do wanna thank Lady A for closing out the show for me tonight, it means a lot!’ The South Carolina native who is with Lady A for the duration of the tour is no newcomer to the music industry, his first of eight studio albums was released back in 2000. Playing a 6 song / 40 minute acoustic set from his Greatest Hits CD he seemed at times more of a stand up comedian spending equal time story telling as he did playing music. With tales of drunk angels, church gossip groups (‘wandering eyes lead to wandering thighs’) and an incident in Charleston where someone rushed the stage at him, the audience ate it up fueling hid comic relief. Ending his set to the surprise of everyone was a version of Blake Shelton’s #1 ‘God Gave Me You’ which David originally wrote back in 2010. Lady A brought him back on stage during their performance of ‘Walking In Memphis’ coining the addition to their line up as ‘The Double Daves’. To anyone who hasn’t seen Lady A, they’re a class act and they have the performance nailed down, nothing super-fancy, but it’ll make for a memorable evening with confidence that your ticket money was well spent. A quick word about the name change, the Nashville trio will always remain Lady Antebellum to me. It seems as if the name change brought on more controversy than the name itself. It was innocently chosen (search it out for yourself) and the change ensued a lawsuit with black gospel singer Anita White who had been using ‘Lady A’ for years along, with more allegations of racism. I can see both sides, and unfortunately it is what it is! Entering the venue the first thing I noted to my wife was, ‘This is the most “normal” looking crowd I’ve ever seen’.

There was some problems with the production however. The sound mixing left a lot to be desired. There was no attempt to balance the sounds, the bass guitar and the drum drowned out the vocals often all night long. The best part of the concert was the unplugged vocals where the sound mixing was not applicable. Early on on the Lady A set it was so ridiculously loud and unbalaced there was bass feedback through out the first 3 songs.
Unfortunately, it was hard at times to tell what song it was even though I know them all. The musicians were all excellent however.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">West Tulsa, OK</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">The Cove at River Spirit Casino Resort</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/03.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Annie</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">June 2nd 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">All in all it was a great show.

Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to go to another one of their performances.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Wheatland, CA</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Toyota Amphitheatre</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/01.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Erica</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">July 25th 2014</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">The show was just amazing! Joe Nichols, the opening act, was spot on. I knew many of his songs (Yeah, Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off, Sunny and 75 to name a couple). But Lady A played so wonderfully! They interacted with the crowd, told stories and sang beautifully. The set list was just to die for... I just fell in love with the band even more.

They scored their first number 1 hit with the song "I Run To You" July 2009. They write their own songs, typically about relationships, in a unique blend that mingles classic country, 1960s R&B soulfulness and the heart-on-the-sleeve openness of 1970s singer-songwriters, all presented with a razor-sharp contemporary edge.</div><div class="Tvc0ZULwLMLk0DBHNKIP">Show More</div></div><div class="dsGU9cvaR_ciPBMcGU2u"><div class="IDH4vkBiPw7kU9QI4ut6">Genres: </div><div

I was close enough to look into Hillary Scott&#x27;s eyes and see just how amazingly beautiful she truly is.  I have seen Lady A 12 times before and they always put on an amazing show. 

The staff at the Met were so.kind and helpful.  I can&#x27;t wait tomeither see another band at the Met or Lady A again. Five stats aren&#x27;t enough.

In every category you can describe them they were fantastic!  They were personable, positive, and really seem to care about putting on a special show for those in attendance that evening.  The PA system/mix was tuned perfectly, the band was VERY tight and the song selection covered nearly entire 17 years they&#x27;ve been together.   We paid &quot;a lot&quot;of money to sit up front due to my poor eyes and yes, it was worth every cent!  What an incredible experience!

It had been a bit of a wait as I had originally purchased tickets back in April of 2022 and the show ha been postponed nearly 10 months. In August 2022 Lady A announced they were putting their tour on hold in order to support Charles Kelley on his sobriety journey. Happy to report Kelly is nearing the one year mark of sobriety and in his own words, ‘feeling super-blessed’ and ‘really grateful’! With 9 studio albums and 25 charted singles including 11 #1’s there would be no lack of material for the Grammy and ACM/CMA award winning Grand Ole Opry members. The Peace Center Hall was the ideal venue and my seats 4th row upper balcony delivered great sound and a comprehensive overview of the stage. The stage L to R would have the three members in the forefront (Kelley, Haywood, Scott) with guitars and bass behind them to the wings, drums and keyboard on separate risers in the rear, the risers had illuminated lateral snowflake/asterisk symbols on the front. A diagonally facing piano was directly center stage and eight freestanding retro styled amber spotlights completed the background positioned in order of a candelabra (shortest at the ends, longest in the center). There were no video screens. The band took the stage at 8:30 for a 1.45 hour / 22 song set beginning hot with a pair of #1’s 2009’s ‘I Run To You’ and 2010’s ‘American Honey’! Charles addressed the audience, ‘We wanted to do something different this tour and we know that a lot of the songs too for you guys your favorites sometimes aren’t always the radio singles and so hence The Request Line Tour. So we took requests, we had people texting, and calling, as the kids call it “Slide in their DM’s”’. With that they played the first of two voice mails over the system and called out the name of the individual ‘Gloria’ to see if she was in attendance. Spotting her in one of the opera boxes Hillary dedicated the song 2010’s #22 ‘Wanted You More’ to her. Next Dave Hayward addressed us as the house lights shown, ‘Oh, there’s a second balcony’. Charles replied, ‘I didn’t even notice during our forty-five minute sound check’. A second voice mail came in this time from Zach as he was spotted in (you guessed it) the second balcony. ‘Somebody give Zachary better seats’, Charles advised. ‘What I’m Leaving For’ a #39 from 2020 was dedicated to Zach. They three were clearly having a good time Dave commenting on what a great town we have. Charles added, ‘This feels like a hometown show for us being from Augusta down the road’. There were family in the audience including Charles 4 1/2 year old nephew, Hillary’s daughter, and Dave’s wife and they had taken their kids to the Children’s Museum earlier in the day. They broke from set the entire show, trying to follow along from previous shows set lists proved a futile task. There was a notebook of all their songs placed a top the piano which they’ve had to use from time to time during the request tour as well as a bright yellow dial telephone. Later during the encore the phone was signed and given away to an audience member of Hillary’s daughter Eisele’s choice as she carried it into the audience in search of a lucky fan. The #1 ‘Just A Kiss’ was inserted perfectly mid-set to keep momentum going. During ‘Army’ (unreleased as a single) were the band intros, every member an accomplished musician with a resume’ beginning with Dennis on bass, then Jon on keys, Butch on guitar, and Ian on drums. The band’s lead guitarist Slim Gambill who states he loves ‘sideman land’ was next. His time with NBC&#x27;s Last Call With Carson afforded him work on stage with John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5, Peter Frampton, Stevie Nicks and many more. He’s more than a great addition to Lady A, he showed himself as a 4th member of the group many times throughout the evening. Hillary spoke next, ‘We wanna take one of the songs y’all might now and “Operafi it”’. With banjo and accordion they turned their 2013’s #6  ‘Compass’ into a sing-along medley adding in Country standards ‘Meet In The Middle-Dust On The Bottle-Forever And Ever Amen-Jolene’. Next the lights dimmed and stools were brought out as Charles spoke, ‘I’ve been on a little journey myself these days, next week I will be celebrating one year of sobriety.’ ‘I wrote this “Goodbye Letter” to my drink of choice which is whiskey.’ Turned into a song titled ‘As Far As You Could’, the letter’s lyrics “Whiskey you took me as far as you could take me, now it’s time to let you go”’ were especially moving. The powerful moment came when he sang the line ‘Who’s standing now’ and rose to his feet, and so did the crowd. This was indeed a legit “Goodbye Letter to Alcohol” as I can arrest from experience having written one myself nine years ago in rehab. After a standing ovation for Charles the band had a little fun with a melody. ’There’s one song that any song can be sung over’ turned out it was Don Henley’s ‘The Boy’s Of Summer’ and they put it into a medley incorporating in ‘Shake It Off-Mmmbop-l Wanna Dance With Somebody-My Heart Will Go On. Hearing songs from Swift, Hanson, Whitney, and Celine was something I never expected at a Country show, but it worked! Concluding the regular set were #1 ‘We Owned The Night’, #2 ‘Downtown’, and #3 ‘Love Don’t Live Here’. The first of a two song encore was ‘A Love Song’, a yet to be released new single sung in a stripped down version with just the three of them. ’Need You Now’ brought the concert a grand conclusion, everyone on their feet. Noticeably missing from the set was 2011’s ‘Lookin For A Good Time’. In my quest these days to see artists that I’ve not yet seen LIVE before, it has been few and far between that I’ve seen ‘younger’ artists perform lately. Hillary Scott 37, Charles Kelley 41, and Dave Haywood 40 showed their youth in both their voices and their energy levels. There was an opener from Nashville, singer/songwriter Dave Barnes who took the stage in typical Peace Center regime precisely at 7:30. Capturing the crowds attention immediately he stated, ‘I do wanna thank Lady A for closing out the show for me tonight, it means a lot!’ The South Carolina native who is with Lady A for the duration of the tour is no newcomer to the music industry, his first of eight studio albums was released back in 2000. Playing a 6 song / 40 minute acoustic set from his Greatest Hits CD he seemed at times more of a stand up comedian spending equal time story telling as he did playing music. With tales of drunk angels, church gossip groups (‘wandering eyes lead to wandering thighs’) and an incident in Charleston where someone rushed the stage at him, the audience ate it up fueling hid comic relief. Ending his set to the surprise of everyone was a version of Blake Shelton’s #1 ‘God Gave Me You’ which David originally wrote back in 2010. Lady A brought him back on stage during their performance of ‘Walking In Memphis’ coining the addition to their line up as ‘The Double Daves’. To anyone who hasn’t seen Lady A, they’re a class act and they have the performance nailed down, nothing super-fancy, but it’ll make for a memorable evening with confidence that your ticket money was well spent. A quick word about the name change, the Nashville trio will always remain Lady Antebellum to me. It seems as if the name change brought on more controversy than the name itself. It was innocently chosen (search it out for yourself) and the change ensued a lawsuit with black gospel singer Anita White who had been using ‘Lady A’ for years along, with more allegations of racism. I can see both sides, and unfortunately it is what it is! Entering the venue the first thing I noted to my wife was, ‘This is the most “normal” looking crowd I’ve ever seen’. Then stepping back for a moment I added, ‘Except there is one thing missing, folk of a darker hue then that of ourselves’. t does makes one think!” Review and photo by DAve (Concert #788)</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Greenville, SC</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Peace Concert Hall - Peace Center</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/07.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Martin</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">June 11th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">This was such a great show.

There was some problems with the production however. The sound mixing left a lot to be desired. There was no attempt to balance the sounds, the bass guitar and the drum drowned out the vocals often all night long. The best part of the concert was the unplugged vocals where the sound mixing was not applicable. Early on on the Lady A set it was so ridiculously loud and unbalaced there was bass feedback through out the first 3 songs.
Unfortunately, it was hard at times to tell what song it was even though I know them all. The musicians were all excellent however.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">West Tulsa, OK</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">The Cove at River Spirit Casino Resort</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/05.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/03.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Annie</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">June 2nd 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">All in all it was a great show.

Die hard fans like me, would&#x27;ve been able to though.The tribute &#x27;midnight rider&#x27; to Gregg Alman was a nice addition to set list!All in all it was a great show &amp; cant wait to see them again!</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Holmdel, NJ</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">PNC Bank Arts Center</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/08.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/08.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Amy</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">May 28th 2017</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Best way to start off the concert year!!! with my bestie and my hubby! hubby&#x27;s first concert ever and I think he had more fun than me lol!

They write their own songs, typically about relationships, in a unique blend that mingles classic country, 1960s R&B soulfulness and the heart-on-the-sleeve openness of 1970s singer-songwriters, all presented with a razor-sharp contemporary edge.</div><div class="Tvc0ZULwLMLk0DBHNKIP">Show More</div></div><div class="dsGU9cvaR_ciPBMcGU2u"><div class="IDH4vkBiPw7kU9QI4ut6">Genres: </div><div

The PA system/mix was tuned perfectly, the band was VERY tight and the song selection covered nearly entire 17 years they've been together.

It had been a bit of a wait as I had originally purchased tickets back in April of 2022 and the show ha been postponed nearly 10 months. In August 2022 Lady A announced they were putting their tour on hold in order to support Charles Kelley on his sobriety journey. Happy to report Kelly is nearing the one year mark of sobriety and in his own words, ‘feeling super-blessed’ and ‘really grateful’! With 9 studio albums and 25 charted singles including 11 #1’s there would be no lack of material for the Grammy and ACM/CMA award winning Grand Ole Opry members. The Peace Center Hall was the ideal venue and my seats 4th row upper balcony delivered great sound and a comprehensive overview of the stage. The stage L to R would have the three members in the forefront (Kelley, Haywood, Scott) with guitars and bass behind them to the wings, drums and keyboard on separate risers in the rear, the risers had illuminated lateral snowflake/asterisk symbols on the front. A diagonally facing piano was directly center stage and eight freestanding retro styled amber spotlights completed the background positioned in order of a candelabra (shortest at the ends, longest in the center). There were no video screens. The band took the stage at 8:30 for a 1.45 hour / 22 song set beginning hot with a pair of #1’s 2009’s ‘I Run To You’ and 2010’s ‘American Honey’! Charles addressed the audience, ‘We wanted to do something different this tour and we know that a lot of the songs too for you guys your favorites sometimes aren’t always the radio singles and so hence The Request Line Tour. So we took requests, we had people texting, and calling, as the kids call it “Slide in their DM’s”’. With that they played the first of two voice mails over the system and called out the name of the individual ‘Gloria’ to see if she was in attendance. Spotting her in one of the opera boxes Hillary dedicated the song 2010’s #22 ‘Wanted You More’ to her. Next Dave Hayward addressed us as the house lights shown, ‘Oh, there’s a second balcony’. Charles replied, ‘I didn’t even notice during our forty-five minute sound check’. A second voice mail came in this time from Zach as he was spotted in (you guessed it) the second balcony. ‘Somebody give Zachary better seats’, Charles advised. ‘What I’m Leaving For’ a #39 from 2020 was dedicated to Zach. They three were clearly having a good time Dave commenting on what a great town we have. Charles added, ‘This feels like a hometown show for us being from Augusta down the road’. There were family in the audience including Charles 4 1/2 year old nephew, Hillary’s daughter, and Dave’s wife and they had taken their kids to the Children’s Museum earlier in the day. They broke from set the entire show, trying to follow along from previous shows set lists proved a futile task. There was a notebook of all their songs placed a top the piano which they’ve had to use from time to time during the request tour as well as a bright yellow dial telephone. Later during the encore the phone was signed and given away to an audience member of Hillary’s daughter Eisele’s choice as she carried it into the audience in search of a lucky fan. The #1 ‘Just A Kiss’ was inserted perfectly mid-set to keep momentum going. During ‘Army’ (unreleased as a single) were the band intros, every member an accomplished musician with a resume’ beginning with Dennis on bass, then Jon on keys, Butch on guitar, and Ian on drums. The band’s lead guitarist Slim Gambill who states he loves ‘sideman land’ was next. His time with NBC's Last Call With Carson afforded him work on stage with John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5, Peter Frampton, Stevie Nicks and many more. He’s more than a great addition to Lady A, he showed himself as a 4th member of the group many times throughout the evening. Hillary spoke next, ‘We wanna take one of the songs y’all might now and “Operafi it”’. With banjo and accordion they turned their 2013’s #6  ‘Compass’ into a sing-along medley adding in Country standards ‘Meet In The Middle-Dust On The Bottle-Forever And Ever Amen-Jolene’. Next the lights dimmed and stools were brought out as Charles spoke, ‘I’ve been on a little journey myself these days, next week I will be celebrating one year of sobriety.’ ‘I wrote this “Goodbye Letter” to my drink of choice which is whiskey.’ Turned into a song titled ‘As Far As You Could’, the letter’s lyrics “Whiskey you took me as far as you could take me, now it’s time to let you go”’ were especially moving. The powerful moment came when he sang the line ‘Who’s standing now’ and rose to his feet, and so did the crowd. This was indeed a legit “Goodbye Letter to Alcohol” as I can arrest from experience having written one myself nine years ago in rehab. After a standing ovation for Charles the band had a little fun with a melody. ’There’s one song that any song can be sung over’ turned out it was Don Henley’s ‘The Boy’s Of Summer’ and they put it into a medley incorporating in ‘Shake It Off-Mmmbop-l Wanna Dance With Somebody-My Heart Will Go On. Hearing songs from Swift, Hanson, Whitney, and Celine was something I never expected at a Country show, but it worked! Concluding the regular set were #1 ‘We Owned The Night’, #2 ‘Downtown’, and #3 ‘Love Don’t Live Here’. The first of a two song encore was ‘A Love Song’, a yet to be released new single sung in a stripped down version with just the three of them. ’Need You Now’ brought the concert a grand conclusion, everyone on their feet. Noticeably missing from the set was 2011’s ‘Lookin For A Good Time’. In my quest these days to see artists that I’ve not yet seen LIVE before, it has been few and far between that I’ve seen ‘younger’ artists perform lately. Hillary Scott 37, Charles Kelley 41, and Dave Haywood 40 showed their youth in both their voices and their energy levels. There was an opener from Nashville, singer/songwriter Dave Barnes who took the stage in typical Peace Center regime precisely at 7:30. Capturing the crowds attention immediately he stated, ‘I do wanna thank Lady A for closing out the show for me tonight, it means a lot!’ The South Carolina native who is with Lady A for the duration of the tour is no newcomer to the music industry, his first of eight studio albums was released back in 2000. Playing a 6 song / 40 minute acoustic set from his Greatest Hits CD he seemed at times more of a stand up comedian spending equal time story telling as he did playing music. With tales of drunk angels, church gossip groups (‘wandering eyes lead to wandering thighs’) and an incident in Charleston where someone rushed the stage at him, the audience ate it up fueling hid comic relief. Ending his set to the surprise of everyone was a version of Blake Shelton’s #1 ‘God Gave Me You’ which David originally wrote back in 2010. Lady A brought him back on stage during their performance of ‘Walking In Memphis’ coining the addition to their line up as ‘The Double Daves’. To anyone who hasn’t seen Lady A, they’re a class act and they have the performance nailed down, nothing super-fancy, but it’ll make for a memorable evening with confidence that your ticket money was well spent. A quick word about the name change, the Nashville trio will always remain Lady Antebellum to me. It seems as if the name change brought on more controversy than the name itself. It was innocently chosen (search it out for yourself) and the change ensued a lawsuit with black gospel singer Anita White who had been using ‘Lady A’ for years along, with more allegations of racism. I can see both sides, and unfortunately it is what it is! Entering the venue the first thing I noted to my wife was, ‘This is the most “normal” looking crowd I’ve ever seen’. Then stepping back for a moment I added, ‘Except there is one thing missing, folk of a darker hue then that of ourselves’. t does makes one think!” Review and photo by DAve (Concert #788)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"DAve"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Lady A","genre":"Country","sameAs":"http://facebook.com/ladyaband","description":"This vocal trio slammed into the Country Music scene with their self-titled debut CD on April 15, 2008.

There was some problems with the production however. The sound mixing left a lot to be desired. There was no attempt to balance the sounds, the bass guitar and the drum drowned out the vocals often all night long. The best part of the concert was the unplugged vocals where the sound mixing was not applicable. Early on on the Lady A set it was so ridiculously loud and unbalaced there was bass feedback through out the first 3 songs.\r\nUnfortunately, it was hard at times to tell what song it was even though I know them all. The musicians were all excellent however.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":3,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Greg"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Lady A","genre":"Country","sameAs":"http://facebook.com/ladyaband","description":"This vocal trio slammed into the Country Music scene with their self-titled debut CD on April 15, 2008.

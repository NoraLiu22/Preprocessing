<p>Geographers traditionally divide the vast territory of Russia into
        five natural zones: the tundra zone; the taiga, or forest, zone; the
        steppe, or plains, zone; the arid zone; and the mountain zone. Most of
        Russia consists of two plains (the East European Plain and the West
        Siberian Plain), two lowlands (the North Siberian and the Kolyma, in far
        northeastern Siberia), two plateaus (the Central Siberian Plateau and
        the Lena Plateau to its east), and a series of mountainous areas mainly
        concentrated in the extreme northeast or extending intermittently along
        the southern border.</p>
        <h3>Topography</h3>
        <p>The East European Plain encompasses most of European Russia. The West
        Siberian Plain, which is the world's largest, extends east from the
        Urals to the Yenisey River. Because the terrain and vegetation are
        relatively uniform in each of the natural zones, Russia presents an
        illusion of uniformity. Nevertheless, Russian territory contains all the
        major vegetation zones of the world except a tropical rain forest.</p>
        <p>About 10 percent of Russia is tundra, or treeless, marshy plain. The
        tundra is Russia's northernmost zone, stretching from the Finnish border
        in the west to the Bering Strait in the east, then running south along
        the Pacific coast to the northern Kamchatka Peninsula. The zone is known
        for its herds of wild reindeer, for so-called white nights (dusk at
        midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total
        darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow
        only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above
        the barren permafrost (see Glossary). Although several powerful Siberian
        rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean,
        partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes,
        ponds, and swamps of the tundra. Frost weathering is the most important
        physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely
        modified by glaciation in the last ice age. Less than 1 percent of
        Russia's population lives in this zone. The fishing and port industries
        of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge oil and gas fields of
        northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a
        population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of Noril'sk is
        second in population to Murmansk among Russia's settlements above the
        Arctic Circle.</p>
        <p>The taiga, which is the world's largest forest region, contains
        mostly coniferous spruce, fir, cedar, and larch. This is the largest
        natural zone of the Russian Federation, an area about the size of the
        United States. In the northeastern portion of this belt, long and severe
        winters frequently bring the world's coldest temperatures for inhabited
        areas. The taiga zone extends in a broad band across the middle
        latitudes, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the
        Verkhoyansk Range in northeastern Siberia and as far south as the
        southern shores of Lake Baikal. Isolated sections of taiga also exist
        along mountain ranges such as the southern part of the Urals and in the
        Amur River valley bordering China in the Far East. About 33 percent of
        Russia's population lives in this zone, which, together with a band of
        mixed forest to its south, includes most of the European part of Russia
        and the ancestral lands of the earliest Slavic settlers.</p>
        <p>The steppe has long been depicted as the typical Russian landscape.
        It is a broad band of treeless, grassy plains, interrupted by mountain
        ranges, extending from Hungary across Ukraine, southern Russia, and
        Kazakstan before ending in Manchuria. Most of the Soviet Union's steppe
        zone was located in the Ukrainian and Kazak republics; the much smaller
        Russian steppe is located mainly between those nations, extending
        southward between the Black and Caspian seas before blending into the
        increasingly desiccated territory of the Republic of Kalmykia. In a
        country of extremes, the steppe zone provides the most favorable
        conditions for human settlement and agriculture because of its moderate
        temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture. Even
        here, however, agricultural yields are sometimes adversely affected by
        unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic
        droughts.</p>
        <p>Russia's mountain ranges are located principally along its
        continental divide (the Urals), along the southwestern border (the
        Caucasus), along the border with Mongolia (the eastern and western Sayan
        ranges and the western extremity of the Altay Range), and in eastern
        Siberia (a complex system of ranges in the northeastern corner of the
        country and forming the spine of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and lesser
        mountains extending along the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan).
        Russia has nine major mountain ranges. In general, the eastern half of
        the country is much more mountainous than the western half, the interior
        of which is dominated by low plains. The traditional dividing line
        between the east and the west is the Yenisey Valley. In delineating the
        western edge of the Central Siberian Plateau from the West Siberian
        Plain, the Yenisey runs from near the Mongolian border northward into
        the Arctic Ocean west of the Taymyr Peninsula.</p>
        <p>The Urals are the most famous of the country's mountain ranges
        because they form the natural boundary between Europe and Asia and
        contain valuable mineral deposits. The range extends about 2,100
        kilometers from the Arctic Ocean to the northern border of Kazakstan. In
        terms of elevation and vegetation, however, the Urals are far from
        impressive, and they do not serve as a formidable natural barrier.
        Several low passes provide major transportation routes through the Urals
        eastward from Europe. The highest peak, Mount Narodnaya, is 1,894
        meters, lower than the highest of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
        <p>To the east of the Urals is the West Siberian Plain, which covers
        more than 2.5 million square kilometers, stretching about 1,900
        kilometers from west to east and about 2,400 kilometers from north to
        south. With more than half its territory below 500 meters in elevation,
        the plain contains some of the world's largest swamps and floodplains.
        Most of the plain's population lives in the drier section south of 55°
        north latitude.</p>
        <p>The region directly east of the West Siberian Plain is the Central
        Siberian Plateau, which extends eastward from the Yenisey River valley
        to the Lena River valley. The region is divided into several plateaus,
        with elevations ranging between 320 and 740 meters; the highest
        elevation is about 1,800 meters, in the northern Putoran Mountains. The
        plain is bounded on the south by the Baikal mountain system and on the
        north by the North Siberian Lowland, an extension of the West Siberian
        Plain extending into the Taymyr Peninsula on the Arctic Ocean.</p>
        <p>Truly alpine terrain appears in the southern mountain ranges. Between
        the Black and Caspian seas, the Caucasus Mountains rise to impressive
        heights, forming a boundary between Europe and Asia. One of the peaks,
        Mount Elbrus, is the highest point in Europe, at 5,642 meters. The
        geological structure of the Caucasus extends to the northwest as the
        Crimean and Carpathian mountains and southeastward into Central Asia as
        the Tian Shan and Pamirs. The Caucasus Mountains create an imposing
        natural barrier between Russia and its neighbors to the southwest,
        Georgia and Azerbaijan.</p>
        <p>In the mountain system west of Lake Baikal in south-central Siberia,
        the highest elevations are 3,300 meters in the Western Sayan, 3,200
        meters in the Eastern Sayan, and 4,500 meters at Mount Belukha in the
        Altay Range. The Eastern Sayan reach nearly to the southern shore of
        Lake Baikal; at the lake, there is an elevation difference of more than
        4,500 meters between the nearest mountain, 2,840 meters high, and the
        deepest part of the lake, which is 1,700 meters below sea level. The
        mountain systems east of Lake Baikal are lower, forming a complex of
        minor ranges and valleys that reaches from the lake to the Pacific
        coast. The maximum height of the Stanovoy Range, which runs west to east
        from northern Lake Baikal to the Sea of Okhotsk, is 2,550 meters. To the
        south of that range is southeastern Siberia, whose mountains reach 2,800
        feet. Across the Tatar Strait from that region is Sakhalin Island, where
        the highest elevation is about 1,700 meters.</p>
        <p>Northeastern Siberia, north of the Stanovoy Range, is an extremely
        mountainous region. The long Kamchatka Peninsula, which juts southward
        into the Sea of Okhotsk, includes many volcanic peaks, some of which
        still are active. The highest is the 4,750-meter Klyuchevskaya Volcano,
        the highest point in the Russian Far East. The volcanic chain continues
        from the southern tip of Kamchatka southward through the Kuril Islands
        chain and into Japan. Kamchatka also is one of Russia's two centers of
        seismic activity (the other is the Caucasus). In 1994 a major earthquake
        largely destroyed the oil-processing city of Neftegorsk.</p>
        <h3>Drainage</h3>
        <p>Russia is a water-rich country. The earliest settlements in the
        country sprang up along the rivers, where most of the urban population
        continues to live. The Volga, Europe's longest river, is by far Russia's
        most important commercial waterway. Four of the country's thirteen
        largest cities are located on its banks: Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara,
        Kazan', and Volgograd. The Kama River, which flows west from the
        southern Urals to join the Volga in the Republic of Tatarstan, is a
        second key European water system whose banks are densely populated.</p>
        <p>Russia has thousands of rivers and inland bodies of water, providing
        it with one of the world's largest surface-water resources. However,
        most of Russia's rivers and streams belong to the Arctic drainage basin,
        which lies mainly in Siberia but also includes part of European Russia.
        Altogether, 84 percent of Russia's surface water is located east of the
        Urals in rivers flowing through sparsely populated territory and into
        the Arctic and Pacific oceans. In contrast, areas with the highest
        concentrations of population, and therefore the highest demand for water
        supplies, tend to have the warmest climates and highest rates of
        evaporation. As a result, densely populated areas such as the Don and
        Kuban' river basins north of the Caucasus have barely adequate (or in
        some cases inadequate) water resources.</p>
        <p>Forty of Russia's rivers longer than 1,000 kilometers are east of the
        Urals, including the three major rivers that drain Siberia as they flow
        northward to the Arctic Ocean: the Irtysh-Ob' system (totaling 5,380
        kilometers), the Yenisey (4,000 kilometers), and the Lena (3,630
        kilometers). The basins of those river systems cover about 8 million
        square kilometers, discharging nearly 50,000 cubic meters of water per
        second into the Arctic Ocean. The northward flow of these rivers means
        that source areas thaw before the areas downstream, creating vast swamps
        such as the 48,000-square-kilometer Vasyugane Swamp in the center of the
        West Siberian Plain. The same is true of other river systems, including
        the Pechora and the North Dvina in Europe and the Kolyma and the
        Indigirka in Siberia. Approximately 10 percent of Russian territory is
        classified as swampland.</p>
        <p>A number of other rivers drain Siberia from eastern mountain ranges
        into the Pacific Ocean. The Amur River and its main tributary, the
        Ussuri, form a long stretch of the winding boundary between Russia and
        China. The Amur system drains most of southeastern Siberia. Three basins
        drain European Russia. The Dnepr, which flows mainly through Belarus and
        Ukraine, has its headwaters in the hills west of Moscow. The
        1,860-kilometer Don originates in the Central Russian Upland south of
        Moscow and then flows into the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea at
        Rostov-na-Donu. The Volga is the third and by far the largest of the
        European systems, rising in the Valday Hills west of Moscow and
        meandering southeastward for 3,510 kilometers before emptying into the
        Caspian Sea. Altogether, the Volga system drains about 1.4 million
        square kilometers. Linked by several canals, European Russia's rivers
        long have been a vital transportation system; the Volga system still
        carries two-thirds of Russia's inland water traffic (see Transportation,
        ch. 6).</p>
        <p>Russia's inland bodies of water are chiefly a legacy of extensive
        glaciation. In European Russia, the largest lakes are Ladoga and Onega
        northeast of St. Petersburg, Lake Peipus on the Estonian border, and the
        Rybinsk Reservoir north of Moscow. Smaller man-made reservoirs, 160 to
        320 kilometers long, are on the Don, the Kama, and the Volga rivers.
        Many large reservoirs also have been constructed on the Siberian rivers;
        the Bratsk Reservoir northwest of Lake Baikal is one of the world's
        largest.</p>
        <p>The most prominent of Russia's bodies of fresh water is Lake Baikal,
        the world's deepest and most capacious freshwater lake. Lake Baikal
        alone holds 85 percent of the freshwater resources of the lakes in
        Russia and 20 percent of the world's total. It extends 632 kilometers in
        length and fifty-nine kilometers across at its widest point. Its maximum
        depth is 1,713 meters. Numerous smaller lakes dot the northern regions
        of the European and Siberian plains. The largest of these are lakes
        Beloye, Topozero, Vyg, and Il'men' in the European northwest and Lake
        Chany in southwestern Siberia.</p>

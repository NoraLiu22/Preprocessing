<p>For the past few years, manager services and artist development company mtheory, have partnered with Goth Babe&#39;s manager Sean Sheahan, to develop his music marketing strategy, using a data-driven approach to promote Goth Babe’s experiential sound. So, when it came to building hype for his EP, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6n9SqKcGCx1RWJ7m1v8of8?si=P_301n8ITuWn4nUHJ_5UPg&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=ce058e2f87064245"><span><em>Iceland</em></span></a>, which dropped in November 2022 and his debut album, <em>Lola</em>, which will be released on January 26, 2024, his team turned to Campaign Kit to surface the right music – both new and catalog – where listeners were already streaming. “The end goal is helping artists connect with their fans. Being able to hone in on where artist fan bases actively are consuming their music already, and reach them there, is the best approach,” says mtheory’s Director of Marketing, Mira Brock. </p>
<p>Using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://artists.spotify.com/campaign-kit"><span>Campaign Kit</span></a> in Spotify for Artists, Goth Babe&#39;s team strategically grew his audience release by release. From deploying a &quot;staircase&quot; approach with Marquee to grow his audience with each release, to creating a second (or even third) life for catalog tracks with Discovery Mode, to using Showcase to build off success from Discovery Mode, Goth Babe&#39;s team creatively used Campaign Kit tools in lockstep with their overall marketing strategy. Let’s take a look at how Goth Babe’s team surfaced the right music at the right time to bring even more listeners into his musical ecosystem. </p>

<p>In the lead up to Goth Babe’s EP, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6n9SqKcGCx1RWJ7m1v8of8?si=P_301n8ITuWn4nUHJ_5UPg&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=ce058e2f87064245"><span><em>Iceland</em></span></a>, his team used Marquee’s full-screen format to deepen fandom with a series of new releases. The strategy: engage the right listeners more and more with each new drop. “We ran Marquee for every single release, with the idea that it would function like a staircase. By the time we reached an EP…we’d been building more and more listeners,” says Brock. </p>
<p>Included in that staircase strategy was Goth Babe’s previous EP, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6wv8zT8vG5EICl083UHoVm?si=mEqGond6TMylRFUv7LL9lw&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=955142733001428d"><span><em>Santa Catalina</em></span></a>. To maximize impact among listeners who hadn’t yet heard the release, Goth Babe’s team targeted all relevant Marquee listeners and ran the campaign later in the release cycle. As a result, the Marquee reached the widest set of listeners who hadn’t actively streamed yet – and more than 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the EP to their library or added it to a personal playlist.</p>
<p>“We used a Marquee the Wednesday after the release week,” continues Brock. “We waited for organic streaming to happen first and then Release Radar to hit on Tuesday. We wanted to maximize spend by reaching people who hadn’t streamed the song yet.”</p>
<p>With each step, Goth Babe’s team brought listeners deeper into his musical storytelling. To accelerate that journey, his team promoted his single <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1z5oBUPtPK58v4slX1AlTx?si=7c3e11495c254905&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=8338210c2996434f"><span><em>“Surfing in Iceland”</em></span></a> driving to his This Is playlist, where listeners could discover more of his sound after streaming the new release. </p>
<p>“It wasn’t just about the singles, but a catalog consumption experience,” says Brock. “Listening to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1z5oBUPtPK58v4slX1AlTx?si=7c3e11495c254905&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=8338210c2996434f"><span>‘<em>Surfing in Iceland</em>’</span></a> within the This Is playlist would help guide listeners into navigating the rest of the artist’s catalog.”</p>
<p>The strategy paid off.

<p>When Goth Babe’s team first started using Discovery Mode, they tested out the tool with catalog tracks that previously had not received a lot of listener activity. After seeing great results in terms of stream lift, they decided to include bigger catalog hits in their campaigns, such as Goth Babe&#39;s 2019 single, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=ad832bc93697421b"><span><em>&quot;Weekend Friend.&quot;</em></span></a>  With the help of Discovery Mode, streams of the track peaked in January 2023 when it experienced more than 3.2 million streams on Spotify — nearly 6x the streams it had generated in its first month of release.</p>
<p>“We’ve been pleased and blown away with the results of tracks such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=ad832bc93697421b"><span><em>“Weekend Friend”</em></span></a>. Discovery Mode gave <em>&#39;Weekend Friend&#39;</em> an entirely new life, but the fun part is also adding in tracks that were never focus tracks or hadn’t been playlisted before,” explains Jonah Berry, Vice President of mtheory. </p>
<p>This is a story that Goth Babe’s team has seen with other previously popular tracks as well, such as the single,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/track/08ZZ7SILfKcreLtA3K6Gqr?si=04afe7f74bdd4a38&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=9568d042c65b412f"><span><em>“I Wanna Help Your Mind,”</em></span></a> which also beat out streams from its initial release week in 2021, after it was included in Discovery Mode. It then reached its highest streaming peak in December 2022. Discovery Mode has given selected tracks not only an entirely new life, but also a second or third life in some cases.</p>
<p>Discovery Mode has also helped Goth Babe reach a more international audience. “Once we saw we were reaching a wider audience through Discovery Mode, we really doubled down on that and started using it to reach new listeners in new regions,” says Mira. With the help of Discovery Mode, Goth Babe has now reached new listeners in 160 markets across the world.</p>
<p>Discovery Mode has been key in re-engaging Goth Babe’s listeners and bringing new listeners, wherever they may be, into his listening ecosystem.</p>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:0.75em" class="Type__TypeElement-goli3j-0 gOnAVZ">Showcase built on Discovery Mode momentum</h2><p class="article-picture"><picture><img data-srcset="//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2gphFbB8ePx0t6QsD6qnB0/b6c69574c0108ecedd39a755ef0bf564/Asset_4___Showcase.png?w=480 480w, //images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2gphFbB8ePx0t6QsD6qnB0/b6c69574c0108ecedd39a755ef0bf564/Asset_4___Showcase.png?w=768 768w, //images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2gphFbB8ePx0t6QsD6qnB0/b6c69574c0108ecedd39a755ef0bf564/Asset_4___Showcase.png?w=1280 1280w, //images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2gphFbB8ePx0t6QsD6qnB0/b6c69574c0108ecedd39a755ef0bf564/Asset_4___Showcase.png?w=1600 1600w" srcSet="//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2gphFbB8ePx0t6QsD6qnB0/b6c69574c0108ecedd39a755ef0bf564/Asset_4___Showcase.png?fm=jpg&amp;h=10&amp;w=12" data-sizes="auto" alt="" style="display:block" class="ContentfulImage__StyledImage-sc-1w5lmts-0 ContentfulImage__StyledImageWithPlaceholder-sc-1w5lmts-1 dvEErQ gpSuGX lazyload"/></picture></p>
<p>After seeing the success Discovery Mode drove for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=ad832bc93697421b"><span><em>“Weekend Friend,”</em></span></a> Goth Babe’s team used Showcase to continue the momentum. </p>
<p>“With Showcase, it was really exciting to focus on a catalog release and have it highlighted on Spotify’s Home,” says Brock. </p>
<p>After reviewing data on Goth Babe’s audience segments, Goth Babe’s team decided to target his previously active audience with the campaign headline “You might like” to re-engage listeners who hadn’t recently streamed his music. With the help of Showcase, Goth Babe reactivated listeners who had fallen out of his active audience – 12% of previously active listeners who streamed the single saved it to their library or added it to a personal playlist. And their engagement wasn&#39;t limited to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=ad832bc93697421b"><span><em>“Weekend Friend”</em></span></a> — more than 18% of listeners went on to stream from Goth Babe’s other releases. With a cohort of reactivated listeners, Goth Babe is now ready to drop his debut album to an even more engaged audience. </p>

<p>For Goth Babe, the Campaign Kit tools work in harmony to ensure he engages the right listeners at various moments in the discovery and release cycle. </p>
<p>“All the products work really cohesively and in tandem,” Mira shares. “Using these tools together is about trying to cast a broad net to reach new listeners or less active ones and bring them closer in. Then when you have a new release, you can further engage these listeners. The goal is to build up Goth Babe’s daily streams and monthly listeners so that at the time of his next release he has the highest amount of listenership possible. Our marketing goal is to amplify an artist’s reach and Campaign Kit allows us to do exactly that — whether it’s for a catalog track or a new release.” </p>
<p>By using Campaign Kit tools together over the course of more than a year, Goth Babe’s team grew his monthly listeners metric to its highest-ever level, achieving their marketing goal ahead of his <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Link__defaultComponent-sc-13r4a93-0 fCeZCf  " href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6n9SqKcGCx1RWJ7m1v8of8?si=P_301n8ITuWn4nUHJ_5UPg&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=f6e05504fd8e490b"><span><em>Iceland</em></span></a> EP release, and in preparation for his debut album release, <em>Lola</em>.</p>
<p>Campaign Kit made it easy for Goth Babe’s team to measure the impact of their campaigns and constantly iterate on strategy. They were especially focused on intent rate — a measure of likelihood of long-term fandom. </p>
<p>“We can look at the data to understand what works and what listeners are resonating with. Intent rate is really valuable to us because it shows the listeners’ intent to stream more music. That’s the ultimate success of a campaign — bringing in new listeners, but also having them intend to stick around and continue engaging with the artist,” adds Mira.</p>
<p>For Goth Babe and his team, it’s all about bringing listeners into his musical world and creating a shared experience.

team used Campaign Kit to build momentum and invite listeners deeper into his experiential catalog. The approach drove the highest-ever listenership for his EP and gave “a new life” to his broader catalog – with several tracks surpassing their initial release week streams.\n","article":"For Griff Washburn – who performs as indie electronic artist [Goth Babe](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7o96HO2zrujyATtVsqGhh3?si=eiAgk1GfQZel1weKa3xpBA\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=c2ff326003934572) – his music echoes his adventurous spirit. His sound brings listeners across his journey through nature, from sailing along the coast of Mexico to exploring the great outdoors in a camper van. \n\nFor the past few years, manager services and artist development company mtheory, have partnered with Goth Babe's manager Sean Sheahan, to develop his music marketing strategy, using a data-driven approach to promote Goth Babe’s experiential sound. So, when it came to building hype for his EP, [*Iceland*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6n9SqKcGCx1RWJ7m1v8of8?si=P_301n8ITuWn4nUHJ_5UPg\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=ce058e2f87064245), which dropped in November 2022 and his debut album, *Lola*, which will be released on January 26, 2024, his team turned to Campaign Kit to surface the right music – both new and catalog – where listeners were already streaming. “The end goal is helping artists connect with their fans. Being able to hone in on where artist fan bases actively are consuming their music already, and reach them there, is the best approach,” says mtheory’s Director of Marketing, Mira Brock. \n\nUsing [Campaign Kit](https://artists.spotify.com/campaign-kit) in Spotify for Artists, Goth Babe's team strategically grew his audience release by release. From deploying a \"staircase\" approach with Marquee to grow his audience with each release, to creating a second (or even third) life for catalog tracks with Discovery Mode, to using Showcase to build off success from Discovery Mode, Goth Babe's team creatively used Campaign Kit tools in lockstep with their overall marketing strategy. Let’s take a look at how Goth Babe’s team surfaced the right music at the right time to bring even more listeners into his musical ecosystem. \n\n## Marquee Brought Listeners Into Goth Babe’s Storytelling Over Time\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/18lSDTocVDHx1Z1jAi85Ei/3421908a3bf323b52b4a0a0686b1c661/Asset_2___Marquee.png)\n\nIn the lead up to Goth Babe’s EP, [*Iceland*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6n9SqKcGCx1RWJ7m1v8of8?si=P_301n8ITuWn4nUHJ_5UPg\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=ce058e2f87064245), his team used Marquee’s full-screen format to deepen fandom with a series of new releases. The strategy: engage the right listeners more and more with each new drop. “We ran Marquee for every single release, with the idea that it would function like a staircase. By the time we reached an EP…we’d been building more and more listeners,” says Brock. \n\nIncluded in that staircase strategy was Goth Babe’s previous EP, [*Santa Catalina*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6wv8zT8vG5EICl083UHoVm?si=mEqGond6TMylRFUv7LL9lw\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=955142733001428d). To maximize impact among listeners who hadn’t yet heard the release, Goth Babe’s team targeted all relevant Marquee listeners and ran the campaign later in the release cycle. As a result, the Marquee reached the widest set of listeners who hadn’t actively streamed yet – and more than 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the EP to their library or added it to a personal playlist.\n\n“We used a Marquee the Wednesday after the release week,” continues Brock. “We waited for organic streaming to happen first and then Release Radar to hit on Tuesday. We wanted to maximize spend by reaching people who hadn’t streamed the song yet.”\n\nWith each step, Goth Babe’s team brought listeners deeper into his musical storytelling. To accelerate that journey, his team promoted his single [*“Surfing in Iceland”*](https://open.spotify.com/track/1z5oBUPtPK58v4slX1AlTx?si=7c3e11495c254905\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=8338210c2996434f) driving to his This Is playlist, where listeners could discover more of his sound after streaming the new release. \n\n“It wasn’t just about the singles, but a catalog consumption experience,” says Brock. “Listening to [‘*Surfing in Iceland*’](https://open.spotify.com/track/1z5oBUPtPK58v4slX1AlTx?si=7c3e11495c254905\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=8338210c2996434f) within the This Is playlist would help guide listeners into navigating the rest of the artist’s catalog.”\n\nThe strategy paid off. The Marquee for [*“Surfing in Iceland”*](https://open.spotify.com/track/1z5oBUPtPK58v4slX1AlTx?si=7c3e11495c254905\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=8338210c2996434f) drove nearly 4x more listeners of Goth Babe’s broader catalog, as compared to previous campaigns promoted to the singles or EPs page – meaning the Marquee prompted listeners to dive deeper into the Goth Babe experience.\n\n## Discovery Mode Brought New Life to Goth Babe’s Catalog Tracks\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/4405Sld8UQxFn0B8BZiwq1/09089c1ed8ff89134c17777b3d9d1d64/Asset_3___Discovery_Mode.png)\n\nWhen Goth Babe’s team first started using Discovery Mode, they tested out the tool with catalog tracks that previously had not received a lot of listener activity. After seeing great results in terms of stream lift, they decided to include bigger catalog hits in their campaigns, such as Goth Babe's 2019 single, [*\"Weekend Friend.\"*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=ad832bc93697421b)  With the help of Discovery Mode, streams of the track peaked in January 2023 when it experienced more than 3.2 million streams on Spotify — nearly 6x the streams it had generated in its first month of release.\n\n“We’ve been pleased and blown away with the results of tracks such as [*“Weekend Friend”*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=ad832bc93697421b). Discovery Mode gave *'Weekend Friend'* an entirely new life, but the fun part is also adding in tracks that were never focus tracks or hadn’t been playlisted before,” explains Jonah Berry, Vice President of mtheory. \n\nThis is a story that Goth Babe’s team has seen with other previously popular tracks as well, such as the single,[*“I Wanna Help Your Mind,”*](https://open.spotify.com/track/08ZZ7SILfKcreLtA3K6Gqr?si=04afe7f74bdd4a38\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=9568d042c65b412f) which also beat out streams from its initial release week in 2021, after it was included in Discovery Mode. It then reached its highest streaming peak in December 2022. Discovery Mode has given selected tracks not only an entirely new life, but also a second or third life in some cases.\n\nDiscovery Mode has also helped Goth Babe reach a more international audience. “Once we saw we were reaching a wider audience through Discovery Mode, we really doubled down on that and started using it to reach new listeners in new regions,” says Mira. With the help of Discovery Mode, Goth Babe has now reached new listeners in 160 markets across the world.\n\nDiscovery Mode has been key in re-engaging Goth Babe’s listeners and bringing new listeners, wherever they may be, into his listening ecosystem.\n\n## Showcase built on Discovery Mode momentum\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2gphFbB8ePx0t6QsD6qnB0/b6c69574c0108ecedd39a755ef0bf564/Asset_4___Showcase.png)\n\nAfter seeing the success Discovery Mode drove for [*“Weekend Friend,”*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=ad832bc93697421b) Goth Babe’s team used Showcase to continue the momentum. \n\n“With Showcase, it was really exciting to focus on a catalog release and have it highlighted on Spotify’s Home,” says Brock. \n\nAfter reviewing data on Goth Babe’s audience segments, Goth Babe’s team decided to target his previously active audience with the campaign headline “You might like” to re-engage listeners who hadn’t recently streamed his music. With the help of Showcase, Goth Babe reactivated listeners who had fallen out of his active audience – 12% of previously active listeners who streamed the single saved it to their library or added it to a personal playlist. And their engagement wasn't limited to [*“Weekend Friend”*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=6eaf4b6e2de0454e\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=ad832bc93697421b) — more than 18% of listeners went on to stream from Goth Babe’s other releases. With a cohort of reactivated listeners, Goth Babe is now ready to drop his debut album to an even more engaged audience. \n\n## With Campaign Kit, Goth Babe grew and developed his fanbase, turning listeners into long-term fans\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3OqjsZ9rPgCg4gGbLEfBlI/d9d383ae94ced03da0aa9443c52a4d12/Asset_11__1_.png)\n\nFor Goth Babe, the Campaign Kit tools work in harmony to ensure he engages the right listeners at various moments in the discovery and release cycle. \n\n“All the products work really cohesively and in tandem,” Mira shares. “Using these tools together is about trying to cast a broad net to reach new listeners or less active ones and bring them closer in. Then when you have a new release, you can further engage these listeners. The goal is to build up Goth Babe’s daily streams and monthly listeners so that at the time of his next release he has the highest amount of listenership possible. Our marketing goal is to amplify an artist’s reach and Campaign Kit allows us to do exactly that — whether it’s for a catalog track or a new release.” \n\nBy using Campaign Kit tools together over the course of more than a year, Goth Babe’s team grew his monthly listeners metric to its highest-ever level, achieving their marketing goal ahead of his [*Iceland*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6n9SqKcGCx1RWJ7m1v8of8?si=P_301n8ITuWn4nUHJ_5UPg\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=f6e05504fd8e490b) EP release, and in preparation for his debut album release, *Lola*.\n\nCampaign Kit made it easy for Goth Babe’s team to measure the impact of their campaigns and constantly iterate on strategy. They were especially focused on intent rate — a measure of likelihood of long-term fandom. \n\n“We can look at the data to understand what works and what listeners are resonating with. Intent rate is really valuable to us because it shows the listeners’ intent to stream more music. That’s the ultimate success of a campaign — bringing in new listeners, but also having them intend to stick around and continue engaging with the artist,” adds Mira.\n\nFor Goth Babe and his team, it’s all about bringing listeners into his musical world and creating a shared experience.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

It lets you promote the releases you want, when you want, to the listeners you want to reach – right on Spotify’s Home. \n","article":"At Spotify for Artists, we’re building tools that help artists and their teams promote their music — right where streaming happens. Today, [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-marquee) gets listeners into your new releases right when they open the app and [playlist pitching](https://artists.spotify.com/playlisting) gets your unreleased music in front of Spotify editors to consider for editorial programming. \n\nBut artists and their teams want even more flexibility when it comes to surfacing the right music to the right fans at the right time — whether that’s reaching new listeners with a trending song, engaging super listeners with an anniversary album, or targeting previously active listeners with a reminder of your tour. \n\nWith a rise in the [popularity of catalog music,](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/edition/catalog) it’s also increasingly important to revitalize your body of work as a crucial aspect to building and maintaining your fanbase. From 2020 to 2022, the portion of our Global Weekly Top Songs Chart represented by catalog (18+ months) increased by 155%. Promoting new releases also remains critical, but not only during the release moment: On average, 75% of a release’s first-year streams happen after the first month.\n\nThat’s why we built [Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/page/showcase), a new campaign tool that gives artists and their teams even more ways to get your new and catalog music in front of the right listeners, right when it counts. With Showcase, you'll be able to develop fans in ways that have never been possible before — by giving your music its moment on Home.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/aEWIa9PyQjrfFUmC4D0Sf/cf4af4200d202a794f593aa0397f1156/Asset_5_1280x720.gif)\n\n## What is Showcase and how does it work?\n\nShowcase is a sponsored recommendation that helps you share your music — whether it’s your newest release, your deepest catalog cut, or anything in between — at any time to likely listeners across Spotify. It appears as a mobile banner at the top of Spotify’s Home — the most visited place on Spotify, where millions of listeners come to decide what to listen to, resulting in billions of streams each day. Additionally, on average, people who see a Showcase are [6x more likely to stream the promoted release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZjOjrTvBEY).\n\nWhat’s more, Showcase gives artists and their teams the option to book multiple campaigns for the same release. For example, the tool allows you to spotlight a single, EP, or album with multiple campaigns to reach different goals, each targeting different markets or listener segments.\n\nBelow are a few other examples of how Showcase gives you an opportunity to develop your audience in new and meaningful ways: \n- Hyping up your fans with an old favorite to build excitement for an upcoming release\n- Putting a seasonal hit in front of new listeners during a holiday moment \n- Re-engaging listeners you haven't reached in a while with a new release\n\nNo matter what your goal is, Showcase is the tool to help build your audience at the moments that best support your music and your career.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1lX7aDdpLhS5oiTNCVQB7o/8d23b5d3fe09718954725a51bdd5ee39/Asset_2_1280x720.gif)\n\n## When is the best moment to spotlight my music? \n\nWith Showcase, you can promote your music at any time, so it’s never too late to give your release its moment on Home. Plus you can add a headline to give listeners helpful context to the music you’re promoting. Here are a few examples of headlines and how you could use them:\n\n__Releasing music soon__\n\n  Tap into the pre-release hype by promoting existing music with this headline. This can help prime your audience while letting them know to look out for your new music. \n\n__New music__\n\n  Use this headline to make a splash when you’re dropping new music.  You can also use [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-marquee) alongside Showcase for a new release, or you can use either tool on its own.\n\n__Recently released__\n\n  Once the launch moment has died down, use this headline to extend your promotional cycle and keep your latest music top of mind for potential fans.\n\n__On tour__\n\n  Want to build excitement for a new tour and help drum up interest in the [tickets on your artist profile](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery) and Now Playing view? You can use this option to engage listeners before they see you live.\n\n__Release anniversary__\n\n  Use this headline to celebrate a milestone anniversary for one of your timeless releases and give listeners a reason to dive back in. \n\n__Getting buzz__\n\n  It’s exciting to see your music trending, and this option allows you to seize the moment and build off the momentum to bring new listeners to your music. \n\n__Seasonal vibes__\n\n  This is a great way to promote a seasonal song during a holiday or specific time of year. A spooky song, a festive favorite, or a new love song primed for Valentine’s Day — they all fall under “Seasonal vibes.”\n\nWhat’s important is that you have the freedom to choose the headline (and the moment) that matters most for your music. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/120x513Bwqxai5t3enSVxs/76c5d43b6792a7f1d15feb2146cc2c1f/Asset_4_1280x720.gif)\n\n## Who can I reach with Showcase?\n\nShowcase lets you reach listeners in over [30 markets](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/campaign-targeting-and-destinations/), helping you develop a global fanbase. By default, campaigns reach listeners who are most likely to stream your release — including those who have streamed you before and people who are new to your music. You can also choose to target specific segments of your audience based on real streaming behaviors:\n\n__Active audience__\n\nThese are valuable listeners who have intentionally streamed your music in the past 28 days from active sources like your artist profile, album and release pages, and their own library and playlists. Within the active audience there are three segments:\n\n- __Super listeners:__ Your most dedicated active listeners in the last 28 days. They’re also the most likely to keep streaming your music.\n\n- __Moderate listeners:__ Active listeners who intentionally streamed your music many times in the past 28 days, and could still develop into super listeners.\n\n- __Light listeners:__ Active listeners who intentionally streamed your music once or a couple times in the past 28 days, and could develop into moderate listeners.\n\n__Previously active audience__\n\nListeners who used to be in your active audience but haven’t intentionally streamed your music in at least 28 days. They may still stream your music from programmed sources.\n\n__Programmed audience__ \n\nListeners who only streamed your music from programmed sources like editorial playlists, Discover Weekly, Radio, Autoplay, or playlists by other listeners at least once in the last 2 years.\n\n__Potential audience__\n\nListeners who aren't currently in your total audience. Based on their listening habits, they may stream your promoted release.\n\n## How does Showcase reporting work?\nTwenty-four hours after your campaign starts, you’ll be able to access detailed reporting so you can see how your campaign drove engagement with the release you’re promoting, as well as with the rest of your catalog.\n\nWe already talked about how people who see a Showcase are six times more likely to stream the promoted release, but the effects can be seen even beyond that initial listen. Our reporting metrics measure how your campaigns are growing your audience and developing deeper fans over time. Whether your marketing goals include audience engagement, reactivation, or growth, Showcase reports measure the success of those goals by tracking how campaigns grew your amplified, reactivated, and new active listeners.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of each metric: \n\n- __Amplified listeners:__ Listeners from your active audience who intentionally streamed your promoted release for the first time after seeing your campaign.\n\n- __Reactivated listeners:__ Listeners who rejoined your active audience after intentionally streaming your promoted release.\n\n- __New active listeners:__ Listeners who joined your active audience for the first time by intentionally streaming your promoted release – including __new listeners__ who hadn’t streamed your music anywhere in the past two years.\n\nLastly, Showcase reporting can help you understand how listeners may intend to stream you in the long run by highlighting metrics live saves, playlist adds, and intent rate. Our research shows that saves and playlist adds correlate with a 2.5x increase in streaming of an artist six months later.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZjOjrTvBEY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## How do I set a campaign budget?\n\nBudgets for Showcase campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists and run until you either spend your budget or 14 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Showcase is priced on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis starting at a $0.40 CPC, we only spend your budget when people actually click on the Showcase.\n\nIn order to maximize the value of your spend, Showcase filters out people who have already intentionally streamed the promoted release in the past 21 days. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n## How do I run a Showcase campaign?\n\nTo be eligible to book a Showcase, artists must have at least 1,000 streams over the past 28 days in at least one of the available [target markets](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/campaign-targeting-and-destinations/), and the artist team’s billing country must be set to the U.S.\n\nIf you meet these requirements, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign. \n1. Log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop and head to the Campaigns tab.\n2. Locate the Showcase tab. \n3. Select an eligible release.\n4. Follow the instructions to set up your campaign, and you’re on your way!\n\nOver the next few weeks we will roll out Showcase within the [Campaigns tab](https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/campaigns/showcase) for eligible artists in the U.S., and in the coming months, we’ll continue to expand access to more artists around the world. We’re excited to share more updates so you can bring your own personalized strategy to the releases you want, when you want, and you can give your music its moment on Home, with Showcase.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/177j82KNVu5E4kdv4cA4n2/792f059ba8770b3da07c5338df577f68/Asset_3_1280x720-272kb__1_.gif)\n","modules":[{"title":"Showcase Recirculation Module ","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"More ways to promote your music ","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). We're excited to share more updates as we continue to improve Marquee.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQqlb-Fnf_E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n*If you want to learn more about how using Marquee has helped artists’ promo campaigns, check out our case studies with [girl in red](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout), [Jackboy](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-jackboy-and-empire-used-marquee-for-his-single-to-prime-listeners), [Mt.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","description":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in Radio and Autoplay before the album dropped.","urlSlug":"how-magic-city-hippies-sequenced-marquee-canvas-and-discovery-mode","releaseDate":"2022-07-14T11:50-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","headline":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","image":{"title":"Magic City Hippies","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/4FmIoTmNRTLlNqQZHxSpTH/fb720f937cf60abaee42520ad09996a3/Blog_Header.png","details":{"size":632612,"image":{"width":1280,"height":700}},"fileName":"Blog Header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","textColor":"#000000","id":"2Cj16pKHMvqeP8RUlrASiu","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in [Discovery Mode contexts](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/discovery-mode-contexts/) before the album dropped.","article":"Miami’s [Magic City Hippies](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ikg4sypcURm8Vy5GP68xb) have brought their breezy alt-funk to the party since they formed in 2015, but when the pandemic changed the game, the indie trio got innovative with how they recorded their sophomore album, *[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/album/0r0l3PRmsPwylAZQM16e7a?si=gQt1zxLQTCeUTYD3KROItQ)*, and how they made sure it reached more listeners than the band ever had before.\n\nWritten and recorded in 2021 with band members Robby Hunter, Pat Howard, and John Coughlin all hunkered down in different parts of the country, the album’s title explains the 11 songs’ overarching theme of “taking care of yourself and taking care of your loved ones,” says manager Brad Desmond. “It’s something that the guys felt was missing from their lives before the pandemic.”\n\nWhen Magic City Hippies began planning *Water Your Garden*’s release, the band had nearly 650,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and it had been two years since their debut, *Modern Animal*. So when it came to developing *Garden*’s release strategy, it was all about working to reconnect with existing listeners and reaching new ones. To accomplish this, they planned to release singles over the course of the nine months in advance of the full album — building awareness so that the fanbase was ready to jump in eagerly when the album came out. \n\n\"You only get so many opportunities to release an album,” says Desmond. “I don't want to miss a single potential listener: it's a potential ticket buyer, a potential person who's going to tell 10 of their friends.\"\n\nTo meet their goal of “making it as easy as possible for [listeners] to get to” the new music, Desmond says, they utilized several Spotify for Artists tools, including [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode) in a multi-faceted long-lead approach that activated their audience pre-release, made noise when the release dropped, and kept the momentum going post-release. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1IplhgDMzRfPLCwLBng81H/6fba941d3f94cd41f81cec9807061a05/Blog_1_new-12-6-2023.png)\n\n“Our audience is [on Spotify]. It’s how people discover us,” says Desmond. “It’s our main way of communicating with fans.... So it’s always our priority to play in the sandbox there, to use whatever marketing tools are available to us to provide the best experience possible.”\n\nWith Marquee and Canvas, they primed their listeners for the album with a series of singles beginning months ahead of the January 2022 album release. With Discovery Mode, they worked to expand their audience further, right before and after the album dropped — and just ahead of their tour. \n\n*Read on to learn exactly how they used each tool to exceed their goals.*\n\n## Marquee Engaged Listeners Pre-Album\n__*People who saw the Marquees were four times more likely to stream the singles.*__\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/676oBg3mfgAUbZdNrFej6C/ddc82582d9ae6c47f78e4d00e2c957d4/Blog_2.png)\n\n*Water Your Garden*’s first pre-release single, “[Diamond](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ghj9ln405TCxVrlEuVnGA?si=988361c03b174e64),” arrived nine months before the album, in April of 2021. Since it had been two years since their last album, the Magic City Hippies team decided to try a [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) targeting their lapsed listeners because, “It fit the release strategy by helping reach our goal of reengaging with fans,” says Iona Casta, paid media and digital marketing lead at Create Music Group, the band’s distributor. The Marquee drove 25% of their lapsed listeners to actively stream the band for the first time in more than six months. “Once we saw those results, we decided to use the tool for every release.” \n\nThroughout the rest of the year, they served up five more singles — “[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/track/0CVaDx0YP1nMwZd1eg88cX?si=b80d7601e1594d6e),” “[Queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zFXDAZ2V52022GPNYOxyH?si=6475e492b9ab4d98),” “[High Beams](https://open.spotify.com/track/28r57p0khZL2C2tpeKENXi?si=321dbcb92edc4a56),” “[Ghost on the Mend](https://open.spotify.com/track/32bZRcF2imSuRHdpodPEbQ?si=a8808a0f5ea54029),” and “[Champagne on the Rider](https://open.spotify.com/track/4u8traGW2bhMIfE8RibuKr?si=46d81537aaa5457a)” — and they used Marquee to promote all of them. They even had a cheeky inside joke about it. “Brad and I called it ‘foreplay’ for the album,” says Create Music Group project manager Anna Antoniadis. On average, 24% of people who streamed the pre-album singles after seeing the Marquee saved them to their personal libraries for future streaming.  \n\n“It’s the most effective strategy to actually increase streaming numbers because it’s in-app,” Casta continues. “It gives fans direct access to actually listen to the music, save it, and come back to it later. Even if I optimize other ads for conversions, it takes several steps for people to stream and save it.”\n\nUsing Marquee to target Magic City Hippies’ recently interested, casual, and lapsed listeners resulted in listener familiarity with over half of *Water Your Garden* before it even dropped. \n\n“Our biggest challenge,” says Desmond, “is making sure that all of our fanbase is aware of what we’re doing… and Marquee is a home run for doing that.”\n\n## Canvas Extended the Aesthetic\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3MblUuhlhDz1DX9KIrgKzf/15ad49f0db1ac3185247375ad7b22ee6/Blog_3.png)\n\nMagic City Hippies’ comprehensive use of [Canvas](http://canvas.spotify.com) — the Spotify for Artists tool for short, looping visuals — ensured that listeners who clicked the Marquee also got a taste of their creative world. The band invested in videos for every *Water Your Garden* single, and they made a Canvas for each. “Canvas allowed us to bring that visual into the Spotify platform, and to really give a deeper, more immersive listening experience to our fans,” Desmond explains. “The other thing I love about Canvas is, when it’s shared to Instagram Stories, which is something that we really look out for and encourage our fans to do… It just makes it that much more engaging for them.”\n\n“In some instances, we used a little bit of B-roll to provide a little Easter egg for fans who maybe are obsessed with the music video and are coming to Spotify to listen to the song,” Desmond continues. “On the non-single tracks, we used more B-roll from the other videos. One video, we had the director do a lot of slow-motion shots of flowers, and that was on-brand for the album title.” B-roll from another video was turned into “kind of like a psychedelic visualizer” Canvas for another song. \n\n## Discovery Mode Helped Expand Their Reach\n__*The trio more than tripled their audience in Discovery Mode contexts across more than 100 markets, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before.*__ \n\nIn December, the month before the album arrived and the tour began, the team looked to reach new listeners by turning on [Discovery Mode](http://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode), a marketing tool that helps artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery. Discovery Mode allows distributors to select music they want to prioritize in select personalized sessions. This increases the likelihood a track reaches listeners in those contexts. \n\n“It was kind of a no-brainer in that period, to say, ‘Let’s give a shot at reaching as many people as possible’,” says Desmond. “Especially in a month like December, which is traditionally considered a down month,” seeing the band’s audience triple within Discovery Mode contexts, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before, was “beyond what we expected.” \n\nThe team was surprised at first to see particular uplift for two of the songs they selected, with streams of “Ghost on the Mend” and “Diamond” doubling in Discovery Mode contexts when they turned on Discovery Mode for those tracks compared to the month prior. “Once we looked at a lot of the data, it ended up making sense,” explains Antoniadis. \n\n“I thought ‘Queen’ would've done better because it's shorter and hookier,” says Desmond. “‘Diamond’ and ‘Ghost on the Mend’ are really dynamic, and it was a surprise, but I think it was really cool. On our end, it was cool to see the impact. It's always cool to see the backend data, but specifically with Discovery Mode… it gave us some really interesting insight.” \n\nOverall, the band found Discovery Mode a powerful way to understand what people connect with, “because it’s coming up in algorithmic playlists,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, I heard this super-randomly on a radio, and I added it to my playlist, and I listen to it all the time now.’ That was an interesting, different way to see how things connect.”\n\nFor Desmond, “as an independent artist, to be able to have that kind of audience insight, it’s really incredible.”\n\n## Making Noise On Release Day and Beyond \n\nHaving expanded their audience through Discovery Mode, the band was ready to promote the album, *Water Your Garden*, with Marquee once more. To build on the momentum, they booked a Marquee campaign targeting recently interested listeners — listeners who actively streamed their music in the last 28 days.\n\nIt drove an average of 13.5 streams of the new release per listener, over three times more streams per listener than their album at large. \n\nThat, “shows how reliably it converts, and, at the end of the day, it’s conversion, conversion, conversion,” says Antoniadis. “No matter how many clicks you get on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn’t necessarily mean the user’s gonna go stream the song… As data people, I love being able to see the actual conversion into streams.” \n\nWith Marquee, the album also reached their highest intent rate yet: 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the album to their library or added it to a personal playlist. Plus, 20% of their Marquee listeners also streamed from their older releases like 2019’s *[Modern Animal](https://open.spotify.com/album/6y5roSQsSbhNcVfIkhF7wL?si=sCjy4GBqSx2X7K47ecANYw)*. \n\nBecause “fans are still connecting with it,” months after the album’s release day, Desmond says the team will return to Discovery Mode for *Garden* tracks that weren’t previously turned on.\n\n“One of my goals in general—and especially with an album rollout—is extending the release period the day after the release,” adds Antoniadis. “It doesn’t end there for anyone, and you can continue pushing it in different ways. Discovery Mode [is] an amazing tool for just that.”\n\n“It was a bigger, more professional release this time around,” Desmond says. “We always try to leave no stone unturned, and with these [three] tools, we were able to do a better job of that.”\n\nThe band is excited to continue building on the success of this release as their 2022 tour kicks into high gear, including a stop at Firefly Music Festival in September. “They worked really hard for a couple years to take that sound that’s very unique to them, that they create in the studio, and… bring it on the stage and still perform it live,” Desmond says.","modules":[{"title":"Magic City Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase?

He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Inside the Julia Wolf World: Building Momentum for a New EP, 'Girls in Purgatory'","description":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","urlSlug":"julia-wolf-video-how-they-made-it-new-ep-girls-in-purgatory","releaseDate":"2021-12-09T13:30-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"69yN2bTiEN6usxlihhWk2l"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","article":"[Julia Wolf](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5yvGiZLSWJTPBlZpVbPnEZ?si=h-FgU-_dQuOapDngCAOXSw) is “making music for the girls that are too afraid to speak their minds,” drawing from her own experiences as a shy kid in a big Italian family, struggling to fit in and finding her escape – finding herself – through music. \n\nNow with more than 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, the independent artist uses her own experiences to fuel her music, connecting with fans in a way that’s unique, radically authentic, and 100% her. \n\nBut it was a journey to get there. “Pursuing music as a career had a lot of trial and error involved, a lot of dead ends,” explains Wolf in the new episode of our [How They Made It series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it). “It certainly wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Using Canvas: Top Tips On How to Engage and Attract Fans With Short, Looping Visuals","description":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","urlSlug":"using-canvas-top-tips-on-how-to-engage-attract-fans-short-looping-visuals","releaseDate":"2022-04-20T09:55-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7yCTvLVdh9Pe7nFWNkX7vR"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","article":"Music and art have always been a perfect pairing, and every artist knows their visual identity is an incredibly important way to attract and connect with fans. [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

The 21-year-old rising star’s wistful first single, “[perfume](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kvkYrjZh561EJwERr8EsK?si=3ae2a5dcf6204c25),” with its melancholy acoustic guitar licks and love-struck lyrics, was released in February 2020 and has since become a bona fide indie hit with over 10 million streams on Spotify. After dropping “perfume,” mehro released three singles and two remixes to set the stage for his debut project, *[SKY ON FIRE](https://open.spotify.com/album/78pXYuIlTIUBQhtQTH8gTP?si=1OqFrfzNR6a9zhwrg12vgg\u0026dl_branch=1)*, which was released in March 2021. To date, the project has amassed over 23 million streams, and songs from the project have been saved or playlisted over 1.1 million times.\n\nmehro’s success has been propelled by a marketing approach that amplifies his natural affability via social media and in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84l8PSULCpE\u0026list=PLpobPPKGosH5ZVIBQ57eCubw6IADBAGdM) content, as well as Spotify for Artists tools like [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us), [artist playlists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=cc77f49de99442a5), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode?utm_source=googlesearch\u0026utm_medium=paid\u0026utm_campaign=2021q3_creator_single_creator_discovery_mode\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwqKuKBhCxARIsACf4XuFr8UHzczvoKpLe1KxQOhbR4XboP0bmF_TVMCYDxWVE6YLtkNLnA8YaAsC8EALw_wcB) to help deepen his connection with current fans and help introduce him to new ones. \n\nWhen asked about the source of his inspiration and what led him to create music, mehro responds matter-of-factly: “I’m a sensitive person. I felt so many things inside of me, and I had to let it out somehow.\" On social media, in [intimate conversations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpobPPKGosH4eVS1uAKkg54FpBvOw7BVr) with fans over Zoom, or even in the interview for this article, mehro’s demeanor reflects the emotive music he’s released thus far: He is gentle, as self-aware as he is self-assured, and most importantly, authentic. \n\n“The stories he’s telling in these songs are universal but very specific,” says Danny Rukasin, his manager. “The way that he’s cultivated a community around his music and his fans, [you can tell that] he really does care.” Rukasin, also co-manager to Billie Eilish and FINNEAS, partnered with mehro to help him realize his goals of taking care of himself and his family while making art that brings him both fulfillment and excitement.\n\nNo stranger to the needs of emerging artists, Rukasin and the team around mehro set out with a strategy of scaling the audience for his honest and earnest brand of music. Though fans have gotten a taste of what mehro can do with his releases thus far, Rukasin explains that it's just the tip of the iceberg and that the varied offerings to come require an atypical approach to building a fanbase. “mehro has a ton of music — and a wide breadth of diverse music, too,” he says. “So we’re putting a release plan together that isn’t leading to one big moment but continuously releasing music, so there is no endpoint and more for the newly discovered fan to listen to and\nstay excited for.” \n\nSpotify for Artists tools were key to their plan of building upon past successes and converting social media engagement into fan engagement on Spotify. mehro’s playlist, [Stay Pure](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=-dCv5CQdSdqCoDdxy2Ngww), was not only a place for him to showcase his own music, but his musical taste as well. The playlist, which fans can find on his artist profile via [Artist Pick](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/artist-pick), features tracks from his favorite artists alongside his own: “Stay Pure is one of those things where I get to champion artists whose music I love and who I respect,” he says.\n\nBeyond being an expression of his personal taste, Stay Pure was an opportunity to get fans involved and to give them a stake in one of his creations. “Stay Pure turned into a fan initiative where we had fans submitting UGC [user-generated content] creative, and eventually we made the cover one of the fan’s pieces of art,” explains mehro’s marketing manager, Ryan Lassi. “We’re trying to not only build community around mehro’s Instagram; there’s a community to be built around his Spotify.” \n\n![mehro incorporated [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music.](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/6gB76z9yYWE8aYADv5PSNY/7ce51932ecf0e5dd877f3f989ce0e13e/Blog-2.gif)\n\nFor mehro, imagery is as important as the music, and he uses Canvas to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music. “We launched with that ‘perfume’ Canvas, and there’s something just really timeless about that Canvas that we really love — it’s very mehro,” says Lassi. “We had Canvases go out for ‘hideous’ and singles as they went, but then, once we started talking about the *SKY ON FIRE* project, we were like, ‘maybe now is our opportunity to refresh these Canvases and give fans something new to consume, especially if they’re coming back to some of these tracks for the second, third, fourth time.’” \n\nDiscovery Mode was key to their plan of building mehro’s momentum and introducing him to listeners who were likely to have an affinity for his sound. Currently in an early testing phase, this new tool may help artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery.  “Spotify understands how to really hit those listeners,” says Rukasin. “[With Discovery Mode], we saw the opportunity and felt, ‘Why not take it while we’re still building and leading into new releases?’ There’s new music coming. Why not go and look at what the music is that’s going to resonate, and then kick it into overdrive to try to get audiences that are passively listening to lock in on the songs?” \n\nIn August, mehro’s team turned on Discovery Mode for “perfume” and ”chance with you” through his distributor Downtown Music Services. “We started with two songs,” explains Rukasin. “The strategy was: Start with two songs for three weeks leading into the new release moment. That will help create a wave of listeners.” The results were impressive: With music that resonated with fans and a clever strategy that kept them engaged, mehro was already reaching new listeners each month. Discovery Mode helped amplify that reach further and helped increase his monthly new listener growth four-fold, taking him past the 1 million monthly listeners threshold for the first time. In addition, through Discovery Mode, mehro increased views of his Canvas for both “perfume” and “hideous” by over 50%. These numbers prove that the music he makes resonates with fans all over the world. Discovery Mode also helped mehro reach fans in 15 new markets where he previously had a minimal audience — including Japan, Slovakia, and Hungary. “We want ears on the music because we know that all people need to do is hear it once or twice and they’ll be a fan, they’ll stay involved, they’ll become more active,” says Rukasin.\n\nWhen mehro learned that he had hit the 1 million listeners milestone, he was understandably awestruck: “I can’t even believe it. I don’t know what to say. That was a goal of mine long [ago].” He sees this all as an introduction to himself as an artist and to the varied sounds he has coming, exemplified in his latest singles: “I’m releasing two series of music simultaneously,” he says, excitement written all over his face. “The first release from it is called ‘[coastline](https://open.spotify.com/track/06J6MvuHOCOI5HerZaKKy2?si=d563c7b14bf54cdf),’ and that’s from a series called *Alchemy*.

We talk to Olivia Rodrigo’s creative team about making the perfect visual accompaniment for her breakup anthem.\n","article":"Right now, Olivia Rodrigo is in the driver’s seat and the whole world is along for the ride. As of this writing, the 17-year-old singer-songwriter’s single “[drivers license](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lPN2DXiMsVn7XUKtOW1CS?si=tswYSV4uScmQIq7Mv3iCzw)” has been No. 1 on the [Global Weekly Top Songs Chart](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbNG2KDcFcKOF?si=SPBWd9HuRCyqu7olCQyKGg) for three weeks in a row and has set the record for the most streams for a song in a week on Spotify. The song also sits atop Spotify’s [United States Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp?si=2e2_T-54TvC6R-LPmI3eZg) with over 2 million daily plays and is No. 1 on the [Global Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF?si=wmb9ajMES6W5V-NNrWwzgw) with over 8 million daily plays. This is all after debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and setting the record for the most streams in a day for a non-holiday song.\n\nThe single’s success is due to a number of factors: first and foremost, it’s a heartfelt, relatable, and catchy pop song about young love and loss; then there’s Rodrigo’s preexisting fanbase as a Disney starlet (she plays Nini Salazar-Roberts in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series”); add to that the song’s virality on social media; co-signs from Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish; fan theories about the story behind its lyrics; and you’ve got the recipe for the first bona fide mega-hit of 2021. \n\nWhen you listen to the track on the Spotify app you’ll notice the looping image of three  vintage-looking California driver’s licenses stacked on top of each other, each with animated images of Rodrigo looking alternately sad, strong, pensive, and happy —  this is the [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) for “drivers license.” Conceived by Rodrigo herself, the Canvas is a hit too, with over 243,000 total Instagram shares in the first week of its release (Jan. 8 to Jan.15) and more than 50 million views in the first three weeks. Ned Monahan, Spotify’s Head of Global Hits, knows that breakout successes like this one only happen once in a blue moon. “These sorts of lightning-in-a-bottle moments are rare, but the stars really aligned for ‘drivers license,’” he explains. “It’s a truly great song that’s instantly engaging, touching on universal feelings of heartbreak and suburban angst. The Canvas is a visual extension of the song’s themes, giving fans another way of contextualizing Olivia’s vision and relatable experiences — so it makes sense that it’s been well-received!”\n\nTo bring her vision for the Canvas to life, Rodrigo and Interscope/Geffen worked with art director Dina Hovsepian and designer Tim Barsten. “What we were trying to capture was a vintage-looking license, says Hovsepian, explaining her approach to the design. “I used lots of layers of scratchy filters to create the washed-out feel over her photos and to create the faded text.” (And yes, she confirms, “It’s her real b-day on the license.”) To further understand the inspiration and execution behind the Canvas, Spotify for Artists asked Barsten, who designed and animated the Canvas, about the process.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: How big of a role did Olivia play in the creative process for this Canvas? What was her input?__\n\n__Tim Barsten:__ I have to give all the creative direction credit to Olivia [Rodrigo]. The label provided the artwork and the original driver’s license design she used for her merch for the single, and Olivia provided some shots of herself for the Canvas with the note that she would like to replace the images on the driver’s license with the shots she sent. She said “Think: [Harry Potter, talking portraits](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait)” and I knew exactly what she meant. I then took all the assets into [Adobe] After Effects and designed what you see today. \n\n![Olivia Rodrigo's Harry Potter-inspired driver's licenses](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/21Xva8yuCON4ZHPCsXAoIZ/8dd530b55d5ff1b4189404f77766cacf/Rodrigo-Tile-4MB.gif)\n\n__Talk about interpreting the song and its lyrics visually for the Canvas, there are six looping images in the three licenses in the frame of the Canvas, were those images created specifically for this? What was the direction of the shoot for them and what emotions/moods were you trying to capture?__\n\nIn order to capture the concept of the song, Olivia wanted to showcase all of the different stages of a relationship that has come to an end. From heartbreak to forgiveness, to finally getting back to being happy again, she wanted all of the stages represented in the six different images on the three driver’s licenses for the Canvas of the song. \n\n__How did you think about how the Canvas and single artwork should be different or work together?__\n\nI love that this Canvas is different from the concept for the [single] artwork and music video — it acts almost as a supplemental piece of creative for the song that tells the story in a different way. Because the Canvas concept was different from the art and video but still needed to feel within the same world, I incorporated subtle elements of the music video and single art to help connect them visually. I was able to do that by overlaying some light purple flares in the background and overlaid grain to replicate the music video which was shot on film. From the artwork, I was inspired by the torn paper, grungier feel and applied vintage coloring, and added a slight degradation over the entire Canvas to make it feel a little more retro.\n\n__How long did it take for you to go from concept to Canvas? Were there many revisions?__\n\nWe started with the first concept during the second week of December [2020]. We went back and forth over the next few weeks with different concepts and versions before ultimately settling on the final version you see today. In the end, the original concept from that second week of December is the one we ended up going with! \n\n![Early alternate versions of the \"drivers license\" Canvas ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7cN31Y2xCJ71Plv1iWCywJ/b387822ee9c1ed370f732d258c13bddd/Rodrigo-Body-02-2MB.gif)\n\n__Which ideas were left on the cutting room floor?__\n\nWe had a few different concepts we were working through. On one of them, I took the original artwork and created a stagnant image in the vertical canvas format. I then separated the different layers and applied different types of grains, dust, flares, scan lines, and film mattes to the separated layers to give each layer its own individual movement. In the end, the concept you see now was the most compelling. \n\n__How does it feel to know that your work has been seen or shared by millions of fans at this point? Did you notice all the Canvas shares to Instagram Stories?__\n\nIt feels so cool to have worked on something that has reached the eyes of millions of people on both Spotify and Instagram. I’ve loved seeing it shared all over the world! \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timmhotep Aku","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"2RE4wRc7qEnxFZCVSRE2t3","contentType":"articlePage"}],"themeName":"whiteOnBlack","id":"oxbqgOYOtbh56EDVgbAoN","contentType":"relatedStoriesList"}],"indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"30R9sSwX2mwikPrD0cYxpo","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"Video ","articleLink":{"title":"How thuy’s Team Used Discovery Mode and Marquee to Grow Her Audience on Spotify","description":"See how independent artist thuy’s team (manager Anh Vu and Venice Music’s Isobel Kelly) used Discovery Mode and Marquee over the course of 15 months and multiple releases to grow her audience.","urlSlug":"thuy-how-to-grow-audience-spotify-discovery-mode-marquee-case-study","video":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1tiUUkQeuGcy2DQrvqlw1y"}},"thumbnailImage":{"title":"thuy Case Study ","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3gv10eD6iHa33qGiMvQ0vO/0785e45967f6d4c81b85fd5a37266707/Screenshot_2023-08-09_at_12.01.15_PM.png","details":{"size":5581114,"image":{"width":2874,"height":1598}},"fileName":"Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 12.01.15 PM.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"4m2ShhW4ip0ReJp8047IAz"}}],"indexed":true,"translated":false,"id":"12WpTV4asUTaB0ftCylaWg","contentType":"videoPage"},"background":"#151E17","color":"#EFE3CC","id":"2xLdBPaKqq9YXdbtUw2fBt","contentType":"featuredContentModule"}],"indexed":true,"languages":"en-US","id":"9a07f2zVZd0ue26WEL860","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How to Use Discovery Mode","description":"Discovery Mode is a tool from Spotify for Artists to help you find new listeners when they’re open to discovery.

So when it came to developing *Garden*’s release strategy, it was all about working to reconnect with existing listeners and reaching new ones. To accomplish this, they planned to release singles over the course of the nine months in advance of the full album — building awareness so that the fanbase was ready to jump in eagerly when the album came out. \n\n\"You only get so many opportunities to release an album,” says Desmond. “I don't want to miss a single potential listener: it's a potential ticket buyer, a potential person who's going to tell 10 of their friends.\"\n\nTo meet their goal of “making it as easy as possible for [listeners] to get to” the new music, Desmond says, they utilized several Spotify for Artists tools, including [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode) in a multi-faceted long-lead approach that activated their audience pre-release, made noise when the release dropped, and kept the momentum going post-release. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1IplhgDMzRfPLCwLBng81H/6fba941d3f94cd41f81cec9807061a05/Blog_1_new-12-6-2023.png)\n\n“Our audience is [on Spotify]. It’s how people discover us,” says Desmond. “It’s our main way of communicating with fans.... So it’s always our priority to play in the sandbox there, to use whatever marketing tools are available to us to provide the best experience possible.”\n\nWith Marquee and Canvas, they primed their listeners for the album with a series of singles beginning months ahead of the January 2022 album release. With Discovery Mode, they worked to expand their audience further, right before and after the album dropped — and just ahead of their tour. \n\n*Read on to learn exactly how they used each tool to exceed their goals.*\n\n## Marquee Engaged Listeners Pre-Album\n__*People who saw the Marquees were four times more likely to stream the singles.*__\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/676oBg3mfgAUbZdNrFej6C/ddc82582d9ae6c47f78e4d00e2c957d4/Blog_2.png)\n\n*Water Your Garden*’s first pre-release single, “[Diamond](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ghj9ln405TCxVrlEuVnGA?si=988361c03b174e64),” arrived nine months before the album, in April of 2021. Since it had been two years since their last album, the Magic City Hippies team decided to try a [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) targeting their lapsed listeners because, “It fit the release strategy by helping reach our goal of reengaging with fans,” says Iona Casta, paid media and digital marketing lead at Create Music Group, the band’s distributor. The Marquee drove 25% of their lapsed listeners to actively stream the band for the first time in more than six months. “Once we saw those results, we decided to use the tool for every release.” \n\nThroughout the rest of the year, they served up five more singles — “[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/track/0CVaDx0YP1nMwZd1eg88cX?si=b80d7601e1594d6e),” “[Queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zFXDAZ2V52022GPNYOxyH?si=6475e492b9ab4d98),” “[High Beams](https://open.spotify.com/track/28r57p0khZL2C2tpeKENXi?si=321dbcb92edc4a56),” “[Ghost on the Mend](https://open.spotify.com/track/32bZRcF2imSuRHdpodPEbQ?si=a8808a0f5ea54029),” and “[Champagne on the Rider](https://open.spotify.com/track/4u8traGW2bhMIfE8RibuKr?si=46d81537aaa5457a)” — and they used Marquee to promote all of them. They even had a cheeky inside joke about it. “Brad and I called it ‘foreplay’ for the album,” says Create Music Group project manager Anna Antoniadis. On average, 24% of people who streamed the pre-album singles after seeing the Marquee saved them to their personal libraries for future streaming.  \n\n“It’s the most effective strategy to actually increase streaming numbers because it’s in-app,” Casta continues. “It gives fans direct access to actually listen to the music, save it, and come back to it later. Even if I optimize other ads for conversions, it takes several steps for people to stream and save it.”\n\nUsing Marquee to target Magic City Hippies’ recently interested, casual, and lapsed listeners resulted in listener familiarity with over half of *Water Your Garden* before it even dropped. \n\n“Our biggest challenge,” says Desmond, “is making sure that all of our fanbase is aware of what we’re doing… and Marquee is a home run for doing that.”\n\n## Canvas Extended the Aesthetic\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3MblUuhlhDz1DX9KIrgKzf/15ad49f0db1ac3185247375ad7b22ee6/Blog_3.png)\n\nMagic City Hippies’ comprehensive use of [Canvas](http://canvas.spotify.com) — the Spotify for Artists tool for short, looping visuals — ensured that listeners who clicked the Marquee also got a taste of their creative world. The band invested in videos for every *Water Your Garden* single, and they made a Canvas for each. “Canvas allowed us to bring that visual into the Spotify platform, and to really give a deeper, more immersive listening experience to our fans,” Desmond explains. “The other thing I love about Canvas is, when it’s shared to Instagram Stories, which is something that we really look out for and encourage our fans to do… It just makes it that much more engaging for them.”\n\n“In some instances, we used a little bit of B-roll to provide a little Easter egg for fans who maybe are obsessed with the music video and are coming to Spotify to listen to the song,” Desmond continues. “On the non-single tracks, we used more B-roll from the other videos. One video, we had the director do a lot of slow-motion shots of flowers, and that was on-brand for the album title.” B-roll from another video was turned into “kind of like a psychedelic visualizer” Canvas for another song. \n\n## Discovery Mode Helped Expand Their Reach\n__*The trio more than tripled their audience in Discovery Mode contexts across more than 100 markets, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before.*__ \n\nIn December, the month before the album arrived and the tour began, the team looked to reach new listeners by turning on [Discovery Mode](http://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode), a marketing tool that helps artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery. Discovery Mode allows distributors to select music they want to prioritize in select personalized sessions. This increases the likelihood a track reaches listeners in those contexts. \n\n“It was kind of a no-brainer in that period, to say, ‘Let’s give a shot at reaching as many people as possible’,” says Desmond. “Especially in a month like December, which is traditionally considered a down month,” seeing the band’s audience triple within Discovery Mode contexts, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before, was “beyond what we expected.” \n\nThe team was surprised at first to see particular uplift for two of the songs they selected, with streams of “Ghost on the Mend” and “Diamond” doubling in Discovery Mode contexts when they turned on Discovery Mode for those tracks compared to the month prior. “Once we looked at a lot of the data, it ended up making sense,” explains Antoniadis. \n\n“I thought ‘Queen’ would've done better because it's shorter and hookier,” says Desmond. “‘Diamond’ and ‘Ghost on the Mend’ are really dynamic, and it was a surprise, but I think it was really cool. On our end, it was cool to see the impact. It's always cool to see the backend data, but specifically with Discovery Mode… it gave us some really interesting insight.” \n\nOverall, the band found Discovery Mode a powerful way to understand what people connect with, “because it’s coming up in algorithmic playlists,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, I heard this super-randomly on a radio, and I added it to my playlist, and I listen to it all the time now.’ That was an interesting, different way to see how things connect.”\n\nFor Desmond, “as an independent artist, to be able to have that kind of audience insight, it’s really incredible.”\n\n## Making Noise On Release Day and Beyond \n\nHaving expanded their audience through Discovery Mode, the band was ready to promote the album, *Water Your Garden*, with Marquee once more. To build on the momentum, they booked a Marquee campaign targeting recently interested listeners — listeners who actively streamed their music in the last 28 days.\n\nIt drove an average of 13.5 streams of the new release per listener, over three times more streams per listener than their album at large. \n\nThat, “shows how reliably it converts, and, at the end of the day, it’s conversion, conversion, conversion,” says Antoniadis. “No matter how many clicks you get on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn’t necessarily mean the user’s gonna go stream the song… As data people, I love being able to see the actual conversion into streams.” \n\nWith Marquee, the album also reached their highest intent rate yet: 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the album to their library or added it to a personal playlist. Plus, 20% of their Marquee listeners also streamed from their older releases like 2019’s *[Modern Animal](https://open.spotify.com/album/6y5roSQsSbhNcVfIkhF7wL?si=sCjy4GBqSx2X7K47ecANYw)*. \n\nBecause “fans are still connecting with it,” months after the album’s release day, Desmond says the team will return to Discovery Mode for *Garden* tracks that weren’t previously turned on.\n\n“One of my goals in general—and especially with an album rollout—is extending the release period the day after the release,” adds Antoniadis. “It doesn’t end there for anyone, and you can continue pushing it in different ways. Discovery Mode [is] an amazing tool for just that.”\n\n“It was a bigger, more professional release this time around,” Desmond says. “We always try to leave no stone unturned, and with these [three] tools, we were able to do a better job of that.”\n\nThe band is excited to continue building on the success of this release as their 2022 tour kicks into high gear, including a stop at Firefly Music Festival in September. “They worked really hard for a couple years to take that sound that’s very unique to them, that they create in the studio, and… bring it on the stage and still perform it live,” Desmond says.","modules":[{"title":"Magic City Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Inside the Julia Wolf World: Building Momentum for a New EP, 'Girls in Purgatory'","description":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","urlSlug":"julia-wolf-video-how-they-made-it-new-ep-girls-in-purgatory","releaseDate":"2021-12-09T13:30-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"69yN2bTiEN6usxlihhWk2l"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","article":"[Julia Wolf](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5yvGiZLSWJTPBlZpVbPnEZ?si=h-FgU-_dQuOapDngCAOXSw) is “making music for the girls that are too afraid to speak their minds,” drawing from her own experiences as a shy kid in a big Italian family, struggling to fit in and finding her escape – finding herself – through music. \n\nNow with more than 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, the independent artist uses her own experiences to fuel her music, connecting with fans in a way that’s unique, radically authentic, and 100% her. \n\nBut it was a journey to get there. “Pursuing music as a career had a lot of trial and error involved, a lot of dead ends,” explains Wolf in the new episode of our [How They Made It series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it). “It certainly wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Using Canvas: Top Tips On How to Engage and Attract Fans With Short, Looping Visuals","description":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","urlSlug":"using-canvas-top-tips-on-how-to-engage-attract-fans-short-looping-visuals","releaseDate":"2022-04-20T09:55-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7yCTvLVdh9Pe7nFWNkX7vR"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","article":"Music and art have always been a perfect pairing, and every artist knows their visual identity is an incredibly important way to attract and connect with fans. [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

The 21-year-old rising star’s wistful first single, “[perfume](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kvkYrjZh561EJwERr8EsK?si=3ae2a5dcf6204c25),” with its melancholy acoustic guitar licks and love-struck lyrics, was released in February 2020 and has since become a bona fide indie hit with over 10 million streams on Spotify. After dropping “perfume,” mehro released three singles and two remixes to set the stage for his debut project, *[SKY ON FIRE](https://open.spotify.com/album/78pXYuIlTIUBQhtQTH8gTP?si=1OqFrfzNR6a9zhwrg12vgg\u0026dl_branch=1)*, which was released in March 2021. To date, the project has amassed over 23 million streams, and songs from the project have been saved or playlisted over 1.1 million times.\n\nmehro’s success has been propelled by a marketing approach that amplifies his natural affability via social media and in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84l8PSULCpE\u0026list=PLpobPPKGosH5ZVIBQ57eCubw6IADBAGdM) content, as well as Spotify for Artists tools like [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us), [artist playlists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=cc77f49de99442a5), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode?utm_source=googlesearch\u0026utm_medium=paid\u0026utm_campaign=2021q3_creator_single_creator_discovery_mode\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwqKuKBhCxARIsACf4XuFr8UHzczvoKpLe1KxQOhbR4XboP0bmF_TVMCYDxWVE6YLtkNLnA8YaAsC8EALw_wcB) to help deepen his connection with current fans and help introduce him to new ones. \n\nWhen asked about the source of his inspiration and what led him to create music, mehro responds matter-of-factly: “I’m a sensitive person. I felt so many things inside of me, and I had to let it out somehow.\" On social media, in [intimate conversations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpobPPKGosH4eVS1uAKkg54FpBvOw7BVr) with fans over Zoom, or even in the interview for this article, mehro’s demeanor reflects the emotive music he’s released thus far: He is gentle, as self-aware as he is self-assured, and most importantly, authentic. \n\n“The stories he’s telling in these songs are universal but very specific,” says Danny Rukasin, his manager. “The way that he’s cultivated a community around his music and his fans, [you can tell that] he really does care.” Rukasin, also co-manager to Billie Eilish and FINNEAS, partnered with mehro to help him realize his goals of taking care of himself and his family while making art that brings him both fulfillment and excitement.\n\nNo stranger to the needs of emerging artists, Rukasin and the team around mehro set out with a strategy of scaling the audience for his honest and earnest brand of music. Though fans have gotten a taste of what mehro can do with his releases thus far, Rukasin explains that it's just the tip of the iceberg and that the varied offerings to come require an atypical approach to building a fanbase. “mehro has a ton of music — and a wide breadth of diverse music, too,” he says. “So we’re putting a release plan together that isn’t leading to one big moment but continuously releasing music, so there is no endpoint and more for the newly discovered fan to listen to and\nstay excited for.” \n\nSpotify for Artists tools were key to their plan of building upon past successes and converting social media engagement into fan engagement on Spotify. mehro’s playlist, [Stay Pure](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=-dCv5CQdSdqCoDdxy2Ngww), was not only a place for him to showcase his own music, but his musical taste as well. The playlist, which fans can find on his artist profile via [Artist Pick](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/artist-pick), features tracks from his favorite artists alongside his own: “Stay Pure is one of those things where I get to champion artists whose music I love and who I respect,” he says.\n\nBeyond being an expression of his personal taste, Stay Pure was an opportunity to get fans involved and to give them a stake in one of his creations. “Stay Pure turned into a fan initiative where we had fans submitting UGC [user-generated content] creative, and eventually we made the cover one of the fan’s pieces of art,” explains mehro’s marketing manager, Ryan Lassi. “We’re trying to not only build community around mehro’s Instagram; there’s a community to be built around his Spotify.” \n\n![mehro incorporated [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music.](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/6gB76z9yYWE8aYADv5PSNY/7ce51932ecf0e5dd877f3f989ce0e13e/Blog-2.gif)\n\nFor mehro, imagery is as important as the music, and he uses Canvas to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music. “We launched with that ‘perfume’ Canvas, and there’s something just really timeless about that Canvas that we really love — it’s very mehro,” says Lassi. “We had Canvases go out for ‘hideous’ and singles as they went, but then, once we started talking about the *SKY ON FIRE* project, we were like, ‘maybe now is our opportunity to refresh these Canvases and give fans something new to consume, especially if they’re coming back to some of these tracks for the second, third, fourth time.’” \n\nDiscovery Mode was key to their plan of building mehro’s momentum and introducing him to listeners who were likely to have an affinity for his sound. Currently in an early testing phase, this new tool may help artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery.  “Spotify understands how to really hit those listeners,” says Rukasin. “[With Discovery Mode], we saw the opportunity and felt, ‘Why not take it while we’re still building and leading into new releases?’ There’s new music coming. Why not go and look at what the music is that’s going to resonate, and then kick it into overdrive to try to get audiences that are passively listening to lock in on the songs?” \n\nIn August, mehro’s team turned on Discovery Mode for “perfume” and ”chance with you” through his distributor Downtown Music Services. “We started with two songs,” explains Rukasin. “The strategy was: Start with two songs for three weeks leading into the new release moment. That will help create a wave of listeners.” The results were impressive: With music that resonated with fans and a clever strategy that kept them engaged, mehro was already reaching new listeners each month. Discovery Mode helped amplify that reach further and helped increase his monthly new listener growth four-fold, taking him past the 1 million monthly listeners threshold for the first time. In addition, through Discovery Mode, mehro increased views of his Canvas for both “perfume” and “hideous” by over 50%. These numbers prove that the music he makes resonates with fans all over the world. Discovery Mode also helped mehro reach fans in 15 new markets where he previously had a minimal audience — including Japan, Slovakia, and Hungary. “We want ears on the music because we know that all people need to do is hear it once or twice and they’ll be a fan, they’ll stay involved, they’ll become more active,” says Rukasin.\n\nWhen mehro learned that he had hit the 1 million listeners milestone, he was understandably awestruck: “I can’t even believe it. I don’t know what to say. That was a goal of mine long [ago].” He sees this all as an introduction to himself as an artist and to the varied sounds he has coming, exemplified in his latest singles: “I’m releasing two series of music simultaneously,” he says, excitement written all over his face. “The first release from it is called ‘[coastline](https://open.spotify.com/track/06J6MvuHOCOI5HerZaKKy2?si=d563c7b14bf54cdf),’ and that’s from a series called *Alchemy*.

We talk to Olivia Rodrigo’s creative team about making the perfect visual accompaniment for her breakup anthem.\n","article":"Right now, Olivia Rodrigo is in the driver’s seat and the whole world is along for the ride. As of this writing, the 17-year-old singer-songwriter’s single “[drivers license](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lPN2DXiMsVn7XUKtOW1CS?si=tswYSV4uScmQIq7Mv3iCzw)” has been No. 1 on the [Global Weekly Top Songs Chart](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbNG2KDcFcKOF?si=SPBWd9HuRCyqu7olCQyKGg) for three weeks in a row and has set the record for the most streams for a song in a week on Spotify. The song also sits atop Spotify’s [United States Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp?si=2e2_T-54TvC6R-LPmI3eZg) with over 2 million daily plays and is No. 1 on the [Global Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF?si=wmb9ajMES6W5V-NNrWwzgw) with over 8 million daily plays. This is all after debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and setting the record for the most streams in a day for a non-holiday song.\n\nThe single’s success is due to a number of factors: first and foremost, it’s a heartfelt, relatable, and catchy pop song about young love and loss; then there’s Rodrigo’s preexisting fanbase as a Disney starlet (she plays Nini Salazar-Roberts in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series”); add to that the song’s virality on social media; co-signs from Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish; fan theories about the story behind its lyrics; and you’ve got the recipe for the first bona fide mega-hit of 2021. \n\nWhen you listen to the track on the Spotify app you’ll notice the looping image of three  vintage-looking California driver’s licenses stacked on top of each other, each with animated images of Rodrigo looking alternately sad, strong, pensive, and happy —  this is the [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) for “drivers license.” Conceived by Rodrigo herself, the Canvas is a hit too, with over 243,000 total Instagram shares in the first week of its release (Jan. 8 to Jan.15) and more than 50 million views in the first three weeks. Ned Monahan, Spotify’s Head of Global Hits, knows that breakout successes like this one only happen once in a blue moon. “These sorts of lightning-in-a-bottle moments are rare, but the stars really aligned for ‘drivers license,’” he explains. “It’s a truly great song that’s instantly engaging, touching on universal feelings of heartbreak and suburban angst. The Canvas is a visual extension of the song’s themes, giving fans another way of contextualizing Olivia’s vision and relatable experiences — so it makes sense that it’s been well-received!”\n\nTo bring her vision for the Canvas to life, Rodrigo and Interscope/Geffen worked with art director Dina Hovsepian and designer Tim Barsten. “What we were trying to capture was a vintage-looking license, says Hovsepian, explaining her approach to the design. “I used lots of layers of scratchy filters to create the washed-out feel over her photos and to create the faded text.” (And yes, she confirms, “It’s her real b-day on the license.”) To further understand the inspiration and execution behind the Canvas, Spotify for Artists asked Barsten, who designed and animated the Canvas, about the process.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: How big of a role did Olivia play in the creative process for this Canvas? What was her input?__\n\n__Tim Barsten:__ I have to give all the creative direction credit to Olivia [Rodrigo]. The label provided the artwork and the original driver’s license design she used for her merch for the single, and Olivia provided some shots of herself for the Canvas with the note that she would like to replace the images on the driver’s license with the shots she sent. She said “Think: [Harry Potter, talking portraits](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait)” and I knew exactly what she meant. I then took all the assets into [Adobe] After Effects and designed what you see today. \n\n![Olivia Rodrigo's Harry Potter-inspired driver's licenses](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/21Xva8yuCON4ZHPCsXAoIZ/8dd530b55d5ff1b4189404f77766cacf/Rodrigo-Tile-4MB.gif)\n\n__Talk about interpreting the song and its lyrics visually for the Canvas, there are six looping images in the three licenses in the frame of the Canvas, were those images created specifically for this? What was the direction of the shoot for them and what emotions/moods were you trying to capture?__\n\nIn order to capture the concept of the song, Olivia wanted to showcase all of the different stages of a relationship that has come to an end. From heartbreak to forgiveness, to finally getting back to being happy again, she wanted all of the stages represented in the six different images on the three driver’s licenses for the Canvas of the song. \n\n__How did you think about how the Canvas and single artwork should be different or work together?__\n\nI love that this Canvas is different from the concept for the [single] artwork and music video — it acts almost as a supplemental piece of creative for the song that tells the story in a different way. Because the Canvas concept was different from the art and video but still needed to feel within the same world, I incorporated subtle elements of the music video and single art to help connect them visually. I was able to do that by overlaying some light purple flares in the background and overlaid grain to replicate the music video which was shot on film. From the artwork, I was inspired by the torn paper, grungier feel and applied vintage coloring, and added a slight degradation over the entire Canvas to make it feel a little more retro.\n\n__How long did it take for you to go from concept to Canvas? Were there many revisions?__\n\nWe started with the first concept during the second week of December [2020]. We went back and forth over the next few weeks with different concepts and versions before ultimately settling on the final version you see today. In the end, the original concept from that second week of December is the one we ended up going with! \n\n![Early alternate versions of the \"drivers license\" Canvas ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7cN31Y2xCJ71Plv1iWCywJ/b387822ee9c1ed370f732d258c13bddd/Rodrigo-Body-02-2MB.gif)\n\n__Which ideas were left on the cutting room floor?__\n\nWe had a few different concepts we were working through. On one of them, I took the original artwork and created a stagnant image in the vertical canvas format. I then separated the different layers and applied different types of grains, dust, flares, scan lines, and film mattes to the separated layers to give each layer its own individual movement. In the end, the concept you see now was the most compelling. \n\n__How does it feel to know that your work has been seen or shared by millions of fans at this point? Did you notice all the Canvas shares to Instagram Stories?__\n\nIt feels so cool to have worked on something that has reached the eyes of millions of people on both Spotify and Instagram. I’ve loved seeing it shared all over the world! \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timmhotep Aku","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"2RE4wRc7qEnxFZCVSRE2t3","contentType":"articlePage"}],"themeName":"whiteOnBlack","id":"oxbqgOYOtbh56EDVgbAoN","contentType":"relatedStoriesList"}],"indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"30R9sSwX2mwikPrD0cYxpo","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"New Study: Marquee Delivers 10x More Listeners Per Dollar Than Social Ads, on Average","description":"Working with eight labels and distributors, months-long research reveals the effectiveness of our campaign tool vs. other digital advertising.","urlSlug":"new-study-marquee-delivers-10x-more-listeners-per-dollar-than-social-ads","releaseDate":"2022-11-17T08:00:00+0500","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7sNdOkbDzY9BYbn4S1hkX5"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Working with eight labels and distributors, months-long research reveals the effectiveness of our campaign tool vs. other digital advertising.","article":"Marketing new music is all about targeting the right listeners, reaching them at the right moment, and measuring the impact. But today artists and their teams are often promoting releases on social media — platforms that weren't made for streaming music. Among the top questions we get from them is whether these social media ads actually drive engagement on Spotify, especially given the guesswork of trying to target real music fans and capture their attention in a busy social feed.\n\nWith Marquee, artists and their teams got a powerful new way to understand what their marketing spend drove on Spotify. But since they can't attribute streaming results to ad spend on social platforms, they've wanted to know how to compare returns from social ads to Marquee.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/IWDxZkUW4ymLVkTOWpNGv/5f8b5d6c69b1b343c8083dbb63314eca/Marquee_Vs_OffPlatform_Blog_1280x700_Comparison_Chart.gif)\n\nIn short: The study showed that Marquee delivers an average of 10x more Spotify listeners for every dollar spent on similar social ads. Now let's get into the details.\n\n## Designing the Study\n\nWe partnered with eight labels and distributors to select a wide range of artists with upcoming releases. Ten new releases were featured in the study, and they included a mix of release types (albums, EPs, and singles), a mix of artists' audience sizes (from 300,000 to 16 million monthly listeners), and a mix of genres (e.g. rap, electronic, indie, and rock).\n\nAfter working with partners to identify the right releases, they created ads to run on the most popular social media marketing platforms. To help ensure that their ads were set up in a similar way to Marquee, we applied the following study requirements:\n\n-   Ads promoted the same release as Marquee. \n-   Similar to Marquee, ads targeted artists' core audiences (e.g. people who have liked or engaged with the artist), with no expanded targeting. \n-   Ads targeted mobile users only, since Marquee only reaches mobile listeners.\n-   Ads targeted the same countries as Marquee. \n-   Ads were optimized for driving clicks or conversions to the Spotify mobile app, whichever the partner typically used to drive listening on digital streaming platforms.\n-   Ads' schedules matched Marquee: Campaigns started up to 20 days after release and ended no more than 10 days after start.\n-   Ads' minimum spends matched Marquee: Campaigns booked budgets for at least $100 per campaign.\n\nWe also wanted to make sure the comparison was as apples-to-apples as possible by attributing results in similar ways across all platforms. For Marquee, we measured the number of people who listened to the promoted release within 14 days of clicking on the Marquee. For all other advertising tools, we measured the number of people who listened to the promoted release on the Spotify mobile app within 14 days of clicking on the social ad.\n\n## The Results\n![While Marquee gets listeners into your new release when they're already on Spotify, social ads involve many more steps and high potential for dropoff before listeners get to Spotify.](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6JRfrgfje4NXLWm5Gv6gTH/86eb1183c117e1bee9048b1396e76acd/comparison_phones.png)\n\nOn average, Marquee delivered 10x more Spotify listeners for every dollar spent on similar social ads. While this was the average, even the release with the lowest rate in the study showed that Marquee reported 5x more Spotify listeners per dollar spent on social ads. Not only did Marquee deliver more listeners on average per dollar, it also resulted in more listeners per click: Marquee delivered a 100% higher click-to-listen-rate, on average, than similar social ads.\n\n\u003e \"We believed in the efficacy of on-platform Marquee campaigns vs paid social, but the results of this study were even more definitive than we expected.\" -Whitaker Elledge, VP of Artist Development at Dualtone Music Group\n\nFor Dualtone Music Group's Elledge, the study showed the value of marketing music directly on Spotify: \"It's clear that Marquee not only drives streams at a higher conversion rate and a lower cost [per listener] — it helps us foster meaningful, long term connections between fans and our artists. That's our core mission.\"\n\nSocial ads target listeners based on proxy metrics, making it easy to reach broad audiences, but difficult to be sure you are reaching listeners — especially those listeners who have the potential to become fans. They also reach listeners out of context (while they're scrolling and reading, next to other ads), not when they're ready to listen. And because they're separate platforms, they can't directly attribute marketing spend to listening behavior.\n\nMarquee is made for marketing music, meaning it:\n-   Lets you target Spotify listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests \n-   Reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to stream, rather than when they're scrolling a feed \n-   Provides reporting that shows how people who saw the Marquee engaged with the promoted release and broader artist catalog for up to 14 days after the campaign ends (e.g. listeners, streams per listener, saves, engagement with other releases)\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/5A0SlRnWQSFqhKaFb6iEyx/ab636e50c613a09800a38a430b231d25/Marquee_vs_Offplatform_Value_Prop_Blog_1280x700.png)\n\nThe Marquee results were a win-win for YMU US Music Head of Marketing SuzAnn Brantner. \"We have always questioned whether our social ads were truly driving engagement on Spotify,\" Brantner says. \"With these results from Steve Aoki's single, 'Just Us Two,' we were able to see the value in marketing directly on a music platform over social ads — our Marquee campaign was over 20x times more cost-efficient than our social ads promoting the single.\"\n\n## What's Next\n\nReady to drive more listeners and spend your marketing budgets more effectively?

The 21-year-old rising star’s wistful first single, “[perfume](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kvkYrjZh561EJwERr8EsK?si=3ae2a5dcf6204c25),” with its melancholy acoustic guitar licks and love-struck lyrics, was released in February 2020 and has since become a bona fide indie hit with over 10 million streams on Spotify. After dropping “perfume,” mehro released three singles and two remixes to set the stage for his debut project, *[SKY ON FIRE](https://open.spotify.com/album/78pXYuIlTIUBQhtQTH8gTP?si=1OqFrfzNR6a9zhwrg12vgg\u0026dl_branch=1)*, which was released in March 2021. To date, the project has amassed over 23 million streams, and songs from the project have been saved or playlisted over 1.1 million times.\n\nmehro’s success has been propelled by a marketing approach that amplifies his natural affability via social media and in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84l8PSULCpE\u0026list=PLpobPPKGosH5ZVIBQ57eCubw6IADBAGdM) content, as well as Spotify for Artists tools like [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us), [artist playlists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=cc77f49de99442a5), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode?utm_source=googlesearch\u0026utm_medium=paid\u0026utm_campaign=2021q3_creator_single_creator_discovery_mode\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwqKuKBhCxARIsACf4XuFr8UHzczvoKpLe1KxQOhbR4XboP0bmF_TVMCYDxWVE6YLtkNLnA8YaAsC8EALw_wcB) to help deepen his connection with current fans and help introduce him to new ones. \n\nWhen asked about the source of his inspiration and what led him to create music, mehro responds matter-of-factly: “I’m a sensitive person. I felt so many things inside of me, and I had to let it out somehow.\" On social media, in [intimate conversations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpobPPKGosH4eVS1uAKkg54FpBvOw7BVr) with fans over Zoom, or even in the interview for this article, mehro’s demeanor reflects the emotive music he’s released thus far: He is gentle, as self-aware as he is self-assured, and most importantly, authentic. \n\n“The stories he’s telling in these songs are universal but very specific,” says Danny Rukasin, his manager. “The way that he’s cultivated a community around his music and his fans, [you can tell that] he really does care.” Rukasin, also co-manager to Billie Eilish and FINNEAS, partnered with mehro to help him realize his goals of taking care of himself and his family while making art that brings him both fulfillment and excitement.\n\nNo stranger to the needs of emerging artists, Rukasin and the team around mehro set out with a strategy of scaling the audience for his honest and earnest brand of music. Though fans have gotten a taste of what mehro can do with his releases thus far, Rukasin explains that it's just the tip of the iceberg and that the varied offerings to come require an atypical approach to building a fanbase. “mehro has a ton of music — and a wide breadth of diverse music, too,” he says. “So we’re putting a release plan together that isn’t leading to one big moment but continuously releasing music, so there is no endpoint and more for the newly discovered fan to listen to and\nstay excited for.” \n\nSpotify for Artists tools were key to their plan of building upon past successes and converting social media engagement into fan engagement on Spotify. mehro’s playlist, [Stay Pure](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=-dCv5CQdSdqCoDdxy2Ngww), was not only a place for him to showcase his own music, but his musical taste as well. The playlist, which fans can find on his artist profile via [Artist Pick](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/artist-pick), features tracks from his favorite artists alongside his own: “Stay Pure is one of those things where I get to champion artists whose music I love and who I respect,” he says.\n\nBeyond being an expression of his personal taste, Stay Pure was an opportunity to get fans involved and to give them a stake in one of his creations. “Stay Pure turned into a fan initiative where we had fans submitting UGC [user-generated content] creative, and eventually we made the cover one of the fan’s pieces of art,” explains mehro’s marketing manager, Ryan Lassi. “We’re trying to not only build community around mehro’s Instagram; there’s a community to be built around his Spotify.” \n\n![mehro incorporated [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music.](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/6gB76z9yYWE8aYADv5PSNY/7ce51932ecf0e5dd877f3f989ce0e13e/Blog-2.gif)\n\nFor mehro, imagery is as important as the music, and he uses Canvas to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music. “We launched with that ‘perfume’ Canvas, and there’s something just really timeless about that Canvas that we really love — it’s very mehro,” says Lassi. “We had Canvases go out for ‘hideous’ and singles as they went, but then, once we started talking about the *SKY ON FIRE* project, we were like, ‘maybe now is our opportunity to refresh these Canvases and give fans something new to consume, especially if they’re coming back to some of these tracks for the second, third, fourth time.’” \n\nDiscovery Mode was key to their plan of building mehro’s momentum and introducing him to listeners who were likely to have an affinity for his sound. Currently in an early testing phase, this new tool may help artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery.  “Spotify understands how to really hit those listeners,” says Rukasin. “[With Discovery Mode], we saw the opportunity and felt, ‘Why not take it while we’re still building and leading into new releases?’ There’s new music coming. Why not go and look at what the music is that’s going to resonate, and then kick it into overdrive to try to get audiences that are passively listening to lock in on the songs?” \n\nIn August, mehro’s team turned on Discovery Mode for “perfume” and ”chance with you” through his distributor Downtown Music Services. “We started with two songs,” explains Rukasin. “The strategy was: Start with two songs for three weeks leading into the new release moment. That will help create a wave of listeners.” The results were impressive: With music that resonated with fans and a clever strategy that kept them engaged, mehro was already reaching new listeners each month. Discovery Mode helped amplify that reach further and helped increase his monthly new listener growth four-fold, taking him past the 1 million monthly listeners threshold for the first time. In addition, through Discovery Mode, mehro increased views of his Canvas for both “perfume” and “hideous” by over 50%. These numbers prove that the music he makes resonates with fans all over the world. Discovery Mode also helped mehro reach fans in 15 new markets where he previously had a minimal audience — including Japan, Slovakia, and Hungary. “We want ears on the music because we know that all people need to do is hear it once or twice and they’ll be a fan, they’ll stay involved, they’ll become more active,” says Rukasin.\n\nWhen mehro learned that he had hit the 1 million listeners milestone, he was understandably awestruck: “I can’t even believe it. I don’t know what to say. That was a goal of mine long [ago].” He sees this all as an introduction to himself as an artist and to the varied sounds he has coming, exemplified in his latest singles: “I’m releasing two series of music simultaneously,” he says, excitement written all over his face. “The first release from it is called ‘[coastline](https://open.spotify.com/track/06J6MvuHOCOI5HerZaKKy2?si=d563c7b14bf54cdf),’ and that’s from a series called *Alchemy*. Not an album, not a project, not an EP — it’s a series,” he says of his novel strategy to introduce fans to the breadth of his music. “The second song that we’re putting out is called ‘howling,’ and that is from another series called *Dark Corners*. We’ll be going from one series to the next series to the next series, releasing one song at a time, to show what we’re capable of, what songs are possible for us, and the different sides of who I am, as an artist and as a person.” \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"7Jtp778DMnESHnykUWTOP2","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"7 Ways to Increase Global Listenership","description":"From playlists to merch, these Spotify strategies can help build your presence around the world.","urlSlug":"global-listenership","releaseDate":"2022-08-17T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"5q9e3LRWE2ffnK2N9gL7D6"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"From playlists to merch, these Spotify strategies can help build your presence around the world.","article":"You have new fans out there in the 180+ countries where Spotify is available – you just haven’t met them yet.

With so many fans embracing a wide range of sounds far away from a given genre’s geographic origins, your audience is [likely to be in unexpected locations](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/edition/reach). For example, Over 95% of K-Pop, Latin Hip-hop, and French Shoegaze listens happen outside of their home country. In fact, the ten cities that stream the most new content are spread over five continents! Understanding these stats can help you figure out what tracks to focus on, who to collaborate with, how to market yourself, and even where to tour.

So when it came to developing *Garden*’s release strategy, it was all about working to reconnect with existing listeners and reaching new ones. To accomplish this, they planned to release singles over the course of the nine months in advance of the full album — building awareness so that the fanbase was ready to jump in eagerly when the album came out. \n\n\"You only get so many opportunities to release an album,” says Desmond. “I don't want to miss a single potential listener: it's a potential ticket buyer, a potential person who's going to tell 10 of their friends.\"\n\nTo meet their goal of “making it as easy as possible for [listeners] to get to” the new music, Desmond says, they utilized several Spotify for Artists tools, including [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode) in a multi-faceted long-lead approach that activated their audience pre-release, made noise when the release dropped, and kept the momentum going post-release. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1IplhgDMzRfPLCwLBng81H/6fba941d3f94cd41f81cec9807061a05/Blog_1_new-12-6-2023.png)\n\n“Our audience is [on Spotify]. It’s how people discover us,” says Desmond. “It’s our main way of communicating with fans.... So it’s always our priority to play in the sandbox there, to use whatever marketing tools are available to us to provide the best experience possible.”\n\nWith Marquee and Canvas, they primed their listeners for the album with a series of singles beginning months ahead of the January 2022 album release. With Discovery Mode, they worked to expand their audience further, right before and after the album dropped — and just ahead of their tour. \n\n*Read on to learn exactly how they used each tool to exceed their goals.*\n\n## Marquee Engaged Listeners Pre-Album\n__*People who saw the Marquees were four times more likely to stream the singles.*__\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/676oBg3mfgAUbZdNrFej6C/ddc82582d9ae6c47f78e4d00e2c957d4/Blog_2.png)\n\n*Water Your Garden*’s first pre-release single, “[Diamond](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ghj9ln405TCxVrlEuVnGA?si=988361c03b174e64),” arrived nine months before the album, in April of 2021. Since it had been two years since their last album, the Magic City Hippies team decided to try a [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) targeting their lapsed listeners because, “It fit the release strategy by helping reach our goal of reengaging with fans,” says Iona Casta, paid media and digital marketing lead at Create Music Group, the band’s distributor. The Marquee drove 25% of their lapsed listeners to actively stream the band for the first time in more than six months. “Once we saw those results, we decided to use the tool for every release.” \n\nThroughout the rest of the year, they served up five more singles — “[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/track/0CVaDx0YP1nMwZd1eg88cX?si=b80d7601e1594d6e),” “[Queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zFXDAZ2V52022GPNYOxyH?si=6475e492b9ab4d98),” “[High Beams](https://open.spotify.com/track/28r57p0khZL2C2tpeKENXi?si=321dbcb92edc4a56),” “[Ghost on the Mend](https://open.spotify.com/track/32bZRcF2imSuRHdpodPEbQ?si=a8808a0f5ea54029),” and “[Champagne on the Rider](https://open.spotify.com/track/4u8traGW2bhMIfE8RibuKr?si=46d81537aaa5457a)” — and they used Marquee to promote all of them. They even had a cheeky inside joke about it. “Brad and I called it ‘foreplay’ for the album,” says Create Music Group project manager Anna Antoniadis. On average, 24% of people who streamed the pre-album singles after seeing the Marquee saved them to their personal libraries for future streaming.  \n\n“It’s the most effective strategy to actually increase streaming numbers because it’s in-app,” Casta continues. “It gives fans direct access to actually listen to the music, save it, and come back to it later. Even if I optimize other ads for conversions, it takes several steps for people to stream and save it.”\n\nUsing Marquee to target Magic City Hippies’ recently interested, casual, and lapsed listeners resulted in listener familiarity with over half of *Water Your Garden* before it even dropped. \n\n“Our biggest challenge,” says Desmond, “is making sure that all of our fanbase is aware of what we’re doing… and Marquee is a home run for doing that.”\n\n## Canvas Extended the Aesthetic\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3MblUuhlhDz1DX9KIrgKzf/15ad49f0db1ac3185247375ad7b22ee6/Blog_3.png)\n\nMagic City Hippies’ comprehensive use of [Canvas](http://canvas.spotify.com) — the Spotify for Artists tool for short, looping visuals — ensured that listeners who clicked the Marquee also got a taste of their creative world. The band invested in videos for every *Water Your Garden* single, and they made a Canvas for each. “Canvas allowed us to bring that visual into the Spotify platform, and to really give a deeper, more immersive listening experience to our fans,” Desmond explains. “The other thing I love about Canvas is, when it’s shared to Instagram Stories, which is something that we really look out for and encourage our fans to do… It just makes it that much more engaging for them.”\n\n“In some instances, we used a little bit of B-roll to provide a little Easter egg for fans who maybe are obsessed with the music video and are coming to Spotify to listen to the song,” Desmond continues. “On the non-single tracks, we used more B-roll from the other videos. One video, we had the director do a lot of slow-motion shots of flowers, and that was on-brand for the album title.” B-roll from another video was turned into “kind of like a psychedelic visualizer” Canvas for another song. \n\n## Discovery Mode Helped Expand Their Reach\n__*The trio more than tripled their audience in Discovery Mode contexts across more than 100 markets, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before.*__ \n\nIn December, the month before the album arrived and the tour began, the team looked to reach new listeners by turning on [Discovery Mode](http://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode), a marketing tool that helps artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery. Discovery Mode allows distributors to select music they want to prioritize in select personalized sessions. This increases the likelihood a track reaches listeners in those contexts. \n\n“It was kind of a no-brainer in that period, to say, ‘Let’s give a shot at reaching as many people as possible’,” says Desmond. “Especially in a month like December, which is traditionally considered a down month,” seeing the band’s audience triple within Discovery Mode contexts, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before, was “beyond what we expected.” \n\nThe team was surprised at first to see particular uplift for two of the songs they selected, with streams of “Ghost on the Mend” and “Diamond” doubling in Discovery Mode contexts when they turned on Discovery Mode for those tracks compared to the month prior. “Once we looked at a lot of the data, it ended up making sense,” explains Antoniadis. \n\n“I thought ‘Queen’ would've done better because it's shorter and hookier,” says Desmond. “‘Diamond’ and ‘Ghost on the Mend’ are really dynamic, and it was a surprise, but I think it was really cool. On our end, it was cool to see the impact. It's always cool to see the backend data, but specifically with Discovery Mode… it gave us some really interesting insight.” \n\nOverall, the band found Discovery Mode a powerful way to understand what people connect with, “because it’s coming up in algorithmic playlists,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, I heard this super-randomly on a radio, and I added it to my playlist, and I listen to it all the time now.’ That was an interesting, different way to see how things connect.”\n\nFor Desmond, “as an independent artist, to be able to have that kind of audience insight, it’s really incredible.”\n\n## Making Noise On Release Day and Beyond \n\nHaving expanded their audience through Discovery Mode, the band was ready to promote the album, *Water Your Garden*, with Marquee once more. To build on the momentum, they booked a Marquee campaign targeting recently interested listeners — listeners who actively streamed their music in the last 28 days.\n\nIt drove an average of 13.5 streams of the new release per listener, over three times more streams per listener than their album at large. \n\nThat, “shows how reliably it converts, and, at the end of the day, it’s conversion, conversion, conversion,” says Antoniadis. “No matter how many clicks you get on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn’t necessarily mean the user’s gonna go stream the song… As data people, I love being able to see the actual conversion into streams.” \n\nWith Marquee, the album also reached their highest intent rate yet: 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the album to their library or added it to a personal playlist. Plus, 20% of their Marquee listeners also streamed from their older releases like 2019’s *[Modern Animal](https://open.spotify.com/album/6y5roSQsSbhNcVfIkhF7wL?si=sCjy4GBqSx2X7K47ecANYw)*. \n\nBecause “fans are still connecting with it,” months after the album’s release day, Desmond says the team will return to Discovery Mode for *Garden* tracks that weren’t previously turned on.\n\n“One of my goals in general—and especially with an album rollout—is extending the release period the day after the release,” adds Antoniadis. “It doesn’t end there for anyone, and you can continue pushing it in different ways. Discovery Mode [is] an amazing tool for just that.”\n\n“It was a bigger, more professional release this time around,” Desmond says. “We always try to leave no stone unturned, and with these [three] tools, we were able to do a better job of that.”\n\nThe band is excited to continue building on the success of this release as their 2022 tour kicks into high gear, including a stop at Firefly Music Festival in September. “They worked really hard for a couple years to take that sound that’s very unique to them, that they create in the studio, and… bring it on the stage and still perform it live,” Desmond says.","modules":[{"title":"Magic City Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Inside the Julia Wolf World: Building Momentum for a New EP, 'Girls in Purgatory'","description":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","urlSlug":"julia-wolf-video-how-they-made-it-new-ep-girls-in-purgatory","releaseDate":"2021-12-09T13:30-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"69yN2bTiEN6usxlihhWk2l"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","article":"[Julia Wolf](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5yvGiZLSWJTPBlZpVbPnEZ?si=h-FgU-_dQuOapDngCAOXSw) is “making music for the girls that are too afraid to speak their minds,” drawing from her own experiences as a shy kid in a big Italian family, struggling to fit in and finding her escape – finding herself – through music. \n\nNow with more than 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, the independent artist uses her own experiences to fuel her music, connecting with fans in a way that’s unique, radically authentic, and 100% her. \n\nBut it was a journey to get there. “Pursuing music as a career had a lot of trial and error involved, a lot of dead ends,” explains Wolf in the new episode of our [How They Made It series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it). “It certainly wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Using Canvas: Top Tips On How to Engage and Attract Fans With Short, Looping Visuals","description":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","urlSlug":"using-canvas-top-tips-on-how-to-engage-attract-fans-short-looping-visuals","releaseDate":"2022-04-20T09:55-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7yCTvLVdh9Pe7nFWNkX7vR"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","article":"Music and art have always been a perfect pairing, and every artist knows their visual identity is an incredibly important way to attract and connect with fans. [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science.

(“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

The 21-year-old rising star’s wistful first single, “[perfume](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kvkYrjZh561EJwERr8EsK?si=3ae2a5dcf6204c25),” with its melancholy acoustic guitar licks and love-struck lyrics, was released in February 2020 and has since become a bona fide indie hit with over 10 million streams on Spotify. After dropping “perfume,” mehro released three singles and two remixes to set the stage for his debut project, *[SKY ON FIRE](https://open.spotify.com/album/78pXYuIlTIUBQhtQTH8gTP?si=1OqFrfzNR6a9zhwrg12vgg\u0026dl_branch=1)*, which was released in March 2021. To date, the project has amassed over 23 million streams, and songs from the project have been saved or playlisted over 1.1 million times.\n\nmehro’s success has been propelled by a marketing approach that amplifies his natural affability via social media and in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84l8PSULCpE\u0026list=PLpobPPKGosH5ZVIBQ57eCubw6IADBAGdM) content, as well as Spotify for Artists tools like [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us), [artist playlists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=cc77f49de99442a5), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode?utm_source=googlesearch\u0026utm_medium=paid\u0026utm_campaign=2021q3_creator_single_creator_discovery_mode\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwqKuKBhCxARIsACf4XuFr8UHzczvoKpLe1KxQOhbR4XboP0bmF_TVMCYDxWVE6YLtkNLnA8YaAsC8EALw_wcB) to help deepen his connection with current fans and help introduce him to new ones. \n\nWhen asked about the source of his inspiration and what led him to create music, mehro responds matter-of-factly: “I’m a sensitive person. I felt so many things inside of me, and I had to let it out somehow.\" On social media, in [intimate conversations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpobPPKGosH4eVS1uAKkg54FpBvOw7BVr) with fans over Zoom, or even in the interview for this article, mehro’s demeanor reflects the emotive music he’s released thus far: He is gentle, as self-aware as he is self-assured, and most importantly, authentic. \n\n“The stories he’s telling in these songs are universal but very specific,” says Danny Rukasin, his manager. “The way that he’s cultivated a community around his music and his fans, [you can tell that] he really does care.” Rukasin, also co-manager to Billie Eilish and FINNEAS, partnered with mehro to help him realize his goals of taking care of himself and his family while making art that brings him both fulfillment and excitement.\n\nNo stranger to the needs of emerging artists, Rukasin and the team around mehro set out with a strategy of scaling the audience for his honest and earnest brand of music. Though fans have gotten a taste of what mehro can do with his releases thus far, Rukasin explains that it's just the tip of the iceberg and that the varied offerings to come require an atypical approach to building a fanbase. “mehro has a ton of music — and a wide breadth of diverse music, too,” he says. “So we’re putting a release plan together that isn’t leading to one big moment but continuously releasing music, so there is no endpoint and more for the newly discovered fan to listen to and\nstay excited for.” \n\nSpotify for Artists tools were key to their plan of building upon past successes and converting social media engagement into fan engagement on Spotify. mehro’s playlist, [Stay Pure](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=-dCv5CQdSdqCoDdxy2Ngww), was not only a place for him to showcase his own music, but his musical taste as well. The playlist, which fans can find on his artist profile via [Artist Pick](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/artist-pick), features tracks from his favorite artists alongside his own: “Stay Pure is one of those things where I get to champion artists whose music I love and who I respect,” he says.\n\nBeyond being an expression of his personal taste, Stay Pure was an opportunity to get fans involved and to give them a stake in one of his creations. “Stay Pure turned into a fan initiative where we had fans submitting UGC [user-generated content] creative, and eventually we made the cover one of the fan’s pieces of art,” explains mehro’s marketing manager, Ryan Lassi. “We’re trying to not only build community around mehro’s Instagram; there’s a community to be built around his Spotify.” \n\n![mehro incorporated [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music.](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/6gB76z9yYWE8aYADv5PSNY/7ce51932ecf0e5dd877f3f989ce0e13e/Blog-2.gif)\n\nFor mehro, imagery is as important as the music, and he uses Canvas to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music. “We launched with that ‘perfume’ Canvas, and there’s something just really timeless about that Canvas that we really love — it’s very mehro,” says Lassi. “We had Canvases go out for ‘hideous’ and singles as they went, but then, once we started talking about the *SKY ON FIRE* project, we were like, ‘maybe now is our opportunity to refresh these Canvases and give fans something new to consume, especially if they’re coming back to some of these tracks for the second, third, fourth time.’” \n\nDiscovery Mode was key to their plan of building mehro’s momentum and introducing him to listeners who were likely to have an affinity for his sound. Currently in an early testing phase, this new tool may help artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery.  “Spotify understands how to really hit those listeners,” says Rukasin. “[With Discovery Mode], we saw the opportunity and felt, ‘Why not take it while we’re still building and leading into new releases?’ There’s new music coming. Why not go and look at what the music is that’s going to resonate, and then kick it into overdrive to try to get audiences that are passively listening to lock in on the songs?” \n\nIn August, mehro’s team turned on Discovery Mode for “perfume” and ”chance with you” through his distributor Downtown Music Services. “We started with two songs,” explains Rukasin. “The strategy was: Start with two songs for three weeks leading into the new release moment. That will help create a wave of listeners.” The results were impressive: With music that resonated with fans and a clever strategy that kept them engaged, mehro was already reaching new listeners each month. Discovery Mode helped amplify that reach further and helped increase his monthly new listener growth four-fold, taking him past the 1 million monthly listeners threshold for the first time. In addition, through Discovery Mode, mehro increased views of his Canvas for both “perfume” and “hideous” by over 50%. These numbers prove that the music he makes resonates with fans all over the world. Discovery Mode also helped mehro reach fans in 15 new markets where he previously had a minimal audience — including Japan, Slovakia, and Hungary. “We want ears on the music because we know that all people need to do is hear it once or twice and they’ll be a fan, they’ll stay involved, they’ll become more active,” says Rukasin.\n\nWhen mehro learned that he had hit the 1 million listeners milestone, he was understandably awestruck: “I can’t even believe it. I don’t know what to say. That was a goal of mine long [ago].” He sees this all as an introduction to himself as an artist and to the varied sounds he has coming, exemplified in his latest singles: “I’m releasing two series of music simultaneously,” he says, excitement written all over his face. “The first release from it is called ‘[coastline](https://open.spotify.com/track/06J6MvuHOCOI5HerZaKKy2?si=d563c7b14bf54cdf),’ and that’s from a series called *Alchemy*. Not an album, not a project, not an EP — it’s a series,” he says of his novel strategy to introduce fans to the breadth of his music. “The second song that we’re putting out is called ‘howling,’ and that is from another series called *Dark Corners*. We’ll be going from one series to the next series to the next series, releasing one song at a time, to show what we’re capable of, what songs are possible for us, and the different sides of who I am, as an artist and as a person.” \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"7Jtp778DMnESHnykUWTOP2","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"From Concept to Canvas: Olivia Rodrigo's 'drivers license'","description":"The biggest song in the world features one of the coolest Canvases on Spotify.

We talk to Olivia Rodrigo’s creative team about making the perfect visual accompaniment for her breakup anthem.\n","article":"Right now, Olivia Rodrigo is in the driver’s seat and the whole world is along for the ride. As of this writing, the 17-year-old singer-songwriter’s single “[drivers license](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lPN2DXiMsVn7XUKtOW1CS?si=tswYSV4uScmQIq7Mv3iCzw)” has been No. 1 on the [Global Weekly Top Songs Chart](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbNG2KDcFcKOF?si=SPBWd9HuRCyqu7olCQyKGg) for three weeks in a row and has set the record for the most streams for a song in a week on Spotify. The song also sits atop Spotify’s [United States Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp?si=2e2_T-54TvC6R-LPmI3eZg) with over 2 million daily plays and is No. 1 on the [Global Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF?si=wmb9ajMES6W5V-NNrWwzgw) with over 8 million daily plays. This is all after debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and setting the record for the most streams in a day for a non-holiday song.\n\nThe single’s success is due to a number of factors: first and foremost, it’s a heartfelt, relatable, and catchy pop song about young love and loss; then there’s Rodrigo’s preexisting fanbase as a Disney starlet (she plays Nini Salazar-Roberts in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series”); add to that the song’s virality on social media; co-signs from Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish; fan theories about the story behind its lyrics; and you’ve got the recipe for the first bona fide mega-hit of 2021. \n\nWhen you listen to the track on the Spotify app you’ll notice the looping image of three  vintage-looking California driver’s licenses stacked on top of each other, each with animated images of Rodrigo looking alternately sad, strong, pensive, and happy —  this is the [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) for “drivers license.” Conceived by Rodrigo herself, the Canvas is a hit too, with over 243,000 total Instagram shares in the first week of its release (Jan. 8 to Jan.15) and more than 50 million views in the first three weeks. Ned Monahan, Spotify’s Head of Global Hits, knows that breakout successes like this one only happen once in a blue moon. “These sorts of lightning-in-a-bottle moments are rare, but the stars really aligned for ‘drivers license,’” he explains. “It’s a truly great song that’s instantly engaging, touching on universal feelings of heartbreak and suburban angst. The Canvas is a visual extension of the song’s themes, giving fans another way of contextualizing Olivia’s vision and relatable experiences — so it makes sense that it’s been well-received!”\n\nTo bring her vision for the Canvas to life, Rodrigo and Interscope/Geffen worked with art director Dina Hovsepian and designer Tim Barsten. “What we were trying to capture was a vintage-looking license, says Hovsepian, explaining her approach to the design. “I used lots of layers of scratchy filters to create the washed-out feel over her photos and to create the faded text.” (And yes, she confirms, “It’s her real b-day on the license.”) To further understand the inspiration and execution behind the Canvas, Spotify for Artists asked Barsten, who designed and animated the Canvas, about the process.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: How big of a role did Olivia play in the creative process for this Canvas? What was her input?__\n\n__Tim Barsten:__ I have to give all the creative direction credit to Olivia [Rodrigo]. The label provided the artwork and the original driver’s license design she used for her merch for the single, and Olivia provided some shots of herself for the Canvas with the note that she would like to replace the images on the driver’s license with the shots she sent. She said “Think: [Harry Potter, talking portraits](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait)” and I knew exactly what she meant. I then took all the assets into [Adobe] After Effects and designed what you see today. \n\n![Olivia Rodrigo's Harry Potter-inspired driver's licenses](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/21Xva8yuCON4ZHPCsXAoIZ/8dd530b55d5ff1b4189404f77766cacf/Rodrigo-Tile-4MB.gif)\n\n__Talk about interpreting the song and its lyrics visually for the Canvas, there are six looping images in the three licenses in the frame of the Canvas, were those images created specifically for this? What was the direction of the shoot for them and what emotions/moods were you trying to capture?__\n\nIn order to capture the concept of the song, Olivia wanted to showcase all of the different stages of a relationship that has come to an end. From heartbreak to forgiveness, to finally getting back to being happy again, she wanted all of the stages represented in the six different images on the three driver’s licenses for the Canvas of the song. \n\n__How did you think about how the Canvas and single artwork should be different or work together?__\n\nI love that this Canvas is different from the concept for the [single] artwork and music video — it acts almost as a supplemental piece of creative for the song that tells the story in a different way. Because the Canvas concept was different from the art and video but still needed to feel within the same world, I incorporated subtle elements of the music video and single art to help connect them visually. I was able to do that by overlaying some light purple flares in the background and overlaid grain to replicate the music video which was shot on film. From the artwork, I was inspired by the torn paper, grungier feel and applied vintage coloring, and added a slight degradation over the entire Canvas to make it feel a little more retro.\n\n__How long did it take for you to go from concept to Canvas? Were there many revisions?__\n\nWe started with the first concept during the second week of December [2020]. We went back and forth over the next few weeks with different concepts and versions before ultimately settling on the final version you see today. In the end, the original concept from that second week of December is the one we ended up going with! \n\n![Early alternate versions of the \"drivers license\" Canvas ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7cN31Y2xCJ71Plv1iWCywJ/b387822ee9c1ed370f732d258c13bddd/Rodrigo-Body-02-2MB.gif)\n\n__Which ideas were left on the cutting room floor?__\n\nWe had a few different concepts we were working through. On one of them, I took the original artwork and created a stagnant image in the vertical canvas format. I then separated the different layers and applied different types of grains, dust, flares, scan lines, and film mattes to the separated layers to give each layer its own individual movement. In the end, the concept you see now was the most compelling. \n\n__How does it feel to know that your work has been seen or shared by millions of fans at this point? Did you notice all the Canvas shares to Instagram Stories?__\n\nIt feels so cool to have worked on something that has reached the eyes of millions of people on both Spotify and Instagram. I’ve loved seeing it shared all over the world! \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timmhotep Aku","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"2RE4wRc7qEnxFZCVSRE2t3","contentType":"articlePage"}],"themeName":"whiteOnBlack","id":"oxbqgOYOtbh56EDVgbAoN","contentType":"relatedStoriesList"}],"indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"30R9sSwX2mwikPrD0cYxpo","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"article","articleLink":{"title":"Introducing Campaign Kit: Campaign Tools Made for Music","description":"Learn how to use Campaign Kit, our set of tools specifically made to amplify your music and build lifelong fans — right where streaming happens.

They're costly and often fall short when it comes to targeting the right listeners or capturing their attention — not to mention the guesswork of trying to measure the impact of these tools on streaming.\n\nThat’s why we’ve invested in building effective campaign tools that are made for music — playlist pitching, Discovery Mode, Marquee and, most recently, Showcase. Each tool is designed to help you reach the right listeners, drive engagement when they're listening to music, and measure the impact on audience streaming and engagement. \n\nNow we're bringing together all these tools under one umbrella called Campaign Kit, with the goal of making it the single most effective toolkit to help you grow your audience, no matter where you are in your career or release cycle. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6nyG3YC875gyfj4KyVaRlE/0dfbd3e25a7f590f945f38ea2b440fcf/CK_Value_Prop_Blog_1280x700__1___1_.png)\n\n## What is Campaign Kit?\n\nAs the world's biggest music platform, Spotify can uniquely help artists create lifelong fans. With Campaign Kit, you have the tools you need to amplify your music – reaching listeners in Spotify programming or when they’re actively deciding what to stream next. \n\n### Let’s learn a little more about each tool: \n\n- __[Playlist pitching](https://artists.spotify.com/playlisting)__ makes it easier to share your new songs with the editors who curate playlists like Rap Caviar, Today’s Top Hits, and Fresh Finds. Submit upcoming, unreleased music to Spotify’s editors for playlist consideration — it’s 100% free and available to all artists.\n\n- __[Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode)__ can help expand the reach of your songs in personalized playlists — with no upfront cost. Select the songs that are a priority for you, and we’ll use that signal to help you find new listeners who are going to love them. \n\n- __[Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee)__ captures listeners’ undivided attention with a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release right when they open the app. When a listener clicks on a Marquee, they can save or go directly to your new release, where they can focus on your music.\n\n- __[Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/showcase)__, our newest sponsored recommendation, lets you promote your music to likely listeners at any time with a mobile banner at the top of Spotify’s Home – where millions of listeners look when they’re deciding what to listen to. You can spotlight both new releases and music from your catalog for any occasion, like if your song is going viral, you’re drumming up interest in a tour, or your album anniversary is coming up. \n\n## How Campaign Kit helps amplify your music\n\nThe tools within Campaign Kit are designed to be used together to meet your goals. Here are some examples of how artists and their teams used Campaign Kit – along with a few other Spotify for Artists tools – to successfully grow their audiences:\n\n- Independent R\u0026B artist thuy and her team used Campaign Kit across multiple releases to grow her monthly active listeners by more than 300%. They started by using Discovery Mode to grow her audience in the run up to her debut EP. Once her release dropped, they capitalized on that momentum with Marquee, targeting light and moderate listeners to turn them into bigger fans.\n\n  “Once Discovery Mode started, we really began to notice that the save rate, the listenership, the playlist adds were going through the roof,” said Isobel Kelly, VP Global Head of Streaming at Venice Music and part of thuy’s team. “We had really connected with a new, wide range of potential fans.” \n\n  The campaigns helped thuy reach fans in 178 countries and had her music saved by 230,000 listeners with 210,000 user playlist adds. See more [here](https://artists.spotify.com/video/thuy-how-to-grow-audience-spotify-discovery-mode-marquee-case-study).\n\n- Miami’s Magic City Hippies were able to prime listeners for their 2022 sophomore album, [*Water Your Garden*](https://open.spotify.com/album/0r0l3PRmsPwylAZQM16e7a?si=o227gMSNRL2oLH0jv64DmQ), with a popular Campaign Kit strategy — promoting singles leading up to an album with Marquee, then turning on Discovery Mode for those same tracks. \n\n  The results were clear: Listeners who saw their Marquees were 4x more likely to stream pre-release singles. See more [here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-magic-city-hippies-sequenced-marquee-canvas-and-discovery-mode).\n\n- When Nashville-based folktronica artist Conner Youngblood submitted his song [“Pizza Body”](https://open.spotify.com/track/4OqVdU4qEYloCoDAvEtPZS?si=b31510e6b66d49aa) for editorial playlist consideration, the song was added to the Mellow Morning playlist. It sparked significant growth in his monthly listeners and followers on Spotify, with an added bonus: a noticeable boost in fans at his live shows all over the world. [Check out our series How They Made It](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-wiki-dreezy-and-conner-youngblood-made-it), where Conner, Brooklyn hip-hop artist Wiki, and Chicago rapper Dreezy discuss the impact that pitching their music for playlist consideration has had on each of their careers.\n\n- Goth Babe’s team have used Campaign Kit for many of his new releases and catalog tracks, last year hyping four new releases by successfully pairing Marquee and Discovery Mode. Using Discovery Mode on catalog tracks helped Goth Babe expand his audience, and Marquee helped him notify listeners about his new release. \n\n  His 2019 single [“Weekend Friend”](https://open.spotify.com/track/2d3QlXE6FXFDeodiS66yjM?si=373393ee0b404b8a) was one of the catalog tracks added to Discovery Mode in 2022. This resulted in more streams than it had even during its initial release-week peak. To keep the momentum going, they then promoted “Weekend Friend” with Showcase, targeting his previously active audience to re-engage listeners who had dropped off. \n\n## What new features are coming to Campaign Kit?\nWe’re building Campaign Kit to be the most effective way for artists to reach listeners and develop lifelong fans. In the coming weeks, we’re rolling out some exciting new features to help more artists reach more potential fans at the right music moments:\n\n- __Launching new creative options for Marquee and Showcase:__ Artists and their teams have asked us for more ways to customize their sponsored recommendations, so next year we’re excited to introduce new creative options, like giving teams the ability to pick and choose the background color of their Marquee to match their release artwork. For Showcase, artists will soon be able to choose from four additional headlines — including “Your playlist finds” and “Try something new” — that give listeners even more of a reason to engage.\n- __Connecting with listeners in Mixes:__ [Spotify Mixes](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-mixes/) are similar to [Spotify Radio](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-radio/)— both are personalized algorithmic playlists that listeners select when they’re open to discovery based on a specific input. However until now, despite their similarity to radio playlists, Discovery Mode hasn’t been available in Mixes. We’re updating that in early 2024: Discovery Mode campaigns will include Daily Mix starting January 3, and we’ll be expanding to artist, decade, mood, and genre mixes thereafter. (You can recognize Spotify Mixes with their signature cover design.) For artists and labels using Discovery Mode, this means more opportunities to connect with listeners when they’re most open to discovery — whether it’s a catalog artist reaching listeners in 80s Mix, an EDM artist reaching listeners in Dance/Electronic Mix, or an artist selecting *just* the right song to fit a listener’s Happy Mix.\n- __Expanding Marquee and Showcase to artists in more countries:__ This year, we expanded Marquee to the U.K., Canada, and Australia and introduced Showcase to [eligible](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) artist teams in the U.S. Early next year, we’re excited to expand Showcase to the markets where Marquee is already live and roll out both tools to artist teams in France. Stay tuned for more news on the global reach of our campaign tools over the course of 2024.\n\n## How to get started with Campaign Kit tools\n\nWhile all artists have access to [playlist pitching](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/), we're still expanding access to Discovery Mode, Marquee, and [Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/showcase). Eligible artists and their teams can navigate to the Campaigns tab on Spotify for Artists on desktop to start creating campaigns. (Learn more about eligibility for each tool: [Discovery Mode](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/getting-access-to-discovery-mode/), [Marquee, and Showcase](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/).)\n\nOn our new [Campaign Kit website](https://artists.spotify.com/campaign-kit), you’ll find more details on how we can help you and your team reach your goals – whether you want to grow your audience with a new release, re-engage fans with your catalog, celebrate a release anniversary, develop new audiences around the world, and so much more. Keep an eye on that space over the next few months as we roll out webinars, insights, and more educational materials. \n\nAnd make sure you don’t miss a beat, [sign up](https://masterclass.byspotify.com/) for the Campaign Kit Masterclass on January 24, 2024. We'll share more details on how to best use the toolkit, including how marketers at mTheory and Venice Music are successfully pairing these tools for their artists.\n","modules":[{"title":"Campaign Kit Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Related stories","items":[{"title":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","description":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in Radio and Autoplay before the album dropped.","urlSlug":"how-magic-city-hippies-sequenced-marquee-canvas-and-discovery-mode","releaseDate":"2022-07-14T11:50-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","headline":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","image":{"title":"Magic City Hippies","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/4FmIoTmNRTLlNqQZHxSpTH/fb720f937cf60abaee42520ad09996a3/Blog_Header.png","details":{"size":632612,"image":{"width":1280,"height":700}},"fileName":"Blog Header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","textColor":"#000000","id":"2Cj16pKHMvqeP8RUlrASiu","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in [Discovery Mode contexts](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/discovery-mode-contexts/) before the album dropped.","article":"Miami’s [Magic City Hippies](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ikg4sypcURm8Vy5GP68xb) have brought their breezy alt-funk to the party since they formed in 2015, but when the pandemic changed the game, the indie trio got innovative with how they recorded their sophomore album, *[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/album/0r0l3PRmsPwylAZQM16e7a?si=gQt1zxLQTCeUTYD3KROItQ)*, and how they made sure it reached more listeners than the band ever had before.\n\nWritten and recorded in 2021 with band members Robby Hunter, Pat Howard, and John Coughlin all hunkered down in different parts of the country, the album’s title explains the 11 songs’ overarching theme of “taking care of yourself and taking care of your loved ones,” says manager Brad Desmond. “It’s something that the guys felt was missing from their lives before the pandemic.”\n\nWhen Magic City Hippies began planning *Water Your Garden*’s release, the band had nearly 650,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and it had been two years since their debut, *Modern Animal*. So when it came to developing *Garden*’s release strategy, it was all about working to reconnect with existing listeners and reaching new ones. To accomplish this, they planned to release singles over the course of the nine months in advance of the full album — building awareness so that the fanbase was ready to jump in eagerly when the album came out. \n\n\"You only get so many opportunities to release an album,” says Desmond. “I don't want to miss a single potential listener: it's a potential ticket buyer, a potential person who's going to tell 10 of their friends.\"\n\nTo meet their goal of “making it as easy as possible for [listeners] to get to” the new music, Desmond says, they utilized several Spotify for Artists tools, including [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode) in a multi-faceted long-lead approach that activated their audience pre-release, made noise when the release dropped, and kept the momentum going post-release. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1IplhgDMzRfPLCwLBng81H/6fba941d3f94cd41f81cec9807061a05/Blog_1_new-12-6-2023.png)\n\n“Our audience is [on Spotify]. It’s how people discover us,” says Desmond. “It’s our main way of communicating with fans.... So it’s always our priority to play in the sandbox there, to use whatever marketing tools are available to us to provide the best experience possible.”\n\nWith Marquee and Canvas, they primed their listeners for the album with a series of singles beginning months ahead of the January 2022 album release. With Discovery Mode, they worked to expand their audience further, right before and after the album dropped — and just ahead of their tour. \n\n*Read on to learn exactly how they used each tool to exceed their goals.*\n\n## Marquee Engaged Listeners Pre-Album\n__*People who saw the Marquees were four times more likely to stream the singles.*__\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/676oBg3mfgAUbZdNrFej6C/ddc82582d9ae6c47f78e4d00e2c957d4/Blog_2.png)\n\n*Water Your Garden*’s first pre-release single, “[Diamond](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ghj9ln405TCxVrlEuVnGA?si=988361c03b174e64),” arrived nine months before the album, in April of 2021. Since it had been two years since their last album, the Magic City Hippies team decided to try a [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) targeting their lapsed listeners because, “It fit the release strategy by helping reach our goal of reengaging with fans,” says Iona Casta, paid media and digital marketing lead at Create Music Group, the band’s distributor. The Marquee drove 25% of their lapsed listeners to actively stream the band for the first time in more than six months. “Once we saw those results, we decided to use the tool for every release.” \n\nThroughout the rest of the year, they served up five more singles — “[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/track/0CVaDx0YP1nMwZd1eg88cX?si=b80d7601e1594d6e),” “[Queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zFXDAZ2V52022GPNYOxyH?si=6475e492b9ab4d98),” “[High Beams](https://open.spotify.com/track/28r57p0khZL2C2tpeKENXi?si=321dbcb92edc4a56),” “[Ghost on the Mend](https://open.spotify.com/track/32bZRcF2imSuRHdpodPEbQ?si=a8808a0f5ea54029),” and “[Champagne on the Rider](https://open.spotify.com/track/4u8traGW2bhMIfE8RibuKr?si=46d81537aaa5457a)” — and they used Marquee to promote all of them. They even had a cheeky inside joke about it. “Brad and I called it ‘foreplay’ for the album,” says Create Music Group project manager Anna Antoniadis. On average, 24% of people who streamed the pre-album singles after seeing the Marquee saved them to their personal libraries for future streaming.  \n\n“It’s the most effective strategy to actually increase streaming numbers because it’s in-app,” Casta continues. “It gives fans direct access to actually listen to the music, save it, and come back to it later. Even if I optimize other ads for conversions, it takes several steps for people to stream and save it.”\n\nUsing Marquee to target Magic City Hippies’ recently interested, casual, and lapsed listeners resulted in listener familiarity with over half of *Water Your Garden* before it even dropped. \n\n“Our biggest challenge,” says Desmond, “is making sure that all of our fanbase is aware of what we’re doing… and Marquee is a home run for doing that.”\n\n## Canvas Extended the Aesthetic\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3MblUuhlhDz1DX9KIrgKzf/15ad49f0db1ac3185247375ad7b22ee6/Blog_3.png)\n\nMagic City Hippies’ comprehensive use of [Canvas](http://canvas.spotify.com) — the Spotify for Artists tool for short, looping visuals — ensured that listeners who clicked the Marquee also got a taste of their creative world. The band invested in videos for every *Water Your Garden* single, and they made a Canvas for each. “Canvas allowed us to bring that visual into the Spotify platform, and to really give a deeper, more immersive listening experience to our fans,” Desmond explains. “The other thing I love about Canvas is, when it’s shared to Instagram Stories, which is something that we really look out for and encourage our fans to do… It just makes it that much more engaging for them.”\n\n“In some instances, we used a little bit of B-roll to provide a little Easter egg for fans who maybe are obsessed with the music video and are coming to Spotify to listen to the song,” Desmond continues. “On the non-single tracks, we used more B-roll from the other videos. One video, we had the director do a lot of slow-motion shots of flowers, and that was on-brand for the album title.” B-roll from another video was turned into “kind of like a psychedelic visualizer” Canvas for another song. \n\n## Discovery Mode Helped Expand Their Reach\n__*The trio more than tripled their audience in Discovery Mode contexts across more than 100 markets, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before.*__ \n\nIn December, the month before the album arrived and the tour began, the team looked to reach new listeners by turning on [Discovery Mode](http://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode), a marketing tool that helps artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery. Discovery Mode allows distributors to select music they want to prioritize in select personalized sessions. This increases the likelihood a track reaches listeners in those contexts. \n\n“It was kind of a no-brainer in that period, to say, ‘Let’s give a shot at reaching as many people as possible’,” says Desmond. “Especially in a month like December, which is traditionally considered a down month,” seeing the band’s audience triple within Discovery Mode contexts, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before, was “beyond what we expected.” \n\nThe team was surprised at first to see particular uplift for two of the songs they selected, with streams of “Ghost on the Mend” and “Diamond” doubling in Discovery Mode contexts when they turned on Discovery Mode for those tracks compared to the month prior. “Once we looked at a lot of the data, it ended up making sense,” explains Antoniadis. \n\n“I thought ‘Queen’ would've done better because it's shorter and hookier,” says Desmond. “‘Diamond’ and ‘Ghost on the Mend’ are really dynamic, and it was a surprise, but I think it was really cool. On our end, it was cool to see the impact. It's always cool to see the backend data, but specifically with Discovery Mode… it gave us some really interesting insight.” \n\nOverall, the band found Discovery Mode a powerful way to understand what people connect with, “because it’s coming up in algorithmic playlists,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, I heard this super-randomly on a radio, and I added it to my playlist, and I listen to it all the time now.’ That was an interesting, different way to see how things connect.”\n\nFor Desmond, “as an independent artist, to be able to have that kind of audience insight, it’s really incredible.”\n\n## Making Noise On Release Day and Beyond \n\nHaving expanded their audience through Discovery Mode, the band was ready to promote the album, *Water Your Garden*, with Marquee once more. To build on the momentum, they booked a Marquee campaign targeting recently interested listeners — listeners who actively streamed their music in the last 28 days.\n\nIt drove an average of 13.5 streams of the new release per listener, over three times more streams per listener than their album at large. \n\nThat, “shows how reliably it converts, and, at the end of the day, it’s conversion, conversion, conversion,” says Antoniadis. “No matter how many clicks you get on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn’t necessarily mean the user’s gonna go stream the song… As data people, I love being able to see the actual conversion into streams.” \n\nWith Marquee, the album also reached their highest intent rate yet: 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the album to their library or added it to a personal playlist. Plus, 20% of their Marquee listeners also streamed from their older releases like 2019’s *[Modern Animal](https://open.spotify.com/album/6y5roSQsSbhNcVfIkhF7wL?si=sCjy4GBqSx2X7K47ecANYw)*. \n\nBecause “fans are still connecting with it,” months after the album’s release day, Desmond says the team will return to Discovery Mode for *Garden* tracks that weren’t previously turned on.\n\n“One of my goals in general—and especially with an album rollout—is extending the release period the day after the release,” adds Antoniadis. “It doesn’t end there for anyone, and you can continue pushing it in different ways. Discovery Mode [is] an amazing tool for just that.”\n\n“It was a bigger, more professional release this time around,” Desmond says. “We always try to leave no stone unturned, and with these [three] tools, we were able to do a better job of that.”\n\nThe band is excited to continue building on the success of this release as their 2022 tour kicks into high gear, including a stop at Firefly Music Festival in September. “They worked really hard for a couple years to take that sound that’s very unique to them, that they create in the studio, and… bring it on the stage and still perform it live,” Desmond says.","modules":[{"title":"Magic City Recirculation Module","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"Related Stories","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Inside the Julia Wolf World: Building Momentum for a New EP, 'Girls in Purgatory'","description":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","urlSlug":"julia-wolf-video-how-they-made-it-new-ep-girls-in-purgatory","releaseDate":"2021-12-09T13:30-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"69yN2bTiEN6usxlihhWk2l"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","article":"[Julia Wolf](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5yvGiZLSWJTPBlZpVbPnEZ?si=h-FgU-_dQuOapDngCAOXSw) is “making music for the girls that are too afraid to speak their minds,” drawing from her own experiences as a shy kid in a big Italian family, struggling to fit in and finding her escape – finding herself – through music. \n\nNow with more than 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, the independent artist uses her own experiences to fuel her music, connecting with fans in a way that’s unique, radically authentic, and 100% her. \n\nBut it was a journey to get there. “Pursuing music as a career had a lot of trial and error involved, a lot of dead ends,” explains Wolf in the new episode of our [How They Made It series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it). “It certainly wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Using Canvas: Top Tips On How to Engage and Attract Fans With Short, Looping Visuals","description":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","urlSlug":"using-canvas-top-tips-on-how-to-engage-attract-fans-short-looping-visuals","releaseDate":"2022-04-20T09:55-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7yCTvLVdh9Pe7nFWNkX7vR"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","article":"Music and art have always been a perfect pairing, and every artist knows their visual identity is an incredibly important way to attract and connect with fans.

The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

The 21-year-old rising star’s wistful first single, “[perfume](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kvkYrjZh561EJwERr8EsK?si=3ae2a5dcf6204c25),” with its melancholy acoustic guitar licks and love-struck lyrics, was released in February 2020 and has since become a bona fide indie hit with over 10 million streams on Spotify. After dropping “perfume,” mehro released three singles and two remixes to set the stage for his debut project, *[SKY ON FIRE](https://open.spotify.com/album/78pXYuIlTIUBQhtQTH8gTP?si=1OqFrfzNR6a9zhwrg12vgg\u0026dl_branch=1)*, which was released in March 2021. To date, the project has amassed over 23 million streams, and songs from the project have been saved or playlisted over 1.1 million times.\n\nmehro’s success has been propelled by a marketing approach that amplifies his natural affability via social media and in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84l8PSULCpE\u0026list=PLpobPPKGosH5ZVIBQ57eCubw6IADBAGdM) content, as well as Spotify for Artists tools like [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us), [artist playlists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=cc77f49de99442a5), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode?utm_source=googlesearch\u0026utm_medium=paid\u0026utm_campaign=2021q3_creator_single_creator_discovery_mode\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwqKuKBhCxARIsACf4XuFr8UHzczvoKpLe1KxQOhbR4XboP0bmF_TVMCYDxWVE6YLtkNLnA8YaAsC8EALw_wcB) to help deepen his connection with current fans and help introduce him to new ones. \n\nWhen asked about the source of his inspiration and what led him to create music, mehro responds matter-of-factly: “I’m a sensitive person. I felt so many things inside of me, and I had to let it out somehow.\" On social media, in [intimate conversations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpobPPKGosH4eVS1uAKkg54FpBvOw7BVr) with fans over Zoom, or even in the interview for this article, mehro’s demeanor reflects the emotive music he’s released thus far: He is gentle, as self-aware as he is self-assured, and most importantly, authentic. \n\n“The stories he’s telling in these songs are universal but very specific,” says Danny Rukasin, his manager. “The way that he’s cultivated a community around his music and his fans, [you can tell that] he really does care.” Rukasin, also co-manager to Billie Eilish and FINNEAS, partnered with mehro to help him realize his goals of taking care of himself and his family while making art that brings him both fulfillment and excitement.\n\nNo stranger to the needs of emerging artists, Rukasin and the team around mehro set out with a strategy of scaling the audience for his honest and earnest brand of music. Though fans have gotten a taste of what mehro can do with his releases thus far, Rukasin explains that it's just the tip of the iceberg and that the varied offerings to come require an atypical approach to building a fanbase. “mehro has a ton of music — and a wide breadth of diverse music, too,” he says. “So we’re putting a release plan together that isn’t leading to one big moment but continuously releasing music, so there is no endpoint and more for the newly discovered fan to listen to and\nstay excited for.” \n\nSpotify for Artists tools were key to their plan of building upon past successes and converting social media engagement into fan engagement on Spotify. mehro’s playlist, [Stay Pure](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=-dCv5CQdSdqCoDdxy2Ngww), was not only a place for him to showcase his own music, but his musical taste as well. The playlist, which fans can find on his artist profile via [Artist Pick](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/artist-pick), features tracks from his favorite artists alongside his own: “Stay Pure is one of those things where I get to champion artists whose music I love and who I respect,” he says.\n\nBeyond being an expression of his personal taste, Stay Pure was an opportunity to get fans involved and to give them a stake in one of his creations. “Stay Pure turned into a fan initiative where we had fans submitting UGC [user-generated content] creative, and eventually we made the cover one of the fan’s pieces of art,” explains mehro’s marketing manager, Ryan Lassi. “We’re trying to not only build community around mehro’s Instagram; there’s a community to be built around his Spotify.” \n\n![mehro incorporated [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music.](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/6gB76z9yYWE8aYADv5PSNY/7ce51932ecf0e5dd877f3f989ce0e13e/Blog-2.gif)\n\nFor mehro, imagery is as important as the music, and he uses Canvas to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music. “We launched with that ‘perfume’ Canvas, and there’s something just really timeless about that Canvas that we really love — it’s very mehro,” says Lassi. “We had Canvases go out for ‘hideous’ and singles as they went, but then, once we started talking about the *SKY ON FIRE* project, we were like, ‘maybe now is our opportunity to refresh these Canvases and give fans something new to consume, especially if they’re coming back to some of these tracks for the second, third, fourth time.’” \n\nDiscovery Mode was key to their plan of building mehro’s momentum and introducing him to listeners who were likely to have an affinity for his sound. Currently in an early testing phase, this new tool may help artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery.  “Spotify understands how to really hit those listeners,” says Rukasin. “[With Discovery Mode], we saw the opportunity and felt, ‘Why not take it while we’re still building and leading into new releases?’ There’s new music coming. Why not go and look at what the music is that’s going to resonate, and then kick it into overdrive to try to get audiences that are passively listening to lock in on the songs?” \n\nIn August, mehro’s team turned on Discovery Mode for “perfume” and ”chance with you” through his distributor Downtown Music Services. “We started with two songs,” explains Rukasin. “The strategy was: Start with two songs for three weeks leading into the new release moment. That will help create a wave of listeners.” The results were impressive: With music that resonated with fans and a clever strategy that kept them engaged, mehro was already reaching new listeners each month. Discovery Mode helped amplify that reach further and helped increase his monthly new listener growth four-fold, taking him past the 1 million monthly listeners threshold for the first time. In addition, through Discovery Mode, mehro increased views of his Canvas for both “perfume” and “hideous” by over 50%. These numbers prove that the music he makes resonates with fans all over the world. Discovery Mode also helped mehro reach fans in 15 new markets where he previously had a minimal audience — including Japan, Slovakia, and Hungary. “We want ears on the music because we know that all people need to do is hear it once or twice and they’ll be a fan, they’ll stay involved, they’ll become more active,” says Rukasin.\n\nWhen mehro learned that he had hit the 1 million listeners milestone, he was understandably awestruck: “I can’t even believe it. I don’t know what to say. That was a goal of mine long [ago].” He sees this all as an introduction to himself as an artist and to the varied sounds he has coming, exemplified in his latest singles: “I’m releasing two series of music simultaneously,” he says, excitement written all over his face. “The first release from it is called ‘[coastline](https://open.spotify.com/track/06J6MvuHOCOI5HerZaKKy2?si=d563c7b14bf54cdf),’ and that’s from a series called *Alchemy*. Not an album, not a project, not an EP — it’s a series,” he says of his novel strategy to introduce fans to the breadth of his music. “The second song that we’re putting out is called ‘howling,’ and that is from another series called *Dark Corners*. We’ll be going from one series to the next series to the next series, releasing one song at a time, to show what we’re capable of, what songs are possible for us, and the different sides of who I am, as an artist and as a person.” \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"7Jtp778DMnESHnykUWTOP2","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"From Concept to Canvas: Olivia Rodrigo's 'drivers license'","description":"The biggest song in the world features one of the coolest Canvases on Spotify.

We talk to Olivia Rodrigo’s creative team about making the perfect visual accompaniment for her breakup anthem.\n","article":"Right now, Olivia Rodrigo is in the driver’s seat and the whole world is along for the ride. As of this writing, the 17-year-old singer-songwriter’s single “[drivers license](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lPN2DXiMsVn7XUKtOW1CS?si=tswYSV4uScmQIq7Mv3iCzw)” has been No. 1 on the [Global Weekly Top Songs Chart](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbNG2KDcFcKOF?si=SPBWd9HuRCyqu7olCQyKGg) for three weeks in a row and has set the record for the most streams for a song in a week on Spotify. The song also sits atop Spotify’s [United States Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp?si=2e2_T-54TvC6R-LPmI3eZg) with over 2 million daily plays and is No. 1 on the [Global Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF?si=wmb9ajMES6W5V-NNrWwzgw) with over 8 million daily plays. This is all after debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and setting the record for the most streams in a day for a non-holiday song.\n\nThe single’s success is due to a number of factors: first and foremost, it’s a heartfelt, relatable, and catchy pop song about young love and loss; then there’s Rodrigo’s preexisting fanbase as a Disney starlet (she plays Nini Salazar-Roberts in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series”); add to that the song’s virality on social media; co-signs from Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish; fan theories about the story behind its lyrics; and you’ve got the recipe for the first bona fide mega-hit of 2021. \n\nWhen you listen to the track on the Spotify app you’ll notice the looping image of three  vintage-looking California driver’s licenses stacked on top of each other, each with animated images of Rodrigo looking alternately sad, strong, pensive, and happy —  this is the [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) for “drivers license.” Conceived by Rodrigo herself, the Canvas is a hit too, with over 243,000 total Instagram shares in the first week of its release (Jan. 8 to Jan.15) and more than 50 million views in the first three weeks. Ned Monahan, Spotify’s Head of Global Hits, knows that breakout successes like this one only happen once in a blue moon. “These sorts of lightning-in-a-bottle moments are rare, but the stars really aligned for ‘drivers license,’” he explains. “It’s a truly great song that’s instantly engaging, touching on universal feelings of heartbreak and suburban angst. The Canvas is a visual extension of the song’s themes, giving fans another way of contextualizing Olivia’s vision and relatable experiences — so it makes sense that it’s been well-received!”\n\nTo bring her vision for the Canvas to life, Rodrigo and Interscope/Geffen worked with art director Dina Hovsepian and designer Tim Barsten. “What we were trying to capture was a vintage-looking license, says Hovsepian, explaining her approach to the design. “I used lots of layers of scratchy filters to create the washed-out feel over her photos and to create the faded text.” (And yes, she confirms, “It’s her real b-day on the license.”) To further understand the inspiration and execution behind the Canvas, Spotify for Artists asked Barsten, who designed and animated the Canvas, about the process.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: How big of a role did Olivia play in the creative process for this Canvas? What was her input?__\n\n__Tim Barsten:__ I have to give all the creative direction credit to Olivia [Rodrigo]. The label provided the artwork and the original driver’s license design she used for her merch for the single, and Olivia provided some shots of herself for the Canvas with the note that she would like to replace the images on the driver’s license with the shots she sent. She said “Think: [Harry Potter, talking portraits](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait)” and I knew exactly what she meant. I then took all the assets into [Adobe] After Effects and designed what you see today. \n\n![Olivia Rodrigo's Harry Potter-inspired driver's licenses](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/21Xva8yuCON4ZHPCsXAoIZ/8dd530b55d5ff1b4189404f77766cacf/Rodrigo-Tile-4MB.gif)\n\n__Talk about interpreting the song and its lyrics visually for the Canvas, there are six looping images in the three licenses in the frame of the Canvas, were those images created specifically for this? What was the direction of the shoot for them and what emotions/moods were you trying to capture?__\n\nIn order to capture the concept of the song, Olivia wanted to showcase all of the different stages of a relationship that has come to an end. From heartbreak to forgiveness, to finally getting back to being happy again, she wanted all of the stages represented in the six different images on the three driver’s licenses for the Canvas of the song. \n\n__How did you think about how the Canvas and single artwork should be different or work together?__\n\nI love that this Canvas is different from the concept for the [single] artwork and music video — it acts almost as a supplemental piece of creative for the song that tells the story in a different way. Because the Canvas concept was different from the art and video but still needed to feel within the same world, I incorporated subtle elements of the music video and single art to help connect them visually. I was able to do that by overlaying some light purple flares in the background and overlaid grain to replicate the music video which was shot on film. From the artwork, I was inspired by the torn paper, grungier feel and applied vintage coloring, and added a slight degradation over the entire Canvas to make it feel a little more retro.\n\n__How long did it take for you to go from concept to Canvas? Were there many revisions?__\n\nWe started with the first concept during the second week of December [2020]. We went back and forth over the next few weeks with different concepts and versions before ultimately settling on the final version you see today. In the end, the original concept from that second week of December is the one we ended up going with! \n\n![Early alternate versions of the \"drivers license\" Canvas ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7cN31Y2xCJ71Plv1iWCywJ/b387822ee9c1ed370f732d258c13bddd/Rodrigo-Body-02-2MB.gif)\n\n__Which ideas were left on the cutting room floor?__\n\nWe had a few different concepts we were working through. On one of them, I took the original artwork and created a stagnant image in the vertical canvas format. I then separated the different layers and applied different types of grains, dust, flares, scan lines, and film mattes to the separated layers to give each layer its own individual movement. In the end, the concept you see now was the most compelling. \n\n__How does it feel to know that your work has been seen or shared by millions of fans at this point? Did you notice all the Canvas shares to Instagram Stories?__\n\nIt feels so cool to have worked on something that has reached the eyes of millions of people on both Spotify and Instagram. I’ve loved seeing it shared all over the world! \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timmhotep Aku","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"2RE4wRc7qEnxFZCVSRE2t3","contentType":"articlePage"}],"themeName":"whiteOnBlack","id":"oxbqgOYOtbh56EDVgbAoN","contentType":"relatedStoriesList"}],"indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"30R9sSwX2mwikPrD0cYxpo","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Getting Started with Showcase: A Campaign Tool to Give Your Music Its Moment on Home","description":"Showcase is our newest tool made for marketing music.

It lets you promote the releases you want, when you want, to the listeners you want to reach – right on Spotify’s Home. \n","article":"At Spotify for Artists, we’re building tools that help artists and their teams promote their music — right where streaming happens. Today, [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-marquee) gets listeners into your new releases right when they open the app and [playlist pitching](https://artists.spotify.com/playlisting) gets your unreleased music in front of Spotify editors to consider for editorial programming. \n\nBut artists and their teams want even more flexibility when it comes to surfacing the right music to the right fans at the right time — whether that’s reaching new listeners with a trending song, engaging super listeners with an anniversary album, or targeting previously active listeners with a reminder of your tour. \n\nWith a rise in the [popularity of catalog music,](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/edition/catalog) it’s also increasingly important to revitalize your body of work as a crucial aspect to building and maintaining your fanbase. From 2020 to 2022, the portion of our Global Weekly Top Songs Chart represented by catalog (18+ months) increased by 155%. Promoting new releases also remains critical, but not only during the release moment: On average, 75% of a release’s first-year streams happen after the first month.\n\nThat’s why we built [Showcase](https://artists.spotify.com/page/showcase), a new campaign tool that gives artists and their teams even more ways to get your new and catalog music in front of the right listeners, right when it counts. With Showcase, you'll be able to develop fans in ways that have never been possible before — by giving your music its moment on Home.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/aEWIa9PyQjrfFUmC4D0Sf/cf4af4200d202a794f593aa0397f1156/Asset_5_1280x720.gif)\n\n## What is Showcase and how does it work?\n\nShowcase is a sponsored recommendation that helps you share your music — whether it’s your newest release, your deepest catalog cut, or anything in between — at any time to likely listeners across Spotify. It appears as a mobile banner at the top of Spotify’s Home — the most visited place on Spotify, where millions of listeners come to decide what to listen to, resulting in billions of streams each day. Additionally, on average, people who see a Showcase are [6x more likely to stream the promoted release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZjOjrTvBEY).\n\nWhat’s more, Showcase gives artists and their teams the option to book multiple campaigns for the same release. For example, the tool allows you to spotlight a single, EP, or album with multiple campaigns to reach different goals, each targeting different markets or listener segments.\n\nBelow are a few other examples of how Showcase gives you an opportunity to develop your audience in new and meaningful ways: \n- Hyping up your fans with an old favorite to build excitement for an upcoming release\n- Putting a seasonal hit in front of new listeners during a holiday moment \n- Re-engaging listeners you haven't reached in a while with a new release\n\nNo matter what your goal is, Showcase is the tool to help build your audience at the moments that best support your music and your career.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1lX7aDdpLhS5oiTNCVQB7o/8d23b5d3fe09718954725a51bdd5ee39/Asset_2_1280x720.gif)\n\n## When is the best moment to spotlight my music? \n\nWith Showcase, you can promote your music at any time, so it’s never too late to give your release its moment on Home. Plus you can add a headline to give listeners helpful context to the music you’re promoting. Here are a few examples of headlines and how you could use them:\n\n__Releasing music soon__\n\n  Tap into the pre-release hype by promoting existing music with this headline. This can help prime your audience while letting them know to look out for your new music. \n\n__New music__\n\n  Use this headline to make a splash when you’re dropping new music.  You can also use [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/getting-started-with-marquee) alongside Showcase for a new release, or you can use either tool on its own.\n\n__Recently released__\n\n  Once the launch moment has died down, use this headline to extend your promotional cycle and keep your latest music top of mind for potential fans.\n\n__On tour__\n\n  Want to build excitement for a new tour and help drum up interest in the [tickets on your artist profile](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/making-the-most-of-the-now-playing-view-to-encourage-discovery) and Now Playing view? You can use this option to engage listeners before they see you live.\n\n__Release anniversary__\n\n  Use this headline to celebrate a milestone anniversary for one of your timeless releases and give listeners a reason to dive back in. \n\n__Getting buzz__\n\n  It’s exciting to see your music trending, and this option allows you to seize the moment and build off the momentum to bring new listeners to your music. \n\n__Seasonal vibes__\n\n  This is a great way to promote a seasonal song during a holiday or specific time of year. A spooky song, a festive favorite, or a new love song primed for Valentine’s Day — they all fall under “Seasonal vibes.”\n\nWhat’s important is that you have the freedom to choose the headline (and the moment) that matters most for your music. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/120x513Bwqxai5t3enSVxs/76c5d43b6792a7f1d15feb2146cc2c1f/Asset_4_1280x720.gif)\n\n## Who can I reach with Showcase?\n\nShowcase lets you reach listeners in over [30 markets](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/campaign-targeting-and-destinations/), helping you develop a global fanbase. By default, campaigns reach listeners who are most likely to stream your release — including those who have streamed you before and people who are new to your music. You can also choose to target specific segments of your audience based on real streaming behaviors:\n\n__Active audience__\n\nThese are valuable listeners who have intentionally streamed your music in the past 28 days from active sources like your artist profile, album and release pages, and their own library and playlists. Within the active audience there are three segments:\n\n- __Super listeners:__ Your most dedicated active listeners in the last 28 days. They’re also the most likely to keep streaming your music.\n\n- __Moderate listeners:__ Active listeners who intentionally streamed your music many times in the past 28 days, and could still develop into super listeners.\n\n- __Light listeners:__ Active listeners who intentionally streamed your music once or a couple times in the past 28 days, and could develop into moderate listeners.\n\n__Previously active audience__\n\nListeners who used to be in your active audience but haven’t intentionally streamed your music in at least 28 days. They may still stream your music from programmed sources.\n\n__Programmed audience__ \n\nListeners who only streamed your music from programmed sources like editorial playlists, Discover Weekly, Radio, Autoplay, or playlists by other listeners at least once in the last 2 years.\n\n__Potential audience__\n\nListeners who aren't currently in your total audience. Based on their listening habits, they may stream your promoted release.\n\n## How does Showcase reporting work?\nTwenty-four hours after your campaign starts, you’ll be able to access detailed reporting so you can see how your campaign drove engagement with the release you’re promoting, as well as with the rest of your catalog.\n\nWe already talked about how people who see a Showcase are six times more likely to stream the promoted release, but the effects can be seen even beyond that initial listen. Our reporting metrics measure how your campaigns are growing your audience and developing deeper fans over time. Whether your marketing goals include audience engagement, reactivation, or growth, Showcase reports measure the success of those goals by tracking how campaigns grew your amplified, reactivated, and new active listeners.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of each metric: \n\n- __Amplified listeners:__ Listeners from your active audience who intentionally streamed your promoted release for the first time after seeing your campaign.\n\n- __Reactivated listeners:__ Listeners who rejoined your active audience after intentionally streaming your promoted release.\n\n- __New active listeners:__ Listeners who joined your active audience for the first time by intentionally streaming your promoted release – including __new listeners__ who hadn’t streamed your music anywhere in the past two years.\n\nLastly, Showcase reporting can help you understand how listeners may intend to stream you in the long run by highlighting metrics live saves, playlist adds, and intent rate. Our research shows that saves and playlist adds correlate with a 2.5x increase in streaming of an artist six months later.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZjOjrTvBEY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## How do I set a campaign budget?\n\nBudgets for Showcase campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists and run until you either spend your budget or 14 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Showcase is priced on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis starting at a $0.40 CPC, we only spend your budget when people actually click on the Showcase.\n\nIn order to maximize the value of your spend, Showcase filters out people who have already intentionally streamed the promoted release in the past 21 days. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n## How do I run a Showcase campaign?\n\nTo be eligible to book a Showcase, artists must have at least 1,000 streams over the past 28 days in at least one of the available [target markets](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/campaign-targeting-and-destinations/), and the artist team’s billing country must be set to the U.S.\n\nIf you meet these requirements, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign. \n1. Log in to your Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop and head to the Campaigns tab.\n2. Locate the Showcase tab. \n3. Select an eligible release.\n4. Follow the instructions to set up your campaign, and you’re on your way!\n\nOver the next few weeks we will roll out Showcase within the [Campaigns tab](https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/campaigns/showcase) for eligible artists in the U.S., and in the coming months, we’ll continue to expand access to more artists around the world. We’re excited to share more updates so you can bring your own personalized strategy to the releases you want, when you want, and you can give your music its moment on Home, with Showcase.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/177j82KNVu5E4kdv4cA4n2/792f059ba8770b3da07c5338df577f68/Asset_3_1280x720-272kb__1_.gif)\n","modules":[{"title":"Showcase Recirculation Module ","theme":"blackOnWhite","gridSupertext":"More ways to promote your music ","items":[{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","description":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in Radio and Autoplay before the album dropped.","urlSlug":"how-magic-city-hippies-sequenced-marquee-canvas-and-discovery-mode","releaseDate":"2022-07-14T11:50-04:00","headerModule":{"title":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","headline":"How Magic City Hippies Sequenced Marquee, Canvas, and Discovery Mode to Develop Fans Ahead of Their New Album","image":{"title":"Magic City Hippies","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/4FmIoTmNRTLlNqQZHxSpTH/fb720f937cf60abaee42520ad09996a3/Blog_Header.png","details":{"size":632612,"image":{"width":1280,"height":700}},"fileName":"Blog Header.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","textColor":"#000000","id":"2Cj16pKHMvqeP8RUlrASiu","contentType":"articleHeaderModule"},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Miami band’s use of Spotify for Artists marketing tools made listeners four times more likely to stream pre-release singles and helped triple the band’s audience in [Discovery Mode contexts](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/discovery-mode-contexts/) before the album dropped.","article":"Miami’s [Magic City Hippies](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ikg4sypcURm8Vy5GP68xb) have brought their breezy alt-funk to the party since they formed in 2015, but when the pandemic changed the game, the indie trio got innovative with how they recorded their sophomore album, *[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/album/0r0l3PRmsPwylAZQM16e7a?si=gQt1zxLQTCeUTYD3KROItQ)*, and how they made sure it reached more listeners than the band ever had before.\n\nWritten and recorded in 2021 with band members Robby Hunter, Pat Howard, and John Coughlin all hunkered down in different parts of the country, the album’s title explains the 11 songs’ overarching theme of “taking care of yourself and taking care of your loved ones,” says manager Brad Desmond. “It’s something that the guys felt was missing from their lives before the pandemic.”\n\nWhen Magic City Hippies began planning *Water Your Garden*’s release, the band had nearly 650,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and it had been two years since their debut, *Modern Animal*. So when it came to developing *Garden*’s release strategy, it was all about working to reconnect with existing listeners and reaching new ones. To accomplish this, they planned to release singles over the course of the nine months in advance of the full album — building awareness so that the fanbase was ready to jump in eagerly when the album came out. \n\n\"You only get so many opportunities to release an album,” says Desmond. “I don't want to miss a single potential listener: it's a potential ticket buyer, a potential person who's going to tell 10 of their friends.\"\n\nTo meet their goal of “making it as easy as possible for [listeners] to get to” the new music, Desmond says, they utilized several Spotify for Artists tools, including [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode) in a multi-faceted long-lead approach that activated their audience pre-release, made noise when the release dropped, and kept the momentum going post-release. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/1IplhgDMzRfPLCwLBng81H/6fba941d3f94cd41f81cec9807061a05/Blog_1_new-12-6-2023.png)\n\n“Our audience is [on Spotify]. It’s how people discover us,” says Desmond. “It’s our main way of communicating with fans.... So it’s always our priority to play in the sandbox there, to use whatever marketing tools are available to us to provide the best experience possible.”\n\nWith Marquee and Canvas, they primed their listeners for the album with a series of singles beginning months ahead of the January 2022 album release. With Discovery Mode, they worked to expand their audience further, right before and after the album dropped — and just ahead of their tour. \n\n*Read on to learn exactly how they used each tool to exceed their goals.*\n\n## Marquee Engaged Listeners Pre-Album\n__*People who saw the Marquees were four times more likely to stream the singles.*__\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/676oBg3mfgAUbZdNrFej6C/ddc82582d9ae6c47f78e4d00e2c957d4/Blog_2.png)\n\n*Water Your Garden*’s first pre-release single, “[Diamond](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ghj9ln405TCxVrlEuVnGA?si=988361c03b174e64),” arrived nine months before the album, in April of 2021. Since it had been two years since their last album, the Magic City Hippies team decided to try a [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) targeting their lapsed listeners because, “It fit the release strategy by helping reach our goal of reengaging with fans,” says Iona Casta, paid media and digital marketing lead at Create Music Group, the band’s distributor. The Marquee drove 25% of their lapsed listeners to actively stream the band for the first time in more than six months. “Once we saw those results, we decided to use the tool for every release.” \n\nThroughout the rest of the year, they served up five more singles — “[Water Your Garden](https://open.spotify.com/track/0CVaDx0YP1nMwZd1eg88cX?si=b80d7601e1594d6e),” “[Queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zFXDAZ2V52022GPNYOxyH?si=6475e492b9ab4d98),” “[High Beams](https://open.spotify.com/track/28r57p0khZL2C2tpeKENXi?si=321dbcb92edc4a56),” “[Ghost on the Mend](https://open.spotify.com/track/32bZRcF2imSuRHdpodPEbQ?si=a8808a0f5ea54029),” and “[Champagne on the Rider](https://open.spotify.com/track/4u8traGW2bhMIfE8RibuKr?si=46d81537aaa5457a)” — and they used Marquee to promote all of them. They even had a cheeky inside joke about it. “Brad and I called it ‘foreplay’ for the album,” says Create Music Group project manager Anna Antoniadis. On average, 24% of people who streamed the pre-album singles after seeing the Marquee saved them to their personal libraries for future streaming.  \n\n“It’s the most effective strategy to actually increase streaming numbers because it’s in-app,” Casta continues. “It gives fans direct access to actually listen to the music, save it, and come back to it later. Even if I optimize other ads for conversions, it takes several steps for people to stream and save it.”\n\nUsing Marquee to target Magic City Hippies’ recently interested, casual, and lapsed listeners resulted in listener familiarity with over half of *Water Your Garden* before it even dropped. \n\n“Our biggest challenge,” says Desmond, “is making sure that all of our fanbase is aware of what we’re doing… and Marquee is a home run for doing that.”\n\n## Canvas Extended the Aesthetic\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3MblUuhlhDz1DX9KIrgKzf/15ad49f0db1ac3185247375ad7b22ee6/Blog_3.png)\n\nMagic City Hippies’ comprehensive use of [Canvas](http://canvas.spotify.com) — the Spotify for Artists tool for short, looping visuals — ensured that listeners who clicked the Marquee also got a taste of their creative world. The band invested in videos for every *Water Your Garden* single, and they made a Canvas for each. “Canvas allowed us to bring that visual into the Spotify platform, and to really give a deeper, more immersive listening experience to our fans,” Desmond explains. “The other thing I love about Canvas is, when it’s shared to Instagram Stories, which is something that we really look out for and encourage our fans to do… It just makes it that much more engaging for them.”\n\n“In some instances, we used a little bit of B-roll to provide a little Easter egg for fans who maybe are obsessed with the music video and are coming to Spotify to listen to the song,” Desmond continues. “On the non-single tracks, we used more B-roll from the other videos. One video, we had the director do a lot of slow-motion shots of flowers, and that was on-brand for the album title.” B-roll from another video was turned into “kind of like a psychedelic visualizer” Canvas for another song. \n\n## Discovery Mode Helped Expand Their Reach\n__*The trio more than tripled their audience in Discovery Mode contexts across more than 100 markets, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before.*__ \n\nIn December, the month before the album arrived and the tour began, the team looked to reach new listeners by turning on [Discovery Mode](http://artists.spotify.com/discovery-mode), a marketing tool that helps artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery. Discovery Mode allows distributors to select music they want to prioritize in select personalized sessions. This increases the likelihood a track reaches listeners in those contexts. \n\n“It was kind of a no-brainer in that period, to say, ‘Let’s give a shot at reaching as many people as possible’,” says Desmond. “Especially in a month like December, which is traditionally considered a down month,” seeing the band’s audience triple within Discovery Mode contexts, with 31% of those listeners never having streamed the band before, was “beyond what we expected.” \n\nThe team was surprised at first to see particular uplift for two of the songs they selected, with streams of “Ghost on the Mend” and “Diamond” doubling in Discovery Mode contexts when they turned on Discovery Mode for those tracks compared to the month prior. “Once we looked at a lot of the data, it ended up making sense,” explains Antoniadis. \n\n“I thought ‘Queen’ would've done better because it's shorter and hookier,” says Desmond. “‘Diamond’ and ‘Ghost on the Mend’ are really dynamic, and it was a surprise, but I think it was really cool. On our end, it was cool to see the impact. It's always cool to see the backend data, but specifically with Discovery Mode… it gave us some really interesting insight.” \n\nOverall, the band found Discovery Mode a powerful way to understand what people connect with, “because it’s coming up in algorithmic playlists,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, I heard this super-randomly on a radio, and I added it to my playlist, and I listen to it all the time now.’ That was an interesting, different way to see how things connect.”\n\nFor Desmond, “as an independent artist, to be able to have that kind of audience insight, it’s really incredible.”\n\n## Making Noise On Release Day and Beyond \n\nHaving expanded their audience through Discovery Mode, the band was ready to promote the album, *Water Your Garden*, with Marquee once more. To build on the momentum, they booked a Marquee campaign targeting recently interested listeners — listeners who actively streamed their music in the last 28 days.\n\nIt drove an average of 13.5 streams of the new release per listener, over three times more streams per listener than their album at large. \n\nThat, “shows how reliably it converts, and, at the end of the day, it’s conversion, conversion, conversion,” says Antoniadis. “No matter how many clicks you get on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn’t necessarily mean the user’s gonna go stream the song… As data people, I love being able to see the actual conversion into streams.” \n\nWith Marquee, the album also reached their highest intent rate yet: 30% of Marquee listeners saved a track from the album to their library or added it to a personal playlist. Plus, 20% of their Marquee listeners also streamed from their older releases like 2019’s *[Modern Animal](https://open.spotify.com/album/6y5roSQsSbhNcVfIkhF7wL?si=sCjy4GBqSx2X7K47ecANYw)*. \n\nBecause “fans are still connecting with it,” months after the album’s release day, Desmond says the team will return to Discovery Mode for *Garden* tracks that weren’t previously turned on.\n\n“One of my goals in general—and especially with an album rollout—is extending the release period the day after the release,” adds Antoniadis. “It doesn’t end there for anyone, and you can continue pushing it in different ways.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Listeners who see a Marquee are over two times on average more likely to save a track from the promoted release for future streaming. And, Marquee is not just about the new release: Listeners who engage with a Marquee are three times more likely on average to stream from older releases.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at six ways artists have been using Marquee to achieve the most common new release goals: maximizing engagement overall (__campaign engagement strategies__), and driving engagement from specific parts of your audience (__fan development strategies__). Plus, learn how to measure success for each goal.\n\n## Campaign Engagement Strategies\n\n### 1. Albums \u0026 EPs — Let’s Get Loud\nMake a huge splash right when your new music drops by starting your Marquee on release day. Since Marquees go live at midnight on the campaign start date, you can reach people who are most likely to listen in a big way.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience\n- __Start date__: Release day \n- __Case study__: [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV)’s team turned to Marquee to maximize engagement for their latest album, *Blue Weekend*, by starting their campaign on release day, generating two times more streams per listener than benchmarks. [*Read more here*](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wolf-alice-marquee-campaign-2x-streams-per-listener).\n\n### 2. Amp up Pre-Release Singles\nUse Marquee to promote a series of singles ahead of your album. Targeting recently interested listeners — people who listened to your music in the last 28 days — around release will help you build momentum before your album drops.\n\n- __Targeting__: Recently interested listeners \n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day \n- __Case study__: [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz) built on the momentum of his 2019 viral hit “Lalala” by using Marquee to promote three singles in the lead up to 2021 album *Eat Ya Veggies*, increasing his active streams by 40 percentage points before the new release dropped. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album)*.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Your International Rollout Strategy\nYou can take your new release global by using your Spotify for Artists audience data to determine your top markets, and then targeting the right listeners from among the dozen-plus markets where Marquee is live. Staggering your campaign start dates will help maintain momentum and capture another wave of listeners who didn’t see it release week.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Multiple countries \n- __Start date__: Staggered across markets \n- __Case study__: Spotify RADAR artist [girl in red](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9) ran a staggered multi-market Marquee campaign that helped her release maintain momentum across continents. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-girl-in-red-used-marquee-for-her-debut-albums-international-rollout)*.\n\n## Fan Development Strategies \nWhich listeners do you want to turn into bigger fans? Marquee targets people based on listening history and only reaches listeners who have not already [actively](https://found.byspotify.com/made-by-you) streamed the release. \n\n### 4. Re-engage Lapsed Listeners\nPerfect for the times when you haven’t released new music in a while or want to encourage intentional, active streaming.  \n\n- __Targeting__: Lapsed listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to two days after release day\n- __Case study__: When the pandemic disrupted promotion plans for [Lecrae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CFCsEqKrCyvAFKOATQHiW)’s first album in two years, he and his team turned to Marquee to reactivate lapsed listeners, driving 35% re-engagement and 80,000 saves and playlist adds. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lecrae-used-marquee-to-bring-lapsed-listeners-back-into-his-music)*.\n\n### 5. Turn Casual Listeners Into Fans\nIf your goal is to use Marquee to deepen relationships with listeners, target people who already listen but have potential to stream more. \n\n- __Targeting__: Casual listeners\n- __Start date__: Up to four days after release day\n- __Case study__: After [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY)'s 2015 tune “Space Song” unexpectedly went viral last year, they had a newly expanded audience that they engaged with Marquee, driving 24% of casual listeners to save a track from their album and 20% to stream from their catalog. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-beach-house-used-a-viral-hit-to-drive-momentum-for-their-new-release)*.\n\n### 6. Activate Listeners Post-Release\nSince Marquee’s targeting excludes listeners who have already actively streamed your new music, start a Marquee up to 20 days later to reach listeners who likely want to hear you but who may have missed your release date rollout. \n\n- __Targeting__: Your reachable audience \n- __Start date__: 1 to 2 weeks post-release day\n- __Case study__: Read how [Kaskade](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TQj5BFPooTa08A7pk8AQ1) used Marquee to promote the single “[Miles to Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=4d2d0113a56048c8)” a week after the track’s release to make more listeners aware, resulting in more than 20% of Kaskade or [Ella Vos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zmrsXMHxagFz6vI2cD7r6) fans saving the track. *[Read more here](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-kaskade-used-marquee-to-connect-longtime-listeners-to-his-single-miles)*. \n\n## Measuring Success  \n\n### 1. Identify the metrics that matter most for hitting your goal.\nSuccess looks a little different depending on your overall goals. For the campaign engagement strategies (1, 2, and 3 above), look at your streams per listener, plus your  listener conversion rate — the percentage of people who saw your Marquee and listened to the promoted release.\nFor the fan development strategies (4, 5, and 6 above), look at the intent rate — the percentage of your listeners who saved a track from the promoted release or added it to a playlist — plus how listeners engaged with your other releases. \n\n### 2. Check in on your results as they update and 14 days after the campaign ends.\nAfter each Marquee, you’ll receive reporting on how the people who saw your campaign responded to your music.  You’ll start to see metrics about 24 hours after your campaign starts, and until 14 days after your campaign ends — this is when all metrics are finalized. \n\n### 3. Measure the metrics that matter.\nBenchmarking can help you understand how your Marquee performed. To benchmark against previous Marquees, visit your Spotify for Artists dashboard, click on the Campaigns tab, then choose “Download Results.” \nYour Spotify for Artists dashboard is also the place where you can compare how your Marquee audience engaged with your release versus your total audience. From your dashboard, visit the [__Release Details Page__](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics) by going to the Music tab, clicking on Releases, and then clicking on your new release. \n\n__To learn more about using Marquee, including how to get started, [visit the Marquee site here](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee).__\n","languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"5vh2SL8jxbveY9duEMlWXO","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Inside the Julia Wolf World: Building Momentum for a New EP, 'Girls in Purgatory'","description":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","urlSlug":"julia-wolf-video-how-they-made-it-new-ep-girls-in-purgatory","releaseDate":"2021-12-09T13:30-05:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"69yN2bTiEN6usxlihhWk2l"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"In the latest episode of our “How They Made It” series, singer-songwriter Julia Wolf and her team discuss how they used Canvas, Marquee, and more on her single, “Falling in Love,” to build an audience ahead of her new EP release.","article":"[Julia Wolf](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5yvGiZLSWJTPBlZpVbPnEZ?si=h-FgU-_dQuOapDngCAOXSw) is “making music for the girls that are too afraid to speak their minds,” drawing from her own experiences as a shy kid in a big Italian family, struggling to fit in and finding her escape – finding herself – through music. \n\nNow with more than 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, the independent artist uses her own experiences to fuel her music, connecting with fans in a way that’s unique, radically authentic, and 100% her. \n\nBut it was a journey to get there. “Pursuing music as a career had a lot of trial and error involved, a lot of dead ends,” explains Wolf in the new episode of our [How They Made It series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it). “It certainly wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand.

It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Using Canvas: Top Tips On How to Engage and Attract Fans With Short, Looping Visuals","description":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","urlSlug":"using-canvas-top-tips-on-how-to-engage-attract-fans-short-looping-visuals","releaseDate":"2022-04-20T09:55-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"7yCTvLVdh9Pe7nFWNkX7vR"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"Watch artists and experts share insights on using Canvas – short, looping visuals that immerse listeners in your track – in this episode of the Game Plan.","article":"Music and art have always been a perfect pairing, and every artist knows their visual identity is an incredibly important way to attract and connect with fans. [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), a free tool from Spotify for Artists, is album artwork for the streaming age. It allows you, the artist, to upload three-to-eight-second looping visuals for each of your tracks as a proven way to draw in fans and keep them engaged. The data speaks for itself: Listeners are 20% more likely to add a track to their playlists if they see the Canvas.\n\nWhile uploading a Canvas is simple enough, creating the right Canvas for your audience is both an art and a science. In [this episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan), we tapped artists and experts to help you make your Canvas strategy perfect and give you insights into how others have made the most of the tool.\n\n*Here are three of their top tips for using Canvas:*\n\n### 1. Keep It Clean\nChoose footage without talking, singing, or rapping, and avoiding any intense flashing graphics. Also avoid text or typography.\n\n### 2. Choose a Striking Style \nA “continuous loop” is seamless, a ”hard cut” has clear edit points, and a ”rebound” is an edit that plays your clip forward and then reverses it.\n\n### 3. Share to Social\nWhenever you or your fans share your track from Spotify to Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, your Canvas will loop in the background.\n\n[See More: 10 Tips to Get the Most From Your Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-the-most-from-your-canvas)\n\nSouth Korean synth pop artist [Su Lee](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3deduluMry0ZIGWF673gfK) says that for “artists like myself who are doing everything on their own,” key is the ability “to change and switch Canvases whenever (you) want.”\n\nElectronic artist [San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jNDKefhfSbLR9sFvcPLHo), who works closely with creative director Thorwald, also sees a lot of value in complementing music with visuals via Canvas. “The artwork for us is a piece of the story,” the Netherlands-based musician says. “And, the Canvases allow us to just tell a bit more.”\n\n__Watch the [full episode](https://youtu.be/kL62WKmrZOs) of [the Game Plan](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/the-game-plan) below, and [click here to get started with Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL62WKmrZOs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"53LhxX2Bolr8NiEcXZcuT","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"video","articleLink":{"title":"How Spotify's Marquee Works","description":"Marquee is a marketing tool for promoting your new release — and turning listeners into big fans.

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

The 21-year-old rising star’s wistful first single, “[perfume](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kvkYrjZh561EJwERr8EsK?si=3ae2a5dcf6204c25),” with its melancholy acoustic guitar licks and love-struck lyrics, was released in February 2020 and has since become a bona fide indie hit with over 10 million streams on Spotify. After dropping “perfume,” mehro released three singles and two remixes to set the stage for his debut project, *[SKY ON FIRE](https://open.spotify.com/album/78pXYuIlTIUBQhtQTH8gTP?si=1OqFrfzNR6a9zhwrg12vgg\u0026dl_branch=1)*, which was released in March 2021.

I felt so many things inside of me, and I had to let it out somehow.\" On social media, in [intimate conversations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpobPPKGosH4eVS1uAKkg54FpBvOw7BVr) with fans over Zoom, or even in the interview for this article, mehro’s demeanor reflects the emotive music he’s released thus far: He is gentle, as self-aware as he is self-assured, and most importantly, authentic. \n\n“The stories he’s telling in these songs are universal but very specific,” says Danny Rukasin, his manager. “The way that he’s cultivated a community around his music and his fans, [you can tell that] he really does care.” Rukasin, also co-manager to Billie Eilish and FINNEAS, partnered with mehro to help him realize his goals of taking care of himself and his family while making art that brings him both fulfillment and excitement.\n\nNo stranger to the needs of emerging artists, Rukasin and the team around mehro set out with a strategy of scaling the audience for his honest and earnest brand of music. Though fans have gotten a taste of what mehro can do with his releases thus far, Rukasin explains that it's just the tip of the iceberg and that the varied offerings to come require an atypical approach to building a fanbase. “mehro has a ton of music — and a wide breadth of diverse music, too,” he says. “So we’re putting a release plan together that isn’t leading to one big moment but continuously releasing music, so there is no endpoint and more for the newly discovered fan to listen to and\nstay excited for.” \n\nSpotify for Artists tools were key to their plan of building upon past successes and converting social media engagement into fan engagement on Spotify. mehro’s playlist, [Stay Pure](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6f8ZAq5HlKObVLrcmLulfS?si=-dCv5CQdSdqCoDdxy2Ngww), was not only a place for him to showcase his own music, but his musical taste as well. The playlist, which fans can find on his artist profile via [Artist Pick](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/artist-pick), features tracks from his favorite artists alongside his own: “Stay Pure is one of those things where I get to champion artists whose music I love and who I respect,” he says.\n\nBeyond being an expression of his personal taste, Stay Pure was an opportunity to get fans involved and to give them a stake in one of his creations. “Stay Pure turned into a fan initiative where we had fans submitting UGC [user-generated content] creative, and eventually we made the cover one of the fan’s pieces of art,” explains mehro’s marketing manager, Ryan Lassi. “We’re trying to not only build community around mehro’s Instagram; there’s a community to be built around his Spotify.” \n\n![mehro incorporated [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music.](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/6gB76z9yYWE8aYADv5PSNY/7ce51932ecf0e5dd877f3f989ce0e13e/Blog-2.gif)\n\nFor mehro, imagery is as important as the music, and he uses Canvas to aid in the visual storytelling that accompanies his music. “We launched with that ‘perfume’ Canvas, and there’s something just really timeless about that Canvas that we really love — it’s very mehro,” says Lassi. “We had Canvases go out for ‘hideous’ and singles as they went, but then, once we started talking about the *SKY ON FIRE* project, we were like, ‘maybe now is our opportunity to refresh these Canvases and give fans something new to consume, especially if they’re coming back to some of these tracks for the second, third, fourth time.’” \n\nDiscovery Mode was key to their plan of building mehro’s momentum and introducing him to listeners who were likely to have an affinity for his sound. Currently in an early testing phase, this new tool may help artists expand the reach of their music when audiences are most open to discovery.  “Spotify understands how to really hit those listeners,” says Rukasin. “[With Discovery Mode], we saw the opportunity and felt, ‘Why not take it while we’re still building and leading into new releases?’ There’s new music coming. Why not go and look at what the music is that’s going to resonate, and then kick it into overdrive to try to get audiences that are passively listening to lock in on the songs?” \n\nIn August, mehro’s team turned on Discovery Mode for “perfume” and ”chance with you” through his distributor Downtown Music Services. “We started with two songs,” explains Rukasin. “The strategy was: Start with two songs for three weeks leading into the new release moment. That will help create a wave of listeners.” The results were impressive: With music that resonated with fans and a clever strategy that kept them engaged, mehro was already reaching new listeners each month. Discovery Mode helped amplify that reach further and helped increase his monthly new listener growth four-fold, taking him past the 1 million monthly listeners threshold for the first time. In addition, through Discovery Mode, mehro increased views of his Canvas for both “perfume” and “hideous” by over 50%. These numbers prove that the music he makes resonates with fans all over the world. Discovery Mode also helped mehro reach fans in 15 new markets where he previously had a minimal audience — including Japan, Slovakia, and Hungary. “We want ears on the music because we know that all people need to do is hear it once or twice and they’ll be a fan, they’ll stay involved, they’ll become more active,” says Rukasin.\n\nWhen mehro learned that he had hit the 1 million listeners milestone, he was understandably awestruck: “I can’t even believe it. I don’t know what to say. That was a goal of mine long [ago].” He sees this all as an introduction to himself as an artist and to the varied sounds he has coming, exemplified in his latest singles: “I’m releasing two series of music simultaneously,” he says, excitement written all over his face. “The first release from it is called ‘[coastline](https://open.spotify.com/track/06J6MvuHOCOI5HerZaKKy2?si=d563c7b14bf54cdf),’ and that’s from a series called *Alchemy*. Not an album, not a project, not an EP — it’s a series,” he says of his novel strategy to introduce fans to the breadth of his music. “The second song that we’re putting out is called ‘howling,’ and that is from another series called *Dark Corners*. We’ll be going from one series to the next series to the next series, releasing one song at a time, to show what we’re capable of, what songs are possible for us, and the different sides of who I am, as an artist and as a person.” \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timothy \"timmhotep\" Cornwall","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,cs-CZ,de-DE,el-GR,en-US,es-419,es-ES,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,nl-NL,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN,zh-Hant-TW","id":"7Jtp778DMnESHnykUWTOP2","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"From Concept to Canvas: Olivia Rodrigo's 'drivers license'","description":"The biggest song in the world features one of the coolest Canvases on Spotify.

We talk to Olivia Rodrigo’s creative team about making the perfect visual accompaniment for her breakup anthem.\n","article":"Right now, Olivia Rodrigo is in the driver’s seat and the whole world is along for the ride. As of this writing, the 17-year-old singer-songwriter’s single “[drivers license](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lPN2DXiMsVn7XUKtOW1CS?si=tswYSV4uScmQIq7Mv3iCzw)” has been No. 1 on the [Global Weekly Top Songs Chart](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbNG2KDcFcKOF?si=SPBWd9HuRCyqu7olCQyKGg) for three weeks in a row and has set the record for the most streams for a song in a week on Spotify. The song also sits atop Spotify’s [United States Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp?si=2e2_T-54TvC6R-LPmI3eZg) with over 2 million daily plays and is No. 1 on the [Global Top 50](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF?si=wmb9ajMES6W5V-NNrWwzgw) with over 8 million daily plays. This is all after debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and setting the record for the most streams in a day for a non-holiday song.\n\nThe single’s success is due to a number of factors: first and foremost, it’s a heartfelt, relatable, and catchy pop song about young love and loss; then there’s Rodrigo’s preexisting fanbase as a Disney starlet (she plays Nini Salazar-Roberts in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series”); add to that the song’s virality on social media; co-signs from Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish; fan theories about the story behind its lyrics; and you’ve got the recipe for the first bona fide mega-hit of 2021. \n\nWhen you listen to the track on the Spotify app you’ll notice the looping image of three  vintage-looking California driver’s licenses stacked on top of each other, each with animated images of Rodrigo looking alternately sad, strong, pensive, and happy —  this is the [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/en-US) for “drivers license.” Conceived by Rodrigo herself, the Canvas is a hit too, with over 243,000 total Instagram shares in the first week of its release (Jan. 8 to Jan.15) and more than 50 million views in the first three weeks. Ned Monahan, Spotify’s Head of Global Hits, knows that breakout successes like this one only happen once in a blue moon. “These sorts of lightning-in-a-bottle moments are rare, but the stars really aligned for ‘drivers license,’” he explains. “It’s a truly great song that’s instantly engaging, touching on universal feelings of heartbreak and suburban angst. The Canvas is a visual extension of the song’s themes, giving fans another way of contextualizing Olivia’s vision and relatable experiences — so it makes sense that it’s been well-received!”\n\nTo bring her vision for the Canvas to life, Rodrigo and Interscope/Geffen worked with art director Dina Hovsepian and designer Tim Barsten. “What we were trying to capture was a vintage-looking license, says Hovsepian, explaining her approach to the design. “I used lots of layers of scratchy filters to create the washed-out feel over her photos and to create the faded text.” (And yes, she confirms, “It’s her real b-day on the license.”) To further understand the inspiration and execution behind the Canvas, Spotify for Artists asked Barsten, who designed and animated the Canvas, about the process.\n\n__Spotify for Artists: How big of a role did Olivia play in the creative process for this Canvas? What was her input?__\n\n__Tim Barsten:__ I have to give all the creative direction credit to Olivia [Rodrigo]. The label provided the artwork and the original driver’s license design she used for her merch for the single, and Olivia provided some shots of herself for the Canvas with the note that she would like to replace the images on the driver’s license with the shots she sent. She said “Think: [Harry Potter, talking portraits](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait)” and I knew exactly what she meant. I then took all the assets into [Adobe] After Effects and designed what you see today. \n\n![Olivia Rodrigo's Harry Potter-inspired driver's licenses](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/21Xva8yuCON4ZHPCsXAoIZ/8dd530b55d5ff1b4189404f77766cacf/Rodrigo-Tile-4MB.gif)\n\n__Talk about interpreting the song and its lyrics visually for the Canvas, there are six looping images in the three licenses in the frame of the Canvas, were those images created specifically for this? What was the direction of the shoot for them and what emotions/moods were you trying to capture?__\n\nIn order to capture the concept of the song, Olivia wanted to showcase all of the different stages of a relationship that has come to an end. From heartbreak to forgiveness, to finally getting back to being happy again, she wanted all of the stages represented in the six different images on the three driver’s licenses for the Canvas of the song. \n\n__How did you think about how the Canvas and single artwork should be different or work together?__\n\nI love that this Canvas is different from the concept for the [single] artwork and music video — it acts almost as a supplemental piece of creative for the song that tells the story in a different way. Because the Canvas concept was different from the art and video but still needed to feel within the same world, I incorporated subtle elements of the music video and single art to help connect them visually. I was able to do that by overlaying some light purple flares in the background and overlaid grain to replicate the music video which was shot on film. From the artwork, I was inspired by the torn paper, grungier feel and applied vintage coloring, and added a slight degradation over the entire Canvas to make it feel a little more retro.\n\n__How long did it take for you to go from concept to Canvas? Were there many revisions?__\n\nWe started with the first concept during the second week of December [2020]. We went back and forth over the next few weeks with different concepts and versions before ultimately settling on the final version you see today. In the end, the original concept from that second week of December is the one we ended up going with! \n\n![Early alternate versions of the \"drivers license\" Canvas ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/7cN31Y2xCJ71Plv1iWCywJ/b387822ee9c1ed370f732d258c13bddd/Rodrigo-Body-02-2MB.gif)\n\n__Which ideas were left on the cutting room floor?__\n\nWe had a few different concepts we were working through. On one of them, I took the original artwork and created a stagnant image in the vertical canvas format. I then separated the different layers and applied different types of grains, dust, flares, scan lines, and film mattes to the separated layers to give each layer its own individual movement. In the end, the concept you see now was the most compelling. \n\n__How does it feel to know that your work has been seen or shared by millions of fans at this point? Did you notice all the Canvas shares to Instagram Stories?__\n\nIt feels so cool to have worked on something that has reached the eyes of millions of people on both Spotify and Instagram. I’ve loved seeing it shared all over the world! \n","indexed":true,"author":"Timmhotep Aku","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"2RE4wRc7qEnxFZCVSRE2t3","contentType":"articlePage"}],"themeName":"whiteOnBlack","id":"oxbqgOYOtbh56EDVgbAoN","contentType":"relatedStoriesList"}],"indexed":true,"initialDropcap":false,"languages":"ar,zh-Hant-TW,cs-CZ,nl-NL,en-US,fi-FI,fr-CA,fr-FR,de-DE,el-GR,he-IL,hu-HU,id-ID,it-IT,ja-JP,ko-KR,ms-MY,pl-PL,pt-BR,ru-RU,es-419,es-ES,sv-SE,th-TH,tr-TR,vi-VN","id":"30R9sSwX2mwikPrD0cYxpo","contentType":"articlePage"}],"heroSupertext":"Video ","articleLink":{"title":"How thuy’s Team Used Discovery Mode and Marquee to Grow Her Audience on Spotify","description":"See how independent artist thuy’s team (manager Anh Vu and Venice Music’s Isobel Kelly) used Discovery Mode and Marquee over the course of 15 months and multiple releases to grow her audience.","urlSlug":"thuy-how-to-grow-audience-spotify-discovery-mode-marquee-case-study","video":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1tiUUkQeuGcy2DQrvqlw1y"}},"thumbnailImage":{"title":"thuy Case Study ","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/3gv10eD6iHa33qGiMvQ0vO/0785e45967f6d4c81b85fd5a37266707/Screenshot_2023-08-09_at_12.01.15_PM.png","details":{"size":5581114,"image":{"width":2874,"height":1598}},"fileName":"Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 12.01.15 PM.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"4m2ShhW4ip0ReJp8047IAz"}}],"indexed":true,"translated":false,"id":"12WpTV4asUTaB0ftCylaWg","contentType":"videoPage"},"background":"#151E17","color":"#EFE3CC","id":"2xLdBPaKqq9YXdbtUw2fBt","contentType":"featuredContentModule"}],"indexed":true,"languages":"en-US","id":"9a07f2zVZd0ue26WEL860","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"Getting Started with Marquee","description":"These in-app recommendations are the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new release on Spotify.

Learn how the tool works, why it works, and how you can book your own campaigns.","article":"Dropping new music is all about making the right listeners aware of your latest release at the right time. Artists and their teams use everything from billboards and digital banners to ads on social media in the hopes of turning the folks who see those ads into listeners and, ultimately, fans. But ad campaigns like these can be imprecise in their targeting, inconsistent in their results, and unclear when it comes to their impact on listening. Sure, buying an ad on a social media platform can increase your music’s visibility, but with every step a potential listener has to take to get from that platform to Spotify comes the risk of losing them to the process. \n\nArtists and their teams wanted new and better ways to engage and develop audiences for their new releases on Spotify, so we developed [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to be a powerful promotional tool that serves both the artist and the listener. Marquee, unlike other paid marketing tools, allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. \n\nGot questions about Marquee? We’ve got answers for you. \n\n### What exactly is Marquee? How does it work?\n\nIf you’re a Spotify user, you’ve probably seen a notification recommending new music appear when you open the mobile app — that’s Marquee. This campaign tool grabs listeners’ attention and guides them from the app’s Home screen, directly to your new album, EP, or single. To be specific, Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of your new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners. Campaigns booked and managed in Spotify for Artists reach listeners who are most likely to stream your promoted release after seeing your Marquee — including both new and existing listeners. Marquee raises awareness about your new release and deepens your connection with an audience who is primed to become more highly engaged listeners and big fans. \n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/59b3AIMAxxMYYqoe8gyd8g/8dc4f9a160cacce33d822883cefd744c/S4A_Marquee_Jaywheeler_Blog_01.gif)\n\n### Why should I use Marquee (and not some other digital marketing tool)?\n\nMarquee is the best way to get the right listeners to focus on your new music on Spotify, because it reaches them at the right time. \n\nWith Marquee, you can target listeners based on the way they engage with your music. If you have the audience to support it, you can also target [audience segments](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists). For example, use Marquee to target your Spotify for Artists [active audience](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/?ref=related) (including light listeners, moderate listeners, and super listeners) or your previously active audience. Plus, when you book and manage campaigns in Spotify for Artists, you can target your programmed or potential audience. \n\nAnd, speaking of the right time, unlike other digital music marketing tools where you reach people when browsing websites or social media feeds, Marquee allows you to promote your music to Free and Premium Spotify listeners the moment they open the app while they’re choosing what to stream. It’s minimally intrusive, helpful to the interested listener, and virtually frictionless. \n\n### How do the budgets work?\n\nBudgets for Marquee campaigns start at $100 when booked via Spotify for Artists, and campaigns run until you spend your budget or 10 days after your campaign starts, whichever comes first. Since Marquee is priced on a cost-per-click basis, we spend your budget only when people actually click on the Marquee. \n\nAlso, to maximize the value of your spend, Marquee filters out people who have already intentionally streamed from the new release. During the campaign, you’ll only reach people who haven’t actively listened yet. \n\n### When is the best time to start a Marquee campaign?\n\nMarquees can start at any time within the first three weeks of your release. Choose a start date that best aligns with your campaign goals. If you want the greatest and quickest impact, start the campaign on release day and coordinate your promotional efforts. You will likely see higher engagement (e.g., conversion rate, streams per listener). If you want a delayed boost, start your campaign after release day. Since we remove people who’ve already actively streamed the release from your campaign targeting, you’ll only reach people who haven’t listened yet.\n\n### What results can I expect?\n\nAfter your Marquee ends, Spotify will report to you how people who saw the campaign engaged with your promoted release, including listens, saves, or playlist adds. Marquee can inspire longer-term engagement: Listeners who see a Marquee are more than 2x as likely to save a track or add it to their personal playlists for future listening than if they hadn’t seen the Marquee. And, their engagement isn’t limited to the new release — Marquee builds a halo effect for your entire body of work. People who see a Marquee and stream the promoted release are 3x more likely to stream the artist’s other releases. As you're evaluating results, remember that Marquee helps you reach the right listeners and make them even more engaged. That means you’ll drive depth of results versus breadth.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/6S2Q8wIRgftPfDwDTMe38B/75fabda55ec3c60f5e5810e017f0ca28/Reporting_guide.gif)\n\n### OK, I’m sold. How do I run a Marquee campaign? \n\nIf you’re an artist, manager, or label based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase, you will now see the Campaigns tab in your [Spotify for Artists dashboard](https://artists.spotify.com/c/) on desktop, where you can use Marquee to promote eligible new releases. To create Marquee campaigns in Spotify for Artists, artists must meet the [eligibility requirements](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/). If your team is based in a market where Marquee is available to purchase but you don't see the Campaigns tab, ensure your billing country matches your market.\n\nIf you’ve ticked these requirements off, ask an admin on your team to follow these easy steps to book your campaign up to 18 days after your release date.  \n\n1. Log in to artists.spotify.com on desktop.\n2. Click the three dots in the top left.\n3. Select “Your teams”, then the team you want to set a billing country for (if you’re on multiple teams).\n4. Go to “Billing.”\n5. Under “Billing information,” add an email, billing country, and payment card based in one of the markets where Marquee is [available](https://support.spotify.com/artists/article/getting-started-with-campaign-tools/) to purchase.\n6. If you have an eligible release, within 24 hours you'll start to see a new “Campaigns” tab where you can create a Marquee directly from your Spotify for Artists dashboard. If you don't have an eligible release, you won't get fast access to the \"Campaigns\" tab; we’ll add you over the coming months.\n\nCampaigns can target audiences in three dozen markets, including Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. See the complete Marquee targeting list [here](https://artists.spotify.com/help/article/marquee-targeting?category=promos-and-playlists).

Just ask Jon Strickland, VP of Sales at Sub Pop Records, and the team behind critically acclaimed indie band [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY?si=AACb4CtNRA2vknrrLdWkaA). After a surprise viral moment for the band’s 2015 “[Space Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H0ya83CMmgFcOhw0UB6ow?si=d734f560ee6b452b),” Strickland had a unique opportunity to build momentum for the band’s eighth studio album, [*Once Twice Melody*](https://open.spotify.com/album/79NySyjxJ8xric31mXKMAo?si=70539315247e4418). \n\nIn spring 2021, “Space Song” gained traction on social media as a way to show dramatic irony – emphasis on the dramatic. (“I believe the first [video featured] somebody who was crying,” says Strickland. “They spilled their milk while they were pouring cereal or something, and then they had this outsized reaction.”) The newfound audience who sought out Beach House after hearing “Space Song” had an appetite for the band’s surrealist sound. “It was an astonishing thing, and obviously it was a lot of new fans,” says Strickland. “A lot of younger fans… People heard the music and liked it, and wanted to know more about the band.” \n\nWhen it was time to roll out the band’s latest album, *Once Twice Melody*, Strickland wanted to tap into that viral momentum to develop deeper fans of Beach House’s music – starting with their new release. The band chose a waterfall strategy for the new 18-track album, breaking it into four chapters rolled out over four months. The first chapter set the cinematic tone, much like the first scene of a film. “Artists like Beach House and [fellow Sub Pop artist] [Father John Misty](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT?si=7tKqwkAfR6aLCt0EDJXYuA)… they think in albums,” explains Strickland. Rolling it out in chapters “was a thematic thing that Beach House was attracted to.” \n\nWith so many new tracks and an audience that was \"three times as big\" as their last record, Strickland said the Beach House team needed a way to focus on specific audiences and encourage them to listen beyond the one song. When Beach House started rolling out the new album, Strickland used [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) on the first two chapters (8 tracks total) to drive active, intentional streams from listeners with the potential to become bigger fans.\n\n![](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/2FrlBj6mV0Nb2DctB6dab6/5d60ff903c3d5a46509812b8aa99b8eb/beach-house-marquee-in-line-image.png)\n\nThey ran campaigns to reach two core audiences: 1) lapsed listeners who hadn’t actively streamed Beach House in the last six months, and 2) casual listeners who had actively streamed their music in the last six months, but less than other listeners. With both audiences, they had the potential to reach some of the listeners who had streamed the band following the success of “Space Song,” which had gone viral more than six months earlier. “A lot of [the strategy for Marquee] was connecting that one-song audience with the wider catalog and the new music,” explains Strickland. \n\nBeach House reactivated lapsed listeners with their new and old music in the U.S., and each lapsed listener who engaged with the Marquee averaged eight streams from the new release. 20% of the Marquee listeners also streamed from older releases, with an average of nine streams per listener.\n\nIn Canada, they targeted casual listeners, resulting in a 24% intent rate for the new release – meaning nearly one in four Marquee listeners saved or added a track to a personal playlist – and seven streams per listener on the band’s older releases.\n\n“It’s just the easiest way,” says Strickland of reaching listeners with Marquee. “Someone gets a ping on their phone – ‘oh, it’s the new [Beach House].’ It’s so easy for them to act on that and discover the new music. I can’t think of an equivalent of it, really. Then, to have that halo effect [on the artists’ catalogs] – which is really just an added bonus that we’re seeing with these campaigns – is just fantastic.”\n\nFollowing the success of the Beach House Marquee campaign, Strickland and the team at Sub Pop have decided to double down for their next artist’s new release – increasing their budgets as much as 500%. “For Father John Misty, we’ve allocated a much bigger Marquee budget,” says Strickland. “Our first Marquee is planned around a radio single coming at the beginning of March, ‘[Goodbye Mr. Blue](https://open.spotify.com/track/6b97su2rHlDZm0aiyGQCaw?si=be3de211e8854cfe),’ and we’ll Marquee that. And we’ll probably Marquee the subsequent singles, up until the album. We’ve got, by far and away, the biggest budget that Sub Pop has allocated for Marquee on the basis of what we’ve seen with Beach House.”\n\nThe halo effect – where listeners who engage with a Marquee are 3x more likely to stream from your older releases – is of particular importance to Sub Pop. “We take a lot of pride in our catalog, and when we have a new record by Beach House or Father John Misty, we want to get new fans for those bands, and we want to connect them with those classic albums,” says Strickland. “That’s really what Sub Pop is about – trying to build the audience for these artists.” \n\n*Once Twice Melody* is Beach House’s first No. 1 album on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, and has also gone on to reach No. 1 on their U.S. Top Rock and Alternative Albums chart.\n\n### Get Started with Marquee\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee, which is [now available](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-to-turn-listeners-into-fans-with-marquee-now-available-game-plan) to all eligible artists on U.S., Australian, and U.K. teams.

So when it came time for the release of now-buzzy newcomer [Jelani Aryeh’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7A47sEe0ih6WpKmNCRMu86?si=kOCSYEYYTAukWfOKNRq5SA) debut album, *[I’ve Got Some Living To Do](https://open.spotify.com/album/73ct5rK9qShCYdzBR8C8PX?si=SKyF_8urTdeQVd5P0kRJJw)*, his team knew their plan would have to be just as creative as their artist. “He’s really a vibe,” says Daniella Risi, associate director of marketing at IMPERIAL Music. “A lot of the music happening right now is a viral moment [on social media], and there could be less artistry behind the music. The follow-up singles sometimes aren’t as successful because it was [just a viral] moment. Jelani’s the exact opposite, and we think the music really reflects that.”\n\nThe debut got off to a good start: Despite kicking off the album campaign at the height of the pandemic, a fan-fueled and pandemic-friendly [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfax9iO6j9I) for single “[Stella Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/6n6dqOk5vLiqYaa9Fw5ylH?si=0231a756c726489c)” instantly engaged fans and surged in popularity. But the team also wanted the album to stand on its own, particularly with the highly engaged Spotify audience. “We wanted it to be more of an album, not just a series of singles. This album was a cohesive body of work, so whether it’s ‘[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)’ or ‘[From These Heights](https://open.spotify.com/track/74IoFNuC2nDDFkrt4MAgpS?si=d7610608fb824fd7),’ it was important to make an album that was really signature to him.”\n\nAs Jelani and his team prepared for debut day, they needed a way to build his brand by attracting listeners into his creative world. “For this album cycle, we really wanted him to connect with fans in new ways. We really wanted to build out his personality,” says Risi, explaining that [Marquee](https://artists.spotify.com/marquee) – a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release – helped them achieve their goal of developing deeper, more engaged listeners who would connect not only with his music, but with him as an artist. “We wanted to make sure that people not only knew who he was, [but we also wanted to capture] engaged listeners that actually went back and repeat-listened.”\n\nThe most attractive aspect of Marquee was the laser-focused precision of audience targeting, allowing the IMPERIAL team to aim for real listeners right when they're most likely to engage. They set up the campaign to reach Jelani's lapsed listeners in the U.S. and the U.K. — people who haven’t actively listened to Jelani’s music in the past six months, but had previously — ensuring his album could reach an audience that might not have otherwise known about it. “Marquee really helped fit into our release strategy by helping reach our goal of casting an overall wider net.”\n\nIt’s that precise targeting and direct access to listeners that they found lacking in other marketing options. “If you’re advertising on a social platform, you’re not even positive what [streaming service] they’re listening to the music on,” explains Risi. “You’re linking out to a [landing page] with all the other [streaming services, and] now you have to ask them to click through to another [one]. And sometimes when they click on it, they have to sign in to Spotify, or it brings them to Spotify on [a browser]. And it’s one more step, and you get lazy and you click out. Even if I’m serviced with the ad, it’s an extra step.\" \n\nWith attention spans being a hot commodity, Marquee’s seamless in-app integration removes obstacles that keep listeners from, well, listening. “[With Marquee], you’re being serviced in the platform already. It makes a lot more sense. It’s not an extra step. It’s less work on the consumer’s end, so your results are better,” says Risi.\n\nThe team knew from their Spotify for Artists data that Jelani’s audience tends to be more active on Thursdays, so they decided to start the campaign the Thursday after release day (they wanted to “circle back a few days later and hit the fans again”), ensuring another wave of listeners they didn’t reach with the initial release day marketing. The strategy paid off: intent rate for the campaign was 38%, meaning more than a third of listeners who saw the Marquee and streamed the album then saved or added a track from Jelani’s album to a personal playlist for continued listening. \n\nWith such a high frequency of saves and playlist adds, Risi’s team anticipates listeners will have a greater chance of maintaining a long-term connection with the artist. “We wanted them to save it to their libraries so, at a later date, when the playlist changed and he’s maybe not on the playlist anymore, they’re still listening to the song.”\n\n![ ](//images.ctfassets.net/lnhrh9gqejzl/66WYhj1Eq3PJNKNmqLaQ3k/d15e0901626c5f8e40f4ea027f5deb10/jelani-aryeh-canvas.gif)\n\nWith listeners already primed to listen to *I’ve Got Some Living To Do* long after the debut’s release, the looping [Canvas visuals](https://canvas.spotify.com/) reignited interest in Jelani’s artistic vision. Tracks like “[Marigold](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rCqVP8OeyeTLkBVQtFXZA?si=98152b408c9f4d08)” and “[Overexposed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nU3bryfHBJVsupT0mz3Nh?si=953e8870bdfa44e3)” feature retro-inspired and sun-soaked footage that complement the carefree pop sound he’s known for, while others, like opener “[Trunk Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rV0HNxXQoeaOxhJRe2bjB?si=712213fa37e4400a),” lend an even more personal touch. \n\nA moving, humanesque object that Jelani has affectionately deemed the “doodle bob” runs through several tracks in alternating colors. The graphic incorporates two Js, for \"Jelani\" and his brother “Jordan,” and is stamped throughout the artist’s portfolio, from his album cover to his main logo and even as a tattoo. “The fact that his Canvas is his logo, it’s something very special to him, tattooed on him, and incorporated into the cover art. It was great that we could have this consistent logo that is animated and on repeat. And this is his debut album, so having his logo there was his way of introducing himself.” \n\nNow with a rising career and an impressive batch of engaged listeners under his belt, we can safely say that Jelani Aryeh has made quite the introduction. \n\n### Connect with us\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

Just getting the music right took years.”\n\n“There were a lot of failed collaborations, a lot of people calling me nitpicky. Everyone was just trying to change the sound – a sound that was so simple to me in my head.”\n\nWolf, a singer-songwriter from Queens, NY, describes her sound as drawing from the hip-hop world and from indie music, combining the lyrical emphasis she loves from rap music with the natural indie sound of her voice. “I love adding the layers of harmonies, but ultimately it’s the lyrics. I just want to highlight the lyrics.” \n\n“I realized very, very quickly in my songwriting career that I can only write on things I've lived through. I can't write on other people's experiences, because when I do it, it feels so unnatural.” One such song she’s written is “[Falling in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IX5aHj5KD3MsQwZqBs5Ow?si=a631074e87964cbb),” a new track that tells the true story of an interrupted night out with friends. As the first single released in the lead-up to her first EP, [*Girls in Purgatory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tYt0x29RobSYgYzvgXdTC?si=iFbh6PVFSVe6QRi8xYIVvQ), her team was strategic in how they approached the release, using Spotify for Artists [data and insights](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/release-details-page-and-audience-engagement-analytics), [Canvas](https://canvas.spotify.com/), and [Marquee](http://artists.spotify.com/marquee) to promote the track and build an engaged audience ahead of the full debut. \n\nWolf explains that she and her team used their audience data to better understand who her fans were, and as a result, changed her social media messaging to reach more women. “Spotify [for Artists] has helped me understand more about who my target audience is, because in the beginning it was more of a male-dominant audience. But when we saw that, I just started gearing more of my conversation on social media to my girls, and then we saw the shift starting to happen. And now the female audience is the more dominant one, which is so cool.”\n\nHer manager, Joseph Pineda, adds: “[On Spotify] we have access to data that five, 10 years ago we’d never be able to see. Now more than ever, especially for independent artists like Julia, we need to use all the tools at our disposal in order to try to break through and get some momentum.” That’s why they turned to Marquee, a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of a new release that’s displayed to Spotify listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music. \n\n“What’s great about the Marquee is there’s no extra step for our fans,” explains Pineda. “For our new song, ‘Falling in Love,’ when they see it they can literally listen to the song right away as a reminder that it’s out and it captures them in that moment.”\n\nWhen the Marquee for \"Falling in Love\" launched in August 2021, more than 29% of listeners who saw it streamed the song – double the benchmark for the pop genre. More than 20% of listeners also saved the track to their personal libraries.\n\n“Falling in Love,” like most Julia Wolf tracks, also has a Canvas – a short, looping visual for fans to watch as they listen to her music. She does the artwork herself, and says it’s something she’ll hold onto as long as she can. “It's definitely another form of self-expression, because when people see it, I want them to understand the brand. I want them to feel like they're in a different world – the Julia Wolf world. It's a reflection of who I am, so it's just as important as the music.”\n\n“Spotify Canvas has really helped me add another element to the music, because instead of it just being the artwork, I now have the freedom to put another visual into people's minds and just help them understand [the music even more],” explains Wolf. “I love when I see my fans sharing the Canvases that I make, because it makes it more intriguing for other people to click on and be like, ‘okay, what's the music behind this?’”\n\nIn the three months following the release of “Falling in Love,” the track was saved more than 20,000 times and added to more than 25,000 playlists. Wolf’s Spotify following also grew by more than 20%, increasing the number of listeners who were ready and waiting to hear her extended EP, *[Girls in Purgatory (Full Moon Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/08hQYW3XbwAhtHO0lA69Ia?si=PNjE2lItSdWBFQ8N4mqfbQ)*, when it dropped this week (Dec. 8). \n\n__Watch the full How They Made It episode below to learn more about the Julia Wolf world, then [click here to explore the full series](https://artists.spotify.com/videos/how-they-made-it).__\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyvtw_zpq8A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","modules":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"1OUaoe0pgCFWInDEz8AfEW"}}],"indexed":true,"author":"Sarah Maloy","initialDropcap":false,"languages":"en-US","id":"3UGiNcpbzXAdZJKruOhITi","contentType":"articlePage"},{"title":"How bbno$ Doubled Active Streams Ahead of His New Album","description":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","urlSlug":"how-bbno-doubled-active-streams-ahead-of-his-new-album","releaseDate":"2021-08-26T10:00-04:00","headerModule":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"hDNaP8swWI2NuebZHJyiS"}},"theme":"Light","introduction":"The Vancouver rapper’s team at mtheory strategically used Marquee to increase his active streams by 40 percentage points leading up to the release of ‘eat ya veggies.’","article":"How does an independent artist go from a viral sensation to a household name with a long-lasting career and engaged fanbase? There are myriad factors that play a role in this kind of success story, but a few things are for sure: It takes good music, a savvy artist team, and, of course, great marketing.\n\nAs native to digital spaces as he is to his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, [bbno$](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz?si=xhDYCjw-RYu7arfbsEhm5g\u0026dl_branch=1) is *of* the internet, not just on it, and he’s an indie artist on the cusp of mainstream superstardom. The humorous, down-to-earth rapper broke through in 2019 with the viral hit “[Lalala](https://open.spotify.com/track/51Fjme0JiitpyXKuyQiCDo?si=289e1e77eb5d4bfa),” which has over 770 million plays on Spotify. He’s been on a roll since then, amassing more than 840,000 followers and a monthly listener count of 9 million-plus on Spotify.\n\nSince early 2021, manager services and artist development company [mtheory](https://mtheory.com/) have been bbno$’s partners in his ascent, supporting his management team by helping with his release strategy and tour rollouts and connecting him to creatives. \n\nbbno$’s relationship with mtheory began with goal setting: “For bbno$, it was about leveling up,” says Hannah Waitt, mtheory’s Director of Digital Marketing. “We want to grow him in a smart way that develops a really solid base of fans that will stay with him, because one of his goals is to make music and tour — and be able to live off of that.”\n\nThis fall, on October 8 to be precise, bbno$ is releasing his new album, *eat ya veggies*, and kicking off a tour to support it in October. bbno$’s team at mtheory needed ways to bring listeners who had stumbled across “Lalala'' or his hits with frequent collaborator Yung Gravy deeper into his music — transforming their consumption from passive, “lean back” streaming to active, intentional listening. One of the tools they used to achieve this goal was  Marquee. The promotional tool serves up full-screen, sponsored recommendations of your new release to the right Spotify Free and Premium listeners, guiding them from the app’s Home screen to an active streaming session of your new music. Leading up to the release of his album, bbno$ has released a series of singles that Waitt and his team at mtheory promoted to strategic segments of his audience with Marquee.\n\nmtheory’s work with bbno$ started with his single “[bad to the bone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wTlriqyGE7UX1bebRBtR8?si=5ef2e40de8344b1f).” “Our first goal with it was to target lapsed listeners,” says Waitt, describing listeners who have not actively streamed an artist’s music in the past six months, though they had before. “They know ‘Lalala,’ but they don’t know bbno$ as an artist. For whatever reason, they haven’t listened in six months. [We said to ourselves,] ‘Let’s figure out how many people are out there that fall into that category, and let’s use this first spend to bring as many of them back into bbno$ as possible,’ knowing that, six weeks later, we have another release that we want to hit them with.” \n\nFor his next single, they chose to promote his track “[help herself](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bhpOnHyttMaBCg6WGCRzi?si=640a496a258e44ae),” this time featuring Australian indie pop phenom [BENEE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Cp8WN4V8Tu4QJQwCN5Md4?si=tjE4t6lMQdqYCXvfAzLn6A\u0026dl_branch=1). “We went with [the] recently-interested [audience segment] on that, because we had already hit lapsed and casual [listeners],'' explains Waitt. “Then, it was about maximum conversion: get people into the song, get them saving it, prime them for the next solo bbno$ release.” Waitt’s clever strategy went beyond listener profiles to include the nuance of listeners' locations too. “We also targeted Australia on that one, the idea there [being] to sort of tap into BENEE’s fanbase in Australia and bring some of them over into the bbno$ fanbase, so we could hit them with that next Marquee, which was [the single] ‘wussup.’”\n\nTheir strategic use of audience segments helped “help herself” with BENEE yield a 37% intent rate among listeners — great news for bbno$ and mtheory as they want to drive more intentional, active streams. “[High intent rate] shows me that a listener has heard it, that they liked it, and they intend to listen to it more, either by saving it down to their library or playlisting,” explains Waitt. \n\nThis fan-focused strategy has paid off, and from March 2021 to June 2021, his team saw the number of bbno$’s monthly streams coming from active, lean-in sources — like users’ playlists, their libraries, and bbno$’s page — increase from 38% to 78%. bbno$’s fans actively streaming more of his new releases helped fuel broader engagement with his work. “Marquee is about bringing listeners back into the fold,'' says Waitt. “[When a fan is actively engaged with your music,] you’re in their algorithm, you’re getting autoplayed, you’re in the Daily Mixes. The long-tail effect of Marquee is really what’s going to be the measure of success of this tool, not just the streams you get off of a one-week campaign.” \n\n![bbno$ passive versus active streams](//images.contentful.com/lnhrh9gqejzl/7MKC9MvQ47g02zq3P8WIdw/151519eabf4e148d7b2106fcee58f106/S4A_bbno__BlogPost_02.png)\n\nOverall, Marquee is helping to increase bbno$’s momentum and anticipation for eat ya veggies on Spotify. “Streaming peaks keep getting higher with every new release,'' explains Waitt. “We just had our highest streaming peak to date at over 860,000 daily streams for ‘edamame’ [another single promoted with Marquee]. At this point it's outpaced bbno$'s most successful hit to date, ‘Lalala’! We’re seeing these people actually get pulled back into his orbit, on Spotify.”\n\n__Connect with us__\n\nWe’re excited to share more updates as we continue to expand Marquee.

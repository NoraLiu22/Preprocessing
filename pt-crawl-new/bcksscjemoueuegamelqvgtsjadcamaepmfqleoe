              <p>Healthy Chinese Takeout participants as of 2/5/15. The Philadelphia Healthy Chinese Take-out Initiative is working to prevent and control high blood pressure in Philadelphia residents by 1) reducing the sodium content in Chinese take-out dishes by 10-15% and 2) decreasing access to tobacco products. The initiative is a joint effort among Temple University’s Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Excess consumption of sodium (salt) and tobacco use are two major contributors to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Chinese take-out restaurant dishes can have large amounts of sodium mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. And Chinese take-out restaurants tend to have higher rates of illegal tobacco sales to minors than other retailers. To date, 200 Chinese take-out restaurants have enrolled in the initiative, participated in a low-sodium healthy cooking training with a professional chef, and received education about complying with the Tobacco Youth Sales Law.</p>

              <p>BACKGROUND - The objective of geotechnical testing is to help determine the suitability of a site for green stormwater infrastructure. The tests are used to calculate infiltration rates at proposed green infrastructure locations and evaluate the lithology at depths sufficient to identify any hydraulically limiting layers that would inhibit vertical infiltration and potentially cause lateral flow. The testing includes drilling borings followed by infiltration testing within the footprint of each GSI system.</p>

<p>USING THE LAYER - The infiltration rates and subsurface lithology results such as depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater may be helpful for other users of this layer, but it is important to note that these values can vary widely from location to location, even for nearby sites.</p>

<p>When snow accumulations approach emergency status, the Managing Director may declare a snow emergency. Once emergency status is declared, the City’s 110 miles of Snow Emergency Routes receive priority. Owners of vehicles and dumpsters must move them to alternate parking spaces so City forces can clear snow from curb-to-curb on the emergency routes. Any vehicle remaining on a Snow Emergency Route during the declared Snow Emergency will be ticketed and towed. If your car is towed, call 215-686-SNOW for its location. Do NOT call 911.
The snow-emergency-routes.csv file was created from the table on the Streets Department snow emergency route page. I used this file to generate the snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file.</p>

<p>The snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file contains the IDs of all of the street segments that are classified as snow emergency routes. The snow emergency routes shapefile/geojson is built by filtering the street centerline layer to include only those rows where the seg_id is contained in this list.</p>

To date, <br />Taylor is a twelve-time Grammy winner, a singer, songwriter, musician and producer. She is the first female solo artist to win the music industry’s highest honor, the Grammy Award for Album of the Year! Taylor is Billboard’s first-ever Woman of the Decade recipient along with being the youngest-ever Woman of the Year honoree and the only artist to have been awarded this nod twice. Taylor is the American Music Awards’ Artist of the Decade, the only artist in history to have four consecutive albums sell over one million copies in their week of release (Speak Now, RED, 1989 and reputation) and the only female artist to have six albums each sell at least 500,000 copies in a single week (Fearless, Speak Now, RED, 1989, reputation and Lover). Oh, and did we mention she is a Brit and Emmy Award winner too.<br /><br />Taylor Swift is a household name whose insanely catchy yet deeply personal self-penned songs transcend musical genres. Music critic Jody Rosen once called Taylor “a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture” in Rolling Stone. Her songs are glimpses into her diary, capturing the hearts of millions with her songs about love, life, and the unique struggles we all experience. . The thread that connects her to audiences worldwide but it’s the intangibles that elevate Swift into the stratosphere of our pop culture planet, allowing the 30-year old singer-songwriter to orbit in a more rarified air.<br /><br />It’s her fight for artist’s rights and ownership of their work. It’s taking a stand for LGBTQ rights and equality. It’s publicly calling out former President Trump for “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency.” In addition to her activism, it’s her numerous large-scale charitable contributions to organizations such as the World Health Organizations’ COVID-19 Response Fund, NAACP Legal Defense Fund and direct help to tornado, flood and hurricane victims in Tennessee, Louisiana, Iowa and Houston just to name a few.  However, it’s in the small gestures – the notes of compassion she posts on her fan’s Instagram photos, the genuine hugs she distributes without discretion – where Taylor proves time and time again that multi-platinum selling, record-setting success has not changed her inherent nature. She is honest and powerfully empathetic; a loyal friend, fierce protector of hearts; and one of the world’s greatest ambassadors for the power of just being yourself.<br />Taylor Swift has been breaking records since the beginning of her career. Her music speaks to millions of fans around the world, cementing her place in music history as one of the most talented and influential artists of all time. For fans lucky enough to score Taylor Swift concert tickets, her live performances are a truly unforgettable experience. Keep an eye out for Taylor Swift tour dates and secure your tickets early. <br />Find Taylor Swift tour dates, get notified when tickets go on sale, and browse more upcoming events with

 five star mind blowing experience of entertainment. Taylor Swift is in a calibre all of her own. She was born to write lyrics, sing to thousands and entertain you all night long. Her vulnerability, her humour and her work ethic left us in awe as we sang, danced, hugged and cried. The concert flew by so quickly we never wanted to leave. A once in a life experience we will never forget in our wildest dreams. \r\nA big shout out to Sabrina Carpenter for the opening act. She set the scene and connected with the crowd. She really is a star.\r\nThe MCG didn’t disappoint. The sea of friendly staff were so helpful and the layout of the G caters for large crowds without blinking an eye.  It was safe, it was electric and it was just awesome.","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Melbourne Cricket Ground","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"East Melbourne, Australia","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"February 17th 2024","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Cristina","userImageUrl":"https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/15388150.jpeg","properlySizedImageURL":"https://media.bandsintown.com/36x36/15388150.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.png","rating":5,"comment":"This was my mom and I's first time seeing Taylor. She did AMAZING!!!!! We had a blast, definitely worth coming here and finally being able to see her play live after being fans for decades. However, heads up if you're getting last minute tickets - you may not get your light up bracelets. Security nor guest services were able to help when I told them that our bracelets were stolen, most likely the group of girls next to me who were originally in my seats when we had arrived. It may be just a bracelet but not only its part of the experience but its also supposed to be included with our paid ticket no matter what.

We arrived at around 2:15pm and waited for one hour and fifteen minutes before being served.  This was set in the parking lot of the venue.  They also sold merchandise inside the ticket gates, but given the demand and experience with other events there was risk of missing part of the event itself by doing so.  After the merchandise, the line to enter the event took another hour after the gates opened at 4:30pm. At the end of that experience they gave you a wrist band that turned lights off and on during the concert throughout the stadium in which more than 50,000 fans were all trying to get in at once. The lights on the wrist band would go off depending on where you were seated. The third line was for food and beverage.  After the first two lines the best offerings had really, really long lines. We have missed opening songs by main event performers by choosing food lines that were too long. One of the shortest lines was for cheesesteaks, so we got those…..what they really were was cheap nacho cheese sauce with canned bean-less chile on a hot dog bun…..for $16 each.  \r\nOpening acts:  The opening acts reflected the bi polar nature of Taylor herself, the unhappy, but passionate romantic; and then the hell-bent woman who is determined to set right the personal relationship wrongs in her life.  So there were two opening acts: (1) Tracie Abrams, and (2) HIAM.   Tracie Abrams took the stage at about 6:25pm and sang for roughly 30 minutes.  She sang mostly moody, passionate, melancholy songs such as “I’m Sorry.” (2) The second act, HIAM which is the Hebrew word for “life” was a three sister band whose songs sounded like they were all about how angry they were","artistName":"","artistUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/undefined-?came_from=251&utm_medium=web&utm_source=artist_page&utm_campaign=ratings","venueName":"Levi's Stadium","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Santa Clara, CA","venueCityUrl":null,"date":"July 30th 2023","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":"Abbi","userImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.png","properlySizedImageURL":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.webp","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.png","rating":5,"comment":"Such a wonderful show!

Swift","genre":"Country","sameAs":"https://music.apple.com/artist/taylor-swift/159260351","description":"Taylor Swift is, quite simply, a global superstar and songwriter of her generation.\n\nBorn on December 13, 1989 in Pennsylvania, Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, as a teenager to pursue her dream of becoming a country music artist. To date, \nTaylor is a twelve-time Grammy winner, a singer, songwriter, musician and producer. She is the first female solo artist to win the music industry’s highest honor, the Grammy Award for Album of the Year! Taylor is Billboard’s first-ever Woman of the Decade recipient along with being the youngest-ever Woman of the Year honoree and the only artist to have been awarded this nod twice. Taylor is the American Music Awards’ Artist of the Decade, the only artist in history to have four consecutive albums sell over one million copies in their week of release (Speak Now, RED, 1989 and reputation) and the only female artist to have six albums each sell at least 500,000 copies in a single week (Fearless, Speak Now, RED, 1989, reputation and Lover). Oh, and did we mention she is a Brit and Emmy Award winner too.\n\nTaylor Swift is a household name whose insanely catchy yet deeply personal self-penned songs transcend musical genres. Music critic Jody Rosen once called Taylor “a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture” in Rolling Stone. Her songs are glimpses into her diary, capturing the hearts of millions with her songs about love, life, and the unique struggles we all experience. . The thread that connects her to audiences worldwide but it’s the intangibles that elevate Swift into the stratosphere of our pop culture planet, allowing the 30-year old singer-songwriter to orbit in a more rarified air.\n\nIt’s her fight for artist’s rights and ownership of their work.

Taylor Swift is in a calibre all of her own. She was born to write lyrics, sing to thousands and entertain you all night long. Her vulnerability, her humour and her work ethic left us in awe as we sang, danced, hugged and cried. The concert flew by so quickly we never wanted to leave. A once in a life experience we will never forget in our wildest dreams. \r\nA big shout out to Sabrina Carpenter for the opening act. She set the scene and connected with the crowd. She really is a star.\r\nThe MCG didn’t disappoint. The sea of friendly staff were so helpful and the layout of the G caters for large crowds without blinking an eye.

She did AMAZING!!!!! We had a blast, definitely worth coming here and finally being able to see her play live after being fans for decades. However, heads up if you're getting last minute tickets - you may not get your light up bracelets. Security nor guest services were able to help when I told them that our bracelets were stolen, most likely the group of girls next to me who were originally in my seats when we had arrived. It may be just a bracelet but not only its part of the experience but its also supposed to be included with our paid ticket no matter what.

The main even was nothing short of outstanding….read on.\r\nThe Pre-Concert Lines-  Merchandise for the concert opened at 2:00pm.  We arrived at around 2:15pm and waited for one hour and fifteen minutes before being served.  This was set in the parking lot of the venue.  They also sold merchandise inside the ticket gates, but given the demand and experience with other events there was risk of missing part of the event itself by doing so.  After the merchandise, the line to enter the event took another hour after the gates opened at 4:30pm. At the end of that experience they gave you a wrist band that turned lights off and on during the concert throughout the stadium in which more than 50,000 fans were all trying to get in at once. The lights on the wrist band would go off depending on where you were seated. The third line was for food and beverage.  After the first two lines the best offerings had really, really long lines. We have missed opening songs by main event performers by choosing food lines that were too long. One of the shortest lines was for cheesesteaks, so we got those…..what they really were was cheap nacho cheese sauce with canned bean-less chile on a hot dog bun…..for $16 each.  \r\nOpening acts:  The opening acts reflected the bi polar nature of Taylor herself, the unhappy, but passionate romantic; and then the hell-bent woman who is determined to set right the personal relationship wrongs in her life.  So there were two opening acts: (1) Tracie Abrams, and (2) HIAM.   Tracie Abrams took the stage at about 6:25pm and sang for roughly 30 minutes.  She sang mostly moody, passionate, melancholy songs such as “I’m Sorry.” (2) The second act, HIAM which is the Hebrew word for “life” was a three sister band whose songs sounded like they were all about how angry they were","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bob"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Taylor Swift","genre":"Country","sameAs":"https://music.apple.com/artist/taylor-swift/159260351","description":"Taylor Swift is, quite simply, a global superstar and songwriter of her generation.\n\nBorn on December 13, 1989 in Pennsylvania, Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, as a teenager to pursue her dream of becoming a country music artist.

The open bar, free food, and free show just goes to show you that AT&T always goes above and beyond for their customers and guests.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Austin"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Taylor Swift","genre":"Country","sameAs":"https://music.apple.com/artist/taylor-swift/159260351","description":"Taylor Swift is, quite simply, a global superstar and songwriter of her generation.\n\nBorn on December 13, 1989 in Pennsylvania, Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, as a teenager to pursue her dream of becoming a country music artist.

Taylor Swift is in a calibre all of her own. She was born to write lyrics, sing to thousands and entertain you all night long. Her vulnerability, her humour and her work ethic left us in awe as we sang, danced, hugged and cried. The concert flew by so quickly we never wanted to leave. A once in a life experience we will never forget in our wildest dreams. 
A big shout out to Sabrina Carpenter for the opening act. She set the scene and connected with the crowd. She really is a star.
The MCG didn’t disappoint. The sea of friendly staff were so helpful and the layout of the G caters for large crowds without blinking an eye.  It was safe, it was electric and it was just awesome.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">East Melbourne, Australia</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Melbourne Cricket Ground</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:block"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://media.bandsintown.com/36x36/15388150.webp"/><img src="https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/15388150.jpeg" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Cristina</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">August 5th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">This was my mom and I&#x27;s first time seeing Taylor. She did AMAZING!!!!! We had a blast, definitely worth coming here and finally being able to see her play live after being fans for decades. However, heads up if you&#x27;re getting last minute tickets - you may not get your light up bracelets. Security nor guest services were able to help when I told them that our bracelets were stolen, most likely the group of girls next to me who were originally in my seats when we had arrived. It may be just a bracelet but not only its part of the experience but its also supposed to be included with our paid ticket no matter what. Maybe next time hand them out at the entrance so stuff like this doesn&#x27;t happen.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Los Angeles, CA</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">SoFi Stadium</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:block"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/07.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Bob</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">July 30th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Unlike most concerts we attend, this one was an all afternoon/evening event and consisted of three parts: (1) the pre-concert lines, (2) the opening acts, and (3) the main event- Taylor Swift.  The main even was nothing short of outstanding….read on.
The Pre-Concert Lines-  Merchandise for the concert opened at 2:00pm.  We arrived at around 2:15pm and waited for one hour and fifteen minutes before being served.  This was set in the parking lot of the venue.  They also sold merchandise inside the ticket gates, but given the demand and experience with other events there was risk of missing part of the event itself by doing so.  After the merchandise, the line to enter the event took another hour after the gates opened at 4:30pm. At the end of that experience they gave you a wrist band that turned lights off and on during the concert throughout the stadium in which more than 50,000 fans were all trying to get in at once. The lights on the wrist band would go off depending on where you were seated. The third line was for food and beverage.  After the first two lines the best offerings had really, really long lines. We have missed opening songs by main event performers by choosing food lines that were too long. One of the shortest lines was for cheesesteaks, so we got those…..what they really were was cheap nacho cheese sauce with canned bean-less chile on a hot dog bun…..for $16 each.  
Opening acts:  The opening acts reflected the bi polar nature of Taylor herself, the unhappy, but passionate romantic; and then the hell-bent woman who is determined to set right the personal relationship wrongs in her life.  So there were two opening acts: (1) Tracie Abrams, and (2) HIAM.   Tracie Abrams took the stage at about 6:25pm and sang for roughly 30 minutes.  She sang mostly moody, passionate, melancholy songs such as “I’m Sorry.” (2) The second act, HIAM which is the Hebrew word for “life” was a three sister band whose songs sounded like they were all about how angry they were</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Santa Clara, CA</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Levi&#x27;s Stadium</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Abbi</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">June 7th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Such a wonderful show!

You can tell she really does care about her fans and the staff working at the concerts. I loved this concert in particular because not only did Taylor play Reputation and 1989 songs, she also threw in a couple of old ones. And not only that, she played the guitar and piano. She’s so talented. I’d give this concert 10 stars if I could.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Houston, TX</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">NRG Arena</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/03.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Leah</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">July 9th 2019</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">i am one of the BIGGEST fans of taylor swift, so i might be a little biased.. but lemme tell you- there was not a SINGLE person sitting down. camila cavelike &amp; charli xcx opened and were INCREDIBLE. she walked all over the stage so everyone could see her, and she came out to the b stages so she could get close to those who weren’t in the front, and i was one of those people. i was SO CLOSE to her and i was bawling my eyes out , out of pure joy. not only is she a good and kind person, she’s an amazing performer and i was blessed enough to be there. can’t wait for her next tour!! - leah</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Pittsburgh, PA</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Heinz Field</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/07.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/04.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Toni</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">April 5th 2019</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">I had to rush out of my GCSE Physics exam to get the bus to Dublin on time lol but I would live that day over and over and over again if I could.

The open bar, free food, and free show just goes to show you that AT&amp;T always goes above and beyond for their customers and guests.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Houston, TX</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Club Nomadic</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://media.bandsintown.com/36x36/7506967.webp"/><img src="https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7506967.jpeg" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Brian</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">August 5th 2015</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Taylor Swift always puts outs a Awesome show for her fans!

Taylor delivered an incredible performance as we as loving interactions with the crowd of 45,000+. Taylor has been changing my life since the release of her first album, Taylor Swift and last night I was reborn.

To date, <br />Taylor is a twelve-time Grammy winner, a singer, songwriter, musician and producer. She is the first female solo artist to win the music industry’s highest honor, the Grammy Award for Album of the Year! Taylor is Billboard’s first-ever Woman of the Decade recipient along with being the youngest-ever Woman of the Year honoree and the only artist to have been awarded this nod twice. Taylor is the American Music Awards’ Artist of the Decade, the only artist in history to have four consecutive albums sell over one million copies in their week of release (Speak Now, RED, 1989 and reputation) and the only female artist to have six albums each sell at least 500,000 copies in a single week (Fearless, Speak Now, RED, 1989, reputation and Lover). Oh, and did we mention she is a Brit and Emmy Award winner too.<br /><br />Taylor Swift is a household name whose insanely catchy yet deeply personal self-penned songs transcend musical genres. Music critic Jody Rosen once called Taylor “a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture” in Rolling Stone. Her songs are glimpses into her diary, capturing the hearts of millions with her songs about love, life, and the unique struggles we all experience. . The thread that connects her to audiences worldwide but it’s the intangibles that elevate Swift into the stratosphere of our pop culture planet, allowing the 30-year old singer-songwriter to orbit in a more rarified air.<br /><br />It’s her fight for artist’s rights and ownership of their work. It’s taking a stand for LGBTQ rights and equality. It’s publicly calling out former President Trump for “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency.” In addition to her activism, it’s her numerous large-scale charitable contributions to organizations such as the World Health Organizations’ COVID-19 Response Fund, NAACP Legal Defense Fund and direct help to tornado, flood and hurricane victims in Tennessee, Louisiana, Iowa and Houston just to name a few.  However, it’s in the small gestures – the notes of compassion she posts on her fan’s Instagram photos, the genuine hugs she distributes without discretion – where Taylor proves time and time again that multi-platinum selling, record-setting success has not changed her inherent nature. She is honest and powerfully empathetic; a loyal friend, fierce protector of hearts; and one of the world’s greatest ambassadors for the power of just being yourself.<br />Taylor Swift has been breaking records since the beginning of her career. Her music speaks to millions of fans around the world, cementing her place in music history as one of the most talented and influential artists of all time. For fans lucky enough to score Taylor Swift concert tickets, her live performances are a truly unforgettable experience.

Taylor Swift is in a calibre all of her own. She was born to write lyrics, sing to thousands and entertain you all night long. Her vulnerability, her humour and her work ethic left us in awe as we sang, danced, hugged and cried. The concert flew by so quickly we never wanted to leave. A once in a life experience we will never forget in our wildest dreams. 
A big shout out to Sabrina Carpenter for the opening act. She set the scene and connected with the crowd. She really is a star.
The MCG didn’t disappoint. The sea of friendly staff were so helpful and the layout of the G caters for large crowds without blinking an eye.  It was safe, it was electric and it was just awesome.</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">East Melbourne, Australia</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Melbourne Cricket Ground</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:block"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://media.bandsintown.com/36x36/15388150.webp"/><img src="https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/15388150.jpeg" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Cristina</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">August 5th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">This was my mom and I&#x27;s first time seeing Taylor. She did AMAZING!!!!! We had a blast, definitely worth coming here and finally being able to see her play live after being fans for decades. However, heads up if you&#x27;re getting last minute tickets - you may not get your light up bracelets. Security nor guest services were able to help when I told them that our bracelets were stolen, most likely the group of girls next to me who were originally in my seats when we had arrived. It may be just a bracelet but not only its part of the experience but its also supposed to be included with our paid ticket no matter what.

The main even was nothing short of outstanding….read on.
The Pre-Concert Lines-  Merchandise for the concert opened at 2:00pm.  We arrived at around 2:15pm and waited for one hour and fifteen minutes before being served.  This was set in the parking lot of the venue.  They also sold merchandise inside the ticket gates, but given the demand and experience with other events there was risk of missing part of the event itself by doing so.  After the merchandise, the line to enter the event took another hour after the gates opened at 4:30pm. At the end of that experience they gave you a wrist band that turned lights off and on during the concert throughout the stadium in which more than 50,000 fans were all trying to get in at once. The lights on the wrist band would go off depending on where you were seated. The third line was for food and beverage.  After the first two lines the best offerings had really, really long lines. We have missed opening songs by main event performers by choosing food lines that were too long. One of the shortest lines was for cheesesteaks, so we got those…..what they really were was cheap nacho cheese sauce with canned bean-less chile on a hot dog bun…..for $16 each.  
Opening acts:  The opening acts reflected the bi polar nature of Taylor herself, the unhappy, but passionate romantic; and then the hell-bent woman who is determined to set right the personal relationship wrongs in her life.  So there were two opening acts: (1) Tracie Abrams, and (2) HIAM.   Tracie Abrams took the stage at about 6:25pm and sang for roughly 30 minutes.  She sang mostly moody, passionate, melancholy songs such as “I’m Sorry.” (2) The second act, HIAM which is the Hebrew word for “life” was a three sister band whose songs sounded like they were all about how angry they were</div><a class="l4ESFrEnLBt5ujqetW8S">Santa Clara, CA</a><span style="color:#8F8F8F">@</span><div class="wcY7G9aZMaZWh5GTYEVo">Levi&#x27;s Stadium</div></div><div class="WxX8Vgt4LcYvlBjlB7Q_ " style="display:none"><div class="MIb4rNZVQjncoTkZ7uHI"><div class="eVCjzAHfr4jXCVr30U2K"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcSet="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/02.webp"/><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/homeIcon/festivalPlaceHolderImage/thumbnail/06.png" alt=""/></picture></div><div class="Zcy4MJqSP3ps90PF_aWd"><div class="CgyBVRodwWZG6ZDbhnDk"><div class="moj1VYgpQhszkKJo2acQ">Abbi</div><div class="TR7xwUSyZtRsvKo1brgz">June 7th 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="NCUVzEwP2fYSY5vzSmor"><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div><div class="kTjHETu3RrReJUdnHs_j"><img src="https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg" width="18" height="17" alt=""/></div></div><div class="Kl2ZI_8sK2n8uc3rXFvg">Such a wonderful show!

To date, <br />Taylor is a twelve-time Grammy winner, a singer, songwriter, musician and producer. She is the first female solo artist to win the music industry’s highest honor, the Grammy Award for Album of the Year! Taylor is Billboard’s first-ever Woman of the Decade recipient along with being the youngest-ever Woman of the Year honoree and the only artist to have been awarded this nod twice. Taylor is the American Music Awards’ Artist of the Decade, the only artist in history to have four consecutive albums sell over one million copies in their week of release (Speak Now, RED, 1989 and reputation) and the only female artist to have six albums each sell at least 500,000 copies in a single week (Fearless, Speak Now, RED, 1989, reputation and Lover). Oh, and did we mention she is a Brit and Emmy Award winner too.<br /><br />Taylor Swift is a household name whose insanely catchy yet deeply personal self-penned songs transcend musical genres. Music critic Jody Rosen once called Taylor “a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture” in Rolling Stone. Her songs are glimpses into her diary, capturing the hearts of millions with her songs about love, life, and the unique struggles we all experience. . The thread that connects her to audiences worldwide but it’s the intangibles that elevate Swift into the stratosphere of our pop culture planet, allowing the 30-year old singer-songwriter to orbit in a more rarified air.<br /><br />It’s her fight for artist’s rights and ownership of their work. It’s taking a stand for LGBTQ rights and equality. It’s publicly calling out former President Trump for “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency.” In addition to her activism, it’s her numerous large-scale charitable contributions to organizations such as the World Health Organizations’ COVID-19 Response Fund, NAACP Legal Defense Fund and direct help to tornado, flood and hurricane victims in Tennessee, Louisiana, Iowa and Houston just to name a few.  However, it’s in the small gestures – the notes of compassion she posts on her fan’s Instagram photos, the genuine hugs she distributes without discretion – where Taylor proves time and time again that multi-platinum selling, record-setting success has not changed her inherent nature. She is honest and powerfully empathetic; a loyal friend, fierce protector of hearts; and one of the world’s greatest ambassadors for the power of just being yourself.<br />Taylor Swift has been breaking records since the beginning of her career. Her music speaks to millions of fans around the world, cementing her place in music history as one of the most talented and influential artists of all time. For fans lucky enough to score Taylor Swift concert tickets, her live performances are a truly unforgettable experience.

To date, \nTaylor is a twelve-time Grammy winner, a singer, songwriter, musician and producer. She is the first female solo artist to win the music industry’s highest honor, the Grammy Award for Album of the Year! Taylor is Billboard’s first-ever Woman of the Decade recipient along with being the youngest-ever Woman of the Year honoree and the only artist to have been awarded this nod twice. Taylor is the American Music Awards’ Artist of the Decade, the only artist in history to have four consecutive albums sell over one million copies in their week of release (Speak Now, RED, 1989 and reputation) and the only female artist to have six albums each sell at least 500,000 copies in a single week (Fearless, Speak Now, RED, 1989, reputation and Lover). Oh, and did we mention she is a Brit and Emmy Award winner too.\n\nTaylor Swift is a household name whose insanely catchy yet deeply personal self-penned songs transcend musical genres. Music critic Jody Rosen once called Taylor “a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture” in Rolling Stone. Her songs are glimpses into her diary, capturing the hearts of millions with her songs about love, life, and the unique struggles we all experience. . The thread that connects her to audiences worldwide but it’s the intangibles that elevate Swift into the stratosphere of our pop culture planet, allowing the 30-year old singer-songwriter to orbit in a more rarified air.\n\nIt’s her fight for artist’s rights and ownership of their work. It’s taking a stand for LGBTQ rights and equality. It’s publicly calling out former President Trump for “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency.” In addition to her activism, it’s her numerous large-scale charitable contributions to organizations such as the World Health Organizations’ COVID-19 Response Fund, NAACP Legal Defense Fund and direct help to tornado, flood and hurricane victims in Tennessee, Louisiana, Iowa and Houston just to name a few.  However, it’s in the small gestures – the notes of compassion she posts on her fan’s Instagram photos, the genuine hugs she distributes without discretion – where Taylor proves time and time again that multi-platinum selling, record-setting success has not changed her inherent nature. She is honest and powerfully empathetic; a loyal friend, fierce protector of hearts; and one of the world’s greatest ambassadors for the power of just being yourself.\nTaylor Swift has been breaking records since the beginning of her career.

Taylor Swift is in a calibre all of her own. She was born to write lyrics, sing to thousands and entertain you all night long. Her vulnerability, her humour and her work ethic left us in awe as we sang, danced, hugged and cried. The concert flew by so quickly we never wanted to leave. A once in a life experience we will never forget in our wildest dreams. \r\nA big shout out to Sabrina Carpenter for the opening act. She set the scene and connected with the crowd. She really is a star.\r\nThe MCG didn’t disappoint. The sea of friendly staff were so helpful and the layout of the G caters for large crowds without blinking an eye.

She did AMAZING!!!!! We had a blast, definitely worth coming here and finally being able to see her play live after being fans for decades. However, heads up if you're getting last minute tickets - you may not get your light up bracelets. Security nor guest services were able to help when I told them that our bracelets were stolen, most likely the group of girls next to me who were originally in my seats when we had arrived. It may be just a bracelet but not only its part of the experience but its also supposed to be included with our paid ticket no matter what. Maybe next time hand them out at the entrance so stuff like this doesn't happen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cristina"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Taylor Swift","genre":"Country","sameAs":"https://music.apple.com/artist/taylor-swift/159260351","description":"Taylor Swift is, quite simply, a global superstar and songwriter of her generation.\n\nBorn on December 13, 1989 in Pennsylvania, Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, as a teenager to pursue her dream of becoming a country music artist.

The main even was nothing short of outstanding….read on.\r\nThe Pre-Concert Lines-  Merchandise for the concert opened at 2:00pm.  We arrived at around 2:15pm and waited for one hour and fifteen minutes before being served.  This was set in the parking lot of the venue.  They also sold merchandise inside the ticket gates, but given the demand and experience with other events there was risk of missing part of the event itself by doing so.  After the merchandise, the line to enter the event took another hour after the gates opened at 4:30pm. At the end of that experience they gave you a wrist band that turned lights off and on during the concert throughout the stadium in which more than 50,000 fans were all trying to get in at once. The lights on the wrist band would go off depending on where you were seated. The third line was for food and beverage.  After the first two lines the best offerings had really, really long lines. We have missed opening songs by main event performers by choosing food lines that were too long. One of the shortest lines was for cheesesteaks, so we got those…..what they really were was cheap nacho cheese sauce with canned bean-less chile on a hot dog bun…..for $16 each.  \r\nOpening acts:  The opening acts reflected the bi polar nature of Taylor herself, the unhappy, but passionate romantic; and then the hell-bent woman who is determined to set right the personal relationship wrongs in her life.  So there were two opening acts: (1) Tracie Abrams, and (2) HIAM.   Tracie Abrams took the stage at about 6:25pm and sang for roughly 30 minutes.

<b>Backgrounds:</b>
<p>
The first electronic composition in Finland, the experimental radio play 
<i>Uljas uusi maailma</i> (based on Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i>), was
written by Martti Vuorenjuuri in 1959, and was followed by Bengt
Johansson's <i>Kolme
elektronista harjoitelmaa</i> ("Three Electronic Studies") in 1960 for Finnish
Broadcasting Company
Yleisradio, <a
href="http://www.yle.fi/fbc/">YLE</a>. Also Finnish composers Erkki
Salmenhaara and Henrik Otto Donner experimented with electronic music.
<p>
Yleisradio's
Musica
Nova concerts were visited by such important new music composers as
Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, John Cage, Luciano Berio, Penderecki 
and Oliver Messiaen. As
early as 1967, Musica Nova presented for Finnish audiences computer music
and its various possibilities. 
<p>
As everywhere else in the world, also in
Finland electronic music and avantgarde art were closely connected. In
1963 the Americans Ken Dewey and Terry Riley were organising a performance
or <i>happening</i> for Helsinki Street Piece, with composer Henrik Otto
Donner and some local students. Donner also had in February 1968 his own
happening called <i>S&auml;hk&ouml;shokki-ilta</i> ("Electric Shock 
Evening"),
where he performed at Helsinki's Amos Andersson Gallery his electronic
pieces in conjunction with the exhibition of <a
href="/early/ruutsalo/">Eino Ruutsalo</a>'s
kinetic art and short films. 
<p>
Jyv&auml;skyl&auml; Summer festivals were instrumental in the 
development
of Finnish avantgarde and underground in the 1960s, and were visited by
such international modern composers as Nono, Ligeti and Stockhausen.
The Finnish underground legend, <a
href="/early/index.html#NUMMINEN">M.A.
Numminen</a> shocked in 1966 the establishment in Jyv&auml;skyl&auml;, 
when
he
performed his songs which lyrics had been taken from marital guides and
legislative texts concerning the distribution of pornography. The
multi-talented Numminen would also dabble with electronic music, and
participated in
the creation of S&auml;hk&ouml;kvartetti synthesizer with the composer, 
engineer and visionary <a
href="/early/erkkikurenniemi/">Erkki
Kurenniemi</a>. 
<p>
1967 saw the birth of the notorious Helsinki ensemble <a
href="/early/index.html#SPERM">The
Sperm</a>, led by Mattijuhani Koponen and Pekka Airaksinen and with 
such members as J.O. Mallander and Markus Heikkerö. Airaksinen had
previously written some experimental pieces with the equipment provided
and built by Erkki Kurenniemi for <a
href="http://www.music.helsinki.fi/Overview.html">The University of
Helsinki Electronic Music Studio</a> (where also composers Henrik Otto
Donner and Erkki Salmenhaara had been working).
<p>
The Sperm's performances concentrated, alongside music, on breaking
sexual taboos, and Mattijuhani Koponen eventually had to spend some time
at a correctional facility (the fuss was all about Koponen's alleged
public copulation with an anonymous woman while lying on a grand piano
at a performance), since this sort of avantgardism seemed to be too much
for the establishment of time.
<p>
In the 1970s also such composers continued on the field of Finnish electronic
music as
Osmo Lindeman, Jarmo Sermil&auml;, Otto Romanowski (who had also his 
<a href="/early/neum/">Neum</a>
trio
with Esa Kotilainen and Ilkka Niemeläinen),
Jukka Ruohom&auml;ki (once Erkki Kurenniemi's assistant), Paavo Heininen, Antero
Honkanen, Esa Kotilainen
and Herman Rechberger.

Dance of the Antropoids (Excerpt) 1.09 <br> 
1968 
<p>
One of the undeniable pioneers of Finnish electronic music is Erkki 
Kurenniemi (b. 1941), who founded The University of Helsinki 
Electronic Music Studio in the early 1960's. Kurenniemi
built his own series of synthesizers,
named as DIMI, which are nowadays mostly possessed by Swedish
collector and
electronic musician Ralph Lundsten, and published some of his
experimental
compositions like 'Dance of the Antropoids'. Alongside such
Finnish pioneers as Eino
Ruutsalo (for whose short films Kurenniemi composed music), 
Kurenniemi
also did some early work on the field of <a 
href="http://www.uiah.fi/art2/art2_194/treasury.html">Finnish media
art</a> and contributed to Finnish <a
href="http://www.av-arkki.fi/web/historia.html">video
art</a> and <a
href="http://www.jyu.fi/~tiiukois/musiikki.htm">happenings</a>. These
days Kurenniemi works as an independent researcher, specialising in
such subjects as artificial intelligence. 
<p>
The 
full-length version of this composition can be found on the <a
href="/early/love/">Love Records</a> 
album <i>Perspectives '68 - Music From Finland</i> and also the 1998
collection <i>Love Proge 2</i>. This excerpt of
'Dance of the Antropoids' comes from 
the LP <i>Tombstone Valentine</i> by 
Finnish progressive rock band Wigwam. <a

<p>
From the band's only LP <i>Shh!</i> which also includes the excellent 
'Hein&auml;sirkat' ('Locusts'). Sperm was the biggest name of Helsinki 
underground, having in its line-up among all <a

href="http://www.kiasma.fi/site/pop/pop.php?tid=81&lang=en&mo=">Markus 
Heikkerö</a> and the
musical primus motor Pekka
Airaksinen. The group arranged 
happenings, performances and concerts (with appropriate psychedelic light
shows); and managed to cause some debate and public
outrage at the time in Finland. Sperm created their 
experimental compositions using only various guitar effects and tape
manipulations; the results of which
could these days be called "ambient noise". This track combines some
"samples" to the
experimentation with guitar feedback, effects, etc.,
where an operator of a taxi cab centre recites in a monotonous voice
addresses to the cars where to pick up their customers. 
<p>
These days the original album is a high-priced collector's item, though
there is supposed to be in circulation also a CD-R version available from
Pekka Airaksinen's own <a

<p>
From the rare one-sided 7" EP <i>3rd Erection</i>, which was Sperm's first 
recording. The same people published in 1972 another release at their own 
expense, as Samsa Trio, but it was not actual electronic music either.

<b>M. A. NUMMINEN JA S&Auml;HK&Ouml;KVARTETTI:</b> Kaukana v&auml;ijyy

<br>
('M.A. Numminen & The Electric Quartet: Far Away Lurk Some Friends') <br>
1968
<p>
The Finnish underground legend <a 
href="http://www.ma-numminen.net/">M.A. Numminen</a> 
(b. 1940) & co. on their self-made electronic gadgets, courtesy of 
<a
href="/early/index.html#KURENNIEMI">Erkki
Kurenniemi</a>. Numminen gave the original concept and Kurenniemi built
S&auml;hk&ouml;kvartetti ("Electric 
Quartet"), which was a complex multi-part synthesizer for various players.
M.A. 
Numminen wreaked havoc in a youth festival in Sofia, Bulgaria,
where he performed with S&auml;hk&ouml;kvartetti and a bunch of friends
their
experimental
and very artistic composition 'Kaukana v&auml;ijyy yst&auml;vi&auml;'
("Far Away Lurk Friends"), after which the combo was banned from 
festival.
<p> 
M.A. Numminen had already shocked the establishment in Jyväskylä Summer
festival 1966, when he performed his songs which lyrics had been taken
from guides to newly-married couples and legislative texts concerning 
the distribution of
pornography. The multitalent Numminen was heavily into jazz and
avantgarde culture and music - including electronic sounds - and 
his game was to provoke bourgeoisie as much as he ever could: Numminen's
idiosyncratic
voice (imagine a sheep trying
to sing whining falsetto and out of tune) became soon familiar in
Finland, as he performed anything from traditional tangos and schlagers to
Schubert's lieds to songs which lyrics had been taken from Wittgenstein's
<i>Tractatus</i> to children's songs. M.A. Numminen 
also took part to <a
href="/early/suomen_talvisota/">Suomen
Talvisota 1939-1940</a> ('Finnish Winter War') project which
epitomized Finnish underground rock scene. These days an
established Finnish institution, with a fame going far beyond cult
reputation, Numminen
continued his electronic projects with the Pet Shop Boys-styled album
"M.A. Numminen Goes Tech-No" some years ago, but that's maybe another
story.

<b>PEKKA STRENG:</b> Olen v&auml;synyt ('I'm Tired') <br>
1970
<p>
Maybe not so electronic, but a fine example of <a
href="/retro/garage/finland/" target="_blank">Finnish
psychedelia</a> from the LP
<i>Magneettimiehen kuolema</i> ('The Death of Magnet Man') by <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekka_Streng" target="_blank">Pekka 
Streng</a> 
who died of cancer in 1975 after having recorded only two albums.
<p> 
The subjects of Streng's music, with its tender folk leanings,
concentrate
on fairy tales, Eastern mysticism and spiritualism, social criticism and
so on, with a strong humanist emphasis. On his first album, Streng was
backed by the musicians of the Finnish prog-rock band Tasavallan
Presidentti, and the second - more lavish in its orchestration -
had on it some of the best jazz and rock musicians in
Finland. Even though his recorded output was only two full-length albums
(he was
planning material for the third one at the time of his death) and some 
radio appearances, Pekka Streng remains an influential cult artist even
decades after
his early demise. (Trivia: Pekka Streng appears as one of the extras in
the 1969 
science fiction film, <i><a
href="/links/cinema/ruusujen_aika/" target="_blank">Ruusujen

Preceding the former release, also published by the seminal <a

apparently
influenced by Klaus Schulze/Tangerine Dream. The name of the record is 
<i>Ajatuslapsi</i> ('Thought Child'). <a 
href="http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esa_Kotilainen">Esa Kotilainen</a> 
has among 
all in 
his collection the only mellotron in Finland. Kotilainen also 
purchased in February 1974 from
Germany the first Minimoog synthesizer in Finland. During this era he 
was
playing gigs on the ferry called Finnhansa which sailed 
between Helsinki and 
Travemünde, and paid for 
the instrument 6.100 Finnish marks: the price of a small car those days. 
The first gig with Kotilainen's Minimoog was creating sound effects for 
the soundtrack of <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spede_Pasanen">Spede 
Pasanen</a>'s film comedy <i>Viu-hah-hah-taja</i> (1974), and 
the first music recording was obviously for the solo album <i>Robson</i> 
of Frank Robson. Kotilainen received with his Minimoog lots of

music and sound effects for TV commercials, and the instrument was used

A sample from the collection released on Fennica Nova label, with Osmo 
Lindeman, <a href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/~jase1/">Jarmo
Sermil&auml;</a>, Herman Rechberger, <a 
href="http://amadeus.siba.fi/~oromanow/">Otto Romanowski</a>, Paavo Heininen 
and Antero Honkanen. <a 
href="http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jukka_Ruohom%C3%A4ki">Jukka 
Ruohom&auml;ki</a> (b. 1947) is one of the Finnish
pioneers on the 
electronic field. He started working in 1970 in the Electronic Music
Studio at Helsinki University's Department of Musicology as an assistant
of Erkki Kurenniemi and he made independent compositions as well as music
for
ballet, theatre, radio plays and films. He also provided synthesizer 
sounds for the albums of such pop musicians as Pekka Streng and 
Hector. In the 1980s Ruohomäki was mainly
involved with computer graphics but recently he has started to compose
music again.
<p>
 Ruohomäki is supposedly the first one to bring the
sophisticated 
VCS3 synthesizer (a.k.a. "Putney", image above) to Finland! This
instrument was then used on 
some seminal Finnish rock albums; among them <i>Herra Mirandos</i>
("Mister 
Mirandos") by <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_%28musician%29">Hector</a>
(where also Kurenniemi's DIMI was heard) and
<i>Being</i> by <a
href="http://wigwam.stc.cx/">Wigwam</a>
-- both released in 1973, thus 
becoming a crucial year in the history of Finnish 'synth pop'!
(Ruohom&auml;ki
probably has only borrowed Putney to Wigwam, or consulted the band
about the instrument's connections, not playing himself there, though the
album credits him as "Putney assistant".) 
<p>
These days
Ruohom&auml;ki teaches electronic music at Oulu Conservatory. He finally 
released his debut album proper called <i>Time Ride</i> (HI-008, Hot 
Igloo) in November 2006.

<br>
<H3>Finally, some Finnish synth pop:</H3>
<b>HOT SOX:</b> Die Arbeit <br>
1981
<p>
<img src="/pic/einagogo.jpg" alt="Einstein A
Go Go" align=right> Futurism was the hot thing of the early 80's. In 1981 
the <i>Uusi Laulu</i> ("New Chant") 
magazine organised its first "narcissistic" futurist disco at Klippan,
Helsinki. Restaurant Kaisaniemi had its Einstein A Go Go club where the male
participants put on a make-up in the men's room, and the singer Markku 
Arokanto was seen
swimming and skiing on the dance floor. In Finland the synthetic
Futurist/New Romantic pop was
simply called "futu", and during the first two or three years of the 80's
it
was the hottest thing among the late-teens/early-20's Helsinki trend
slaves, who traditionally want to be "where it's at".
<p>
This
year the 'Q' label of Discophon 
released the Kraftwerk/Bowie influenced LP <i>Das Kapital</i> by Hot Sox
and the single 'Plastic Twist' (with a cover of 'Purple Haze' as B-side!);
the band
featuring 
also Tauno Railo, the future bass player for Piirpauke <i>et al</i>. The
name Hot
Sox came from the band claiming that "our music is so hot that it will
make your socks heat up!". Despite these claims, the
reception of group was only lukewarm, and they disbanded soon after.

<br>
<br>
<img align="left" alt="Stressi" 
src="/pic/stressi.jpg"><b>STRESSI:</b> Go-Go
"Mod" <br>
1981
<p>
From the same year a sample of a "stylish" futu band's music. Stressi 
(picture left) hailed originally from Imatra, Finland, and were successful 
at the
Finnish Rock Championships, subsequently releasing a couple of singles
('Tatsia', 'Labyrintti', 'Ma Joeur') and an eponymous LP ('81).
The charmingly corny lyrics for the band were
provided by one Jaana Rinne, who later became known for her collaboration
with the retro-pop act Clifters. <a

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>CINEMA:</b> Videoh&auml;&auml;t ('Video Wedding') <br>
1984
<p>
Cinema's roots were in the 70's and a band called Gabriel in Kuortane, 
Finland, from which the apparent prog rock and Genesis influences derived. 
Possibly one of the first production works of T.T. Oksala, one of the most 
proficient rock producers in Finland. A stylish record which, according to 
some rumours, was re-released a couple of years ago by the band's
members...
<p>
<b>ARGON:</b> San Salvador <br>
1981
<p>
<i>Kone Kertoo</i> ('The Machine Tells') was released in the same year and
on 
the same label as the LP by Stressi. Obviously the belief in the future of 
futurism(!) was strong...

<p>
<b>ORGAN:</b> For Next <br>
1982
<p>
Organ, maybe the pivotal Finnish synth act, was the answer of Poko Records
and Mikko Saarela to the futu craze. Organ was the outcome of the creative
minds of Saarela (formerly of the popular Finnish punk band Eppu Normaali)
and the synthetic Argon duo -- who had already released one album, <i>Kone
kertoo</i> -- joined together. Organ's most famous song was 
'K&auml;rp&auml;sten juhla' ("The Feast of
Flies") with
its anti-war theme, mocking the clich&eacute;s of some traditional Finnish
patriotic hymns -- Mikko Saarela's witty, humorous lyrics held some social
concern in them,
dealing with the rights of test animals, helping the third world 
countries, bureaucracy and so on, in the best
punk tradition. There is one Organ album, <i>Nekrofiilis</i> (POKO
P&Auml;LP 33, 1982), and
some
singles; 'Kundi meikkaa' ("A Guy Makes Up") being the best known
of them.

<p>
<b>J.O. MALLANDER:</b> 1962 <br>
1968
<p>
The visual artist, art critic and a member of Sperm, J.O. Mallander (b.
1944), recorded this legendary single, 'Extended
Play' (a.k.a. 'Kekkonen'), which consists of a continous loop from the
public counting of votes of the 1956 Finnish Presidential election, when
<a href="/FAQ/kekkonen/">Urho Kaleva
Kekkonen</a>
was chosen, and was to be the longest-running (1956-81) Finnish 
President: "Kekkonen,
Kekkonen, Kekkonen... Kekkonen, Kekkonen, Kekkonen" (and ad infinitum). A
real rarity and collector's item. 
<p>
Mallander was also instrumental in the Elonkorjaajat ("Harvesters") group
who banded together in 1970 through their affiliation with Helsinki's
Cheap Thrills Gallery, run by J.O. Mallander. Elonkorjaajat sought an
alternative to current art movements, and were interested in various
subjects from Eastern philosophy (Mallander himself turned to Buddhism) to
organic food.

<b>DANNY:</b> Maantielt&auml; taloon ('From The Dirt Road To The
House')<br>
1972
<p>
Danny, a.k.a. Ilkka Lipsanen, has been one of the most popular artists in
Finnish light music since the mid-1960s. This Finnish version of Chicory
Tip's hit single 'Son Of My Father' (produced by Giorgio Moroder) could
be called one the earliest "synthpop" tracks in Finland; a basic
happy-go-lucky pop song spiced with a buzzing analogue synthesizer sound,
which was the latest novelty those days. The memorable intro of this track
became later known as the theme music of Finnish TV's news commentary
show A-Studio. [<a href="http://danny.kolumbus.fi/">Danny Web Site]</a>
<p>
<b>WIGWAM:</b> Bless Your Lucky Stars <br>
1975
<p>
<a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigwam_%28progressive_rock%29">Wigwam</a> 
was a Finnish progressive rock band, who gained some success even
internationally. The centre figure of Wigwam was the British
expatriate Jim Pembroke, who had played and written songs in the 60's
for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_Section">Blues
Section</a>, one
of 
those rare acts representing <a
href="/retro/garage/finland/">Finnish
psychedelia</a>. This synth-heavy track
comes from Wigwam's
1975 album <i>Nuclear Nightclub</i>; the vocals are filtered through some
vocoder-like effects, and without the excessive soloing this
one might well have been from the later era of New Wave/synthpop. It is no
surprise then that <a href="http://www.sci.fi/~romantic/">Kinetic</a> 
(a.k.a. Romantic Vision), a
Finnish neo-synthpop band of the late
1990's, used to play their version of this song as part of their gigs. <a

Wasp vintage synth, these electronic noodlings preceded the
sparse soundscapes of Pan Sonic and Mika Vainio some fifteen years.

<b>JIMI SUM&Eacute;N:</b> The Model <br>
1981
<p>
Internationally probably the best known Finnish synth pop musician was
Jimi Sum&eacute;n from Lappeenranta. Sum&eacute;n started as a
Hendrix-styled
virtuoso
guitarist, but then moved to a totally different kind of musical
territory,
influenced by Bowie and Japan, releasing some solo albums. 'The
Model' is not a cover of the Kraftwerk song, but Sum&eacute;n's
original composition; 'Home Movies' (also '81) by Sum&eacute;n became
known as one of the first Finnish music
videos. Jimi
Sum&eacute;n was then recruited by a well-known British synth band Classix
Nouveaux, and has later on concentrated on a career of record producer for
several Finnish rock acts.

<p>
<b>GENERAL NJASSA AND HIS LOST DIVISION:</b> I'm Young, Beautiful
And Natural <br>
1983 
<p>
General Njassa, a.k.a. Jyrki Jantunen, was (and is) a popular Helsinki 
DJ, best known from the
Radio City and Radio Helsinki stations and TV's Levyraati, the Finnish 
version of Juke Box 
Jury. In 1983 Njassa donated to the unsuspecting world
'I'm Young, Beautiful And Natural', a quite orthodox-sounding
Finnish take on hip hop electro, made popular in the early 80's New York
by
Afrika Bambaataa, Arthur Baker <i>et al</i>. This track appeared on the
compilation
<i>The Art of Breeding</i>, with such artists as Jimi Sum&eacute;n, Hefty
Load
and
Twiggy
Oliver. Lyrically the song is just a piss-take -- a little "lost" gem,
anyway. The track was also published as a 7" in France on Barclay.
A French release was also General Njassa's mini-LP <i>Special</i>, which 
appeared in 1986, with an
extended remix of this song, but despite all efforts, Njassa's recording
career (he also did a brief spell as a vocalist of cultish goth-rock 
band <a href="/early/synth/mustaparaati/">Musta Paraati</a>) was short.

<a name="BELABORIS">
<p>
<b>BELABORIS:</b> Rakkauden j&auml;lkeen ('After Love') <br>
1984
<p>
A synthetic girl band Belaboris was gathered together by Miettinen, a
now-legendary Finnish punk journalist, producer and so on. Miettinen
probably planned a Spice Girls-type of success for his beautiful
proteg&eacute;s,
despite which the career of group was short-lived. Belaboris left behind
them a couple of singles, the cover version of the 60's pop favourite
Carola's 'Rakkauden j&auml;lkeen' probably the best known.
<a
href="/early/synth/#BELABORIS">[Discography

<p>
<b>DINGO:</b> Levoton Tuhkimo ('Restless Cinderella') <br>
1984
<p>
There are also some lesser-known bands of this era, like Geisha, but
Finland never created a great amount of synth pop groups,
which genre remains a minor footnote in the history of Finnish
pop, ever so rock-dominated. "The Golden Age" of futu and Finnish synth
pop lasted maybe until 1984, when the trend started to fade, and a band
from Pori called Dingo -- who were to cause a hysteria among Finnish
teenage girls often compared to Beatlemania -- released their first album,
including the synth-driven single 'Levoton Tuhkimo', which could well be 
called the swansong of Finnish synth pop. <a
href="http://pelu.jns.fi/~dingo/">[Dingo Web Site]</a>
<br>
<br>
<H3>Afterwords:</H3>
<p>	
The dream was not over yet, though: the synthetic experimentations 
were to continue in Finnish pop music.
After this were to come the industrial funk of Jimi Tenor and
His Shamans (before Jimi found easy listening in the early 90's and became
a world star), the synth/EBM groups like <a
href="/early/synth/advancedart/">Advanced
Art</a>
and Neuroactive
and the whole Cyberware label roster; loads of internationally-acclaimed
techno acts and record labels like Pan(a)sonic, Mono Junk and
S&auml;hk&ouml;
Recordings, but more info about them elsewhere on this site.

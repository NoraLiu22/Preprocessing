Ghosted Me" is the result of Joanne's therapist doing just that! Ignoring her calls, refusing to answer the door at the clinic, or speak to her after she'd tracked him down at Enfield crematorium as he scattered his Aunt's ashes. Despite it all, it’s often said that friends give the best therapy so Vogue &amp; Joanne have teamed up to do exactly that (alongside a generous helping of laughter as that too is said to be the best form of therapy). Together they will give 100% unqualified, unsubstantiated but up front and honest advice on the plethora of issues they and many others continue to grapple with.<br/><br/>If you'd like to get in touch, you can send an email to hello@MTGMpod.com<br/><br/>For live shows, merch and more, visit mytherapistghostedme.com<br/><br/>Please review Global's Privacy Policy: https://global.com/legal/privacy-policy/</div></div><div><p class="podcast-show_episodeTitles__2SeXD" data-testid="podcast-show__episodes__title">Episodes</p><div class="style_podcastEpisode__APEZP style_episode__oJHJb style_full__AZeBE" data-testid="episode"><div class="style_episodeArtworkContainer__mXuSe"><button class="style_episodeArtwork__pWlew" data-testid="episode__artwork" aria-pressed="false"><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></div></button><button class="style_unstyled__jdW3p style_dark__iFDAw style_actionButton__2TSQx" aria-label="Play Post Thief, Jedward &amp; How Often Do You Wash? from My Therapist Ghosted Me" aria-pressed="false" data-testid="play-button" title="Play Post Thief, Jedward &amp; How Often Do You Wash? from My Therapist Ghosted Me" style="width:26px;height:26px;position:absolute;bottom:5px;right:5px;cursor:pointer"><span class="style_icon__gsGve"><span class="icon style_icon__VMfKE "><svg fill="" viewBox="0 0 30 32"><use xlink:href="#player-play-b35cfb43--sprite"></use></svg></span></span></button></div><div class="style_episodeText__Ppy1R"><h4 class="style_episodeTextTitle__2VQgE style_episodeTextTitleMultiLine__lVLaX" title="Post Thief, Jedward &amp; How Often Do You Wash?"><a href="/podcasts/episodes/7DriQW8/">Post Thief, Jedward &amp; How Often Do You Wash?</a></h4><div class="style_episodeTextDescription__WjfCe" title="So, how often do you wash?

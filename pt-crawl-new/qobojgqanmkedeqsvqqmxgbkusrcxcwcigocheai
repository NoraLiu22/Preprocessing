We want to acknowledge that this has been an extremely challenging week for Cal Poly Humboldt.&nbsp;We are hurting within our campus community and beyond, and we have much work in front of us to reset, rebuild, and heal. This will take time. We will do this together.</p><p dir="ltr">The unlawful actions that took place this past week stand in contrast to our values and beliefs—and can never happen again. We unequivocally support the rights of students and others to assemble peacefully, to protest, and to have their voices heard.&nbsp;We must also recognize the difference between free speech and unlawful activities that put others and protesters themselves at risk.&nbsp;This is something we simply cannot tolerate. As we call for peace, we must all practice it.</p><p dir="ltr">It is often the case that in extreme challenges communities come together. We have been deeply moved by the hundreds of staff and faculty who went well beyond their standard roles on campus in order to support the extensive needs of our community, and to the many organizations, state agencies, tribal governments, and law enforcement agencies who advised us and rushed to our aid in our time of great need. We are very grateful. This is who we are as a community—one that has a shared commitment and dedication to those we serve: our students.</p><p dir="ltr">As we get to the difficult work of reckoning with what has happened, we must also look to the future. We have already begun assessing the state of the&nbsp;campus and working to clean up the buildings and grounds. The campus will certainly remain closed through the end of the semester, likely much longer. Modified plans are being made for Commencement ceremonies at off-campus locations. We will continue to share updates, and more information will be available in the coming days.</p><p dir="ltr">We want to encourage you all to care for yourselves and others during this time—and to continue to use intellect and reason to challenge the status quo and make the world a better place. Our hope is that you are able to engage in meaningful dialogue with respect, empathy, and humanity. Lastly, let us use this opportunity to remind ourselves, our community and beyond of our shared vision at Cal Poly Humboldt: to be a campus for those who seek&nbsp;<em>above all else&nbsp;</em>to improve the global human condition and our relationship with the environment.</p><p dir="ltr">We know we will get there—together.</p><p dir="ltr">Sincerely,</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tom Jackson, Jr.</strong><br>President</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Jenn Capps</strong><br>Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sherie Gordon</strong><br>Vice President for Administrative Affairs</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Chrissy Holliday</strong><br>Vice President for Enrollment Management &amp; Student Success</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Frank Whitlatch</strong><br>Vice President for University Advancement</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mark Johnson</strong><br>Chief of Staff</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrienne Colegrove-Raymond</strong><br>Special Assistant for Tribal Relations &amp; Community Engagement</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nick Pettit</strong><br>Executive Director of Intercollegiate Athletics &amp; Campus Recreation</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connie Stewart</strong><br>Executive Director of Initiatives&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="views-row"><div class="emergency-landing"><div class="container"><div data-history-node-id="24264" class="emergency-alert-node medium yellow"><div class=""><div class="d-md-flex"><div class="icon"><span class="ion-alert-circled"></span></div><div class="notification-text"><h2><span>Update on Cal Poly Humboldt Commencement Ceremonies</span></h2><div ><span class="time">May 1, 2024 - 1:38pm</span><div><p dir="ltr">Cal Poly Humboldt is committed to hosting Commencement ceremonies so that graduates and their families and friends can celebrate this important milestone.

About 35 individuals were arrested, without incident. There were no injuries.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The operation was carried out by Unified Command, which is made up of law enforcement personnel from throughout the State of California under the leadership of Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal and University Police Department Chief Peter Cress.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time the operation was initiated, on-campus residents were advised by University text and emails to shelter in place. Others were directed to stay away from campus, which was already under a hard closure.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The operation’s objective was to establish control of the site; protect the rights, safety, and health of students and employees; eliminate the threat of violence and criminal behavior; and reestablish control of buildings and other property.</p><p dir="ltr">Those arrested faced a range of different charges depending on individual circumstances including unlawful assembly, vandalism, conspiracy, assault of police officers, and others. In addition, students could face discipline for conduct violations while any University employees arrested could face disciplinary action.</p><p dir="ltr">The University had made repeated efforts over the last week to resolve the situation. This morning’s enforcement action was determined to be necessary to restore order and to address the lawlessness and dangerous conditions that had developed.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">What was occurring was not free expression or a protest. It was criminal activity, and there were serious concerns it would spread even further on campus.</p><p dir="ltr">The hard closure of the campus remains in place through May 10, and law enforcement is continuing to monitor the situation. For employees, your supervisor will contact you if you are authorized to be on campus.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal</strong></p><p dir="ltr">“The law enforcement action at Cal Poly Humboldt was essential to reestablishing order on campus. When someone commits a crime and infringes on the rights of others, it becomes necessary for law enforcement to step in. I'm grateful to the agencies and officers who contributed to bringing safety back to our campus. I understand the widespread frustration caused by the campus closure, threatening behavior, and lawlessness we've witnessed over the past week. By restoring order, we've sent a clear message that the criminal and dangerous activities we experienced were not peaceful protests, but outright criminal behavior, which is unacceptable.”</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>University Police Department Chief Peter Cress</strong></p><p dir="ltr">“The University Police Department is deeply grateful to the local and statewide agencies that lent support to our campus during this event. The support was critical in restoring an environment on campus where learning and work occur safely. UPD remains committed to a learning environment where everyone can be heard without breaking the law.”</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tom Jackson Jr., Cal Poly Humboldt President</strong></p><p dir="ltr">“This is a difficult day, it breaks my heart to see it, and truly nobody wanted to see things come to this. We’ve all watched this with great concern, and always with the sincere hope that it would be resolved peacefully. Unfortunately, serious criminal activity that crossed the line well beyond the level of a protest had put the campus at ongoing risk. I commend the law enforcement team for their effort in resolving this very dangerous situation, and I’m incredibly grateful for the many agencies who advised us and who came to our aid in our time of need. I’m also very grateful for our many staff members who performed far and above their normal duties to help us protect the campus and maintain operations. Our focus for the entire time has been on doing all we could do to protect the safety of all involved, and we were very patient and very disciplined with that.”</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="views-row"><div class="emergency-landing"><div class="container"><div data-history-node-id="24260" class="emergency-alert-node medium red"><div class=""><div class="d-md-flex"><div class="icon"><span class="ion-alert-circled"></span></div><div class="notification-text"><h2><span>Campus Residents Can Access Limited Dining; Hard Closure Remains.</span></h2><div ><span class="time">April 30, 2024 - 6:50am</span><div><p dir="ltr">The shelter in place advisory has been lifted for residents living on campus.</p><p dir="ltr">However, it is important that residents stay vigilant.

The safety and security of our campus community—our students, faculty, and staff—are at the forefront of every decision we are making. We know that many of you, regardless of whether or not you support the protest itself, are upset about the current state of affairs and the disruption it has caused in your student experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Please know that Cal Poly Humboldt’s leadership takes seriously our responsibility to our campus community, particularly our students, during this difficult time. This is especially true for those of us who provide leadership to areas directly responsible for our students’ success and wellbeing.</p><p dir="ltr">Police were called on April 22 to remove protesters from Siemens Hall because the situation was becoming increasingly dangerous. The protestors had blocked exits and other spaces, creating safety hazards, both for themselves and others who were working and attending class in the building at that time. Since Monday, hateful graffiti has been painted on campus buildings and there has been other damage throughout campus, all of which is certainly well outside the bounds of our expectations for student behavior.&nbsp;<strong>The University supports free speech, however, there are many options to express those views that don't put others in danger, destroy property, and completely disrupt campus.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">While Siemens Hall and Nelson Hall East are most directly impacted, individuals have attempted to break into other spaces across campus. The occupied buildings create health and safety issues that cannot be ignored. We are hearing from families and students with various perspectives, including those who are asking us to end this immediately to allow students to return to the important work of learning. We are also hearing from those of you who feel unsafe because of this protest, not because of the law enforcement presence, but because of the actions of the protesters. So please know that the impacts of this are widely varied within our campus community, and we are balancing our response as best we can in recognition of that reality.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are we working to end the disruption to campus?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Absolutely. Since the occupation of Siemens Hall began Monday, efforts have been underway to engage with protesters, while ensuring the safety and security of those who are choosing to instead focus on finishing out the semester. Much of that work has been behind the scenes and has included outreach at various times from both of us, as well as other campus and academic leaders, beginning Monday evening and continuing to current time.</p><p dir="ltr">On our part, that means encouraging them to cease this disruption within a space that is essential to our academic purpose.&nbsp;<strong>Friday, we offered to students who were in the buildings, and included this in direct messaging to all students who received notices of conduct proceedings and interim suspensions, a chance for a check-out process that ensured their safe passage from the occupied buildings at this time, but did not eliminate the conduct and legal repercussions of the recent activity</strong>. Saturday’s hard closure of campus is our next step towards restored normalcy. This is in no way an exhaustive list of all that has been done to bring this to a close, but we wanted to share some of it with you, and assure you that Cal Poly Humboldt’s primary focus is resolving this in a manner that prioritizes the health, safety, and educational success of our students.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What about Commencement?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This time is particularly difficult for our seniors, who are looking forward to graduating on May 11 and, in many cases, did not have the joy of an in-person high school graduation due to COVID. As the situation continues to evolve, we do not yet know how Commencement will look at Cal Poly Humboldt. However, our campus leadership understands the importance of Commencement to all of you and your families, and we are doing everything in our power to ensure you have the opportunity to walk across a stage and hear your family and friends cheer as you receive your diploma. Expect more communication about Commencement in the coming days.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What if I need support dealing with this disruption?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Any student who needs additional support navigating the current situation is encouraged to contact the Dean of Students office by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dos@humboldt.edu">dos@humboldt.edu</a>. Members of that team can provide assistance in connecting you with resources needed for your online classes, or connecting with faculty about special accommodations.</p><p dir="ltr">If you have concerns about your grades or progress in your courses, please reach out to your faculty members via email and also check Canvas, as many faculty members are posting updates and announcements that you will find helpful there.</p><p dir="ltr">Student Health &amp; Wellbeing Services is open for telehealth visits and looking forward to continuing to support our students. Please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:health@humboldt.edu">health@humboldt.edu</a> for medical appointments or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:humboldtcaps@humboldt.edu">humboldtcaps@humboldt.edu</a> for counseling appointments.

Even in the midst of this challenging period for our community, we remain firmly rooted in our University’s purpose:&nbsp;to provide the highest quality and affordable college education built on the contributions of diverse students, staff, and faculty who are committed to a just and sustainable world.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">We write today in this spirit, while also reasserting our responsibility for civil discourse and fact-based debate. In particular, we would like to provide context and feedback to the stated demands of the protesters. They have asked the campus to:</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Disclose all holdings and collaborations with Israel.&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It is important to highlight that Cal Poly Humboldt is among the higher education leaders in environmentally and socially responsible investing. In 2014, with extensive student involvement, an investment strategy focused on reducing investments in the fossil fuel industry and in tracking investments in socially concerning sectors was adopted. Last year, again with student involvement and assistance, a new policy focused on Environmentally &amp; Socially Responsible (ESR) investing was adopted. This policy takes a “positive investment” approach to select funds with strong environmental, social, and governance practices, and again puts Humboldt at the leading edge of responsible investing within higher education.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The investments in the University’s endowment does not include any&nbsp;<strong>direct investment</strong> in defense companies or any securities issued by Israeli companies or organizations, or to defense firms. In fact, because of the relatively small size of the endowment, the investment strategy does&nbsp;<strong>not include</strong> direct investment in any specific companies or securities. Instead, the portion of the investment in securities is in mutual funds, which are bundles of many securities that reflect the portfolios of numerous different investment managers.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">So any holdings of the securities in question would represent&nbsp;<strong>indirect investment</strong>. Our estimates put the potential&nbsp;<strong>indirect investment</strong> in the areas that are asked about at less than 1%<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of the investment portfolio of more than $51 million. Of this, our estimate of potential defense investment is less than 0.5% of the entire portfolio, though that can fluctuate over time. This estimate is probably high as these companies do not produce weaponry but rather components of various industrial products (like wind turbines and aviation parts). The portion of the indirect investment in Israeli companies or organizations is likewise less than 0.5%, and can fluctuate over time. These securities, which again are bundled in different mutual funds, are software companies and banks, and there is also less than 0.1% in bonds. Any of these holdings could be sold by the fund manager at any time.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">We would welcome the opportunity to discuss the investment policies in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Cut all ties with Israeli universities.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Cal Poly Humboldt has a commitment to global engagement. While we have no current ties with Israeli Universities, we are open to connecting with universities across the world in an effort to build connections and expand understanding.

<div class="Object3777"><span class="textstyle0">Frequently Asked Questions<br>
<br>
WHY SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR THE &#34;RIGHTS&#34; OF SOME MILLIONAIRES ARTISTS AND THE MULTINATIONALS WITH THE HUGE PROFITS?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Our aim is the protection of hundreds of thousands of artists worldwide. The majority of these artists are ordinary, hard working professionals. Some of them of 
course are famous and earn a lot of money. Respectively, we have a membership comprising more than 1400 record companies, the majority of which are small 
independent companies. It is natural, each trade association to have as members both large and small size companies.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IS IT TRUE THAT INDEPENDENT COMPANIES HAVE NO SAYING AND VOTE IN IFPI?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Decisions in IFPI are taken by the majority with participation of all members. After all, the IFPI's aims are common for both large and small companies.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IFPI CHASES PIRATES TO ELIMINATE COMPETITION?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">It is not competition. It is theft.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">WHO ACTUALLY HOLDS THE COPYRIGHT IN A PIECE OF MUSIC?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">The person who wrote the tune and the lyrics and/or their publishers own authors' rights; the artist that performs that music has rights to his/her performance; 
and a record company has rights to its recordings.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">HOW DO I KNOW IF THERE IS COPYRIGHT ON A PARTICULAR PIECE OF MUSIC?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">All music and recordings of music are copyrighted and also subject to protections of 'related rights' as of the date they are created or published, as the case may 
be. In Europe authors and music publishers retain copyright for 70 years after the death of the author, and performers and producers enjoy protection for 50 years 
after the recording was first communicated to the public.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">HOW DO I KNOW IF WHAT I'M DOING IS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Under copyright (and related rights) in more than 150 countries it is not legal to copy, adapt, translate, perform, or broadcast a protected work or recording, or 
put it on the Internet, unless a specific exception exists in the copyright law of your country, or unless you have permission from all of the relevant owners of 
rights.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IS IT ILLEGAL FOR ME TO COPY AND DISTRIBUTE MUSIC EVEN IF I'M NOT MAKING MONEY OUT OF IT?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">The question of whether you are doing copying for profit may affect what penalties apply, but does not determine whether you are in breach of copyright.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">ISN'T IT LEGAL TO MAKE COPIES FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">The laws of some countries have limited exceptions to the rights owners' rights to control copying, which allow copying for your own private use. These exceptions 
do not apply, however, if you make available or transmit copyright material over the internet, distribute copies, or (in most countries) copy from illegal sources.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IF I HAVE BOUGHT A LEGITIMATE CD, CAN'T I DO WHAT I LIKE WITH THE MUSIC ON IT?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">In buying a legitimate CD you have paid for the right to own the physical disc, to play it privately as often as you like. You have not bought the right to make copies 
or distribute copies, whether on CD-R or over the Internet.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">SO WHAT IF I BREAK THE LAW - WHAT CAN ANYONE DO ABOUT IT?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Where people persistently make music available on the Internet in breach of copyright laws, they are in effect engaged in copyright theft, and that exposes them to 
the risk of legal action by the copyright holders.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IS THERE A COPYRIGHT ON ALL MUSIC, INCLUDING MUSIC THAT MAY NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE COMMERCIALLY?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Generally, yes. While some old recordings may have fallen into the public domain, the vast bulk of those that appear on the Internet are still under copyright 
protection.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">WHAT IF I JUST WANT TO DOWNLOAD A FEW SONGS TO SEE IF IT'S WORTH BUYING THE ALBUM?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">That's fine if you're allowed to do so by the holder of the rights. Some legitimate sites let you listen to clips from particular songs, or sample a limited download of 
tracks from their service, as a 'taster' of the music.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">MATERIAL OVER THE INTERNET IF IT IS MARKED WITH 'DELETE WITHIN 24 HOURS', 'FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES', OR A SIMILAR DISCLAIMER?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">No, these disclaimers are invalid unless authorised by the right holder. The law looks to the reality of what is happening - unauthorised transmission and 
reproduction of somebody else's music.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE HOW MUCH I'M UPLOADING?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">You are likely to be breaking the law whether you are uploading one copyrighted song or thousands.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IS ALL FILE-SHARING ILLEGAL?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Unauthorised peer-to-peer 'file sharing' is copyright infringement. For the time being the vast majority of all peer-to-peer file-sharing is unauthorised, since it is 
not licensed by copyright holders, and is therefore illegal.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">WHAT IF I DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM A SITE FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRY THAN THE ONE I'M IN, WHERE THE LAW MIGHT BE DIFFERENT?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Internet activities of this sort typically involve acts of copying, transmission, or distribution in both countries, so both countries' laws would apply.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">THE SOUL OF INTERNET IS THE FREE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION AND IDEAS. WHY IS THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TRYING TO CONTROL IT AND BOUND 
IT?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Protected content, though distributed in means of digital information, does not constitute information but a product with moral and commercial value. Though 
intangible has an owner and although it owes its existence to a creative idea of its creator, it does not constitute idea. Imposing legal and commercial regulations 
to its distribution cannot be associated with any limitations to free distribution of ideas and information, since it cannot be associated with these, despite the fact 
that sometimes a song can be source of information or the sparkle for the creation of an idea. We can keep on playing with words forever, but the substance 
remains: music industry does not limit the internet but tries to protect the rights of thousands of people in it.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FIGHTS THE INTERNET BECAUSE IT FEARS NEW TECHNOLOGIES?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">The music industry is not afraid of the internet. On the contrary invests in new technologies of digital distribution of music that lead to lower cost of acquiring 
songs. Users already have the capability through more than 500 legal services (<a href="http://www.pro-music.org">www.pro-music.org</a>) to access music in whatever way and time they want, with 
respect to those that have contributed to the creation and production of this music.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IS BUYING MUSIC THROUGH INTERNET LEGAL?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Of course, through the proper services. Today, through <a href="http://www.pro-music.org">www.pro-music.org</a> consumers in more than 100 countries worldwide can choose between 26 million 
tracks through more than 500 different services. They have unlimited choices of accessing music: download, subscription and ad-supported, through numerous 
devices and software.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="textstyle0">IF INTERNET BRINGS ARTISTS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THEIR AUDIENCE, MAYBE THE RECORD COMPANIES ARE UNNECESSARY?<br>
</span><span class="textstyle1">Experience in talent development, promotion of artists and offering to the audience the kind of music they want is equally valuable in the digital environment as in 
the physical one. In any case, the choice of free or otherwise alternative distribution of an artist's work to the public remains a prerogative of the artist and not a 
choice of the public.<br>

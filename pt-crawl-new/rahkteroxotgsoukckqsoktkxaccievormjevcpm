             <h3><a href="/datasets/walk-score-phila-only/">Walk Score (Phila. only)</a></h3>
             <p>An online application, which enables users to view calculated walkability ranks and related neighborhood metrics, such as proximity of nearby businesses, service providers, and recreational/outdoor spaces. Users can select geographic parameters (neighborhood names), or search for specific locations (addresses), to access mobility data, which is also visualized on a heat map tool with marked features. In addition to walkability, the application also gauges biking and transit scores, which measure the convenience/proximity to bikability and public transit opportunities. Users can also access walking, biking, and transit score through an API.  More information about the Walk Score is available <a href="https://www.redfin.com/how-walk-score-works">through Redfin</a>.</p>

After a couple seasons of profiling recruits at East Mississippi Community College, which has won several NJCAA national titles, the reality series shifted its focus to Independence Community College. The Kansas school doesn't have the same type of gridiron pedigree as EMCC — it's trying to rebound from more than a decade of losses — but the players are dealing with many of the same challenges that the EMCC squad faced, both on and off the field. After premiering in 2016, the final season took place at Laney College in Oakland, California and premiered in 2020.</p></div></div><div class="mb-4"><div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 relative overflow-hidden"><iframe loading="lazy" src="" allowfullscreen="" frameBorder="0" class="h-full w-full object-cover object-center absolute top-0 left-o"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="small-body my-4 py-4"><div class="pb-2"><h3>Last Chance U: Basketball</h3><h4>GQ Studios</h4><div class="rich-text"><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(45,46,47);">Last Chance U is a critically acclaimed, Emmy-winning American documentary streaming television series that focuses on college sports.

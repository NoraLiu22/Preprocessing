<p>Under communism, the Belorussian SSR had net industrial and
        agricultural export surpluses within the Soviet Union until 1990, thanks
        to the relatively high productivity of the Belarusian labor force.
        Belarus shipped trucks, tractors, tractor trailers, elevators, lathes,
        bearings, electric motors, computer equipment, synthetic yarns and
        fibers, tires, linoleum, flax, textiles, carpets, potatoes, meat, dairy
        products, eggs, flour, and various consumer goods to the other
        republics.
        <p>Apart from Belarus's energy situation, little had changed in the
        direction of independent Belarus's trade from its previous centralized
        planning system. In 1994 Belarus's major trading partners were still
        former Soviet republics (mainly Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova,
        Lithuania, and Latvia), which accounted for 93 percent of its exports.
        Exports to these countries totaled approximately US$2.5 billion, a
        decrease of 36 percent by volume over the previous year. Exports
        included gasoline (198,000 tons), diesel fuel (147,000 tons), meat and
        meat products (53,000 tons), milk and milk products (256,000 tons),
        refrigerators, tractors, and trucks. Belarus had a trade deficit with
        CIS countries amounting to US$614 million in 1994.
        <p>Belarus's main non-CIS trading partners in 1994 were Germany (21
        percent of non-CIS trade), Poland (9 percent), the United States (7
        percent), Switzerland (4 percent), Austria (4 percent), Italy (3
        percent), the Netherlands (3 percent), Hungary (3 percent), China (3
        percent), Brazil (3 percent), Britain (2 percent), and Lithuania (2
        percent). Exports to non-CIS countries consisted mainly of energy
        products and heavy machinery. Belarus had a trade surplus of US$434
        million with non-CIS countries in 1994.
        <p>After independence and continuing into 1995, Belarus's trade
        deteriorated because import prices for energy and for raw materials
        began to rise to world market levels, and demand for the country's
        exports by its major trading partners (especially Ukraine and Russia)
        declined. Payment problems within the former Soviet Union made the
        situation worse, and limited access to foreign financing caused the
        domestic economy to decline by further decreasing the volume of trade.
        <p>Restrictions on export quantities, imposed by the new government to
        prevent low-cost Belarusian goods from being sold abroad in large
        quantities to the detriment of the Belarusian consumer, were relaxed in
        March 1994, and only certain goods continued to be restricted: oil and
        gas, electricity, fertilizers, timber and wood products, nonferrous
        metals, cereals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and leather. Exports of
        precious metals and gems had to be licensed by the State Committee on
        Precious Metals and Precious Stones, and an export ban applied to
        certain medicinal herbs, animals, and some artworks and antiques. An
        agreement between Belarus and the EU set export quotas on textiles.
        <p>As part of Belarus's pursuit of economic and monetary integration
        with Russia, interstate trade regulations and taxation were harmonized
        with those of Russia, and most export and import fees on mutual trade
        with Russia were abolished by June 1, 1994. In May 1995, Belarus and
        Russia eliminated customs checkpoints along their joint border.</p>

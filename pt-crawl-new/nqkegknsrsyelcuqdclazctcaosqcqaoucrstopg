Working closely grooming and styling for country music heavy-hitters Dierks Bentley, Jason Aldean, Riley Green and Jordan Davis, as well as media giants CMT, Billboard and more, Henderson has established herself as a go-to resource within the industry. Henderson began offering an intimate insight into her work via her highly successful lifestyle blog, “Velvet’s Edge,” which began as a place her audience could find tips on fashion, travel, fitness, health and more. As Henderson evolved, so her content has expanded. “People aren’t one dimensional, even though sometimes we try to live that way,” she says. With an ever-growing demand from her invested online followers, Henderson has now launched an extension of her blog in the form of a podcast of the same name via iHeartMedia. She uses her expertise and speaks from a decade long journey in 12-step recovery, intensive experiential therapy and other holistic modalities combined with her successful career as a tastemaker, artist and stylist to explore the deeper inner working of humans, celebrities and healers alike. The Velvet’s Edge Podcast normalizes hard conversations, “taboo” topics and people’s ever evolving journeys, while promoting healing, inner peace and the road to a happy and fulfilling life experience. The podcast is built on Henderson’s motto, “Everyone has a little Velvet and a little Edge, I’m just here to help people feel comfortable with that and hopefully get on the path to living their best life.” New episodes are released every Wednesday and Friday, with Henderson leading the charge on Wednesday's on 'the Velvet' side of things- interviewing experts, celebrities and spiritual leaders in line with each monthly topic. She is joined on Friday's for 'the Edge' by co-host and friend, Chip Dorsch, to explore the lighter side of the things, laugh and connect with listeners!","editorialContentQuery":[],"hostIds":[],"id":29105879,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzk1YWU4YThhLWM3ZDgtNGIzMi04ZTA4LWFlM2MwMDIxZjFlMy83YzM4OTgyNi0wNTAwLTQwZDctOWZkMS1hZTNjMDAyMWYxZjYvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTY2Mzc3MDM4MCZzaXplPUxhcmdl","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1706730984,"seedId":29105879,"seedShowId":29105879,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"834-velvets-edge-with-kelly-he","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Velvet's Edge with Kelly Henderson","url":"/podcast/834-velvets-edge-with-kelly-he-29105879/","episodeIds":[]},"29213961":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Jon Stewart and The Daily Show News Team cover today's biggest headlines.

Renowned sportswriter and author Jack McCallum was there with the guys and brings us the thrilling memories, personal stories, and sometimes surprising anecdotes of the twelve historic players. Season 2 joining Jack McCallum with J.A.

They talk to players and coaches including Carmelo Anthony, Phil Jackson, Jason Kidd, Chris Bosh, Robert Horry, Jerry Colangelo, Deron Williams, Mike Krzyzewski and more, bringing you an insider's study in athletic challenge, transformation, and ultimate victory.

He was writing a teenage symphony to God. That album, Smile, was never finished. Instead, Brian slowly unraveled, as the pressure to make something profound weighed heavy on him. He worried that he wasn’t good enough. He worried that he was a failure in the eyes of the record company, his band, his peers, and his own father. He thought his house was bugged. He thought the music he was making conjured some strange voodoo that had a disastrous impact on the real world. He became paranoid. He self-medicated with amphetamines, hash, and LSD. He held meetings in his swimming pool. He imagined people who weren’t there. And eventually, in 1967, he went off the proverbial deep end. Did the real Brian Wilson ever resurface? Part true crime, part historical fiction, part spoken word lo-fi beat noir brought to you by Jake Brennan, and featuring the fictionalized voice Brian Wilson, BLOOD ON THE TRACKS sounds like nothing you’ve heard before.

But every national front-page headline the next morning featured the story of one of the biggest heists in history. At the center of it all - a hustler named “Chicken Man”. Fans arrived in Rolls Royces delivered from New York City. Adorned in vibrant fur coats and dripping with diamonds, they grabbed engraved invitations then strutted into the arena. The sold-out crowd stood and cheered when the first-round bell rang, minus two empty seats. After the fight, many celebrating the victory, including top black mafia leaders, headed to Chicken Man’s house with invitation in hand. Instead of women and wine greeting them at the front door, each walked into the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun. On FIGHT NIGHT, J.D. Hudson, one of the first black detectives in Atlanta’s desegregated police force helped lead Muhammed Ali into the ring. The next day, he was assigned to the robbery by the chief of police. When asked by a journalist years later, “When did the investigation end?” J.D. summed it up perfectly, “When everybody was dead.”","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":72737532,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxL2QxYzQyNWJhLWQ4MjktNGRjYy1hYjg2LWFlMzIwMDZjZDE0YS9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg1NjQzNTc3JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1706727158,"seedId":72737532,"seedShowId":72737532,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1119-fight-night","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Fight Night","url":"/podcast/1119-fight-night-72737532/","episodeIds":[]},"72777210":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Love Country?

Maya is no stranger to change. “My whole childhood revolved around the violin, but that changed in a moment when I injured my hand playing a single note,” says Shankar, who was studying under Itzhak Perlman at the Juilliard School at the time. “I was forced to try and figure out who I was, and who I could be, without the violin.\" Maya soon discovered a new path in the field of cognitive science, where she earned her PhD as a Rhodes Scholar studying how and why we change. Her insights into human behavior ultimately led her to create A Slight Change of Plans—Apple Podcasts’ Best Show of the Year in 2021. You’ll hear intimate conversations with people like Tiffany Haddish, Kacey Musgraves, and Riz Ahmed, as well as real-life inspirations, like John Elder Robison, who undergoes experimental brain stimulation to deepen his emotional intelligence, Daryl Davis, a Black jazz musician who inspires hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan, and Shankar herself, who had her own “slight change of plans” earlier this year. The show also explores the science of change with experts like Adam Grant and Angela Duckworth. \"What I love most about this show is that the content is evergreen,\" says Shankar. \"You can listen to episodes in any order and at any time.\"","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":82213198,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzBmMTI4M2UyLTgwZmUtNDYwYi1iMTU3LWFlMzkwMDM3NWQzOC9kNTQ4ZjJjMS1kNTIyLTRhYTgtOWZmMy1hZTM5MDAzNzVkNDEvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTY0NDU0OTY5NSZzaXplPUxhcmdl","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706645753,"seedId":82213198,"seedShowId":82213198,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1297-a-slight-change-of-plans","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"A Slight Change of Plans","url":"/podcast/1297-a-slight-change-of-plans-82213198/","episodeIds":[]},"82262169":{"customLinks":[],"description":"In every ballet studio, there is a wall of mirrors.

But when Hargrove reached out to warn local police, he was ignored -- until Afrikka Hardy was murdered, and those cold cases suddenly didn’t look so cold. Algorithm follows the investigation into Afrikka’s murder, exposing the warnings that police ignored, and uncovering more than anyone expected -- that a serial killer was strangling women in Gary, Indiana could've been stopped.

Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home. On River Cafe Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers. Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt, and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant. You are invited to take a seat at this intimate table and join the conversation.

From Panama to Puerto Rico, from Boston to Medellin, from Mexico to Brazil. There has always been someone willing to raise their hand and take the lead. As a result, reggaeton evolved as a merger of Pan-American musical influences, which in turn helped explode its appeal.

During one awful week in February 1942 he viciously attacks women night after night. But the victims of the so-called Blackout Ripper are now all but forgotten. \nIn this season of Bad Women, historian Hallie Rubenhold and criminologist Alice Fiennes share new details from the archives to tell the extraordinary and moving stories of the women who died and why their deaths were swept from view. \nAnd don't miss season one of Bad Women about a cold case like no other. In the fall of 1888, five women were brutally murdered in the slums of London. But everything you think you know about Jack the Ripper and those murdered women is wrong. Hallie reconstructs the lives of the five victims - revealing the appalling treatment they faced as women in the 1880s, and completely overturning the accepted Ripper story.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":87627989,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxL2FiZGNiZTFjLTM1ZjAtNDlmZi04YTJhLWFlMzkwMDM3NjFhMi84YWE4MWI1Mi1kYzc2LTRlN2MtODBkNi1hZTM5MDAzNzYxYWIvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTY2NDIwNTI3MSZzaXplPUxhcmdl","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706714368,"seedId":87627989,"seedShowId":87627989,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1297-bad-women-the-blackout-ri","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Bad Women: The Blackout Ripper","url":"/podcast/1297-bad-women-the-blackout-ri-87627989/","episodeIds":[]},"87854732":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Money Moves is an in-depth podcast hosted by Tanya Sam and dedicated to empowering black and brown communities to end the wealth gap by providing financial planning tips with guests sharing their successes and how they balance the money moves behind their names and businesses.

It tells the story of Naasón Joaquín García, a self-proclaimed apostle, who is currently behind bars after pleading guilty in June 2022 of sexually abusing girls from his congregation. Naasón is currently serving a nearly 17-year sentence, but maintains his innocence.\nHost and investigative journalist Roberta Garza explores Naasón's control over a multitude of devotees, some of whom now describe their experiences in the church as \"pure evil.\" In this true-crime series, survivors share stories about this powerful religious leader and the alleged sexual abuse that followed, many relating to minors.\nSEASON 1:\nTwo decades ago on a calm, dark Miami night, a nun was stabbed nearly 100 times on the grounds of a prestigious private academy and monastery, by student Mykhaylo Kofel. As investigators started asking questions around this Byzantine Catholic School and the gruesome murder, they found more than just her killer. In a search for answers that stretches into some of the most remote villages of Eastern Europe, they uncovered allegations of sexual abuse, secret letters to the Vatican and other mysteries of faith. Sacred Scandal unravels the fuller picture that came to light in the wake of this crime. Led by a former student, told by those who lived through the aftermath, and Kofel himself, the show pieces together a complicated narrative that, twenty years later, still has those closest to it questioning what they truly believe… including a man who’s spent half his life in prison for the crime: “It’s so unbelievable. It definitely wasn’t me. I’m not a killer. No way.

Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsports to more than one billion fans worldwide, with death-defying races, state-of-the-art machinery, exotic locales, and billions of dollars at stake. But to many Americans who follow only the Big Four sports, it’s still a fairly new sport that offers more questions than answers. But with now three races in the USA - Miami, Austin and Vegas - Formula 1 is growing in popularity and increasingly being discussed in spaces outside of motorsports. In season One, Daily Show correspondent Michael Kosta, got the dirt on teams, their history, and their drivers, from how they came up through the sport to the messy problems they’ve had in recent seasons. In Season Two, he's coming back to the table with more questions, and new co-host, Toni Cowan-Brown, will help Michael figure out what type of fan he is. Unlike other sports, Formula 1 offers a wide range of interesting topics - the gossip, the fashion, the logistics, the technology, the business... you get the point. New episodes of \"Choosing Sides: F1\" drop every Tuesday, beginning March 12th but why not binge Season One with Michael Kosta and Lily Herman in the meantime.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":98407484,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzA1NThhMDM2LWJiYTQtNDFhMi1iYjMxLWFlOWYwMTU4MDEwYS9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg0OTUzMDY5JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1709744833,"seedId":98407484,"seedShowId":98407484,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-choosing-sides-f1","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Choosing Sides: F1","url":"/podcast/1119-choosing-sides-f1-98407484/","episodeIds":[]},"98407485":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Back in 2019, sisters Rasha Pecoraro and Yvette Gentile revealed the true story of their dark family history in the hit podcast Root of Evil. \nNow, Pecoraro and Gentile are back with Facing Evil, a new weekly true crime show which focuses on different but equally resonant stories.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":98407485,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzIxNjdhYzczLWM4MWYtNDNiYS1hNWMzLWFlOTgwMTRmMGZjNC9kOTBjZmRmYi1iYjg2LTQxZGQtOTQ5OC1hZTk4MDE0ZjU4MWUvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTY4NDc4NjQzMCZzaXplPUxhcmdl","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706725619,"seedId":98407485,"seedShowId":98407485,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-facing-evil","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Facing Evil","url":"/podcast/1119-facing-evil-98407485/","episodeIds":[]},"98589488":{"customLinks":[],"description":"We're sending you to 1993 when TGIF reigned supreme and “Boy Meets World” first premiered.

It follows the true story of three courageous women, known as the Mirabal sisters, who changed the world. Their lifelong activism in the Dominican Republic and state-orchestrated assassination ignited outrage that led to the downfall of one of the most brutal and enduring dictators of the 20th Century, Rafael Trujillo (aka El Jefe). This series takes us back to a period when the Mirabal Sisters inspired an entire nation to emancipate themselves from a tyrannical regime that lasted for more than 30 years. While the martyrdom of the Mirabal Sisters is the stuff of legend in the DR, Sisters of the Underground brings these hidden figures to life for a global audience in a vivid, immersive, audio drama.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":101186016,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzZjN2YyZjllLTU4NmItNDFiOS1hYzJmLWFlZDcwMTQwMTk0Ni9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg0OTU5MjkzJnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1707099013,"seedId":101186016,"seedShowId":101186016,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-sisters-of-the-undergroun","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Sisters of the Underground","url":"/podcast/1119-sisters-of-the-undergroun-101186016/","episodeIds":[]},"101274258":{"customLinks":[],"description":"A hundred and fifty years ago, the Osage Nation bought a stretch of prairie the size of Delaware, in what's now Oklahoma.

Every episode will reveal something about the movie you didn’t know, feature interviews with the biggest actors, directors, writers and producers behind them, and tap into the history of Latinos in film.\n\nS1: When Edward James Olmos set out on his directorial debut, American Me, he wanted to accomplish two things: to represent Chicano culture on the big screen and to save part of his community from gang violence. But when people were allegedly murdered because of their participation in the film and Olmos himself was allegedly extorted by the real life Mexican Mafia, it exposed the unintended risks of trying to represent someone with an agenda in mind, even a well-meaning one. On the 30th anniversary of the cult classic, host Alex Fumero and producer Nigel Duara delve into the true story of American Me and the legacy the controversial film left behind.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":101826784,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzUxNmI2NjZiLWRlNDEtNGQyZi04M2Y4LWFmMDEwMTI5MmM3OS9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNzEyNzU2MTc0JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1713374965,"seedId":101826784,"seedShowId":101826784,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1119-more-than-a-movie","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"More Than a Movie","url":"/podcast/1119-more-than-a-movie-101826784/","episodeIds":[]},"101982283":{"customLinks":[],"description":"A rare and insightful deep dive into the musical world of The Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan; with a keen focus on the inspiration behind the singer’s most iconic work and his newest, a three-act rock opera album.","editorialContentQuery":[],"hostIds":[],"id":101982283,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzM3YjEwMGEyLWJiNGUtNGU5My1hMzA4LWFmMGEwMGRkYzNlYy9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg4NjU1MjgxJnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706809314,"seedId":101982283,"seedShowId":101982283,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1119-thirty-three-with-william","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Thirty-Three with William Patrick Corgan","url":"/podcast/1119-thirty-three-with-william-101982283/","episodeIds":[]},"102012322":{"customLinks":[],"description":"During the second season of “Chasing Sleep,\" new hosts Katie Lowes and Adam Shapiro explore the fascinating relationship with sleep and the far-reaching effects of sleep on our quality of life.

The girls were runaways, escaping from a state-run reform school called the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children in Mount Meigs, Alabama. The girls were determined to tell someone about the abuse they’d suffered there: physical and sexual violence, unlivable facilities, and grueling labor in the fields surrounding the school. It was, as several former students called it, a slave camp.\nUNREFORMED is the story of how this reform school derailed the lives of thousands of Black children in Alabama for decades and what happened after those five girls found someone willing to blow the whistle. Host Josie Duffy Rice investigates the history of the school at the tail end of the Civil Rights movement in Alabama and speaks to former students who are still haunted by their experience but had the will to survive.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":107005437,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxL2U5NzE2NGNkLTBhNDctNGZlYi1hOTBlLWFmMjUwMGUyNDhiYy9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg0Nzc1Nzc2JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706731088,"seedId":107005437,"seedShowId":107005437,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-unreformed-the-story-of-t","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Unreformed: the Story of the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children","url":"/podcast/1119-unreformed-the-story-of-t-107005437/","episodeIds":[]},"107027693":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Every Tuesday best friends Jason Alexander and Peter Tilden are joined by experts, newsmakers and celebrities in an attempt to find answers to the things that make us go…\"Really? no, Really?” We invite you to join us, subscribe and even suggest topics, as we search for the answers to life’s most baffling, intriguing, confusing and annoying questions","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":107027693,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzQ1Mjk0YzI0LTk5N2ItNDAwYS1iOTNkLWFmMzMwMTAxZDA3YS9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg0NzgwNzI2JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706727618,"seedId":107027693,"seedShowId":107027693,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-really-no-really","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"Really? no, Really?","url":"/podcast/1119-really-no-really-107027693/","episodeIds":[]},"107110388":{"customLinks":[],"description":"When journalist Danelle Morton’s daughter skips town to hop trains, she follows her into the train yard, and across America.

Fifty years later, with drug overdoses in the US at a record high, are we any closer to ‘victory’? The War on Drugs has a more profound effect on society than any of us really understands. It is embedded in the fabric of our culture and permeates our daily lives in visible and invisible ways – perhaps the most daunting pandemic we face.\nLava for Good’s The War on Drugs podcast, co-hosted by comedian Clayton English and Greg Glod, senior criminal justice fellow at Americans for Prosperity, examines the true cost of five decades of policy, policing, and persecution. Special guests, including diverse subject matter experts, peel back the surface of this complicated period of US history, showing the ways the War on Drugs has fueled over incarceration, exacerbated addiction and hampered economic progress. By shining a spotlight on how our communities have crumbled under the weight of this so-called ‘war,’ we can explore the politicization of public health policy, institutional racism and classism in the legislation and administration of criminal law, and how decriminalization and other alternatives could bring the fruitless ‘war’ to an end. \nThe War on Drugs will be available every Wednesday beginning January 25 wherever you get your podcasts.\nThe War on Drugs is a production of Lava for Good Podcasts in association with Signal Co.

After five years of reporting on marriage in the wildly popular Committed podcast, Jo is now uncovering the other side of monogamy and finding some surprising answers about the motivations behind female infidelity – from sex, to empowerment, to self-esteem, and even love.\nIn She Wants More, Jo explores the double standard of cheating, unpacking the guilt, shame, and the expectations placed on women. She has candid conversations with women about the affairs that have either strengthened or broken their marriages that will make you feel like you're eavesdropping on an intimate conversation between two friends. These stories will make you question everything you thought you knew about desire, monogamy, and marriage.\nShe Wants More was inspired by the book A Passion for More by Susan Shapiro Barash.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":107769177,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzViYmNmZDQzLTI5NGUtNDBlNy05M2JhLWFmOTQwMTQ2YzJhOC9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg1MDM2MTQ1JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":false,"lastUpdated":1706735213,"seedId":107769177,"seedShowId":107769177,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-she-wants-more","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"She Wants More","url":"/podcast/1119-she-wants-more-107769177/","episodeIds":[]},"107817863":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Shondaland Audio in partnership with iHeartPodcasts present: Unpacking The Toolbox.

Only one made it out alive. The other two were found ten days later. They had been attacked by someone - or something. The investigation that followed revealed town secrets as old as the caves themselves and put a third teenage boy, James Fincher, on death row. This haunting narrative follows Julien Solas, an amateur writer and James' friend who’s been haunted by the events ever since.

How they ushered in the birth of new genres and became hotspots for political activism. But above all how they created space for people to escape the world around them, to lose themselves in the music and leave it all on the dance floor. \nNightclubs are sanctuaries where people find their chosen family. It's where you experience the joy of dancing in crowded rooms with people open to accepting you for who you are, or whoever you want to become, even if it’s only for the night.\nPartying brings us together. Whether that’s under a mirror ball in New York or out in the sun in Lagos, beneath the glare of bright strobe lights in Berlin or while listening to the early sounds of a new genre in Detroit. They influence one another. \nNightclubs do change the way we see the world. Because the pure joy of a good party has the unique ability to transcend language, culture and place. To reach people from different parts of the world and unite them through the magical, unshakable, desire to… dance.\n“The History of the World’s Greatest Nightclubs” is executive produced by Paris Hilton, Bruce Gersh and Bruce Robertson for London Audio, and Jonathan Hirsch for Neon Hum Media.

In his absence, legends of his generosity have grown. But no one knows where he is, or if the stories are even true. \nHere’s what we do know: there’s a million Euro bounty out for Vassilis, and a 24-hour task force trying to track him down. When he robs banks, he shares the money with the poor. When he kidnaps industrialists -- and he only kidnaps those who are known for unfair labor practices -- they give baffling interviews showing how he opened their minds. And when he escapes heavily reinforced prisons, as he’s done ... by helicopter ... twice, he does it without harming a guard. \nJoin host Miles Gray and our team of Greek reporters as we follow Vassilis’ trail from Athens to tiny islands to remote mountain hideouts. Along the way, we’ll meet Vassilis’s inner circle, chat with police chiefs and prime ministers, and work to understand how this thief managed to steal the country’s heart.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":118487908,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzFkNTBhYzgxLTMzMzEtNDhmMC04NTNmLWIwMmUwMTAzMjUxMC9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNjg4NTUwMzU0JnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1707099230,"seedId":118487908,"seedShowId":118487908,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"serial","slug":"1119-outlaws-the-good-thief","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"OUTLAWS: The Good Thief","url":"/podcast/1119-outlaws-the-good-thief-118487908/","episodeIds":[]},"118493245":{"customLinks":[],"description":"UK comedian The Honourable Tom Houghton takes us inside Britain’s stately homes, castles and country estates to hear about their local histories, the scandals, the mysteries and occasionally the odd ghost that makes up the fabric of what they are.

What starts as another big party for her, ends up being the history making adventure of a lifetime, blowing the lid off the Iran-Contra scandal and almost taking down the Reagan presidency. \nAward winning filmmaker, Steven Esteb, takes us into the dangerous and improbable lives of Cookie and her team of courageous wartime journalists covering the civil wars, revolutions, and US missteps in Central America. \nJOURNALISTA is dangerous, irreverent, insatiable, and hilarious. An inside look at the insane world of combat journalism. They worked hard, and they partied harder.\nStephen Kinzer (former bureau chief of the New York Times) writes: “During the 1980s and 1990s, Cookie Hood was the driving force behind the most successful television coverage of Central America that appeared anywhere in the United States.” \nCookie uses her unique mix of charm, balls, and passion for social justice, to get through checkpoints, into jungle military camps, and the highest levels of government. She's also a clear and present danger to the shadow U.S. government that is using Central America as a right-wing terror experiment in their fight against communism. \nCookie and her cohorts are brilliant trainwrecks speeding down a path to self- destruction. At the same time, they might just change the world. \nHosted and Created by Steven Esteb\nProduced by Sean J.

But deadly viruses persist — and containing them remains a scientific and technological challenge that each successive generation must take on.\nAuthor and What’s Your Problem host Jacob Goldstein takes us on a journey with leading medical researchers, doctors and historians to trace key moments in our battles with viruses, breakthroughs in vaccine research, and the impact of vaccination campaigns.

Hardy was shot behind the Crown Sterling Suites hotel in Birmingham, Alabama. At the same time as the murder, at least ten people saw Toforest Johnson four miles away, at a popular nightclub called Tee's Place. But detectives zeroed in on him as a main suspect in Deputy Hardy’s murder anyway, ultimately resulting in Toforest being tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. For over a quarter century, Toforest has been confined to a 5’ by 8’ cell on Alabama’s death row.\nIn 2019, investigative journalist Beth Shelburne began covering the case, going down a disturbing rabbit hole revealing many unsettling facts that cast grave doubts about Toforest’s guilt. The facts she found tear at the very foundation of the American criminal justice system: No eyewitnesses or physical evidence tied Toforest to the murder; the state tried to convict a different man for the same crime; and perhaps most disturbing of all, Toforest’s conviction relied on an ‘earwitness’ – a woman who claimed to have eavesdropped on an incriminating phone call, a woman whom prosecutors paid for her testimony, in secret. That payment was not disclosed to the jury, Toforest, or his lawyers until after he had been on death row for 17 years.\nFrom the team behind the award-winning hit podcast Bone Valley, Lava for Good’s Earwitness is an 8-episode docuseries that asks the question, “How did an innocent man end up on death row — and why is the state still trying to execute him over the objection of the prosecutor who put him there?” Shelburne’s unprecedented access to key players—the lead detective, lead prosecutor, witnesses, jurors, and the earwitness herself— illuminate a story filled with disturbing twists, frustrating ambiguities, and shocking admissions. The story of Toforest Johnson and the state's enthusiasm for the death penalty in the face of such troubling evidentiary flaws brings to light the failings of a criminal justice system run amok.\nEarwitness is available every Tuesday wherever you get your podcasts.

Sarah and Jacob have never been found. After disappearing for several days, Catherine was arrested and ultimately charged with the children’s murder. Catherine was declared not competent to stand trial shortly after and has been committed to a psychiatric facility until her competency can be restored.\nBut plenty of people - including some of Catherine’s own family members - have suggested she’s faking incompetence, convinced it’s her path out of prison.\nSarah and Jacob’s dad, Troy, and his wife, Stephanie, continue to search for the kids, desperate for both answers and justice. And now, the clock is ticking. Maryland law requires dismissal of murder charges against a defendant found incompetent to stand trial after the expiration of five years. This means that Catherine could be on the verge of release. Troy, Stephanie and their lawyer, Matt—along with police and prosecutors—are racing to stop that from happening.\nIn addition to a compelling and tragic personal narrative, this case raises broader issues about mental health and the justice system and the unintended consequences of well-intentioned laws.

Each passenger tells their own extraordinary and often terrifying tale to influence the Ferryman’s final destination— be it a comfortable place of eternal light, a haunted purgatory of regret, or one of the nine rings of hell. \nThese are the tales that shaped the soul of the nation.\nCreated by filmmaker Dan Bush (Tomorrow’s Monsters, The Mantawauk Caves) and writer, Nicholas Tecosky, and a co-production of iHeartPodcasts, and Psychopia Pictures, The Passage is a riveting, immersive anthology featuring performances by Wes Studi (The Last of the Mohicans / Geronimo: An American Legend), Martin Starr (Freaks and Geeks / Silicon Valey), Tristan Mack Wilds (The Wire / Red Tails), and Scott Haze (Child of God, Jurassic World Dominion). \nHeadphones are recommended.","editorialContentQuery":[[]],"hostIds":[],"id":146850134,"imgUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcHJvZ3JhbXMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzIzYzk1YWQ0LTcxZmMtNDk5ZC1iYjdlLWIwZGMwMTIyYzAzYy9pbWFnZS5qcGc_dD0xNzA2NzE3MjkzJnNpemU9TGFyZ2U","isExternal":true,"lastUpdated":1713802685,"seedId":146850134,"seedShowId":146850134,"seedType":"podcast","showType":"episodic","slug":"1119-the-passage","socialMediaLinks":[],"stationType":"podcast","title":"The Passage","url":"/podcast/1119-the-passage-146850134/","episodeIds":[]},"146890324":{"customLinks":[],"description":"Artful story telling takes center stage as BIN’S \"Black Land\" podcast taps into the lives of ordinary people and brings to life their extraordinary tales of triumph and circumstance.

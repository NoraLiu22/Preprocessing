    about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your 
    data. This privacy policy supplements other notices and privacy policies
     and is not intended to override them.</p>

    <h5>Your duty to inform us of changes</h5>
    <p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate 
    and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes 
    during your relationship with us.</p>
    <h5>Third-party links</h5>
    <p>Our Websites may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and 
    applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may 
    allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not 
    control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their 
    privacy statements. When you leave our Websites, we encourage you to read
     the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>
    <h4>The data we collect about you</h4>
    <p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about 
    an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not 
    include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
    <p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Identity Data includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier and title.</li>
    	<li>Contact Data includes billing address, postal address, email address and telephone numbers.</li>
    	<li> Financial Data includes bank account and payment card details.</li>
    	<li>Transaction Data includes details about payments to and from you.</li>
    	<li>Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login 
    data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser 
    plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other 
    technology on the devices you use to access this website.</li>
    	<li>Profile Data includes your username and password, purchases or

    </ul>
    <p>We also collect and use Aggregated Data such as statistical or 
    demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from 
    your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this 
    data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if 
    we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it
     can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as 
    personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you 
    (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or 
    philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions,
     trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and 
    biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal 
    convictions and offences.</p>
    <h5>If you fail to provide personal data</h5>
    <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a
     contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when 
    requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are 
    trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with a 
    particular service). In this case, we may have to cancel the service but
     we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
    <h4>How is your personal data collected?</h4>
    <p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Direct interactions. You may give us your personal data by dealing 
    with our staff in person, filling in forms or by corresponding with us 
    by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you 
    provide when you: subscribe to become a member of the Betting and Gaming
     Council; create an account on our Websites; subscribe to our 
    publications; or give us feedback or contact us.</li>
    	<li>Automated technologies or interactions. As you interact with our 
    Websites, we will automatically collect Technical Data about your 
    equipment, browsing actions and patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How we use your personal data</h4>
    <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most 
    commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
    	<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a 
    third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override 
    those interests.</li>
    	<li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing 
    your personal data. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing
     at any time by contacting us.</p>
    <h4>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h4>
    <p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the 
    ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we 
    rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests 
    are where appropriate.</p>
    <p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful 
    ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your 
    data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal 
    ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than 
    one ground has been set out in the table below.</p>

    to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of 
    interest to you. This is how we decide which services, membership 
    benefits and events may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
    <p>You may receive marketing communications from us if you have 
    requested information from us or become a member of the Betting and 
    Gaming Council, in which case we may contact you based on our legitimate
     interest. You will always be given the opportunity to opt out of our 
    marketing when we make contact.</p>
    <h5>Third-party marketing</h5>
    <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>
    <h5>Change of purpose</h5>
    <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we 
    collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for 
    another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. 
    If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new 
    purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>
    <p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we 
    will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to 
    do so.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your 
    knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is 
    required or permitted by law.</p>
    <h4>Disclosures of your personal data</h4>
    <p>We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Service providers acting as processors based in EU/UK who provide 
    IT and system administration services and cloud based storage and 
    services.</li>
    	<li>External third parties acting as processors based in the UK who 
    provide event organising services, and otherwise assist with events that
     we hold or organise.</li>
    	<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities acting 
    as processors or joint controllers based in the UK who require reporting
     of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
    	<li>Our professional advisors acting as processors or joint controllers
     including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide 
    consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
    	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge 
    parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to 
    acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our 
    business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way
     as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
     data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our 
    third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own 
    purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for 
    specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions </p>
    <h4>International transfers</h4>
    <p>We do not routinely transfer personal data outside of the European 
    Economic Area (EEA). The most common scenario for this is where you have
     asked us to do so in the course of us providing services relating to 
    your membership of the Council or where we have engaged a third party 
    data processor.</p>
    <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a 
    similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one 
    of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have 
    been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data
     by the European Commission;</li>
    	<li>where we use certain service providers, we may use specific 
    contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data 
    the same protection it has in Europe; and/or</li>
    	<li>where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to 
    them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to 
    provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe 
    and the US.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Data security</h4>
    <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your 
    personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an 
    unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to 
    your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other 
    third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process 
    your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
     confidentiality. </p>
    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal 
    data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach
     where we are legally required to do so.</p>
    <h4>Data retention</h4>
    <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably 
    necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the 
    purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or 
    reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer 
    period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a
     prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we 
    consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the 
    potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your 
    personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and 
    whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the 
    applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>
    <h4>Your legal rights</h4>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection 
    laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below 
    to find out more about these rights:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
    	<li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
    	<li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
    	<li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
    	<li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
    	<li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
    	<li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
    <p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information

    chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please 
    contact us in the first instance.</p>
    <h5>No fee usually required</h5>
    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to 
    exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable 
    fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. 
    Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these 
    circumstances.</p>
    <h5>What we may need from you</h5>
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us 
    confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data
     (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure 
    to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no 
    right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further 
    information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
    <h5>Time limit to respond</h5>
    <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. 
    Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is 
    particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this 
    case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

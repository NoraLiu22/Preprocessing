In these cases, you are transacting directly with the Partner. On those pages or locations, the transactional Partners’ brand is clearly visible and their terms of service are posted. When using these Partner pages, you are bound by Partner terms of service in addition to remaining bound by these Terms.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND TNR HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED. </b>This Section is deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and TNR agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p><p>We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient, and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that we may have. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms, if you have any past, present, or future dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Service; (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with TNR; or (iii) any data or information you may provide to TNR or that TNR may gather in connection with such use, interaction, or transaction (collectively, “TNR Transactions or Relationships”), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. By using or interacting with the Service or engaging in any other TNR Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.</p><p>We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. If those efforts fail, by using the Service, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against TNR, and any claim that TNR may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or any TNR Transactions or Relationships, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration”) administered by JAMS or its successor (“JAMS”) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect (respectively, the “Applicable Rules”). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the “AAA”) instead and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the “Applicable Rules” in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect that would be applicable to the matter in dispute, TNR agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (h) below. Furthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p><p>You further agree that:</p><ol type="a"><li><h3>Arbitrator Will Interpret These Terms</h3><p>The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms and the arbitration provisions in this Section, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable;</p></li><li><h3>Location of Arbitration</h3><p>The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and TNR; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission;</p></li><li><h3> Governing Law</h3><p>The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;</p></li><li><h3>No Class Relief</h3><p>The Arbitration can resolve only your and TNR’s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</p></li><li><h3>Written Award</h3><p>The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an “Award”). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;</p></li><li><h3>Arbitration Costs</h3><p>In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, TNR will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;</p></li><li><h3>Reasonable Attorney’s Fees</h3><p>In the event you recover an Award greater than TNR’s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award TNR’s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the Arbitration, but TNR shall in all events bear its own attorneys’ fees;</p></li><li><h3>Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause</h3><p>With the exception of the subsection entitled No Class Relief above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, “No Class Relief” is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor TNR shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction;</p></li><li><h3>Small Claims Matters Are Excluded. No Class Relief or Joinder of Claims</h3><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against TNR in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding;</p></li><li><h3>Right to Opt Out</h3><p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor TNR can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision, and must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your TNR account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. Any requests to opt out must be sent to: <a href="mailto:dmyer@tnr.com">dmyer@tnr.com</a>; and</p></li><li><h3>Intellectual Property Disputes</h3><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, TNR may submit any dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy relating to TNR’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and other patents) to any court of competent jurisdiction.</p></li></ol></li><li><h2>General</h2><p>These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter hereof. We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to the Service, and operation of the Service may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. You agree that these Terms and all incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by TNR in our sole discretion. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. All sections which by their context ought to survive these Terms shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.</p></li><li><h2> DIGITAL MILLENIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (&quot;DMCA&quot;) NOTICE</h2><p>In operating the Service, we may act as a “services provider” (as defined by DMCA) and offer services as online provider of materials and links to third-party websites. As a result, third-party materials that we do not own or control may be transmitted, stored, accessed, or otherwise made available using the Service. TNR has in place certain legally mandated procedures regarding allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the Service. TNR has adopted a policy that provides for the immediate removal of any content or the suspension of any user that is found to have infringed on the rights of TNR or of a third party, or that has otherwise violated any intellectual property laws or regulations, or any of the terms and conditions of these Terms. If you believe any material available via the Service infringes a copyright, you should notify us using the notice procedure for claimed infringement under the DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sect. 512(c)(2)). We will respond expeditiously to remove or disable access to the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the material. Our designated agent (i.e., proper party for notice) to whom you should address infringement notices under the DMCA is <a href="mailto:copyrightagent@tnr.com">copyrightagent@tnr.com</a>.</p><p>Please provide the following notice:</p><ol><li>Identification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;</li><li>Identification of the material on the Service that you claim is infringing, with enough detail so that we may locate it on the Service;</li><li>A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li><li>A statement by you declaring under penalty of perjury that (a) the above information in your notice is accurate and (b) that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on behalf of that owner;</li><li>Your address, telephone number, and email address; and</li><li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li></ol><p>We may give notice to our users of any infringement notice by means of a general notice on the Service, electronic mail to a user’s email address in our records, or by written communication sent by first-class mail to a user’s physical address in our records. If you receive such an infringement notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing to the designated agent that includes the information below. To be effective, the counter-notification must be a written communication that includes the following:</p><ol><li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li><li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li><li>A statement from you, under the penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li><li>Your name, physical address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of a Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your physical address is located, or if your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person.</li></ol></li><li><h2>Apple Disclaimer</h2><p>The following applies to any apps you acquire from the App Store, an electronic store branded, owned, or controlled by Apple or any affiliate of Apple (“App Store-Sourced Software”):</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are solely between you and TNR, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the App Store–Sourced Software or content thereof.

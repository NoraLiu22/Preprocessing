<H2>The General (1998)</H2>

<P>D: John Boorman<BR>
S: Brendan Gleeson, Jon Voight, Maria Doyle Kennedy</P>

<P><I>The General</I> marks director John Boorman's return to the gangster
genre after a thirty year hiatus. But where <I>Point Blank</I> was a radical
rewriting of familiar codes and conventions released at a moment in American
film history where rethinking was everything, <I>The General</I> is more
classical in form and structure, right down to the use of black and white
cinematography (albeit anamorphic). Of course, as with all of Boorman's
work, it's not quite that simple. Apart from the fact that this particular
classical gangster tale is set in contemporary Dublin and manages to draw
in and upon several major social and political threads defining urban Irish
life, it is also inflected with the director's characteristic metaphysical
concerns and alive with powerful imagery which transgresses the demands
of narrative and characterisation.</P>

<P>Based on events in the life of Dublin crime lord Martin Cahill (some
true, some myth), the film follows the standard rise-and-fall structure
of the classical gangster film. It begins with Cahill's death in 1994, but
immediately juxtaposes the face of actor Brendan Gleeson with that of young
Eamon Owens (<I><A HREF="bb.htm">The Butcher Boy</A></I>), as a young Dublin
thief leading the Gardai on a merry chase through the tenements. Setting
the pattern for the rest of the film and obeying the laws of the genre (seen
from <I>The Public Enemy</I> to <I>Goodfellas</I>), it immediately engages
the audience's sympathies with the lovable rogue whose opposition to the
powers that be may be seen as a form of social protest, or at least an on
screen catharsis for members of the audience frustrated with their own realities.</P>

<P>The film which follows plays heavily on the opposition between The General
and the Gardai, particularly his arch rival, a stern officer played by veteran
American actor Jon Voight (star of Boorman's <I>Deliverance</I>). It consistently
demands we empathise with the outsider, not the authority figure. It is
also often funny, and the childish hijinks and vicious thuggery of its characters
are metered out in even doses calculated to take the audience on a journey
from empathy to abjection which is central to the genre.</P>

<P>While this entirely standard formal structure is hardly likely to raise
an eyebrow beyond these shores, it has led to a baffling level of controversy
among members of the press and the Government here in Ireland. Certain ordinary
people, victims of The General and his gang, have also been outspoken on
the portrayal of this despicable arch criminal as a lovable Dublin lad with
a keen sense of humour and a number of human passions which make him more
approachable in fiction than he ever was in fact.</P>

<P>It is a typical case of Irish ignorance insofar as the entire (and admittedly
not all that huge) controversy replicates the comment by a Limerick politician
upon the release of <I>Michael Collins</I> that &quot;It's not history the
way <I>Gandhi</I> is history,&quot;: films are all very well, but the closer
you get to a recognisable reality, the more irrational and intolerant people
become. <I>The General</I> is very close in spirit to Howard Hawks' <I>Scarface</I>
, a film whose tentative links to factual reality and whose pertinent comments
upon real life have become confused in the minds of reactionary viewers
eager to proscribe the limits of social discourse.</P>

<P>Gangster films require the audience to admire their criminal protagonists,
but they do not suggest that their actions should be emulated. Gangster
films acknowledge social problems, particularly urban ones, and while the
gangster always seems to have the answers, they invariably sow the seeds
of their own downfall and reap violent death at the hands of forces finally
beyond their control.</P>

<P>Luckily, Boorman is canny enough to realise that controversy is a feature
of Irish film making anyway (his own involvement in the <I>Angel</I> affair
back in 1981 will have made him immune to it at this stage). The result
is that his film is a beautifully crafted Boormanesque take on the gangster
film which should appeal to genuine cineastes the world over. Like Neil
Jordan's adaptation of <I><A HREF="bb.htm">The Butcher Boy</A></I>, this
Irish film film is not intended as a portrait of Ireland, but a dark mirror
of its subconscious held at a peculiar angle by a genuine cinematic visionary.</P>

<P>In the role of Cahill, Brendan Gleeson excels yet again, firmly establishing
himself as the top Irish actor of the last few years (seen most recently
in <I><A HREF="iwd.htm">I Went Down</A></I>). His affable slobbery is far
from glamorous, but nonetheless effective, especially in conjunction with
and contrast to Jon Voight's intense, tight-lipped performance as his chief
pursuer. Some moral and sexual complications are raised in the performances
of <I>The Commitments</I> co-stars Maria Doyle Kennedy and Angeline Ball
as Cahill's 'wives', and Sean McGinley contributes another wonderfully sleazy
characterisation as one of his henchmen. Adrian Dunbar is suitably ambiguous
as Cahill's closest associate, who may or may not have sold him out. An
able supporting cast of familiar faces (including a turn by director Jim
Sheridan) fills out a Dublin cityscape replete with the currents and rhythms
of recent Irish society, including questions of clerical abuse, the drugs
trade, urban renewal, paramilitary activity, housing, social welfare and
the legal system. All of these are underlaid with familiar concerns of Irish
cinema such as family, religion, community and the quasi-mythic representation
of violence.</P>

<P>Again, many of these elements are standard to the genre. Boorman handles
them deftly, and with mesmeric images (by Seamus Deasy) and beautifully
measured editing (by Ron Davis), the film is never less than interesting
even when it is at its most generically predetermined. The threads of genre,
narrative and social specificity are skilfully wound together, resulting
in a film which works on several levels.</P>

<P>Where it doesn't work is in its moments of psychological analysis. This
is not really a film about personality, it is about abstract concepts of
people in general. But it plays many of the familiar cards of the genre
in its characterisation of cop/criminal as opposite sides of the coin, and
the final confrontation between them in a darkened jail cell offers more
in the way of atmosphere and tone than in insightful dialogue as Cahill
reveals to his nemesis that he has brought him down to his level.</P>

<P>To be fair, Boorman has never been about classically rounded characters
and gritty realism. His films are always possessed of a heightened sense
of the structures of human behaviour and their appropriate and inappropriate
application to a sometimes hostile, mostly alienating landscape (<I>Deliverance</I>,
<I>Zardoz</I>, <I>The Emerald Forest</I>, <I>Beyond Rangoon</I>). <I>The
General</I> is a multi-layered text, a meditation on the human condition
set in a particular environment and based on particular characters who serve
the needs of the film maker before they serve the thing we call 'reality'.
As with all of Boorman's work, this may prove its weakness if you are ill
disposed towards him, but its uncharacteristically conventional narrative
is likely to hold the attention of even casual viewers and it is certainly
his most watchable film in many years.</P>

<P>Boorman deservedly picked up the Best Director award at the Cannes Film
Festival in 1998 and while Oscar recognition is unlikely, <I>The General</I>
is, up with <A HREF="bb.htm"><I>The Butcher Boy</I>,</A> among the best
films made in or about Ireland in the 1990s.</P>

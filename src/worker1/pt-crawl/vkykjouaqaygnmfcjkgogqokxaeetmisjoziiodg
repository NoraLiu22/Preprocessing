Yet there came upon him a danger that would endanger his entire dominions, after <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony</A> had been beaten at the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium">Battle of Actium</A> by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar</A> [Octavian]; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="162">[162]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.162"> G</A> &nbsp; for at that time both Herod's enemies and friends despaired of his affairs, for it was not probable that he would remain without punishment, who had showed so much friendship for Antony. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="163">[163]</A> So it happened that his friends despaired, and had no hopes of his escape; but as for his enemies, they all outwardly appeared to be troubled at his case, but were privately very glad of it, as hoping to obtain a change for the better. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="164">[164]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.164"> G</A> &nbsp; As for Herod himself, he saw that there was no one of royal dignity left but <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcanus.html#2">Hyrcanus,</A> and therefore he thought it would be for his advantage not to allow him to be an obstacle in his way any longer; for if he himself survived, and escaped the danger he was in, he thought it the safest way to put it out of the power of such a man to make any attempt against him, at such junctures of affairs, who was more worthy of the kingdom than himself; and in case he should be slain by Caesar, his envy prompted him to desire to slay the man who would otherwise be king after him.
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="165">[165]</A> While <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> had these things in his mind, there was a certain occasion afforded to him: for <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcanus.html#2">Hyrcanus</A> was of so mild a temper, both then and at other times, that he desired not to meddle with public affairs, nor to concern himself with sedition, but left all to fortune, and contented himself with what that brought him: <A CLASS="verse" NAME="166">[166]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.166"> G</A> &nbsp; but <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandra.html#3">Alexandra</A> [his daughter] was a lover of strife, and was exceedingly desirous of a change of the government, and told her father not to bear for ever Herod's injurious treatment of their family, but to anticipate their future hopes, as he safely might; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="167">[167]</A> and urged him to write about these matters to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/malchus.html#2">Malchus,</A> who was then ruler of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arabia.html#1">Arabia,</A> <I>asking him</I> to receive them, and to secure them [from Herod], because if they went away, and Herod's affairs proved to be as it was likely they would be, by reason of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar's</A> enmity to him, they should then be the only persons who could take the government; and this, both on account of the royal family they were of, and on account of the good disposition of the multitude towards them. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="168">[168]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.168"> G</A> &nbsp; While she used these persuasions, Hyrcanus put off her request; but as she showed that she was a woman, and a contentious woman too, and would not desist either night or day, but was always speaking to him about these matters, and about Herod's treacherous designs, she at last prevailed on him to intrust Dositheus, one of his friends, with a letter, wherein his intentions were declared; and he desired the Arabian ruler to send to him some horsemen, who should receive him, and conduct him to Lake <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dead.html#1">Asphaltitis,</A> which is three hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_%28unit_of_length%29">stades</A> from the borders of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem,</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="169">[169]</A> and he did therefore trust Dositheus with this letter, because he was a careful attendant on him, and on Alexandra, and had no small reasons to bear ill-will towards Herod; for he was a kinsman of one Joseph, whom Herod had slain, and a brother of those who were formerly slain at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyre.html#1">Tyre</A> by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony:</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="170">[170]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.170"> G</A> &nbsp; yet these motives did not induce Dositheus to serve Hyrcanus in this affair; for, preferring the hopes he had from the present king to those he had from him, he gave Herod the letter. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="171">[171]</A> So he took his kindness in good part, and bid him besides do what he had already done, that is, go on in serving him, by rolling up the letter and sealing it again, and delivering it to Malchus, and then to bring back his letter in answer to it; for it would be much better if he could know Malchus's intentions also. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="172">[172]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.172"> G</A> &nbsp; And when Dositheus was very ready to serve him in this point also, the Arabian ruler sent a reply, that he would receive Hyrcanus, and all those who should come with him, and even all the Jews that were of his party; that he would, moreover, send forces sufficient to secure them in their journey; and that he should not lack anything that he should desire. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="173">[173]</A> Now as soon as Herod had received this letter, he immediately sent for Hyrcanus, and questioned him about the agreement he had made with Malchus; and when he denied it, he showed his letter to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sanhedrin.html#1">Sanhedrin,</A> and put the man to death immediately.
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="174">[174]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.174"> G</A> &nbsp; And this account we give the reader, as it is contained in the commentaries of king <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod:</A> but other historians do not agree with them, for they suppose that Herod did not find, but rather made, this an occasion for thus putting <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcanus.html#2">Hyrcanus</A> to death, and that by treacherously laying a snare for him; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="175">[175]</A> for thus do they write: That Herod and he were once at a banquet, and that Herod had given no occasion to suspect [that he was displeased at him], but put this question to Hyrcanus, Whether he had received any letters from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/malchus.html#2">Malchus?</A> and when he answered that he had received letters, but those of greetings only; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="176">[176]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.176"> G</A> &nbsp; and when he asked further, whether he had not received any presents from him? and when he had replied that he had received no more than four horses to ride on, which Malchus had sent him; then Herod charged these matters against him as the crimes of bribery and treason, and gave order that he should be led away and slain. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="177">[177]</A> And in order to demonstrate that he had been guilty of no offence, when he was thus brought to his end, they alleged how mild his temper had been, and that even in his youth he had never given any demonstration of boldness or rashness, and that the case was the same when he came to be king, but that he even then committed the management of the greatest part of public affairs to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antipater.html#14">Antipater</A> ; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="178">[178]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.178"> G</A> &nbsp; and that he was now above eighty years old, and knew that Herod's government was in a secure state. He also came over the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/euphrates.html#1">Euphrates,</A> and left those who greatly honoured him beyond that river, though he was to be entirely under Herod's government; and that it was a most incredible thing that he should attempt anything by way of innovation, and entirely contrary to his character, but that this was a plot of Herod's contrivance.
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="179">[179]</A> And this was the fate of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcanus.html#2">Hyrcanus</A> ; and thus did he end his life, after he had endured various and manifold turns of fortune in his lifetime. For he was made high priest of the Jewish nation at the beginning of his mother  <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandra.html#1">Alexandra's</A> reign, who held the government nine years; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="180">[180]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.180"> G</A> &nbsp; and when, after his mother's death, he took the kingdom himself, and held it three months, he was driven from it, by his brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristobulus.html#2">Aristobulus.</A> He was then restored by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pompeius.html#22">Pompey,</A> and received all sorts of honour from him, and enjoyed them for forty years; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="181">[181]</A> but when he was again deprived by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#7">Antigonus,</A> and was maimed in his body, he was made a captive by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/parthia.html#1">Parthians,</A> and thence returned home again after some time, on account of the hopes that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> had given him; none of which came to pass according to his expectation, but he still struggled with many misfortunes through the whole course of his life; and, what was the heaviest calamity of all, as we have related already, he came to an end which was undeserved by him. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="182">[182]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.182"> G</A> &nbsp; His character appeared to be that of a man of a mild and moderate disposition, who allowed the administration of affairs to be generally done by others under him. He was averse to much meddling with the public, nor had shrewdness enough to govern a kingdom. And both <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antipater.html#14">Antipater</A> and Herod came to their greatness by reason of his mildness; and at last he met with such an end from them as was not fitting either to justice or piety.
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="183">[183]</A> Now <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod,</A> as soon as he had put <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcanus.html#2">Hyrcanus</A> out of the way, made haste to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar;</A> and because he could not have any hopes of kindness from him, on account of the friendship he had for <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony,</A> he had a suspicion of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandra.html#3">Alexandra,</A> lest she should take this opportunity to bring the multitude to a revolt, and introduce a sedition into the affairs of the kingdom; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="184">[184]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.184"> G</A> &nbsp; so he committed the care of everything to his brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pheroras.html#1">Pheroras,</A> and placed his mother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cypros.html#1">Cypros,</A> and his sister [ <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/salome.html#1">Salome</A> ], and the whole family at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/masada.html#1">Masada,</A> and gave him a charge, that if he should hear any sad news about him, he should take care of the government. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="185">[185]</A> But as to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mariamme.html#1">Mariamme</A> his wife, because of the misunderstanding between her and his sister, and his sister's mother, which made it impossible for them to live together, he placed her at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandreium.html#1">Alexandreium,</A> with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandra.html#3">Alexandra</A> her mother, and left his treasurer Joseph and Sohemus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/ituraea.html#1">Ituraea</A> to take care of that fortress. These two had been very faithful to him from the beginning, and were now left to guard the women. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="186">[186]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.186"> G</A> &nbsp; They also had it in charge, that if they should hear any mischief had befallen him, they should kill them both, and, as far as they were able, to preserve the kingdom for his sons, and for his brother Pheroras.
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="187">[187]</A> When he had given them these instructions, he made haste to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhodes.html#1">Rhodes,</A> to meet <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar;</A> and when he had sailed to that city, he took off his diadem, but remitted nothing else of his usual dignity. And when, upon his meeting him, he requested that he would let him speak to him, he therein exhibited a very noble specimen of a great soul; for he did not resort to supplications, <A CLASS="verse" NAME="188">[188]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.188"> G</A> &nbsp; as men usually do upon such occasions, nor offered him any petition, as if he were an offender; but, in an undaunted manner, gave an account of what he had done; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="189">[189]</A> for he spoke thus to Caesar: That he had the greatest friendship for <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony,</A> and did everything he could that he might obtain the government; that he was not indeed in the army with him, because the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arabia.html#1">Arabians</A> had diverted him; but that he had sent him both money and corn, <A CLASS="verse" NAME="190">[190]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.190"> G</A> &nbsp; which was but too little in comparison of what he ought to have done for him; "for if a man owns himself to be another's friend, and knows him to be a benefactor, he is obliged to hazard everything, to use every faculty of his soul, every member of his body, and all the wealth he has, for him, in which I confess I have been too deficient. However, I am conscious that so far I have done right, that I have not deserted him upon his defeat at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/actium.html#1">Actium</A> ; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="191">[191]</A> nor upon the evident change of his fortune have I transferred my hopes from him to another, but have preserved myself, though not as a valuable fellow soldier, yet certainly as a faithful counsellor, to Antony, when I demonstrated to him that the only way that he had to save himself, and not to lose all his authority, was to slay <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleopatra.html#7">Cleopatra</A> ; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="192">[192]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.192"> G</A> &nbsp; for when she was once dead, there would be room for him to retain his authority, and rather to bring you to make a compact with him, than to continue at enmity any longer. None of which advice would he listen to, but he preferred his own rash resolution before it, which has happened unprofitably for him, but profitably for you. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="193">[193]</A> Now, therefore, in case you decide about me, and my alacrity in serving Antony, according to your anger at him, I admit that there is no room for me to deny what I have done, nor will I be ashamed to admit, and that publicly too, that I had a great kindness for him. But if you will put him out of the case, and only examine how I behave myself to my benefactors in general, and what sort of friend I am, you will find by experience that we shall do and be the same to yourself, for it is but changing the names, and the firmness of friendship that we shall bear to you will not be disapproved by you."
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="194">[194]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.194"> G</A> &nbsp; By this speech, and by his behaviour, which showed <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar</A> the frankness of his mind, he greatly gained upon him, who was himself of a generous and magnificent spirit, insomuch that those very actions, which were the foundation of the accusation against him, procured him Caesar's goodwill. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="195">[195]</A> Accordingly, he restored to him his diadem again; and encouraged him to show himself as great a friend to himself as he had been to Antony, and then held him in great esteem. Moreover, he added this, that Quintus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/didius.html#4">Didius</A> had written to him that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> had very readily assisted him in the affair of the gladiators. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="196">[196]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.196"> G</A> &nbsp; So when he had obtained such a kind reception, and had, beyond all his hopes, procured his crown to be more entirely and firmly settled upon him than ever by Caesar's donation, as well as by that decree of the Romans, which Caesar took care to procure for his greater security, he conducted Caesar on his way to Egypt, and made presents, even beyond his ability, to both him and his friends, and in general behaved himself with great magnanimity. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="197">[197]</A> He also requested that Caesar would not put to death one <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexas.html#3">Alexander,</A> who had been a companion of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony</A> ; but Caesar had sworn to put him to death, and so he could not obtain this petition. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="198">[198]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.198"> G</A> &nbsp; And now he returned to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judaea.html#1">Judaea</A> again with greater honour and assurance than ever, and frightened those who had expectations to the contrary, because he had acquired from his very dangers greater splendour than before, by the favour of God to him. So he prepared for the reception of Caesar, as he was going out of Syria to invade Egypt; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="199">[199]</A> and when he came, he entertained him at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemais.html#1">Ptolemais</A> with all royal magnificence. He also bestowed presents on the army, and brought them provisions in abundance. He also proved to be one of Caesar's most cordial friends, and put the army in array, and rode along with Caesar, and had a hundred and fifty men, well appointed in all respects, after a rich and sumptuous manner, for the better reception of him and his friends. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="200">[200]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.200"> G</A> &nbsp; He also provided them with what they should want, as they passed over the dry desert, insomuch that they lacked neither wine nor water, which last the soldiers stood in the greatest need of; and besides, he presented Caesar with eight hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A>, and procured to himself the goodwill of them all, because he was assisting them in a much greater and more splendid degree than the kingdom he had obtained could afford; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="201">[201]</A> by which means he more and more demonstrated to Caesar the firmness of his friendship, and his readiness to assist him; and what was of the greatest advantage to him was this, that his liberality came at a opportune time also. And when they returned again out of Egypt, his assistance was in no way inferior to the good offices he had formerly done for them.
 
<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c7">{7.}</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="202">[202]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.202"> G</A> &nbsp; However, when he came into his kingdom again, he found his house all in disorder, and his wife <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mariamme.html#1">Mariamme</A> and her mother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandra.html#3">Alexandra</A> very uneasy; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="203">[203]</A> for as they supposed (what was easy to be supposed) that they were not put into that fortress [ <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandreium.html#1">Alexandreium</A> ] for the security of their persons, but as into a garrison for their imprisonment, and that they had no power over anything, either of others or of their own affairs, they were very uneasy; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="204">[204]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.204"> G</A> &nbsp; and Mariamme supposing that the king's love to her was but hypocritical, and rather pretended (as advantageous to himself) than real, she looked upon it as fallacious. She also was grieved that he would not allow her any hopes of surviving him, if he should come to any harm himself.

<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="259">[259]</A> But some time afterwards, when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/salome.html#1">Salome</A> happened to quarrel with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/costobarus.html#1">Costobarus,</A> she sent him a notice of divorce and dissolved her marriage with him, though this was not according to the Jewish laws; for with us it is lawful for a husband to do so; but a wife; if she departs from her husband, cannot of herself be married to another, unless her former husband puts her away. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="260">[260]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.260"> G</A> &nbsp; However, Salome chose to follow not the law of her country, but the law of her authority, and so renounced her wedlock; and told her brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod,</A> that she left her husband out of her goodwill to him, because she perceived that he, with Antipater, and Lysimachus, and Dositheus, were raising a sedition against him; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="261">[261]</A> as evidence of which, she alleged the case of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_ben_Buta">sons of Babas,</A> that they had been by him preserved alive already for the interval of twelve years; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="262">[262]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.262"> G</A> &nbsp; which proved to be true. But when Herod thus unexpectedly heard of it, he was greatly surprised at it, and was the more surprised, because the story appeared incredible to him. As for the facts relating to these sons of Babas, Herod had formerly taken great pains to bring them to punishment, as being enemies to his government; but they were now forgotten by him, on account of the length of time [since he had ordered them to be slain]. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="263">[263]</A> Now the cause of his ill-will and hatred to them arose from this, that while <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#7">Antigonus</A> was king, Herod, with his army, besieged the city of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem,</A> where the distress and miseries which the besieged endured were so pressing, that the greater number of them invited Herod into the city, and already placed their hopes on him. Now the sons of Babas were of great dignity, and had power among the multitude, and were faithful to Antigonus, and were always raising calumnies against Herod, and encouraged the people to preserve the government for that royal family which held it by inheritance. So these men acted thus politically, and, as they thought, for their own advantage; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="264">[264]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.264"> G</A> &nbsp; but when the city was taken, and Herod had got the government into his hands, and Costobarus was appointed to hinder men from passing out at the gates, and to guard the city, so that those citizens who were guilty, and of the party opposite to the king, might not get out of it, Costobarus, being aware that the sons of Babas were held in respect and honour by the whole multitude, and supposing that their preservation might be of great advantage to him in the changes of government afterward, kept them by themselves, and concealed them in his own farms; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="265">[265]</A> and when the thing was suspected, he assured Herod upon oath that he really knew nothing of that matter, and so overcame the suspicions that lay upon him; nay, after that, when the king had publicly proposed a reward for their discovery, and had put in practice all sorts of methods for searching out this matter, he would not confess it; but being persuaded that when he had at first denied it, if the men were found, he should not escape unpunished, he was forced to keep them secret, not only out of his goodwill to them, but out of a necessary regard to his own preservation also. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="266">[266]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.266"> G</A> &nbsp; But when the king knew the thing, by his sister's information, he sent men to the places where they were reported to be concealed, and ordered both them, and those that were accused as guilty with them, to be slain, insomuch that there were now none at all left of the family of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcanus.html#2">Hyrcanus,</A> and the kingdom was entirely in Herod's own power, and there was nobody remaining of such dignity as could put a stop to what he did against the Jewish laws.
 
<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c8">{8.}</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="267">[267]</A> It was on this account that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> abandoned the laws of his country, and corrupted their ancient constitution, by the introduction of foreign practices, although this constitution yet ought to have been preserved inviolable; by which means we became guilty of great wickedness afterwards, while those religious observances which used to lead the multitude to piety were now neglected; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="268">[268]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.268"> G</A> &nbsp; for, in the first place, he appointed solemn games to be celebrated every fifth year, in honour of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar,</A> and built a theatre at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem,</A> and also a very great amphitheatre in the plain. Both of them were indeed costly works, but opposite to the Jewish customs; for we have had no such shows handed down to us as fit to be used or exhibited by us; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="269">[269]</A> yet did he celebrate these games every five years, in the most solemn and splendid manner. He also made proclamation to the neighbouring countries, and called men together out of every nation. The wrestlers also, and the rest of those that strove for the prizes in such games, were invited out of every land, both by the hopes of the rewards there to be bestowed, and by the glory of victory to be there gained. So the principal persons that were the most eminent in these sports were gathered together, for there were very great rewards for victory proposed, <A CLASS="verse" NAME="270">[270]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.270"> G</A> &nbsp; not only to those that performed in gymnastic events, but to those that played the musicians also, and were called <FONT CLASS="exotic"> thymelikoi</FONT>; and he spared no pains to induce all persons, the most famous for such exercises, to come to this contest for victory. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="271">[271]</A> He also proposed no small rewards to those who competed for the prizes in chariot races, when they were drawn by two or four horses, and for race-horses. He also imitated everything, though it might be costly or magnificent, in other nations, out of an ambition that he might give a public demonstration of his grandeur. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="272">[272]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.272"> G</A> &nbsp; Inscriptions also of the great actions of Caesar, and trophies of those nations which he had conquered in his wars, and all made of the purest gold and silver, encompassed the theatre itself; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="273">[273]</A> nor was there anything that could contribute to his design, whether it were precious garments, or precious stones set in order, which was not also displayed to sight in these games. He had also made a great preparation of wild beasts, and of lions themselves in great abundance, and of such other beasts as were either of uncommon strength, or of such a sort as were rarely seen. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="274">[274]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.274"> G</A> &nbsp; These were prepared either to fight with one another, or men who were condemned to death were to fight with them. And truly foreigners were greatly surprised and delighted at the vastness of the expenses here exhibited, and at the great dangers that were here seen; but to native Jews, this was no better than a dissolution of those customs for which they had so great a veneration. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="275">[275]</A> It appeared also no better than an instance of barefaced impiety, to throw men to wild beasts, for the delight of the spectators; and it appeared an instance of no less impiety, to change their own laws for such foreign exercises: but, above all the rest, the trophies gave most distaste to the Jews; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="276">[276]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.276"> G</A> &nbsp; for as they imagined them to be images, included within the armour that hung round about them, they were sorely displeased at them, because it was not the custom of their country to pay honours to such images.
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="277">[277]</A> Nor was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> unacquainted with the consternation they were suffering; and as he thought it inappropriate to use violence against them, so he spoke to some of them by way of consolation, in order to free them from that superstitious fear they were under; yet could not he satisfy them, but they cried out with one accord, out of their great uneasiness at the offences they thought he had been guilty of, that although they should think of bearing all the rest yet would they never endure images of men in their city, meaning the trophies, because this was against the laws of their country. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="278">[278]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.278"> G</A> &nbsp; Now when Herod saw them in such disorder, and that they would not easily change their resolution unless they received satisfaction in this point, he called to him the most eminent men among them, and brought them into the theatre, and showed them the trophies, and asked them what sort of things they took these trophies to be; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="279">[279]</A> and when they cried out that they were the images of men, he gave order that they should be stripped of these outward ornaments which were about them, and showed them the naked pieces of wood; which pieces of wood, now without any ornament, became matter of great sport and laughter to them, because they had before always assumed the ornaments to be a disguise for images.

<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="284">[284]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.284"> G</A> &nbsp; When they had taken this resolution, and that by common consent, they went into the theatre, hoping that, in the first place, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> himself could not escape them, as they should fall upon him so unexpectedly; and supposing, however, that if they missed him, they should kill a great many of those that were about him; and this resolution they took, though they should die for it, in order to suggest to the king what injuries he had done to the multitude. These conspirators, therefore, standing thus prepared beforehand, went about their design with great alacrity; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="285">[285]</A> but there was one of those spies of Herod, who were appointed for such purposes, to fish out and inform him of any conspiracies that should be made against him, who found out the whole affair, and told the king of it, as he was about to go into the theatre. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="286">[286]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.286"> G</A> &nbsp; So when he reflected on the hatred which he knew the greatest part of the people bore him, and on the disturbances that arose upon every occasion, he thought this plot against him not to be improbable. Accordingly, he retired into his palace, and called those that were accused of this conspiracy before him by their several names; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="287">[287]</A> and as, upon the guards falling upon them, they were caught in the very act, and knew they could not escape, they prepared themselves for their ends with all the decency they could, and so as not at all to recede from their resolute behaviour, <A CLASS="verse" NAME="288">[288]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.288"> G</A> &nbsp; for they showed no shame for what they were about, nor denied it; but when they were seized, they showed their daggers, and professed that the conspiracy they had sworn to was a holy and pious action; that what they intended to do was not for gain, or out of any indulgence to their passions, but principally for those common customs of their country, which all the Jews were obliged to observe, or to die for them. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="289">[289]</A> This was what these men said, out of their undaunted courage in this conspiracy. So they were led away to execution by the king's guards that stood about them, and patiently underwent all the torments inflicted on them till they died. Nor was it long before that spy who had revealed them was seized on by some of the people, out of the hatred they bore to him; and was not only slain by them, but pulled to pieces, limb from limb, and given to the dogs. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="290">[290]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.290"> G</A> &nbsp; This execution was seen by many of the citizens, yet not one of them would reveal the doers of it, till upon Herod's making a strict scrutiny after them, by bitter and severe tortures, certain women that were tortured confessed what they had seen done; and the authors of this act were so terribly punished by the king, that their entire families were destroyed because of their rash attempt; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="291">[291]</A> yet the obstinacy of the people, and that undaunted constancy they showed in the defence of their laws, did not make Herod any easier to them, but he still strengthened himself after a more secure manner, and resolved to encompass the multitude in every way, lest such disaffection should end in an open rebellion.
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="292">[292]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.292"> G</A> &nbsp; Since, therefore, he now had the city fortified by the palace in which he lived, and by the temple which had a strong fortress by it, called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonia.html#8">Antonia,</A> and was rebuilt by himself, he contrived to make <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samaria.html#1">Samaria</A> a fortress for himself also against all the people, and called it Sebaste, <A CLASS="verse" NAME="293">[293]</A> supposing that this place would be a stronghold against the country, not inferior to the former. So he fortified that place, which was a day's journey distant from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem,</A> and which would be useful to him in common, to keep both the country and the city in awe. He also built another fortress for the whole nation; it was of old called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/strato.html#1">Strato's</A> Tower, but was by him named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caesareia.html#1">Caesarea.</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="294">[294]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.294"> G</A> &nbsp; Moreover, he chose out some select horsemen, and placed them in the Great Plain; and built [for them] a place in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/galilee.html#1">Galilee</A> called <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaba%27,_Haifa">Gaba,</A> along with <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heshbon">Esebonitis</A> in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/peraea.html#2">Peraea.</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="295">[295]</A> And these were the places which he particularly built, while he always was inventing something further for his own security, and encompassing the whole nation with guards, that they might by no means get from under his power, nor fall into tumults, which they did continually upon any small commotion; and that if they did make any commotions, he might know of it, while some of his spies might be onto them from the neighbourhood, and might both be able to know what they were attempting, and to prevent it. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="296">[296]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.296"> G</A> &nbsp; And when he went about building the walls of Samaria, he contrived to bring thither many of those who had been assisting to him in his wars, and many of the people in that neighbourhood also, whom he made fellow citizens with the rest. This he did out of an ambitious desire of building a (?) temple, and out of a desire to make the city more eminent than it had been before; but principally because he contrived that it might at once be for his own security, and a monument of his magnificence. He also changed its name, and called it Sebaste. Moreover, he divided the adjoining country, which was excellent in its kind, among the inhabitants of Samaria, that they might be in a happy condition, upon their first coming to reside there. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="297">[297]</A> Besides all this, he surrounded the city with a wall of great strength, and made use of the steepness of the place for making its fortifications stronger; nor was the compass of the place made now so small as it had been before, but was such as rendered it not inferior to the most famous cities; for it was twenty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_%28unit_of_length%29">stades</A> in circumference. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="298">[298]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:15.298"> G</A> &nbsp; Now within, and about the centre of it, he built a sacred place, of a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_%28unit_of_length%29">stade</A> and a half [in circuit], and adorned it with all sorts of decorations, and init he erected a temple, which was illustrious on account of both its size and beauty. And as to the several parts of the city, he adorned them with decorations of all sorts also; and as to what was necessary to provide for his own security, he made the walls very strong for that purpose, and made it for the greatest part a citadel; and as to the elegance of the building, it was taken care of also, that he might leave monuments of the fineness of his taste, and of his beneficence, to future ages.

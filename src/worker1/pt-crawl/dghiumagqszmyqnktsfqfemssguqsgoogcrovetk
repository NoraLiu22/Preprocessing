<b><i><font size="6" color="#08A008"><p align="CENTER">A Brief History 
of the Sleeping Giant</p>
</i></b><p>&nbsp;</p></font>

<font size="5"><p>The trap rock ridges in Connecticut began life about 170 million years ago when volcanic 
eruptions formed the columnar patterns of basaltic rock.  This hard rock which fractures at near 90 
degree angles gives the rock the name  <i>trap</i> meaning step or stair in Swedish.  In Connecticut 
most of these ridges run north-south, but one unique ridge six miles north of New Haven runs east-west 
and has the distinctive profile of a recumbent human, especially when viewed from the south.  This <i>Sleeping 
Giant</i> has held a mythical quality for all who see it.  </p>
<p>The Native Americans in the area called the Giant <i>Hobbomock</i>, an evil spirit who became angry at 
the neglect of his people and stamped his foot near the current location of Middletown causing the Connecticut 
River to change course.  <i>Keitan</i>, a good spirit cast a spell on Hobomock causing him to sleep forever so that 
he would do no further damage.</p>

<p>Although the ridges to the north of New Haven were easily visible from the harbor and Long Island Sound, 
it was almost a century after the founding of New Haven Colony before Europeans began to settle the area which 
would be named Mount Carmel.  In 1735 Joel Munson began work on a dam on the Mill river just southwest of 
the Giant's head.  He built a grist mill and saw mill on the site.  The presence of the mill spurred 
settlement of the area as did a north-south road constructed through a difficult area known as the Steps, 
just west of the Mill River.  In 1828 a canal from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts brought barge 
traffic to the area.  In 1846, the canal company ceased operations, and a rail line was laid along the 
bed of the canal.  The Mount Carmel Axleworks moved to the location of Joel Munson's dam.  </p>

<p>The second half of the nineteenth century saw cottages built on many of the Giant's ridges.  The summer 
homes were used by many local notables for either overnight stays or summer-long residency.  Many ingenious 
devices were used to provide comforts at these remote locations. The highlight of this era was John H. 
Dickerman's opening of <i>Blue Hills Park</i> on July 4, 1888 when local residents were invited to travel 
a carriage road that had been constructed to a pavilion on the fourth ridge for a &quot;basket picnic&quot;
 which included ice cream.</p>

<p>Judge Willis Cook who owned the first ridge or the Giant's head had an ox road built to the top of 
the head so he could transport building materials for a cottage.  Parts of this road are now the blue 
trail on the north side of the head.  By 1911 however vandals had become such a problem that Judge Cook 
decided to accept an offer from the Mount Carmel Traprock Company to lease the land for quarrying.  The 
lease was for 20 years with a renewal option for another twenty years.  Perhaps to ease the objections 
of his neighbors, Judge Cook included a clause in the lease that no quarrying should be visible from 
Mount Carmel Avenue. The objections of local residents to the continuous blasting and ultimately to the 
changing of the Giant's shape led to the formation of the Sleeping Giant Park Association and the beginning 
of Sleeping Giant State Park.  For more information on this part of the Giant's story, see the page on

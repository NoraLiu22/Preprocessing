<p>Throughout the ages, many women have tried to make an impact
on the world, many without success. There are those, however, who
are able to break the bonds that held women to certain positions
in society. Some of these women who were able to break from
tradition made an immense impact on the society of their time and
upon history in general. One of these amazing women is Catherine de' Medici, an Italian woman who eventually became Queen of
France. </p>

<p>Catherine de' Medici was born to the Medici family of Florence
in 1519. Her parents were Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine
de la Tour d'Auvergne. Both of her parents died shortly after her
birth leaving her as the sole heiress to all of the possessions
and holdings of the Medici family. After her parents' deaths, she
had no close relatives to care for her. Her father's distant
relative Cardinal Guilio de' Medici came to Florence to take
control of the Florentine government and to care for the young
Catherine. </p>

<p>In 1527, when Catherine was eight years old, the Medici palace
in Florence was attacked by an angry mob of Florentines. Her
relatives who lived in the palace with her decided to flee the
palace but they were ordered by the rebellion leaders to leave
young Catherine behind, so that they would have a valuable
hostage in the future. After young Catherine was taken hostage
she was placed in various convents in and around the city. While
in these convents she received an education that allowed her to
be one of the best-educated women of her time.</p>

<p>When the Florentine rebellion was finally crushed by Guilio d'Medici, now Pope Clement VII, she was sent to Rome to reside
with him. Once there, her marriage arrangements were made.
Clement and King Francis I of France arranged that Catherine was
to be married to his second eldest son, Henry of Orleans. Now at
age 14, she was described as, &quot;small and slender, with fair
hair, thin and not pretty in face, but with the eyes peculiar to
all the Medici&quot; (Young 393).</p>

<p>Her arrival at the palace in France for the wedding ceremonies
was supposedly a time of great celebration. Catherine wanted a
great impression on the Royal Court of France. Although short in
stature, she wanted to make a grand entrance. In order to do
this she consulted a Florentine artisan for help, who had
presented her with the first example of the modern high-heeled
shoe. Her arrival in France, while wearing these shoes, caused
quite a stir.</p>

<p>After her marriage to Henry of Orleans, she traveled and saw
much of France. King Francis I, now her father-in-law soon
realized what a wonderful traveling companion his new
daughter-in-law was. Other than Francis, Catherine had not a
friend in all of France and was not looked highly upon by the
French people, especially the nobles, who called her &quot;the
Italian woman&quot;.</p>

<p>King Francis' eldest son, the Dauphin Francis, died in 1536,
leaving Henry of Orleans as the heir to the French throne. This
caused quite a commotion throughout France. The French did not
want an Italian woman to become their queen. Many French hoped
for Catherine to do something wrong to keep her from ever
reaching the throne. Many thought that she would never have
children and that her time in there would be short, but between
the years 1543 and 1555 Catherine had ten children, three of
which died in infancy. Of those that survived three of them,
Francis, Charles, and Henry, would later serve as Kings of France.</p>

<p>In 1547, Catherine's beloved father in law, Francis I died.&nbsp; Her husband of 14 years
became King Henry II of
France, and Catherine was now the Queen. Catherine's
severe unpopularity with the French people became greater than
ever. Their new queen was not of royal blood and she was Italian--
not a good combination according to the French.</p>

<p>Catherine's marriage was also not very pleasant. Although she loved him deeply, Henry was more in love with his
mistress, Diane de Poitiers, with whom he spent much of his time.
What made matters worse, Diane had almost complete control
over the weak-minded Henry. Through Henry, Diane de Poitiers
gained much influence in the governing of France. This severely
bothered Catherine, but she did not cause problems or create a
stir. She kept her personal feelings and attitudes to herself.</p>

<p>In 1559, Catherine's husband died in a tournament accident and her eldest son Francis
II came to the throne. Like his father, he was weak of mind.
Francis II only ruled for 17 months and upon his death in 1560, Catherine's second son, Charles IX came to the throne at age ten.
This allowed Catherine to become Queen Regent of France, and she served as such until Charles
IX's death. She also served as Queen
Regent for her third son, Henry III. </p>

<p>During her reign, Catherine de' Medici faced many problems
including the religious wars involving the Huguenots in France
and the French hatred toward her. She overcame such
obstacles, managed to uphold the power of the monarchy, and
protected the claims of the Valois dynasty.</p>

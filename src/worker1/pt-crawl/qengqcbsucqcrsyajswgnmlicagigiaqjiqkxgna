<p><strong>&quot;The Ossett Observer&quot;</strong> held on microfiche archive at Ossett Library, Station Road is a fantastic resource for Ossett history and I have spent many hours reading through past copies of the Observer finding much previously unknown local and family history.

I understand a similar archive is held at Balne Lane library in Wakefield.</p>

<p>The preface to &quot;<em>Glimpses of Ossett's History</em>&quot; by John Pollard has the following information: </p>
<p>&quot;In writing <em>Glimpses of Ossett's History</em>, I have tried to include the principal events, which have occurred here and also give some account of the ways of life of ordinary people. Conventional history is referred to only to the extent required to provide the setting or the explanation for Ossett's affairs, but some reference to the affairs of our neighbours has been unavoidable.</p>
<p>Much space is given to our early centuries, but this is not a comprehensive history. There are many gaps in the story and <em>Glimpses of Ossett's History</em> is a fitting title.</p>
<p>I have drawn on many sources of information, including a series of lectures given some years ago by Mr. Colin Oldroyd, which I remember with pleasure. Other sources have been the <em>Journal</em> of the Yorkshire Archeological Society and the pages of the <em>Ossett Observer, </em>which latter for over one hundred years gave a wide and faithful coverage of local news. Information about mining has come from Mr. R.W.G. Lucas, ARICS, and Mr. Clifford Ellis has allowed me access to his documents.</p>
<p>I also offer thanks to Mr. Albert Spencer, Mr. David Scriven and Mr Claud Ford of the Ossett Historical Society, who have arranged publication and who have contributed their special skills.</p>
<p>To all who have assisted in whatever way, I offer my sincere thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>JOHN POLLARD</p>

<p class="comment">Although the scale of the illustration is significantly smaller than
that of the later illustrations in the various editions of <span class="book">The 
Christmas Books</span>, as the anthologized version was known from 1852 onwards, John
Leech has successfully compressed the visual information that Dickens provides about The
small newsagent's family into a single, highly detailed scene in the 1848 Bradbury and
Evans edition. [Commentary continued below.]</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p class="one">Like all the plates that follow, except the concluding one, "The
Tetterbys" occupies somewhat less than a full page, sharing the page with the text. Since
Leech had wanted a subject more congenial to his abilities as a graphic humorist, Dickens
had proposed that the <span class="book">Punch</span> illustrator realise this hectic
scene of an extended family of the type he himself endured as a child: two adults, the
infant Sally ("Moloch"), and the seven male children. As we turn the page, we come upon
the scene with Mrs. Tetterby grudgingly setting the table and the children gathered about
in anticipation.</p>

<p>Leech conveys an impression of congested space and close living conditions with the
small fireplace, insufficient table, inadequate floor space, and room full of small
children. This is not the cheery yuletide repast of the Cratchits — the only food
visible here is a small loaf. The placement of this plate is masterful since it occurs at
precisely the moment that one finds Mrs. Tetterby setting the table in the accompanying
text. Despite the confined living conditions and constrained financial circumstances, the
mantelpiece's ornaments have a humanizing influence on the chaotic scene.</p>

<p>Deborah A. Thomas in <span class="book">Dickens and the Short Story</span> (1982)  
notes that reading and remembering are recurring motiffs in the novella that
anticipate the conflicting wisdoms of the head and the heart in <span class="book">Hard
Times</span> (1854). Figures especially associated with reading, Redlaw and Tetterby, are
both members of the Information Age as the former spreads scientific thinking beyond the
restricted communities of the privileged and politically connected universities of Oxford
and Cambridge, while Adolphus Tetterby earns his living by selling journals and newspapers
to those unable to afford purchasing books and even paying a lending library subscription.
But reading and study can also be retreats from emotional engagement, as Leech suggests in this scene:</p>

<p class="lq">The motif of reading is also echoed in the subplot, dealing with the impoverished Tetterby family whose attitudes directly reflect the baneful influence of Redlaw, while he is afflicted with the Phantom's gift, and the healing counter-influence of Milly. When they are first introduced, despite their large numbers and cramped living quarters, the Tetterbys are cheerful. Mr. Tetterby, a newsvender by occupation, is attempting to read a newspaper. . . . The "small scraps of newspapers" covering Mr. Tetterby's screen prove to be clippings which he is in the habit of reading to his eight children for instructively emotional effect. [Thomas 54]</p>

<p class="one">The later illustrators have taken a much more realistic approach to the figures,
modelling them and showing them in action — in this regard, Barnard's Household
Edition plate of Johnny and Moloch is noteworthy for its baroque complexity. But Leech's
illustration of the congested Tetterby parlour exudes a charm and convivial humour the
later artists failed to realise.</p>

Atthis moment, the patient yelled from the shock received. A soundreached Meucci's left ear, apparently coming from the instrument inhis left hand. In his affidavit<SUP>(*)</SUP>,<B> </B>Meucci stated:<FONT COLOR="#660000"><I>&#147;I thought I heard this sound moredistinctly than natural.

This experiment(in fact, it was a series of like experiments) differed from thefirst one in three ways:</P><UL>   <LI>both the patient's and Meucci's implements were covered with a   cone of pasteboard, into which the patient could speak freely and   Meucci could better hear, enjoying the acoustic power gain of the   cone, as well as some acoustic isolation from the   environment;</LI>      <LI>the second instrument, formerly held by the patient in his   left hand, was left idle, as it was not required anymore to apply   current to the patient.</LI>      <LI>the total emf was gradually reduced down to four or six   elements of Bunsen, providing a total emf between 7.6 volts and   11.4 volts, because, as Meucci stated in Answer No. 540 of his   deposition: <FONT COLOR="#660000"><I>&#147;experimenting, I found   that I didn&#146;t need a current so strong as the one produced by   many cells; and the current not being too strong, gave better   results in the transmission of the sound&#148;</I></FONT>.</LI></UL><P><HR></P><P><B>Panel B1</B> Fig. A of Meucci's affidavit, reproduced below,shows the layout of his second experiment. This figure is similar tothat of Panel A1, though rotated by 90&#176;, but it is now moreevident that the patient "a" is not traversed by current. The outcomeof this second experiment is described by Meucci in his affidavit asfollows: <FONT COLOR="#660000"><I>&#147;I directed him to speak&#133; I being at the end of the third room, I placed my instrument,covered like his, to my ear. I then heard, while holding this to myear, quite distinctly, the sound of his voice, so much so that Ibelieved it came over the wire. I made him repeat what had saidseveral times, which convinced me that I heard his voice over thewire electrically.&#148;</I></FONT></P><CENTER><IMG SRC="immagini/sec_exp_layout.gif" ALT="Layout of Antonio Meucci 's second experiment for transmission of human voice" WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=458 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P><HR></P><P><B>Panel B2</B> The drawing below (by B. Catania) shows theequivalent circuit of this second experiment. Of course, no variableresistance in the patient's mouth existed any more; instead, thevibration impressed by the patient's voice upon his copper tongueonly produced a variable capacitance C<SUB>1</SUB> that causedsimilar vibrations to be induced in Meucci's copper tongueC<SUB>2</SUB>, as if the two copper tongues were the leaves of a(gold-) leaf electroscope, exploiting the same principle that wouldbe employed, many years later, in the so-called "statictelephone".</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="immagini/sec_exp_eq_ckt.gif" ALT="Equivalent circuit of Antonio Meucci 's second experiment for transmission of human voice" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=148 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>However, the speech transmission quality, featured by Meucci'ssecond experiment, was not (and could not) be as good as that of hisfirst experiment, basically because the powerful principle ofvariable resistance was not exploited. This is confirmed by Meuccihimself in Answer No. 14 of his deposition:<FONT COLOR="#660000"><I>&#147;At the moment that said individualspoke, I received the sound of the word; not distinct, but a murmur&emdash; an inarticulate sound. I caused it to be repeated severaltimes in the same day, and then I tried it again in different days,and I obtained the same result. From this moment this was myimagination, and I recognized that I had obtained the transmission ofthe human word by means of conducting wire united with severalbatteries to produce electricity, and I gave it immediately the nameof "Speaking Telegraph.&#148;</I></FONT></P><P>His above words are a confirmation that Antonio Meucci consideredhis Havana's experiments as marking the discovery of the electricaltransmission of the human voice.</P><P><HR><HR></P><H2>C - in Clifton (first electromagnetic telephone)</H2><P><B>Panel C1</B> In 1850 Meucci left Havana for the United Statesof America and went to live in Clifton (Staten Island), NY. In 1853,his wife, Esther, aggravated her rheumatoid arthritis to the pointthat she seldom could leave her bedroom, in the third floor of thehouse. Esther's illness stimulated the resuming of Meucci's speakingtelegraph, as it would allow her to communicate with him and othersfrom her bedroom. Therefore, between 1854 and 1855, Meucciestablished his first telephone link from Esther's room to thebasement (where he had a small laboratory) and to a larger laboratoryin the yard. To call attention, a traditional (mechanical) call bellwas used, its wires running parallel to those of the telephone. Onlyone instrument was used at each end, that was alternatively broughtto the ear or the mouth of the user. We reproduce below Fig. 12 ofMeucci's deposition, showing the layout of his telephone links.</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="immagini/clifton_first_link.gif" ALT="First telephone link established by Antonio Meucci in Clifton, NY, in 1854-55" WIDTH=478 HEIGHT=268 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR><FONT COLOR="#660000">First telephone link, established by AntonioMeucci in Clifton, between 1854 and 1855</FONT></CENTER><P><HR>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 HEIGHT=297>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=366>         <P><B>Panel C2</B></P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Meucci tried on the above said link very many kinds of         telephones, steadily improving the quality of speech         transmission with respect to that of his "static telephone"         of 1849 in Havana.</P>                  <P>He came to satisfactory results around 1857, when he         constructed an electromagnetic instrument (Fig. A at right,         reproduced from "The Chicago Tribune" of 9 November 1885 ),         in which he used a tempered steel bar "M", permanently         magnetized, and a many-turns bobbin, both of which he bought         from one Charles Chester, a manufacturer of telegraphic         instruments in Centre St., New York.

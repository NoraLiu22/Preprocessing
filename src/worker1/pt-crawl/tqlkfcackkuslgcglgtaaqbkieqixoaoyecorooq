   <td colspan="3"  valign="top"><p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        1754, William Vick, a wealthy Bristol wine merchant, had left <br>
        &pound;1,000 in his will with instructions that the money should be invested 
        until it reached the sum of &pound;10,000, an amount he felt would pay 
        for the construction of a stone bridge across the gorge. The bridge would 
        be free to travellers and would link the hamlet of Clifton and the private 
        estates of Leigh Woods. As the proposed bridge would seem to serve little 
        economic purpose, it is uncertain what Vick&#8217;s motive was in leaving 
        these instructions.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/suspension_bridge/jpegs/suspension_bridge_2.jpg" alt="Brunel&#8217;s winning entry" width="370" height="240"><br>
        <br>
        <font size="1">Brunel&#8217;s winning entry</font><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        By 1829, Vick&#8217;s legacy had reached &pound;8,000 and a committee 
        was set up to decide how to fulfil his dream. It was soon realised that 
        a stone bridge would cost in the region of &pound;90,000. An iron suspension 
        bridge would be cheaper but would still require tolls to cover its cost 
        and maintenance. An Act of Parliament was passed allowing these changes 
        to Vick&#8217;s bequest and on 1 October a competition to design a bridge 
        was announced with a prize of 100 guineas for the winner.<br>
        <br>
        Brunel entered the competition but the result was a shambles: the judge, 
        the distinguished engineer Thomas Telford, dismissed all the entries and 
        was invited to submit his own proposal by the committee. Telford&#8217;s 
        design, a three span bridge supported by Gothic towers (he thought the 
        span too great for a suspension bridge), was derided by the public. A 
        second competition was announced in 1830 and once again Brunel submitted 
        four designs. One of these was originally given second place but Brunel 
        convinced the panel to award him the first prize: this was formally confirmed 
        on 16 March 1831. He wrote to his brother-in-law:<br>
        <br>
        <em>I have to say that of all the wonderful feats I have performed since 
        I have been in this part of the world, I think yesterday I performed the 
        most wonderful. I produced unanimity amongst fifteen men who were quarrelling 
        about the most ticklish subject &#8211; taste.<br>
        <br>
        The Egyptian thing I brought down was quite extravagantly admired by all 
        and unanimously adopted; and I am directed to make such drawings, lithographs, 
        etc as I, in my supreme judgement, may deem fit; indeed, they were not 
        only very liberal with their money, but inclined to save themselves much 
        trouble by placing very complete reliance on me.</em><br>
        <br>
        His design shows that Brunel perceived the bridge in terms of the grand 
        experience of crossing the gorge, of having a landmark presence and of 
        being a gateway to the city. Author Bryan Little has written of the project:<br>
        <br>
        <em>...with his piercing, inventive brain, [Brunel] was as much artist 
        as engineer. His earliest Bristol activity led to the creation of a great 
        engineering feat which he also saw as a conscious work of art&#8230; His 
        essentially artistic conception led on to his more utilitarian, and not 
        less famous work, on the harbour, on steamships, and on the railways.</em><br>
        <br>
        On 21 June 1831, at the ceremony to mark the laying of the <br>
        foundation stone on the Clifton side of the gorge, Sir Abraham Elton, 
        referring to Brunel, said:<br>
        <br>
        <em>The time will come when, as that gentleman walks along the streets 
        or as he passes from city to city, the cry would be raised, &quot;There 
        goes the man who reared that stupendous work, the ornament of Bristol 
        and the wonder of the age&quot;.</em><br>

        In late October that year, Bristol suffered considerable damage and disruption 
        during rioting centred upon Queen Square. Brunel, who was in the city 
        to supervise work on the bridge, served as a special constable during 
        the riot. Business confidence in the city fell and work on the bridge 
        was halted. It did not resume until 1836.<br>
        <br>
        Brunel referred to the Clifton Suspension Bridge as his &#8216;darling&#8217; 
        but financial difficulties and contractual disagreements led to long delays 
        in its construction and the bridge was not completed until 1864, five 
        years after his death and as a memorial to him.<br>

        <font size="1">Brunel's Hungerford Suspension Bridge: demolished to make 
        way for a new bridge at Charing Cross, its chains were used at Clifton<br>
        (Elton Collection: Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust)</font><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The bridge spans 214 metres between its two 26 metre high towers and stands 
        76 metres above the high water mark in the gorge through which the river 
        Avon flows. Modern computer analysis has revealed that in his design of 
        the crucial joints between the 4,200 links that make up the bridge&#8217;s 
        chain, Brunel had made an almost perfect calculation of the minimal weight 
        required to maintain maximum strength (the chains were taken from his 
        bridge at Hungerford which had been demolished). In 2002, it was discovered 
        that the bridge&#8217;s abutments contain a honeycomb of chambers and 
        tunnels, some of which are 11 metres high. It is thought that these spectacular 
        vaults reduced the cost of construction without reducing strength.<br>
        <br>
        Although built for pedestrian and horse drawn traffic, the bridge was 
        so ingeniously constructed that it is now capable of carrying around 4 
        million cars a year, and has become a major route to the motorway network. 
        It is also a structure of great beauty and in 2006 this will be enhanced 
        with a new lighting scheme, to be revealed on the anniversary of Brunel&#8217;s 
        birth.<br>
        <br>
        The Clifton Suspension Bridge is one of Bristol&#8217;s cultural icons 
        and provides perhaps the most easily recognised visual image of the city, 
        being used as a logo on publicity material produced by Destination Bristol 
        and other local bodies. It is symbolic of the city&#8217;s history of 
        building bridges between different communities, places and sectors and 
        its chequered history epitomises the clash between innovation and conservatism 
        that has characterised much of Bristol&#8217;s development.<br>
        <br>
        In 1998, the Clifton Suspension Bridge Trust opened a visitor centre, 
        telling the story of the bridge through exhibitions, photographs, art 
        work, memorabilia, models and interactive displays.<br>

As he swept out of the startled church, the Papal Legate and his entourage stopped at the door and symbolically shook the sullied dust of Eastern Christianity from their Catholic boots. The Pope of Rome had decreed that the Patriarch of Constantinople was denied his place in heaven, and soon afterwards the Patriarch excommunicated the Pope in return.It was the culmination of an argument over a single word in the Nicene Creed - but after a thousand years of being one Church, so began a permanent rift.But what were the real underlying reasons behind the split, what were its effects and why did it take until December 1965 for the excommunications to be finally revoked?With Henrietta Leyser, medieval historian and Fellow of St Peter’s College, Oxford; Norman Housley, Professor of Medieval History at the University of Leicester; Jonathan Shepard, editor of the Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01gn32r.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2010-06-23T15:38:06Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p0054928","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:p0054927","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2003-10-23T00:00:00Z","label":"23 Oct 2003"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"Infinity","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Infinity"},"synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the nature and existence of mathematical infinity.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg discusses a core concept in modern maths which philosophers and mathematicians have continued to grapple with; what is mathematical infinity and does it exist in nature?","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the nature and existence of mathematical infinity.

When confronted with a diagram depicting an infinite solid whose volume was finite, he wrote, “To understand this for sense, it is not required that a man should be a geometrician or logician, but that he should be mad”.

Was he a yeoman, an aristocrat, an anarchist or the figment of a collective imagination?","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the centuries old myth of the most romantic noble outlaw. The first printed version of the Robin Hood story begins like this:“Lithe and Lysten, gentylmen/That be of frebore blodeI shall tell of a good yeman/His name was Robyn Hode/Robyn was a proude outlawe/Whyles he walked on groundeSo curteyse an outlawe as he was one/Was never none yfound”.Robin Hood is described as a ‘yeoman’ – a freeman, and though he is courteous there is not even a hint of the aristocrat he later became. In fact, in the early ballads there is no Maid Marian, no Friar Tuck, Robin does not live in the time of bad Prince John, or the crusades, does not lead a large and merry gang, and certainly never robs the rich to give to the poor. Though he always remains a trickster, and a man with a bow in a wood.Why does this most malleable of myths go through so many changes and so many centuries? And was there ever a real outlaw Robin Hood on whom the ballads, plays, novels and movies are based?With Stephen Knight, Professor of English Literature at Cardiff University and author of Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography; Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York; Dr Juliette Wood, Secretary of the Folklore Society."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01gn2ty.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2010-03-08T14:06:12Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p005492v","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:p005492t","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2003-11-06T00:00:00Z","label":"06 Nov 2003"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"Sensation","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Sensation"},"synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the novels of sensation, a Victorian literary phenomenon.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg discusses the novels of sensation, a literary phenomenon which swept through the Victorian era.","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss sensation, a Victorian literary phenomenon.

He had expected to see the complex pictorial hieroglyphic script the Egyptian establishment had used for over 1000 years, but it seemed that at this very early period, 1700 BC, the mine workers and Semitic slaves had started using a new informal system of graffiti, one which was brilliantly simple, endlessly adaptable and perfectly portable: the Alphabet.

They slept rough, ate simply and gave their lectures in the market place. Perhaps surprisingly, their ideas and attitudes were immensely popular in the ancient world. But how coherent was cynicism as a philosophy? What was its influence on literature and politics and is there any truth to the contention that Jesus himself was influenced by the Cynics?

Thus St Thomas Aquinas described his vocation, not only as a teacher, but also as a Dominican friar and philosopher at the University of Paris. In the 13th century, the religious orders of the Dominicans and the Franciscans were a great force for change in Catholic Europe. They thrived in the emerging towns and cities of the High Middle Ages, leading crusades and changing the way the Church dealt with heretics. They were the evangelists who transformed the Church's preaching of the Christian message to the people. On top of all this, these two orders were also responsible for reconciling Classical and Christian philosophy; their studies of Aristotle paved the way for the Renaissance. They also managed to change the curriculum at the universities of Paris and Oxford. But the Blackfriars and the Greyfriars did not come from the great monasteries of the time; they started out as itinerant preachers surviving upon the charity of the faithful. So how did these two orders come to dominate the spiritual and academic life of the 13th century, and how did they manage to accumulate such huge wealth while professing allegiance to lives of poverty?

William James, along with John Dewey and Charles Sanders Peirce, was the founder of an American philosophical movement which flowered during the last thirty years of the nineteenth century and the first twenty years of the 20th century. It purported that knowledge is only meaningful when coupled with action. Nothing is true or false - it either works or it doesn't. It was a philosophy which was deeply embedded in the reality of life, concerned firstly with the individual's direct experience of the world he inhabited. In essence, practical application was all. But how did Pragmatism harness the huge scientific leap forward that had come with Charles Darwin's ideas on evolution? And how did this dynamic new philosophy challenge the doubts expressed by the Sceptics about the nature and extent of knowledge? Did Pragmatism influence the economic and political ascendancy of America in the early 20th century? And did it also pave the way for the contemporary preoccupation with post-modernism?

Einstein spent the last thirty years of his life trying to find a theory that would unify electromagnetism with gravity, but success eluded him. The search is still on for a unifying theory of gravitational force and hopes are pinned on the location of the graviton - a hypothetical elementary particle that transmits the force of gravity. But the graviton is proving hard to find. Indeed, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN still won't allow us to detect gravitons per se, but might be able to prove their existence in other ways. The idea of the graviton particle first emerged in the middle of the 20th century, when the notion that particles as mediators of force was taken seriously. Physicists believed that it could be applicable to gravity and by the late 20th century the hunt was truly on for the ultimate theory, a theory of quantum gravity. So why is the search for the graviton the major goal of theoretical physics? How will the measurement of gravitation waves help prove its existence?

There are those who have always had robust answers to the questions that those who seek to create artificial intelligence have posed.

And although human language is constrained by experience, this has not stopped an outpouring of artistic, theological and literary representations of heaven. In the early Middle Ages men ascended up a ladder to heaven. In his Divine Comedy, Dante divided heaven into ten layers encompassing the planets and the stars. And the 17th century writer John Bunyan saw the journey of the soul to heaven as a spiritual struggle in his autobiography, The Pilgrim's Progress. But what exactly is heaven and where is it?

Nothing could equal the sublime emotion with which the Agamemnon inspired me; and to the last word of the Eumenides, I remained in an atmosphere so far removed from the present day that I have never since been really able to reconcile myself with modern literature.\" Aeschylus' audience were all familiar with the tale of one man's return home from the Trojan War. Homer's Odyssey recounted Odysseus' perilous journey home, the forceful ejection of the suitors from his household and his reunion with wife Penelope and son Telemachus. Aeschylus had a very different tale of homecoming to tell in his Oresteia. Agamemnon arrives home from Troy to a murderous welcome from a vengeful wife and a cycle of atrocities unfolds in his household. The Oresteia has inspired some of the greatest artists and thinkers of the modern world. From Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche to T.S.

For nearly two and a half thousand years, since Euclid first described the prime numbers in his book Elements, mathematicians have struggled to write a rule to predict what comes next in the sequence. The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler feared that it is \"a mystery into which the human mind will never penetrate.\" But others have been more hopeful... In the middle of the nineteenth century, the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann discovered a connection between prime numbers and a complex mathematical function called the 'zeta function'. Ever since, mathematicians have laboured to prove the existence of this connection and reveal the rules behind the elusive sequence.

For Aristotle, friendship could fall into three categories: it could be based on utility, pleasure or goodness.

In 1759 the British mathematician Francis Maseres wrote that negative numbers \"darken the very whole doctrines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple\". Because of their dark and mysterious nature, Maseres concluded that negative numbers did not exist, as did his contemporary, William Friend. However, other mathematicians were braver. They took a leap into the unknown and decided that negative numbers could be used during calculations, as long as they had disappeared upon reaching the solution. The history of negative numbers is one of stops and starts. The trailblazers were the Chinese who by 100 BC were able to solve simultaneous equations involving negative numbers. The Ancient Greeks rejected negative numbers as absurd, by 600 AD, the Indians had written the rules for the multiplication of negative numbers and 400 years later, Arabic mathematicians realised the importance of negative debt. But it wasn't until the Renaissance that European mathematicians finally began to accept and use these perplexing numbers. Why were negative numbers considered with such suspicion? Why were they such an abstract concept? And how did they finally get accepted?

Published four hundred years ago in Madrid, the book was an immediate success and recognised as one of the classic texts of Western Literature, revered by writers such as Sterne, Goethe, Flaubert, Dostoevsky, Kafka and Melville. Don Quixote tells the story of an unlikely hero - an impoverished country gentleman who goes mad from reading too much and decides to put the world to rights by becoming a knight errant. And so the Knight of La Mancha tilting at windmills with his portly squire astride a donkey is one of the most enduring images in the popular imagination but the simple comedy of the affair belies the fantastically complex, beguiling and sophisticated story on which it is based. As Don Quixote's delusional chivalric ideals bump up against the humdrum of reality and the views of his more earth-bound companion, Sancho Panza.So how has the book endured over the centuries? What was the relationship between Cervantes' work and the world of 17th century Spain in which he lived? In what ways was Don Quixote an interpretation of the age which hitherto had not been articulated? And can it live up to the claim that it was the first European novel?With Barry Ife, Cervantes Professor Emeritus at King's College London; Edwin Williamson, Professor of Spanish Studies at the University of Oxford; Jane Whetnall, Senior Lecturer in Hispanic Studies at Queen Mary, University of London."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01gmz54.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2010-05-20T11:48:16Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p003hydt","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:p003hyds","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2006-03-23T00:00:00Z","label":"23 Mar 2006"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"The Royal Society","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"The Royal Society"},"synopses":{"short":"The history of the formation of the Royal Society, the oldest scientific academy.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg discusses how the formation of the Royal Society heralded the dawning of a new scientific era in the 17th century.","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the formation of the Royal Society. In the 17th century the natural philosopher Francis Bacon heralded the new age of science. The frontispiece to his 1620 edition of the Instauratio Magna depicted a galleon travelling between the metaphorical Pillars of Hercules thought to lie at the Strait of Gibraltar and believed to mark the end of the known world. The image encapsulated Bacon's desire to sail beyond the limits set by Aristotle and the curriculum of the Ancient universities towards the new continent of science. Bacon imagined practical scientists engaged in a collaborative effort to expand knowledge of the natural world. But it was not until the turbulence of the Civil War and Commonwealth years had passed that such a group of scientists would gather together in London for this purpose, and form the Royal Society. Amongst its members were Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren and Isaac Newton, who explicitly rejected dogma and insisted on practical experimentation and observation. How was the Royal Society formed against a backdrop of religious and political strife? What was it about the way this group of men worked that allowed each individual to flourish in his own field? How successful was the Royal Society in disseminating the benefits of experimental science and what is its enduring legacy?

In 1848 the young Parisian Henri Murger wrote of his bohemian friends: Their daily existence is a work of genius…they know how to practise abstinence with all the virtue of an anchorite, but if a slice of fortune falls into their hands you will see them at once mounted on the most ruinous fancies, loving the youngest and prettiest, drinking the oldest and best, and never finding sufficient windows to throw their money out of. Then, when their last crown is dead and buried...they go poaching on all the callings that have any connection with art, hunting from morn till night that wild beast called a five franc piece. Bohemianism meant a life lived for art, it meant sexual liberation and freedom from social constraint, but it also meant dodging the landlord and burning your poems to stay warm. How did the garret-philosophy of the Parisian Latin Quarter take over the drawing rooms of Bloomsbury and Chelsea, and why did a French war with necessity emerge as a British life-style as art?

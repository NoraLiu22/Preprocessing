    <P>&quot;In every city the population has been divided for a
    long time past into the Blue and the Green factions; but within
    comparatively recent times it has come about that, for the sake
    of these names and the seats which the rival factions occupy
    in watching the games, they spend their money and abandon their
    bodies to the most cruel tortures, and even do not think it unworthy
    to die a most shameful death. And they fight against their opponents
    knowning not for what end they imperil themselves, but knowing
    well that, even if they overcome their enemy in the fight, the
    conclusion of the matter for them will be to be carried off straightway
    to the prison, and finally, after suffering extreme torture,
    to be destroyed. So there grows up in them against their fellow
    men a hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it cease
    or disappear, for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage
    nor of relationship nor of friendship, and the case is the same
    even though those who differ with respect to these colours be
    brothers or any other kin. They care neither for things divine
    nor human in comparison with conquering in these struggles; and
    it matters not whether a sacrilege is committed by anyone at
    all against God, or whether the laws and the constitiution are
    violated by friend or by foe; nay even when they are perhaps
    ill supplied with the necessities of life, and when their fatherland
    is in the most pressing need and suffering unjustly, they pay
    no heed if only it is likely to go well with their 'faction';
    for so they name the bands of partisans....so that I, for my
    part, am unable to call this anything except a disease of the
    soul.&quot;</P>

  <P>Although there always had been four factions, the Blues and
  Greens came to predominate. Vitellius and Caracalla both supported
  the Blues. But it is the Greens, first mentioned in AD 35, who
  enjoyed the greatest popularity. Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Verus,
  Commodus, Elagabalus, even the cook in the <I>Satyricon</I> of
  Petronius, all were fervent advocates of the Greens. Marcus Aurelius,
  on the other hand, gives thanks in his <I>Meditations </I>(I.5)
  that he was a partisan of neither faction.</P>
  <P>Suetonius relates that Caligula often would dine with the
  Greens and spend the night in their stables (LV.2) and, for special
  games, have the Circus decorated in red and green (XVIII.3).
  Nero, too, would strew the track with green and wear the colors
  of his team (Dio, LXIII.6.3). Caligula even had his own track,
  the <I>Gaianum</I> (Dio, LIX.14.6), where Vitellius once was
  hit by a chariot while driving with the emperor and injured his
  thigh (Suetonius, XVII.2).</P>
  <P>But imperial enthusiasm also could be deadly. One morning,
  Caligula was so perturbed by the noise of spectators arriving
  early to claim free seats that he ordered the Circus to be cleared.
  There was a riot and a number of people were killed, including
  twenty <I>equites</I> and twenty women (XXVI.4). He also was
  not above poisoning rival horses and charioteers (Dio, LIX.14.5),
  and Caracalla had a charioteer killed because he favored the
  Greens, even though, in his youth, the man had won seven hundred
  and eighty-two races (LXXVIII.1.2). Indeed, says Herodian, the
  emperor once was so infuriated by the crowd jeering his favorite
  charioteer that he sent soldiers into the stands, who arrested
  or killed all they encountered (IV.6.4-6). Vitellius, too, executed
  some of the plebs because he suspected that their disparagement
  of the Blues, in fact, was directed toward him (Suetonius, XIV.3).
  Obviously, such outrageous behavior undermined the <I>civilitas</I>
  that the emperor was expected to demonstrate at the games.</P>
  <P>Courted by the emperors, themselves, some charioteers attained
  power far beyond their station.Caligula once gave a driver two
  million sesterces in gifts (Suetonius, LV.2). One charioteer
  of the Greens befriended by the emperor was allowed use of the
  praetorian guard to build stables (Josephus, <I>Antiquities of
  the Jews</I>, XIX.4.4). Elagabalus, too, was so enamored of a
  charioteer whom he had seen fall from his chariot that &quot;he
  even had greater influence than the emperor himself&quot; (Dio,
  LXXX.15.1-2). The loathsome Tigellinus, who had denounced Petronius
  and is characterized by Tacitus in the<I> Histories</I> (I.72)
  as &quot;A man of humble birth, vicious childhood and dissolute
  maturity,&quot; was appointed praetorian prefect. He had come
  to the attention of Nero because of the quality of the horses
  he was able to provide. And it was in the &quot;circus and theatres,
  where the mob can demonstrate with the greater impunity,&quot;
  that the crowd clamored for his death.</P>
  <P>In the Hippodrome of Constantinople, the violence of the factions
  became even more <A HREF="nika.html">riotous</A>.</P>

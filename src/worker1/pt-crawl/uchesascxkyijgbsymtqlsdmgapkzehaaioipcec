<H4 class="style1"><B>AUTHOR'S NOTE</B></H4>

<P class="style1">Many of the ideas here were
developed and tested in conversations with Evelleen Richards, Stewart
Russell and Ned Woodhouse. Vivien Colless, Richard Donnelly, Steve
Epstein and Les Levidow offered many insightful comments on earlier
drafts of this paper.</P>
<H3 class="style1"><B>Abstract</B></H3>

<H4 class="style1"><I>The author uses personal
experiences to introduce the view that the critique of science, on
entering the academy in the form of the sociology of scientific
knowledge, has become increasingly remote from crucial social issues
and social movements confronting them. By linking their analyses more
with such issues and movements, science studies scholars can serve a
more useful social purpose and also reinvigorate their
theory.</I></H4>

<P class="style1"><BR>
  <BR>
  It was in the early 1970s that I first became involved with the
radical science "movement." I was a Ph.D. student in physics at the
University of Sydney and made contact with Hugh Saddler, recently
returned from London where he had been secretary of the British
Society for Social Responsibility in Science. There was a small
Science for People group in Sydney, named after the magazine of
BSSRS. The group included a few established scientists such as Peter
Mason, Professor of Physics at Macquarie University, some such as
myself among the junior orders of scientists, and a number of
non-scientists.</P>

<P class="style1">In those days, a critique of
science was seen as part of a critique of society. The emphasis was
on political economy, especially an analysis of capitalism. There was
a feeling of change in the air. Associated with the social movements
spawned in the 1960s was the founding of BSSRS -- which soon became
radicalised -- and, in the United States, Science for the People. The
roles of science in imperialism, exploitation of workers, war, racism
and oppression were of central concern.</P>

<P class="style1">Around this time, there were a
number of feminist critiques of science, such as by Shulamith
Firestone and Mary Daly. But it was not until the 1980s that there
were significant <I>groups </I>which adopted a feminist critique of
science. A partial exception was the women's health movement and
associated feminist critiques of medicine, which developed along with
the 1960s second-wave feminist movement. But the women's health
movement mostly ran parallel with the early radical science movement:
each supported but did not embrace the other.</P>

<P class="style1">We read the magazines <I>Science
for People</I> and <I>Science for the People</I>, books and articles
by Bob Young and by Steven and Hilary Rose, and subscribed to the new
<I>Radical Science Journal</I>. There was a party when David Dickson
came to Sydney, shortly after writing his book <I>Alternative
Technology and the Politics of Technical Change</I> and an incisive
article in the first issue of <I>Radical Science Journal </I>(Dickson
1974a, 1974b).</P>

<P class="style1">As I became more familiar with
writing about science, I began to read more of the sociology of
science. The now classic books by Thomas Kuhn (<I>The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions</I>, 1962, 1970) and Jerry Ravetz
(<I>Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems</I>, 1971) had
primed me for a comprehensive analysis of knowledge and power in
science.</P>

<P class="style1">My reading included works in the "sociology of scientific knowledge," epitomised by Barry Barnes' <I>Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory</I> (1974), David
Bloor's <I>Knowledge and Social Imagery</I> (1976) and Michael
Mulkay's <I>Science and the Sociology of Knowledge</I> (1979). The "Edinburgh school," through the journal <I>Social Studies of
Science</I> and associated writings, seemed to promise a more
sophisticated, penetrating critique of science. Yet, as I pondered
Barry Barnes' books, it seemed that the critique was losing touch
with the flesh-and-blood struggles in and over science.</P>

<P class="style1">As the years rolled on, the
sociological treatments of scientific knowledge seemed to me to
become more insular, more disconnected from those early concerns
about the human impact of science. As theory about the practice of
science has become more sophisticated, it has become less accessible
to scientists and activists. Still, it seems radical enough in
principle. It seems that it should be possible to develop some
radical applications from the critical theory.</P>

<P class="style1">My own career has, to some extent,
replicated this process of moving from a critique of science for
scientists to a critique of science for sociologists. After a decade
of postdoctoral scientific research, my position was terminated and I
ended up in a department of "science and technology studies," meaning
the history, philosophy, sociology and politics of science and
technology, with environment and medicine thrown in. A more congenial
milieu could not be imagined. Yet, while the field offers great
intellectual stimulation, the process of academisation of the
critique of science continues apace.</P>

<P class="style1">My aim in this article is to offer
some observations on the evolution of the critique of science and
where it is going. This provides a basis for suggesting resolutions
to some of the theoretical dilemmas in the field and, more
importantly, some opportunities for the future. It should be obvious
that this critique of the critique of science is also a
self-critique, a way of reflecting on my own past and
future.</P>
<H3 class="style1">The <font size="-1" face="Geneva">c</font>ritique of science enters
the academy</H3>

<P class="style1">What can be called the "social
studies of science" is a diffuse field. In the English-speaking
world, at the centre are the social activities whose intellectual
face is represented by the journals <I>Social Studies of Science</I>
and <I>Science, Technology, and Human Values</I>, books by key
practitioners and spillovers into a range of journals in history and
sociology.</P>

<P class="style1">Bluntly speaking, my view is that
much of this professional work on the critique of science can be
interpreted as a process of taking over the insights of the radical
critics, recasting them in an academic and sanitised mould, and
pursuing the dilemmas internal to the resulting intellectual terrain.
Needless to say, this should not necessarily be considered a
conscious process.</P>

<P class="style1">Many of the radical science
activists have been driven by their commitments to a more democratic,
egalitarian and peaceful society, and have worked through various
social movements, including the labour movement, the environmental
movement, the peace movement and the feminist movement. Many of the
academic analysts of science share some of the same goals. But they
differ in method: they prepare their critiques for classrooms,
professional conferences and journals.</P>

<P class="style1">In the process of academisation,
those critics with a more open political agenda are given little
acknowledgement. For example, the magazine <I>Science for the
People</I> has published innumerable incisive critiques of science.
Yet it is a frustrating quest to attempt to find a single reference
to <I>Science for the People</I> in a scholarly analysis of science.
The problem is twofold: <I>Science for the People</I> is openly
political and, in part as a consequence of this, it is not recognised
as a scholarly publication itself, in spite of its many top-flight
contributors and detailed referencing.</P>

<P class="style1">In the 1970s, the left-wing
critics were not entirely ignored. For example, Barry Barnes in
  <I>Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory</I> (1974) discussed
work by Bob Young, among others.</P>

<P class="style1">Sometimes the radical critics were
kept invisible. John Ziman, a prominent scientist, joined the social
science fraternity with a series of defences of science. In his book
  <I>The Force of Knowledge</I> (1976), he stated that "It was all very
well for an enthusiastic bunch of leftists to conceive a Society for
Social Responsibility in Science. After a few years, they converted
this society to other ideological ends, and most of the reputable
scientists resigned." (p. vii). Ziman assumed that doing science and
having an overt, non-orthodox political commitment are incompatible.
But he didn't want to leave the analysis of the links between science
and society to the "leftists," hence his book.</P>

<P class="style1">For Ziman, the critics were a
shadowy source of misconception and misdirection. He never did them
the courtesy of giving them names. For example, Ziman rejected any
analysis that suggested that Darwin's theory was shaped by the ideas
of Malthus: "This is the sort of pitfall that is often encountered in
the game of searching deeply for social and economic influences in
the history of science" (p. 131). Who were the players of this
"game"? Bob Young? Ziman didn't say.</P>

<P class="style1">Of T. H. Huxley, Ziman said, "His
sincere but rather self-conscious religious radicalism mirrors the
naive political radicalism of some of our own distinguished
contemporaries" (p. 138). Hilary and Steven Rose? Ziman didn't
say.</P>

<P class="style1">Ziman at least indicated that
there were some radicals in the field. Even such oblique references
became less frequent in the 1980s. Today, those involved in the
politically articulated critique of science seldom receive even a
Ziman-style acknowledgement.</P>

<P class="style1">For example, Harry Collins, in his
1990 book <I>Artificial Experts: Social Knowledge and Intelligent
Machines</I>, has a long footnote summarising case studies in the
sociology of scientific knowledge. After acknowledging the early work
of Ludwik Fleck, he gets to the brass tacks of citing
contemporaries:</P>

<P class="style1">-- Collins (1975, 1981) on gravity
waves;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Latour and Woolgar (1979) on a
brain peptide;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Pickering (1981) on magnetic
monopoles;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Harvey (1981) on quantum
theory;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Pinch (1981, 1986) on solar
neutrinos;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Travis (1981) on learned
behaviour in worms and rats;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Knorr-Cetina (1981) on a food
research laboratory;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Rudwick (1985) on
geology;</P>

<P class="style1">-- Shapin and Schaffer (1985) on
Robert Boyle and vacuum pumps.</P>

<P class="style1">Of contemporaries, Collins has
pride of place. It is his story, after all. Somewhere along the line,
earlier works by Young (1969, 1971, 1973), Forman (1971), various
authors in <I>Radical Science Journal</I> and in Rose and Rose
(1976a, 1976b) or even the vulgar Hessen (1931) seem to have
disappeared -- even when published in mainstream journals. No doubt
they have been defined as not really being sociology of scientific
knowledge.</P>

<P class="style1">Collins also lists some of the
inspirations behind post-Kuhnian studies, naming Kuhn himself,
Feyerabend, Wittgenstein, ethnomethodology and phenomenology. All
these are properly anchored in the world of scholarship. The
tradition of radical political critique of science in the late 1960s
and early 1970s is omitted from Collins' account. In essence, Collins
presents the sociology of scientific knowledge as a history of ideas,
a history of scholastic traditions, with no suggestion that it is
also a history of social movements and class, gender and racial
struggle.</P>

<P class="style1">Note also the topics treated by
the authors cited by Collins. Nearly every one is "internal" to the
scientific community, in the sense that public debates and "external"
social groups played little overt role. Kuhn and others, attacking
the "internalist" history of scientific ideas, opened the possibility
of a comprehensive analysis of science in society, or rather of
"science-society." (Kuhn himself retreated from the radical
possibilities.) Ironically, the contemporary contextualist
sociologists of scientific knowledge -- the successors of the Kuhnian
challenge to internalism -- look primarily at issues whose social
dynamics are mainly internal to the scientific community (Rowse
1986).</P>

<P class="style1">Lack of acknowledgement of radical
or activist origins<A HREF="#fn1">&#91;1&#93;</A>
is symptomatic of the process by which academics use the critique of
science for professional purposes, distancing it from working
scientists and activists dealing with the impact of science. The
process of academisation has seen a move from a critique of science
in society to a critique of scientific knowledge and finally to a
critique of the knower. This has led to antiseptic concerns about the
way scientists persuade each other about what is a fact, the
discourse of sociologists (who are studying scientists), and the
epistemological basis for the knowledge of sociologists (who are
studying scientists). (The details of theoretical twists and turns
are omitted here to spare the reader.)</P>
<H3 class="style1">Who benefits from science
studies?</H3>

<P class="style1">The answer to this question is
pretty easy when it comes to that prosperous branch of the field
called science policy. "Policy," by consensus and virtually by
definition, refers to decision-making by government and perhaps
industry. Policy researchers are on to a good thing: large contracts
and consultancies from government and industry, and lots of status as
being the people dealing with the "real world."</P>

<P class="style1">It is a common observation that
science policy workers are seldom critical of the fundamental
assumptions underlying their field. They may question particular
policies, of course. What is unquestioned is that policy is something
decided at the level of government and industry, with perhaps some
mechanism for responding to pressure groups. It is no surprise that
policy researchers and advisors adapt to this environment, since that
is where their money and status come from. Those who are
theoretically inclined will note that this assessment also follows
from the sociology of knowledge.</P>

<P class="style1">If policy is conceived as
something carried out by government and industry, then it is
perfectly obvious that working in a women's group, a trade union or
an environmental group cannot be considered "science policy" (Bammer
et al. 1986). There is little status and even less money to be gained
by consorting with such groups.</P>

<P class="style1">Indeed, getting involved with a
community action group can be rather suspect: it smacks of making a
social commitment, which is hard to reconcile with either positivism
or relativism. Similar concerns are seldom articulated about those
who get involved with government or industry policy, although that
too may involve some sort of a "commitment." Apparently, commitment
to one's career or serving powerful groups is honoured while
commitment where there is no money is suspicious.</P>

<P class="style1">The question, "Who benefits from
science studies?," is harder to answer when it comes to the more
academic treatments in scholarly journals. Most obviously, this work
is useful to the academics themselves, since they get publications,
status, visits to conferences and, in some cases, jobs and
promotions.</P>

<P class="style1">But is there some wider use to
this research? In particular, is there anything useful to members of
social movements?</P>

<P class="style1">If you talk to activists in social
movements -- including those who are well-read -- you will be lucky
to find anyone who has even heard of professional work on the
critique of science. Perhaps some of the work could be useful, but
most of it is couched in an inaccessible academic style and deals
with topics of peripheral interest. Why would a social activist be
interested in the social construction of gravity waves or fluorescent
lights, anyway?<A HREF="#fn2">&#91;2&#93;</A></P>

<P class="style1">Consider some of the crucial
problems of the world today.</P>

<P class="style1"><B>* War.</B> Considering the
usual statistic that a quarter or half of the world's scientists and
engineers are engaged on military research and development, there has
been remarkably little attention to military science and technology.
To find some pungent critiques (as contrasted with "policy studies"),
it is necessary to go back decades (Bernal 1939; Clarke
1971).</P>

<P class="style1">A partial exception is Donald
MacKenzie's (1990) careful analysis of the social construction of
nuclear missile accuracy. This work, inspired by peace movement
concerns, is among the most insightful in science studies today. But
for all that, it really has little relevance to the peace movement.
After all, questioning of nuclear missile accuracy is not new. In any
case, what great difference does it make to peace activists, even if
they had time to read MacKenzie's scholarly
treatments?<A HREF="#fn3">&#91;3&#93;</A></P>

<P class="style1"><B>* Repression.</B> In many
countries around the world, governments are routinely involved in
surveillance, harassment, imprisonment, torture and killing of
dissidents. Science and technology are heavily involved. The science
studies community seems to have ignored this area, unless the work of
a BSSRS group is counted (Ackroyd et al. 1977; BSSRS
1985).</P>

<P class="style1"><B>* Poverty and inequality.</B>
Science and technology are very much involved in struggles over
wealth and its distribution, via technology transfer, the green
revolution, ownership of information, workplace technologies,
ideologies of the market, and many others (Third World Network,
1988). What was the last article in a science studies journal that
centrally addressed the role of science and technology in creating or
challenging poverty and inequality?</P>

<P class="style1"><B>* Patriarchy.</B> Feminist
critique is thriving, but has made little impact in the central
science studies journals (Delamont 1987). Is it only coincidence that
almost all the leading figures in the sociology of scientific
knowledge are men?</P>

<P class="style1"><B>* Environment and health.</B>
This is one area where critiques of science abound: analyses of
nuclear power, risk assessment, chemical hazards, etc. Why is this?
Is it, perhaps, because social movements have made this into a
respectable area, taken seriously even by white middle-class men? I
don't know the answer, and there is certainly something worthwhile to
be learned about why the critique of science has been applied in a
more sustained and penetrating fashion to environmental and health
issues than the topics mentioned above. Unfortunately, only a
fraction of the scholarly treatments are of the slightest use to the
front-line participants.</P>

<CENTER class="style1"># # #</CENTER>

<P class="style1">So far I've talked about direct
research on issues of concern to social activists. But there is
another influence here, more indirect but more pervasive: teaching.
Many scholars have their greatest influence through their classrooms
and students. They present critical perspectives on science which are
uncommon in orthodox science texts and classes.</P>

<P class="style1">It is possible to postulate a "trickle-down" effect in spreading the critique of science. After
leading theorists publish esoteric articles in erudite journals,
their ideas are presented by their peers in a more accessible form in
classrooms. Since some students are involved in activist groups, in
this way the high-level critique gains practical
relevance.</P>

<P class="style1">The metaphor of trickle-down has
certain attractions to theorists. It says, go ahead with remote
theorising; the intellectual system will ensure that worthy groups
benefit. Unfortunately, there is little evidence for such a process.
The only obvious case of trickle-down is the popularity of Kuhn's
concepts of paradigm and revolution in numerous arenas outside the
traditional scientific disciplines which Kuhn studied. This sort of "vulgar Kuhn" is castigated by many of today's experts who propound a
more sophisticated -- and difficult to apply -- post-Kuhnian
sociology of scientific knowledge.</P>

<P class="style1">But the impact of teaching is not
dependent on the trickle-down effect. Teachers in science studies
simply need to deal with issues that have meaning for students. Quite
a number of these students are refugees from science, looking for
some relevance and application for fields that hold much promise but
seem to serve only vested interests. Science studies gives hope of
something different.</P>

<P class="style1">But is there some insight for
students that they could not gain by reading critiques from the early
1970s by Bob Young, David Dickson, and Hilary and Steven Rose? The
danger for advanced students is getting caught in the bog of current
theory.</P>
<H3 class="style1">Theoretical dead ends</H3>

<P class="style1">Some socially concerned theorists
have the dream of developing an analysis that, because of its
penetrating insights, is a decisive contribution to progressive
social change. More academically-minded theorists have the parallel
dream of developing an analysis that is a decisive contribution to
social understanding. In either case, the goal is incredibly elusive,
because it misconceives the relation between theory and
practice.</P>

<P class="style1">One aspect of this quest is
disputes about epistemology and the role of the researcher. Steven
Rose, a radical in terms of politics, takes a traditional
epistemological line. For example, he condemns sociobiology as bad
science as well as bad politics. Like orthodox scientists, he draws
on the authority of science to attack those whose politics he
opposes. The role of the social researcher, from this point of view,
is to align oneself with those who do good science. It is usually
assumed, or hoped, that this is also the side of "good" politics.</P>

<P class="style1">The sociologists of scientific
knowledge have rejected this form of analysis. They call for a social
analysis of all science, whether it was "bad" or "good." David
Bloor's "strong programme in the sociology of scientific knowledge" laid out the principles of analysis: causality, symmetry, etc. It
also set the pattern for the role of the analyst, who was to be a
professional social scientist writing for social science journals in
social science jargon. Adherents to the strong programme were not
supposed to become passionate partisans in the debates they
studied.</P>

<P class="style1">The strong programme was built on
the assumption that the analyst was above the debate, rather than
involved in it. The weak programme,<A HREF="#fn4">&#91;4&#93;</A>
presented by Daryl Chubin and Sal Restivo (1983), attempted to go
beyond this. It recognised that analysts were always involved in the
issues they studied. But the weak programme was indeed weak when it
came to articulating a role for a socially concerned
theorist.</P>

<P class="style1">Whatever its practical weaknesses,
the weak programme was an aberration. In recognising and recommending
involvement by analysts in the practicalities of science "policy," it
was out of step with the main line of development. The dominant
theoretical thrusts were towards analysis of the role of the analyst.
"Discourse analysis" tried to expose the author's role in writing.
Bruno Latour in <I>Science in Action</I> (1987) presented an "action" framework neatly disconnected from political critique and political
action.<A HREF="#fn5">&#91;5&#93;</A> Steve Woolgar (1983) has demanded attention to "the problem" of the
relation between the knower and the known, an issue in epistemology
rather than power.</P>

<P class="style1">This narrowing of theoretical
focus is congruent with a shift in commitment by the analysts.
Earlier writers with an overt political commitment, such as the
Roses, analysed large-scale political-economic interests linked to
science. Sociology-of-scientific-knowledge theorists are more likely
to conceive of "interests" as the micro-level interests associated
with games of individual persuasion and advancement, such as a
scientist's "interest" in getting a paper published. Both approaches
are "political." The first deals with politics in the familiar public
sense. The second deals with the politics of individual promotion.
The shift is compatible with the career science studies academics'
greater preoccupation with personal interests than social
interests.</P>

<P class="style1">For students looking for a
critique that can provide help for social action, recent theoretical
developments can be incredibly frustrating. The frustration is
inevitable, because creating social change by extending the analysis
is impossible.</P>

<P class="style1">The flaw in the theoretical search
is the assumption that a grounding for analysis can be founded on
ideas alone. Analysis ultimately depends on practice. The analysis by
academics for the most part reflects a practice of professional
advancement and scholarly theorising. An analysis relevant to social
problems must be linked to a relevant practice.</P>

<P class="style1">All analyses are de facto -- if
not overt -- interventions. The question is not how to intervene, but
what sort of intervention, what audience, and who
benefits.</P>
<H3 class="style1">Conclusion</H3>

<P class="style1">The taming of science studies by
its academic context is nothing new. Similar processes are well
documented in the evolution of more traditional social science
disciplines (Collins 1979; Furner 1975; Schwendinger and Schwendinger
1974; Silva and Slaughter 1984). The radical activists are cast
adrift from the discipline in the mainstream quest for job security
and status, which are achieved through professionalisation and
specialisation. Just as politics has become the study of government
and economics has become the study of capitalism, so science studies
has become the study of science as it is serving society as it is:
the radical critique and the development of alternatives have fallen
by the wayside.</P>

<P class="style1">It is necessary to repeat a
familiar question: in the words of Robert S. Lynd (1939), "Knowledge
for what?" The early radical critics of science had a vision of a
better society and argued that changing fundamental aspects of
"science-society" was an essential part of getting there. Today,
"science policy" seeks to reform society by refining operations
within existing social structures. Science studies has abjured even
that modest social aim. Its search for a better understanding of
science is intellectual, channelled towards academic ends.</P>

<P class="style1">Yet, just as in the disciplines of
politics and economics, science studies remains a contested field,
with social movements as well as dominant power structures having an
impact on theory and practice. For those who favour a more activist
critique of science, I offer the following suggestions.</P>

<P class="style1">* Talk to people to find out
whether there is any social analysis of science and technology that
they think would be useful. That means talking to people who are
directly involved with the issues. Rather than studying things that
are "intellectually interesting," the aim should be to find what is
intellectually stimulating about things that people consider
important.</P>

<P class="style1">* Practise writing in a more
accessible fashion. Learn from journalists and from authors such as
Theodore Roszak and Langdon Winner.</P>

<P class="style1">* Try to publish in journals for
practitioners, not just in journals for social science peers. Try
  <I>Science</I>, <I>Nature</I>, <I>New Scientist</I>, and
<I>Technology Review</I>.</P>

<P class="style1">* Do research and write about an
area that is becoming hot, or investigate an area to make it hot.
Political analysis can be embedded in a discussion that is read
because of the subject matter.</P>

<P class="style1">* Aim to write practical materials
that can be taken up by practitioners or activists and applied in
day-to-day situations.</P>

<P class="style1">* Undertake "action research." This means integrating social and intellectual goals and
methods.</P>

<P class="style1">* Become a member of a social
action group and work with others to apply the analysis of science
and technology in ongoing campaigns or the development of new
campaigns.</P>

<P class="style1">Note that every one of these
suggestions could apply just as well to social science research that
serves dominant interests as to research which serves relatively
powerless groups. The choice of whom to serve -- not theoretical
sophistication -- is a key issue.</P>

<P class="style1">But wait -- a final reservation.
Do we really want to go back to the partisan analyses and
expos&eacute;s of the 1960s, with their simplistic treatment of
epistemology? Surely it is not good enough just to be a crass
partisan, thereby losing both critical finesse and the status of
being an ostensibly objective analyst? Well, yes, I agree that it
would be desirable to develop a critique that is both
epistemologically sophisticated and socially relevant, and also
self-critical about its own method and social location. I look
forward to analyses that fill all these specifications. But for those
of us who are not superhuman, I suspect it is more appropriate to set
less exalted goals.</P>
<H3 class="style1">Notes</H3>

<P class="style1"><A NAME=fn1></A>1 Since writing
this, I have come across an interview (Darnovsky 1991: 75-77) in
which Donna Haraway makes the same point most forcefully.</P>

<P class="style1"><A NAME=fn2></A>2 This is not to
say that activists require spoon-feeding with material that is
immediately applicable. But they, like any of us, need to be able to
see relevance at some level to their key concerns. The academic
literature seldom spells out the links between critique and
application. Do the links exist?</P>

<P class="style1"><A NAME=fn3></A>3 At the end of
his book, MacKenzie has some nice comments about thinking about a
world with no nuclear weapons, but his in-depth analysis of missile
guidance is not a prerequisite for these observations.</P>

<P class="style1">Undoubtedly, there are some
insights in MacKenzie's book and related articles that would be
welcomed by activists. The trouble is that these insights are not
highlighted by MacKenzie, whose hefty tome and formal language makes
the book rather unlikely reading for anyone except a scholar with
plenty of free time.</P>

<P class="style1"><A NAME=fn4></A>4 The name "weak
programme" was a cute challenge to the "strong programme", since
Chubin and Restivo believed that the so-called weak force in physics
was stronger than the "strong force". Actually, the relative strength
of the strong and weak forces depends on location, a relation which
is a better metaphor for the relative strengths of the strong and
weak programmes anyway.</P>

<P class="style1"><A NAME=fn5></A>5 Steve Epstein
(personal communication, 22 January 1992) commented to me that
Latour, like other micro theorists) "starts with discourses, texts,
laboratories, and the local construction of interests, but (unlike
those theorists) works his way outward to develop what by the final
chapter is a sketch of Western imperialism as historical cause and
consequence of the power of the laboratory." In this way, he uses the
micro to deal with wider issues. I agree that there is radical
potential in Latour's approach -- as, indeed, there is in many
approaches, even seemingly conservative ones. But so far I've seen
little evidence that Latourian analysis has any attraction or use
outside academic circles.</P>

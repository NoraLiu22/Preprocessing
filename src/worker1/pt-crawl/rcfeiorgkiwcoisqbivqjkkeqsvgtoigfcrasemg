<p class="one">The brother of well-known <em>fin de siècle</em>​illustrator  
<a href="../brock/index.html">Henry Matthew Brock</a> (illustrator of the Gresham 
Imperial edition volume of <span class="book">Great Expectations</span>, 1901-3), Charles 
Edmund Brock  was a widely published English line artist​ and book illustrator, who 
signed his work "<em>C. E. Brock</em>."​Noted for the quality of his line drawings in 
the manner of the early Victorian illustrators, he was the eldest of four artist 
brothers, sons of a specialist reader in oriental languages for Cambridge University 
Press. With his better known brother, H. M., Charles Edward, and Richard Brock shared a 
studio, in which they gathered eighteenth- and nineteenth-century artefacts and curios to 
use in their drawings,​paintings, and book illustrations. Having trained in the studio of 
Henry Wiles, their careers began in the early 1890s at Macmillan. Like his brother, E. C. 
Brock contributed to <a href="../../../periodicals/punch/pva44.html"><span 
class="book">Punch</span></a>, but Charles Edmund was also a recognized painter in oils. 
Moreover, he illustrated Dickens's <span class="book">Christmas Books</span> — <span 
class="book">A Christmas Carol</span>, <span class="book">The Cricket on the 
Hearth</span>, <span class="book">The Haunted Man</span>, and <span class="book">The 
Battle of Life</span>, as well as an edition of <span class="book">The Posthumous Papers 
of the Pickwick Club</span>, various novels by Jane Austen, Jonathan Swift's <span 
class="book">Gulliver's Travels</span>, Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="book">Vicar of 
Wakefield</span>, Thomas Hood's poems, Lamb's essays, volumes of Greek and Norse myths, 
and the Bible.</p>

<p>Although <a href="../leech/index.html">John Leech</a>, Dickens's original <span 
class="book">Carol</span> illustrator, did not make much of the Cratchits, depicting Bob 
just once, in the tailpiece, later illustrators in general and Brock in particular have 
recognized the importance of Cratchit family values in this tale of redemption and social 
reintegration. Here, Brock depicts Mrs. Cratchit's serving her culinary triumph, the 
wonderful Christmas pudding, to the manifold compliments of her adoring family. Although 
his visualisations are often congruent with those of Leech, Brock consistently depicts 
the characters in a naturalistic rather than caricatural vein, and emphasizes the 
presence of children in five of the sixteen plates that graph Scrooge's spiritual and 
social redemption. — <a href="../../../misc/pvabio.html">Philip V. Allingham</a></p>

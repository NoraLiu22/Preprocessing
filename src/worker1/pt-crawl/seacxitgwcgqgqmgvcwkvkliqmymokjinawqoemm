<h3>John Sloan: Portraitist, Landscapist, Illustrator, and Observer of New York Life 
(1871-1933)</h3>

<p class="one">John French Sloan (2 August 1871-7 September 1951),​ New York City painter 
and etcher,​ was a founding member of the Ashcan school of American art, and a member of 
the group of painters who called themselves "The Eight."​ Although he was a successful 
book illustrator, his best known works are genre paintings of urban scenes which he 
recorded as he observed his New York City neighbourhood outside the window of his Chelsea 
studio. In his paintings he focussed on "the drab, shabby, happy, sad, and human life"​of 
New York City, particularly pedestrians,​during the early part of the twentieth century. 
Sloan was also a highly capable book-illustrator, landscape artist,​and painter of 
portraits. Although his study of the reactions of Gabriel Betteredge, Rachel Verinder, 
Godfrey Ablewhite, and Franklin Blake to the Moonstone may be compared to that of 
contemporary British Illustrator Alfred Pearse's <a href="../pearse/2.html"><span 
class="illustration">"'Exquisite! exquisite!'"</span></a> (1910), Sloan's choice of 
subject was in no way influenced by the 1910 half-tone lithograph, which Sloan's 
illustration predates by two years. His other choices, however, suggest that he may have 
seen the original serial illustrations, either in <span class="book">Harper's 
Weekly</span> for 1868 or in the Harper and Brothers volume published in July 1868, and 
re-printed in the fall of 1873.</p>

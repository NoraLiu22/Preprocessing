<H2> <A NAME="103.0">103</A>:  Charax of Pergamum </H2>
<P><I>Charax lived in the 2nd century A.D., and wrote various books about Greek and Roman history. Most of the surviving fragments have been preserved in quotations by <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanus_of_Byzantium">Stephanus of Byzantium</A>.</I>

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.3">[3]</A> &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">{CONSTANT. PORPHYR.}</FONT> &nbsp; <I>[Charax], in book 3 of his Hellenica, says that [Spain] was called Iberia</I>: &nbsp; At first the Greek called Spain Iberia, when they had not yet learnt the name of the whole nation, but from that part of the county which is near the river Iber and is named after it, they called the whole country by the same name. &nbsp; <I>He says that it was later renamed Pania.</I>

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.4">[4]</A> &nbsp; <I>Ph&#275;geia: a city of Arcadia, named after king Phegeus, as Charax says in book 4 of his Hellenica</I>: &nbsp; Phegeus the brother of Phoroneus founded the city of Phegeia, which was previously called Erymanthus, and was later names Psophis, as we have discovered, from his mother . . .  

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.5">[5]</A> &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">{SCHOL. ARISTOPH.}</FONT> &nbsp; <I> Charax in book 4 says as follows</I>: &nbsp; Agamedes, the ruler of Stympalus in Arcadia, married Epicaste, who had an illegitimate son, Trophonius. They surpassed all their comtemporaries in craftmanship, and they were hired to build the temple at Delphi. In Elis they built a treasury of gold for Augeias; but they left out a stone joint, so that they could go in there at night and steal the money, along with Cercyon, who was the legitimate son of Agamedes and Epicaste. Augeias was at a complete loss and he begged Daedalus, who was staying there because of Minos, to track down the thief. Daedalus made some traps, into which Agamedes fell and was killed. Trophonius cut off his head to prevent him from being recognised, and fled to to Orchomenus with Cercyon. When Augeias, as instructed by Daedalus, pursued them for the shedding of blood, Cercyon fled to Athens - Callimachus says, "who fled from Arcadia, and dwells here as our evil neighbour" - and Trophonius fled to Lebadeia in Boeotia, where he stayed, making his home in a cavern. When he died, it became a definite oracle for them, and they sacrificed to him as to a god. He left a son called Alexander.   

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.6">[6]</A> &nbsp; <I>Dorion: . . . Charax mentions the Thessalian Doris, writing as follows about Thessalus son of Aeatus, who defeated the Boeotians at Arn&#275;</I>: &nbsp; And Thessalus did not change the fourth section from its existing name, but allowed it to be called Histiaeotis as before; it lies to the west of Mount Pindus. It was assigned to Dorus son of Hellen at first, and was previously called Doris from him; but it was later renamed Histiaeotis.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.13">[13]</A> &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">{ANON. PARADOXOGR.}</FONT> &nbsp; <I>Concerning Io</I>. &nbsp; Io the daughter of Arestor was priestess of Hera. Before she was married, her father perceived that she was pregnant - because she no longer had the appearance of a virgin, but she she seemed by the peak of love-making  to become larger and more beautiful than she was before, so that she was called Cow - and in his indignation he kept her emprisoned, and appointed Argus, who was her mother's brother, to be her guard. Argus, who was unsleeping and very watchful, gave her no chance of escaping; and he was therefore given the name Panoptes {"all-seeing"}. One of the local inhabitants, Hermaon, with Io's approval secretly killed Argus. After being freed in this way, she fled with her accomplices and boarded a cargo ship. The ship was carried away by a storm onto the sea which is called the Ionian Sea, and after many wanderings she was brought to A&euml;ria, where she was considered to be a goddess because of her beauty. &nbsp; <I>This is the account of Charax in his Chronica.</I>

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.13">[13]</A> &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">{ANON. PARADOXOGR.}</FONT> &nbsp; <I>Concerning Dionysus. Charax says as follows</I>. &nbsp; Semele the daugher of Cadmus became pregnant before she was married, and during childbirth she was struck by lightning; she was destroyed, but the child survived. Therefore, as is said of those who are struck by lightning, she was thought to have obtained the status of a goddess, and they called her Thy&#333;ne. The boy, who seemed very god-like, was reared by Cadmus since he had been saved from the fire, and he gave him the ancestral name of Egyptian Dionysus.  

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.15">[15]</A> &nbsp; <I>Parrhasia: a city of Arcadia . . . it was named after Parrhasus, one of the sons of Lycaon. Charax says that it was founded by Pelasgus, in book 1 of his Chronica, as follows</I>: &nbsp; Pelasgus, son of Arestor son of Ecbasus son of Argus, migrated from Argos to the place which was then called Pelasgia from him, but was later called Arcadia. He reigned for 25 years and founded the city of Parrhasia. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.18">[18]</A> &nbsp; <I>Hephaestia: a city on Lemnos. Hecataeus mentions it in his Europ&#275;. Ethnic: Hephaestieus. Charax in book 4 of his Chronica says</I>: &nbsp; The Myrinaeans, taking no account of the promises made by the Pelasgians, shut their gates against Militiades, and he subjected them to a siege. Hermon, the tyrants of the Hephaestians, was afraid of the power of the Persians. He said that, to please the Athenians who were their friends, he would fulfil the promises made by the Pelasgians, and he surrendered the city without a fight.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.19">[19]</A> &nbsp; <I>&#332;reus: . . . Charax mentions the ethnic in book 6 of his Chronica</I>: &nbsp; The Athenians, along with the Chalcidians of Euboea and the Megarians, sent an expedition to Oreus. They liberated the Oreitans after killing Philistides, their tyrant.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.26">[26]</A> &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">{CONSTANT. PORPHYR.}</FONT> &nbsp; <I>Charax mentions this place in book 6 of his Chronica</I>: &nbsp; In Little Further Spain, the Lusitanians again rebelled, and the Romans sent Quintus as general against them.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.27">[27]</A> &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">{CONSTANT. PORPHYR.}</FONT> &nbsp; <I> The same writer in the same place says about the two [Spains]</I>: &nbsp; Quintus, the commander of the Romans in both the Spains, was defeated by Viriathus and made a treaty with him. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.29">[29]</A> &nbsp; <I> Dorus:  . . . and Charax mentions it in book 21</I>:  &nbsp; Tryphon, who was besieged by Antiochus in Dorus, a city of Coele Syria, fled to Ptolemais, also known as Ac&#275;.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="103.44">[44]</A> &nbsp; <I> Egypt: both the country and the river. It was was named after Aegyptus, as Charax says</I>: &nbsp; [Aegyptus], the son of Belus and A&euml;ria also known as Potamitis, who reigned for 43 years . . .

<P><I>A few fragments of this history have survived on a papyrus of the 2nd century A.D. ( P.Oxy. 1798 ). Of these, the best preserved is fr. 44, which describes some events of 333 B.C. &nbsp; The translation is taken from "Oxyrhynchus Papyri", volume 15.</I>

When he saw that the decision was imminent Alexander was in a torment of suspense and had recourse to prayer, calling on Thetis and the Nereids and Nereus and Poseidon, for the last of whom he ordered that a four-horse chariot should be brought and cast into the sea; and he offered sacrifices by night . . .

<P><I>This is an anonymous summary of events after the death of Alexander, from 323 to 316 B.C.</I>
<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="155.1">[1]</A> When <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A> died, he left behind his wives and an unborn son by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/roxane.html#1">Roxane</A>.  His followers quarrelled about who should become king, but Alexander's half-brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arrhidaeus.html#1">Arrhidaeus</A>, who was later called Philippus, was appointed to be king until the son of Alexander reached an appropriate age. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Because Arrhidaeus was dull-witted, and also epileptic, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/perdiccas.html#4">Perdiccas</A> was appointed to be guardian and overseer of the royal government.  Alexander had given his ring to Perdiccas before he died, considering him to be more trustworthy than the other generals.  After due consideration, Perdiccas divided the empire into more than 24 satrapies, and gave each of the generals a satrapy to govern. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> So they went out to the satrapies which had been allotted to each of them, but still tried to extend their power to other territories whenever possible.  Then Perdiccas gathered a large force and marched against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A> in Egypt, but there some of his officers plotted against him and murdered him. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Then <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antipater.html#1">Antipater</A> took over as guardian of the kings, and he also after due consideration changed the satrapies which had been allotted by Perdiccas, giving them to others to govern, except for the satrapies of Ptolemy and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysimachus.html#1">Lysimachus</A>, which he could not alter.  Amongst others, he gave the satrapy of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/susiana.html#1">Susiana</A> to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigenes.html#1">Antigonus</A>, and the satrapy of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/babylon.html#1">Babylon</A> to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#1">Seleucus</A>; and he appointed his own son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cassander.html#1">Cassander</A> to be chiliarch.
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Then after a while Antipater died, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/polyperchon.html#1">Polysperchon</A> took over as guardian and overseer of the royal government.

This happened in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonia</A> [(?) after the death] of Olympias the mother of Alexander. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> As a result there was confusion in the satrapies.  The officers plotted against each other and added other territory to their own.  The more ruthless ones put together large forces and killed the weaker ones.  <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#1">Antigonus</A>, who together with his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demetrius.html#1">Demetrius</A> Poliorcetes gained greater power than the others, called himself king and started to wear a diadem.

They were Ptolemy in Egypt and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syria.html#1">Syria</A>; Lysimachus in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrace.html#1">Thrace</A>; and Seleucus in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/babylonia.html#1">Babylonia</A>, who became king of all <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#2">Asia</A> after the death of Antigonus.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="155.2">[2]</A> After the death of Alexander, the Macedonians carried his body from Babylon to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandria.html#1">Alexandria</A>.  They adorned the body lavishly, with great expense and fine workmanship in silver and gold.  They accompanied the body with a large and abundant bodyguard.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Then they sent Roxane to Macedonia, along with the son whom she bore to Alexander, who was also called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#4">Alexander</A>.  They also sent over Philippus Arrhidaeus, who ruled with guardians for a total of six years and four months, until he and his wife Eurydice were cruelly killed by his stepmother Olympias.  Shortly afterwards Olympias herself, along with [Alexander's] widow Roxane and her son Alexander, were cruelly killed by Cassander the son of Antipater.  <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> After all these murders, Cassander married <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thessalonice.html#1">Thessalonice</A> the stepsister of Alexander the Great, who later founded the city of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thessalonice.html#2">Thessalonice</A>.

He often fought against those who were opposing the royal government, and won many great victories over some of the greatest generals of the Macedonians.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Then, since Antigonus was ambitiously increasing his power and wished even to take the name of king for himself, the royal family, Olympias, Philippus Arrhidaeus and Roxane, sent a royal summons asking Eumenes to come to their aid.  Eumenes was moved by their request.  He went off to the satrapies on the far side of Babylonia, and after collecting a large army from there he made war against Antigonus.  He won two or three victories, and would perhaps have completely defeated him, if he had not been seized and handed over to Antigonus by some of his own friends, who had formed a plot against Eumenes.  After this, Antigonus became extremely powerful and was completely irresistible

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> Perdiccas, intriguing against Antigonus, called him to judgment, but Antigonus, aware of the plot, refused to appear. This led to enmity between them. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> At the same time <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/iollas.html#1">Iollas</A> and Archias came to Perdiccas from Macedonia, accompanied by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicaea.html#4">Nicaea</A>, the daughter of Antipater, with a proposal of marriage. Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, also sent to him, offering him the hand of her daughter Cleopatra. Eumenes of Cardia favoured Cleopatra, but his brother Alcetas persuaded him to accept Nicaea. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> Soon afterwards <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cynane.html#1">Cynane</A> was put to death by Perdiccas and his brother Alcetas.

This Amyntas was the son of Perdiccas the brother of Philippus, so that he was the cousin of Alexander. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> Cynane brought her daughter Adea (afterwards called Eurydice) to Asia and offered her hand to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arrhidaeus.html#1">Arrhidaeus</A>. The marriage subsequently took place, with the approval of Perdiccas, to appease the increasing indignation of the soldiery, which had been aroused by the death of Cynane. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> Antigonus, in the meantime, took refuge with Antipater and Craterus in Macedonia, informed them of the intrigues of Perdiccas against him, declaring that they were directed against all alike. He also described the death of Cynane in such exaggerated terms that he persuaded them to make war on Perdiccas. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> Arrhidaeus, who kept the body of Alexander with him, contrary to the wish of Perdiccas, took it from Babylon by way of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/damascus.html#1">Damascus</A> to Ptolemy the son of Lagus in Egypt; and though often hindered on his journey by Polemon, a friend of Perdiccas, nevertheless succeeded in carrying out his intention. </P>
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> Meanwhile, Eumenes conveyed gifts from Perdiccas to Cleopatra at Sardis, since Perdiccas had decided to repudiate Nicaea and to marry Cleopatra. When this became known to Antigonus through Menander the governor of Lydia, he informed Antipater and Craterus, who were more than ever determined to make war on Perdiccas. Antipater and Craterus, starting from the Chersonese, crossed the Hellespont, having previously sent messengers to deceive those who guarded the passage. They also sent ambassadors to Eumenes and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/neoptolemus.html#6">Neoptolemus</A>, who supported Perdiccas ; Neoptolemus went over to them, but Eumenes refused. 
<FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT>  Neoptolemus being suspected by Eumenes, war broke out between them, in which Eumenes was victorious. Neoptolemus fled with a few men to Antipater and Craterus, and succeeded in persuading the latter to join him; so both made war against Eumenes. Eumenes did his best to prevent his own men from knowing that Craterus was fighting against him, being afraid that, influenced by his great reputation, they might either desert to him, or, if they remained faithful to him, might lose heart. Successful in scheming, he was also successful in battle. Neoptolemus fell by the hand of Eumenes "the secretary" himself, after having proved himself a brave soldier and commander. Craterus, who fought boldly against all who opposed him and showed himself openly in order to be known, was slain by some Paphlagonians before he was recognized, although he had thrown off his hat. However, the infantry escaped and returned to Antipater, which considerably reassured him. 
<FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> Perdiccas, setting out from Damascus to make war upon Ptolemy the son of Lagus, reached Egypt with the kings  and a large force. He made many charges against Ptolemy, who publicly cleared himself, so that the accusations appeared ill-founded. Perdiccas, notwithstanding the opposition of his troops, decided to carry on the war. He was twice defeated, and, having treated those who were inclined to go over to Ptolemy with great severity, and in other respects behaved in camp more arrogantly than became a general, he was slain by his own cavalry during an engagement. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> After his death Ptolemy crossed the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nile.html#1">Nile</A> to visit the kings, upon whom he bestowed gifts and treated them with the utmost kindness and attention, as well as the other Macedonians of rank. At the same time he openly showed sympathy with the friends of Perdiccas, and did all he could to allay the apprehensions of those Macedonians who imagined they were in peril, so that at once and ever afterwards he was held in great esteem.</P> 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> At a full council of war, Pithon and Arrhidaeus having been appointed commanders-in-chief of all the forces for the time being, about fifty of the supporters of Eumenes and Alcetas were condemned, chiefly because Craterus had met his death in civil strife. Antigonus was summoned from Cyprus, and Antipater ordered to repair with all speed to the kings. <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> Before they arrived, Eurydice refused to allow Pithon and Arrhidaeus to do anything without her permission. At first they did not demur, but afterwards told her that she had nothing to do with public affairs, and that they themselves would look after everything until the arrival of Antigonus and Antipater. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> When they arrived, Antipater was placed in chief command. When the army demanded the pay that had been promised them for the campaign, Antipater replied straightforwardly that he had no money, but that, to avoid incurring their censure, he would thoroughly search the treasury and other places where money might be hidden. These words aroused the displeasure of the army. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> When Eurydice joined in the accusations against Antipater, the people were indignant, and a disturbance took place. Eurydice then delivered a speech against him, in which she was assisted by Asclepiodorus the scribe and supported by Attalus. Antipater barely escaped with his life, after Antigonus and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#1">Seleucus</A>, at his earnest request, had addressed the people on his behalf and nearly lost their lives in consequence. Antipater, having thus escaped death, withdrew to his own army, where he summoned the cavalry commanders, and after the disturbance had been put down with difficulty, he was again reinstated in his command.</P> 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> He then made a division of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#2">Asia</A>, partly confirming the earlier one and partly altering it as circumstances necessitated.

The Rhodians, under their admiral, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demaratus.html#2">Demaratus</A>, completely repulsed them. <FONT CLASS="verse">40</FONT> How Eumenes nearly came to blows with Antipater on his arrival at Sardis, but Cleopatra, Alexander's sister, to prevent the Macedonian people accusing her of being the cause of the war, persuaded Eumenes to leave Sardis. Notwithstanding, Antipater reviled her for her friendship with Eumenes and Perdiccas. She defended herself more vigorously than a woman could have been expected to do, brought countercharges against him, and in the end they parted amicably. <FONT CLASS="verse">41</FONT> Eumenes, having unexpectedly attacked those who did not acknowledge his authority, collected much booty and money, which he distributed amongst his soldiers. He also sent messages to Alcetas and his friends, begging them to assemble all their forces in one place so that they might unitedly attack the common enemy. But differences of opinion arose amongst them, and they finally refused. <FONT CLASS="verse">42</FONT> Antipater, not yet daring to engage Eumenes, sent Asander against Attalus and Alcetas; after the battle had long remained undecided, Asander was defeated. <FONT CLASS="verse">43</FONT> Cassander was at variance with Antigonus, but by command of his father, Antipater, he abandoned his opposition. Nevertheless, Cassander, when he met his father in Phrygia, advised him not to get too far from the kings, and to keep watch on Antigonus ; but the latter, by his quiet behaviour, courtesy, and good qualities, did all he could to remove suspicion. Antipater, being appeased, appointed him to the command of the forces which had crossed over with him to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#1">Asia</A> - 8500 Macedonian 'infantry, and the same number of foreign cavalry, together with half the elephants (that is, seventy) - to assist him in ending the war against Eumenes. <FONT CLASS="verse">44</FONT> Thus Antigonus began the war.

<H2> <A NAME="523.0">523</A>:  ? Zenon of Rhodes ( P.K&ouml;ln 247 )</H2>

<P> <I>The Greek text of the legible part of this papyrus fragment, along with a historical commentary, was published by G.A.Lehmann (ZPE, 1988).  Because of the emphasis on the Rhodians, it is likely that the fragment comes from a local history written by Zenon in the first half of the second century B.C.  The surviving portion describes events of 306/5 B.C.; Lehmann points out that the remarks in column III, about the importance to the Rhodians of trade with Egypt, are echoed in Diodorus' account of this year ( <A HREF="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/20D*.html#81">20.81'4</A> ).</I>

<H2> <A NAME="723.0">723</A>:  Eupolemus </H2>
<P> <I>Eupolemus lived in the second century B.C. and wrote a history "On the Kings in Judaea", of which a few fragments have survived in quotations by later Christian writers, although it appears that they found the quotations in the writings of Alexander Polyhistor, rather than directly reading the history. </I> 

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="723.1">[1]</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[EUSEB:PE.9.25.4]</FONT> &nbsp; And concerning <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moses.html#1">Moses</A> the same author [<A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#29">Alexander</A> Polyhistor] again brings forward many things, which are worth hearing.  But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eupolemus.html#4">Eupolemus</A> says that the first wise man was Moses, and that he was the first to teach the Jews letters, and from the Jews the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phoenicia.html#1">Phoenicians</A> received them, and from the Phoenicians the Greeks, and that Moses was the first to give written laws to the Jews. &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">[CLEM.AL:STROM.1.23]</FONT> &nbsp; And Eupolemus, in his book <I>On the Kings in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judaea.html#1">Judaea</A></I>, says that &quot;Moses was the first wise man, and the first that imparted grammar to the Jews, that the Phoenicians received it from the Jews, and the Greeks from the Phoenicians.&quot;

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="723.2">[2]</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[CLEM.AL:STROM.1.21]</FONT> &nbsp; Accordingly it is easy to perceive that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/solomon.html#1">Solomon</A>, who lived in the time of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menelaus.html#1">Menelaus</A> (who was during the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/troy.html#1">Trojan</A> war), was earlier by many years than the wise men among the Greeks. And how many years Moses preceded him we showed, in what we said above. And Alexander, surnamed Polyhistor, in his work on the Jews, has transcribed some letters of Solomon to Vaphres king of Egypt, and to the king of the Phoenicians at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyre.html#1">Tyre</A>, and theirs to Solomon; in which it is shown that Vaphres sent eighty thousand Egyptian men to him for the building of the temple, and the other as many, along with a Tyrian artificer, the son of a <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jewish.html#2">Jewish</A> mother, of the tribe of Dan, as is there written, of the name of Hyperon. &nbsp; <FONT CLASS="green">[EUSEB:PE.9.30.1-8]</FONT> &nbsp; 
But Eupolemus says, in some (?) comment on the prophecy of Elias, that Moses prophesied forty years; then <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/joshua.html#1">Jesus</A> the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nun.html#1">Nave</A> thirty years, and he lived a hundred and ten years, and pitched the holy tabernacle in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/silo.html#3">Silo</A>.  And afterwards <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samuel.html#1">Samuel</A> rose up as a prophet: and then by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A>'s will <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/saul.html#1">Saul</A> was chosen king by Samuel, and died after a reign of twenty-one years. Then his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/david.html#1">David</A> reigned, who subdued the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syria.html#1">Syrians</A> which live beside the river <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/euphrates.html#1">Euphrates</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/commagene.html#1">Commagene</A>, and the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/assyria.html#1">Assyrians</A> in Galadene, and the Phoenicians; he also made expeditions against the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edom">Edomites</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ammonites.html#1">Ammonites</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moab.html#1">Moabites</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/ituraea.html#1">Ituraeans</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arabia.html#1">Nabathaeans</A>, and Nabdaeans. And again he made an expedition against Suron king of Tyre and Phoenicia; and compelled these nations to pay tribute to the Jews; and contracted a friendly alliance with Vaphres king of Egypt.  And when David wished to build a temple for God, he entreated God to point out to him a place for the altar; whereupon there appeared to him an angel standing above the place, where the altar is built in Jerusalem, who commanded him not to build the temple, because he was defiled with men's blood and had passed many years in war.  And the angel's name was Dianathan; and he bade him commit the building of the temple to his son, but himself to prepare the things pertaining to the building, gold, silver, brass, stones, cypress wood and cedar.  And on bearing this David built ships in (?) A&iuml;lana, a city of Arabia, and sent miners to the island Urphe which lies in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/red.html#1">Red</A> Sea, and contains gold mines. And thence the miners transported the gold into Judaea.  When David had reigned forty years he gave over the government to Solomon his son, who was twelve years old, in the presence of Eli the High Priest and the twelve princes of the tribes, and delivered to him the gold and silver and brass and stone and cypress wood and cedar. Then David died, and Solomon was king, and wrote to Vaphres king of Egypt the letter which is transcribed below.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="723.3">[3]</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[EUSEB:PE.9.34.20]</FONT> &nbsp; And Eupolemus says that Solomon made also a thousand golden shields, each of which weighed five hundred staters of gold. He lived fifty-two years, of which he reigned forty in peace.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="723.4">[4]</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[CLEM.AL:STROM.1.21]</FONT> &nbsp; Besides, Eupolemus, in (?) the same work, says that all the years from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/adam.html#1">Adam</A> to the fifth year of king <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demetrius.html#3">Demetrius</A>, and the twelfth year of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#8">Ptolemy</A> king of Egypt <FONT CLASS="orange">[? 158 B.C.]</FONT>, when added, amount to five thousand one hundred and forty-nine; and from the time that Moses brought out the Jews from Egypt to the above-mentioned date, there are, in all, two thousand five hundred and eighty years. And from this time till the consulship in Rome of Gaius Dometianus and Casianus <FONT CLASS="orange">[? Gnaeus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/calvinus.html#6">Domitius</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pollio.html#2">Asinius</A>, 40 B.C.]</FONT>, a hundred and twenty years are computed.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="723.5">[5]</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[EUSEB:PE.9.39.1-5]</FONT> &nbsp; Besides this, as [Alexander] Polyhistor has made mention of the prophecy of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jeremiah.html#1">Jeremiah</A>, it would be a most unreasonable thing for us to pass it over in silence. Let this then also be set down:

<P> Then <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jehoiakim.html#1">Jonachim</A>: in his time prophesied Jeremiah the prophet. He was sent by God, and found the Jews sacrificing to a golden image, the name of which was Baal.  And he foreshowed to them the calamity which was to come. Jonachim then attempted to burn him alive: but he said that with that fuel they should cook food for the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/babylon.html#1">Babylonians</A>, and as prisoners of war should dig the canals of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tigris.html#1">Tigris</A> and Euphrates.  When <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nebuchadnezzar.html#1">Nebuchadnezzar</A>, king of the Babylonians, had heard of the predictions of Jeremiah, he summoned Astibares, the king of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/media.html#1">Medes</A>, to join him in an expedition. And having taken with him Babylonians and Medes, and collected a hundred and eighty thousand infantry and a hundred and twenty thousand cavalry, and ten thousand chariots, he first subdued <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samaria.html#1">Samaria</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/galilee.html#1">Galilee</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythopolis.html#1">Scythopolis</A>, and the Jews who lived in the region of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gilead.html#1">Gilead</A>; and afterwards took Jerusalem, and made Jonachim, the king of the Jews, a prisoner. And the gold that was in the temple, and the silver and brass, they chose out and sent to Babylon, except the Ark and the tables that were in it: but this Jeremiah retained.

Apollonius in book 17 of his Carica relates that the Galatians, when they were newly arrived, fought as allies of Mithridates and Ariobarzanes, and they pursued the Egyptian soldiers sent by Ptolemy as far as the sea, where they took hold of the anchors of their ships. As payment for their victory, they received land to build a city, and they founded a city to which they gave this name, Ancyra {"Anchor"}.

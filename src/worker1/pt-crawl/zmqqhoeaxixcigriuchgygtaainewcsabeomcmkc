<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.1">1</A> While Fortune's mutable phases were causing these occurrences in a different part of the world, Julian in the midst of his many occupations in Illyricum was constantly prying into the entrails of victims and watching the flight of birds, in his eagerness to foreknow the result of events; but he was perplexed by ambiguous and obscure predictions and continued to be uncertain of the future. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.2">2</A> At length, however, Aprunculus, a Gallic orator skilled in soothsaying, afterwards advanced to be governor of Gallia Narbonensis, told him what would happen, having learned it (as he himself declared) from the inspection of a liver which he had seen covered with a double lobe.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="

onMouseOut="nd();">1</A> And although Julian feared that it might be a fiction conformable to his own desire, and was therefore troubled, he himself saw a much more evident sign which clearly foretold the death of Constantius. For at the very moment when that emperor died in Cilicia, a soldier who lifted Julian with his right hand to mount his horse slipped and fell to the ground; and Julian at once cried in the hearing of many: "The man has fallen who raised me to my high estate." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.3">3</A> But although he knew that these were favourable signs, yet as if standing fast upon his guard he remained within the confines of Dacia, and even so was troubled with many fears. For he


<A ID="p189"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p189 </SPAN></A>did not deem it prudent to trust the predictions which might perhaps be fulfilled by contraries.

And now believing in the prophecies, and knowing by experience that speed had often been helpful to his enterprises, he ordered a march into Thrace, quickly broke camp, and passing the slope of Succi,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref3" HREF="

And as rumour is wont to exaggerate all novelties, he hastened on from there, now raised still higher, as though in some chariot of Triptolemus,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="

And so he was met on the eleventh of December with the respectful attendance of the senate and the unanimous applause of the people, and surrounded by troops of soldiers and citizens he was escorted as if by an army in line of battle, while all eyes were turned upon him, not only with a fixed gaze, but also with great admiration. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.5">5</A> For it seemed almost like a dream that this young man, just come to his growth,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="

But for the death of Ursulus, count of the sacred largesses, Justice herself seems to me to have wept, and to have accused the emperor of ingratitude. For when Julian was sent as Caesar to the western regions, to be treated with extreme niggardliness, being granted no power of making any donative to the soldiers to the end that he might be exposed to more serious mutinies of the army, this very Ursulus wrote to the man in charge of the Gallic treasury, ordering that whatever the Caesar asked for should be given him without hesitation. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.8">8</A> After Ursulus' death Julian found himself the object of the reproaches and curses of many men, and thinking that he could excuse himself for the unpardonable crime, he declared that the man had been put to death without his knowledge, alleging that his taking off was due to the anger of the soldiers, who remembered his words (which we have reported before)&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref20" HREF="

Ammianus confuses two libraries, that of the Bruchion and that of the Serapeum. The former was founded by Ptolemy Soter (322‑283 <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN>) and in the time of Callimachus contained 490,000 volumes; the Serapeum, founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus (285‑247 <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN>), contained 42,800. At the time of the battle of Pharsalia the total number was 532,800 and it may have reached 700,000 by the time of the Alexandrine war. Antony gave Cleopatra 200,000 volumes that had been collected in Pergamum. The damage done

For the whole question of whether Jews stink — an opinion current in Christian Europe for a thousand and some years after Ammian — see the rather detailed commonsense refutation by Sir Thomas Browne,

Our passage here is of interest, though, since it is one of the few such statements that does not appear to have been made under the influence of that religion. The only possible explanation (short of an interpolation in the text of Ammian, noting that the point of the Marcus Aurelius story is fractiousness rather than odor) seems to be that as a group and in their own country, Jews may have had different enough dietary habits from those of gentiles as to make their scent noticeable. I am told that natives of India find the odor of Westerners offensive, very likely for our diet high in beef and animal fat.

Another possibility, detailed by David Rohrbacher in <I>Mnemosyne</I> <SPAN CLASS="small">LVIII</SPAN>.441‑42 (2005), is that here we find expressed the notion, current among gentile Greeks and Romans at the time, that Egyptian Jews were afflicted with leprosy and therefore foul-smelling; the idea is found several centuries before Ammian, in

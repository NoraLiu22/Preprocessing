<H2>The Crooked Mile (2001)</H2>

<P>D: Stephen Kane<BR>
S: Dayna McKiernan, Alan Smith</P>

<P>Harmless and inoffensive road movie following the travels of a young
girl (Dayna McKiernan) in search of her father in the company of a shiftless
would-be student (Alan Smith) who happens to be her neighbour. When her
mother is hospitalised, the girl takes to the road to find the man who deserted
them in her infancy, armed only with an image of James Dean which her mother
has always referred to when asked for explanations. Unremarkable in most
respects, but entirely pleasant, the film was among the first digital features
shot in Ireland, and is distinguished by good photography and lustrous colour.
</P>

<P>The details of the plot are pretty much standard for this kind of thing.
On their road to Waterford from Dublin (accompanied by a goldfish) they
encounter a variety of colourful types, including a lecherous truck driver
who may or may not be kidding, and various other rural eccentrics. Like
all road movies, the journey is spiritual as well as physical, with McKiernan
learning something about the difference between dreams and reality and Smith
realising the value of having goals, even unrealistic ones. There are some
relatively unexpected elements, including the sensitivity with which the
meeting between the girl and her natural father (Pat McGrath) is handled,
but there is little here that has not been seen before. The film lacks the
richness of an <I>Alice in the Cities</I> or the satiric punch of <I>Paper
Moon</I>, but its basic sweetness (which never descends into mawkishness)
makes it very watchable.</P>

<P>As far as Irish cinema goes, <I>The Crooked Mile</I> falls into a sub
genre of movies involving children including <I>Sweety Barret</I> and <I>The
Boy From Mercury</I> that use childhood as their muse but aren't entirely
suitable for children. Though free of the grimy gangster movie trappings
which might alienate younger viewers of <A HREF="swb.htm"><I>Sweety Barret</I>
</A>and the 1950s nostalgia which gives <A HREF="bm.htm"><I>The Boy From
Mercury</I></A> a more adult appeal, <I>The Crooked Mile</I> suffers from
lacking edge or excitement on a level sufficient to lure the small fry from
the onslaught of Disney movies competing for their attention. Of course
this is an issue in itself as far as Ireland is concerned, and in that respect,
<I>The Crooked Mile</I> is the kind of film which actually merits encouragement.
The film requires no apologies on terms of quality, especially for a relatively
low budget film. It is well shot, well put together, and generally well
made in every respect. The performances are generally good and the film
is never boring in spite of the generic familiarity of it all. That it lacks
spark is neither here nor there, but even a review of this type does become
a case of damning the film with faint praise, which is a little unfair to
a film with many small pleasures to offer those of a mind to enjoy it.</P>

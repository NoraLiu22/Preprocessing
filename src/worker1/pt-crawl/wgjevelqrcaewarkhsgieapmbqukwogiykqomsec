<H2>Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003)</H2>

<P>D: McG<BR>
S: Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu</P>

<P>The title summarises the ethos which has informed the sequel to <I><A HREF="ca.htm">Charlie's Angels</A></I>, and there is certainly no denying
that it never lets up. From its incredibly noisy opening to its equally
bombastic climax, returning director McG takes the hyperkinetic action scenes
which peppered the original and attempts to construct an entire movie out
of them. The result is a relentless, bombastic, and self-deprecating super
spectacle which paves the way for the cartoon series which is apparently
to follow. The fact that it becomes painful fairly fast is a slight drawback
though, because the sense of spontaneous fun which made the first one work
has been replaced by a sense of desperate excess. The film wears you down
rather than lifting you up, and though there are a few giggles, it is hard
to actually like even if you don't completely hate it.</P>

<P>The plot begins with an action scene crossing <I>Raiders of the Lost
Ark</I> with <I>GoldenEye</I> as the 'angels', (Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore,
and Lucy Liu) take on a Mongolian horde in a smoky bar before leaping off
a bridge and into a helicopter. At the end of the scene, a miscellaneous
baddie makes a phone call to an enigmatic and as yet unseen &uuml;ber-villain
who says it's time for 'Plan B', triggering the credit sequence. The rest
of the movie works much the same way, careening from big action set piece
to big action set piece pausing momentarily for a smidgen of plot, a couple
of in-jokes, and some pun-laden banter between the principals.</P>

<P>Does it really matter how the story unfolds? Well, there's no secret
to the fact that it involves Demi Moore as a former angel who has struck
out on her own, and the stage is set for a climactic catfight on wires in
slo-mo and scored with the techno-punk stylings of The Prodigy. There are
a couple of surprise cameos, more action than anyone really needs in one
sitting, and a serious overload of movie references. The whole film is designed
like an advertisement for itself, consisting almost entirely of hi-impact
visual gags and fetish situations which make for a great poster campaign.</P>

<P>There is very little to say about the film that wasn't said in criticism
of the original or of the television series itself. The lines between appropriation
and exploitation are crossed once again, and with much the same joyous abandon
as last time. In the opening scenes, Diaz mounts a mechanical bull dressed
in a skimpy white and outfit pretending to be a ditzy tourist. The point
of her routine is to distract the sweaty Mongolians from the heroic activities
of her fellow agents, but the result is a scene in which a pretty blonde
bumps, grinds, and squeals before a room full of heaving, hairy men howling
in appreciation. It is really very much up to the individual how to respond
to all of this, but the film is certainly aware of where the boundaries
are drawn, and is more than happy to leap, strut, and dance across them
as its stars rake in the royalties (Barrymore's production company, Flower
Films, is again a prime mover behind the scenes).</P>

<P>Alas something has definitely been lost between the first big screen
outing and this sequel. There was a relaxed and likable air to the proceedings
last time out which is absent here. In spite of attempts to reprise many
of the scenes which worked in the first, the second seems to be reaching
for something which seemed to come naturally before. Though it acknowledges
its own contrivances (including an entire subplot revolving around an hi-octane
action movie featuring supporting character Matt Le Blanc which has an ad
campaign styled after <I><A HREF="mi2.htm">Mission: Impossible 2</A></I>),
the tongue-in-cheek approach seems forced.</P>

<P>The endless movie jokes get tired too quickly, and some of them are simply
overdone (most of the kids for whom the movie will represent the pinnacle
of cinematic entertainment will not remember <I>Cape Fear</I>, let alone
<I>Rebel Without a Cause</I>, both of which are referenced). The eponymous
stars try hard, but actually frequently appear more haggard than they are
probably meant to from the effort of enjoying themselves so much. In fact,
in the final analysis, the movie really isn't very enjoyable at all despite
everyone's apparently earnest efforts to make it so. Though there are enough
gags in there for everyone to find at least one they like (John Cleese isn't
bad in a small supporting role), it can be rather too much effort to endure
the barrage of sound and fury which makes up the rest of it. It is just
too hard to have fun with this movie, and it really shouldn't be.</P>

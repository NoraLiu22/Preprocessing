                  <p class="style35">Screen  South-supported filmmakers Marc and Nick Francis of Speak-it Productions in  Brighton have just returned from the world premiere of their film BLACK GOLD at  the Sundance Film Festival in the USA, and it was an incredible 10  days of screenings, interviews and parties. </p>
                  <p class="style35">It started off  with the Directors brunch at the Sundance village, where Hollywood  legend and Festival Founder Robert Redford passionately explained why he  continues to be so committed to supporting independent film.</p>
                  <p class="style35">The five screenings from January 20th-29th were  sold out, each generating queues of over 100 people. The two brothers were  amazed by the turnout and people kept telling them that BLACK GOLD was the talk  of the town. To keep the spirit of the film alive, Marc and Nick had hooked up  with a local coffee roaster who served free Ethiopian coffee featured in the  film to people in the ticket queues. </p>
                  <p class="style35">Says Marc: </p>
                  <p class="style35">&ldquo;The Q&amp;A sessions were lively and people seemed fascinated and keen  to find out more. At the world premiere one member of the audience wrote out a  $10,000 cheque to the Coffee Union run by the main character in the film to  assist with the building of a new school.</p>
                  <p class="style35">Starbucks sent their people to every screening and press released the  media, even though BLACK GOLD isn&rsquo;t specifically about Starbucks; it&rsquo;s about  how coffee farmers are losing out in a multi-billion dollar coffee industry.&rdquo; </p>
                  <p class="style35">Director Marc Francis has been supported by Screen  South over the last two years to develop the project&rsquo;s feature potential. Marc  joined the Screen South European Documentary &lsquo;Bourse de Co-Production&rsquo; in Lille, France,  in 2004 and was also selected to take part in the Screen South LA Trade and  Talent Mission the same year. BLACK GOLD received a further &pound;6000 completion  funding from Screen South at the end of 2005, enabling final festival  preparation.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style35">Says Jo Nolan, Screen South CEO: </p>
                  <p class="style35">&ldquo;I am absolutely delighted to see that Marc and  Nick&rsquo;s documentary has created such a great response at Sundance. It is very  important that Screen South is able to get behind directors like Marc, he  understands the politics and passion in important stories like BLACK GOLD and  these films are not always easy to finance. The success of recent issue-driven  features clearly shows that there is a market for these films and we look  forward to continuing our support for the Francis brothers along with other  regional documentary makers who have something unique to say&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="style35">By the end of the  festival BLACK GOLD had generated a lot of interest from distributors and is  now in the hands of their sales agent. BLACK GOLD will now be screening in more  international festivals over the next few months. Check out the film&rsquo;s website  and sign up to the BLACK GOLD newsletter at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080522132345/http://www.blackgoldmovie.com/">www.blackgoldmovie.com</a> to keep up to  date!</p>
                  <p class="style35">BLACK GOLD is an alarming and timely feature-length  documentary about the global coffee industry, where the spoils of overpriced  lattes and cappucinos are sparsely shared with the people who produce it. From  Ethiopian bean to Starbucks&rsquo; cup, we meet coffee drinkers, tasting experts,  baristas, and coffee traders and visit the sweatshop production lines, auction  houses and roasting plants around the world. The film&rsquo;s main character is  Tadesse Meskela who fights to save his Ethiopian coffee farmers from  bankruptcy&ndash; taking on not just the coffee industry, but also the world trading  system.</p>
                  <p class="style35">The last year has been both an exciting and  challenging one for Marc and Nick Francis. BLACK GOLD entered its second year  of production and with it came some new developments and opportunities.  Highlights included an insightful trip with Screen South on their  UKTI-supported trade mission to LA in November 2004 where Marc met up with US  distribution companies behind releases such as <strong><em><u><a href="/web/20080522132345/http://www.close-upfilm.com/reviews/f/fahrenheit911.htm">Farenheit 9/11</a></u></em></strong><em>, <strong><u><a href="/web/20080522132345/http://www.close-upfilm.com/reviews/t/touchingthevoid.htm">Touching  the Void</a></u></strong></em>, and <strong><em><u><a href="/web/20080522132345/http://www.close-upfilm.com/reviews/s/supersizeme.htm">Super Size Me</a></u>. </em></strong></p>
                  <p class="style35">Subsequently, completion funding for the  documentary was secured from the Sundance Institute Documentary Fund. BLACK  GOLD was one of fourteen projects to be selected by the fund. Dedicated to  supporting U.S.  and international documentary films that focus on current human rights issues,  freedom of expression, social justice, and civil liberties, the fund was  established at the Sundance Institute in 2002 by a gift from the Open Society  Institute. The Sundance Institute Documentary Fund grants are announced twice a  year and since its inception at the Institute, the Fund has disbursed over $2  million to 84 projects. <br>
                    <br>
                    The completion funding from the Sundance Institute enabled Marc and Nick to  finish filming some key scenes in the US,  Italy and Ethiopia and  enter the&nbsp; final stages of the final cut. </p>
                  <p class="style35">More recently, Marc and Nick were invited by  Sundance to spend one week in Utah  for a series of workshops. One workshop involved working with producers and  distributors from LA and New York  on distribution and marketing strategies and the other workshop was an  intensive few days of working with music composers on the soundtrack of their  film. </p>
                  <p class="style35">Back in the UK Marc and Nick received completion  funding from Screen South in December 2005 with a view to getting the film  festival-ready.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Everything moves slowly in the village at the
heart of <i>Evil Does Not Exist</i>. It's a place where time itself doesn't seem
to matter much, or at least, that's the case for the film's protagonist Takumi
(Hitoshi Omika), the widowed father of an 8-year-old girl and a self-proclaimed
jack-of-all-trades. The man's day amounts to chopping firewood, gathering water
from a stream in the forest, and eventually remembering that he has to pick up
his daughter from school. It's not that he doesn't care, obviously. Time just
gets away from him, because his life has no schedule otherwise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Writer/director Ryusuke Hamaguchi takes his
time establishing this rhythm of life, from its opening shot looking up at the
trees in the woods, to lengthy sequences of Takumi cutting logs with an ax and
collecting spring water into a bunch of containers, and to his casual drive to
his daughter's school. Upon arriving there, it's a little jarring to notice that
the kids outside are standing frozen, almost as if the filmmaker has suddenly
decided to indulge in some stylistic gimmickry to highlight just how differently
time moves in this place. As it turns out, the young students are just playing
that traffic signal game of stopping and starting on command, but it's one of
those images that makes the point so clearly that it's tough to believe the
choice wasn't intentional.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">There's a meticulousness to the way Hamaguchi
sets the scene here, and that, appropriately, carries over to the nature of the
main character and the conflict that, for him and everyone in the village, pops
up as if out of nowhere. One day, everyone is going about their ordinary
business, and suddenly, the town's chief Suruga (Taijiro Tamura) has been given
a pamphlet about a meeting that will be happening in a couple days' time. It has
to do with a proposed &quot;glamping&quot;—or glamorous camping—site that a
company wants to build just uphill of the village.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">At first, no one in town knows what any of this
is about, but Suruga is convinced that the last-minute announcement of the
meeting doesn't bode well for the population. The company is obviously trying to
limit the number of people who attend the meeting, and at dinner at Takumi's
house with some other friends, the conversation might have delved into more
speculation and strategy for how the villagers will act at the meeting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">However, there are more pressing matters at
hand, mainly how Takumi and his daughter Hana (Ryo Nishikawa) found a
particularly lovely feather while walking in the forest earlier that day. Suruga
collects them to give to his adult son to use as picks for his harpsichord
playing. Yes, what's important in this place isn't anything like what matters to
the world outside of it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">That's the conflict here—between the way of
life in the village and the aims of those who want to exploit the land for
profit. It's an old tale, in other words, and the strength of Hamaguchi's film
is in how subtly but thoroughly he connects us to these old, relaxed, and
simpler ways of living, while making it clear that even the most relatively
minor and seemingly inconsequential acts by outsiders could destroy everything
about and beyond it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It's a film, then, that is specific in its
details but carries the weight of an environmentalist parable. The story's
centerpiece, for example, is that meeting, in which two representatives from the
company, Takahashi (Ryuji Kosaka) and Mayuzumi (Ayaka Shibutani), present the
glamping project to the villagers, who have filled the hall of the local
elementary school. They explain the idea in broad terms and with a lot of
corporate lingo, so as soon as someone starts asking questions about the massive
septic tank that will have to be built to accommodate the site's guests, it's
quickly apparent that neither of them is prepared to discuss the actual
specifics of how this project will operate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It's almost comic, in fact, as is a
fly-on-the-wall look at the company's follow-up meeting about the previous
meeting and the representatives' return to the village, when Takahashi suddenly
decides that he wants to become part of the little community after successfully
chopping a single piece of firewood. That such moments play that way show how
well Hamaguchi establishes the mindset of the village and its population. That
the protests at the first meeting, as various people explain how a matter as
trivial to the company as a septic tank could have disastrous consequences of
the village and other places downstream of it, make us think about much more
than a small town's water supply get at the potency of the place as a metaphor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Takumi, of course, sums it up best, pointing
out that this land was incorporated less than a century ago, meaning that
everyone is an outsider to it. The locals understand the necessity of harmony to
their and the land's survival, but the real outsiders—the corporate lackeys
and hunters, with their sporadic gunshots cracking through the still air, who
leave wounded deer to suffer—simply don't. As things progress, an unsettling
undercurrent begins to rise to the story's surface. Something will or already
has upset the balance, emphasized by how Eiko Ishibashi's score (a gorgeous main
theme that elicits beauty and melancholy with an eerie countermelody) ceases
without warning in certain scenes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The payoff of <i>Evil Does Not Exist</i> is a
decided anticlimax (mostly because the assembly of the final moments is
uncharacteristically clunky), but that's appropriate in its own way. This is
great conflict of our time, and its resolution is still an open question.</font>

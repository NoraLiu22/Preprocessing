HEN the Editor of this Magazine first expressed to me his
flattering wish that I should
write down, for him to print,
my ideas on the subject of book
illustration, I was much embarrassed. I felt that of all subjects in the world, this was
perhaps the one on which I had the least and fewest
ideas; that such ideas as I had consisted principally
in my admiration for so many illustrations by others,
in my dissatisfaction with so many illustrations of
my own, in the wonder that there should be so
many illustrated books, good, bad, and indifferent; and that the taste for them should rather seem to
be on the increase than otherwise.</p>

<p>
Evidently the illustrated book is a "felt want."
The majority of civilised human nature likes to read,
and a majority of that majority likes to have its
book (even its newspaper!) full of little pictures.
Evidently, also, there are two classes of readers.</p>

<p>
There, is the reader who visualises what he reads
(at the moment of reading) with the mind's eye,
unconsciously, perhaps, and without effort, but in a
manner so satisfactory to himself that he wants the
help of no picture; indeed, to him a picture would
be a hindrance. Another man's conception of the
scene or character would interfere with his own, and
probably seem to him inferior; just as many people
would sooner read their Shakespeare for themselves
than see him acted on the stage or hear him declaimed by an elocutionist. To such a man two is
company, three is none.</p>

<p>The greater number, I fancy, do not possess this
gift, and it is for their greater happiness that the
illustrator exists and plies his trade. To have the
authors conceptions adequately embodied for them in
a concrete form is a boon, an enhancement of their [349/350] 
pleasure. Their greatest pleasure of all, of course,
is to see it all acted on the stage. In this way the
story unfolds itself to them without any effort on
their part; nothin' is left to the imagination, which
they may not possess, or, possessing, may not care to
exert.</p>

<p>But the stage is not always at one's command,
and failing this, the little figures in the picture are
a mild substitute tor the actors at the footlights.
They are voiceless and cannot move, it is true. But
the arrested gesture, the expression of face, the
character and costume, may be as true to nature and
life as the best actor can make them. Within the
limits assigned, these little dumb motionless puppets
may be as graceful, or grotesque, or humorous, or
terrible as people in real life — indeed, more so , they
may continue to haunt the memory when the letterpress they illustrate is forgotten. When they produce this effect, it may be said, I think, that they
are the work of a good illustrator; and if, in addition to this, there is the charm of fine handicraft
and the cunning of a well-trained faculty, the result
is a delightful and valuable work of art — although
its scale be a small one, and the means of its
production very simple and slight — a very precious
possession.</p>

<p>As the highest example of such performance in
our time, I will cite Menzel's illustrations to the
Life of Frederick the Great (by an author whose
name I have forgotten, and whose book I have not
read, because it is in German). Whatever the book,
the illustrations seem to me for all time, and for any
country.</p>

<p>It would be possible, I suppose, and perhaps interesting, to trace the history of book illustrations
from its very beginning, which must lie pretty far
back in the past. But such a task is not for such
as the present writer, and would require a volume
for its execution, instead of a magazine article.</p>

<p>I will content myself with recording quickly such
impressions, recollections, and general experience as
I have of the subject, well satisfied if, in doing so,
I meet the wishes of the Editor of this Magazine,
and do not impose too much upon the patience of
its readers.</p>

<p>Of course, the most delightful illustrations in
the world are those one loved when one was young.
It is impossible, perhaps, to judge them quite impartially. One may lose one's taste for the text, and
no longer relish <a href="../../../authors/ainsworth/index.html">Harrison Ainsworth</a> or Charles Lever
with quite so keen a zest as was the case forty years
ago; but the comely forms of Jack Hinton and
Harry Lorrequer, and their rollicking brothers in
arms, have still power to please, especially when on
galloping horses — galloping from one scrape to
another, from the old love to the new.  And the headsman, cutting off the head of Lady Jane Grey,
is as thrilling as ever, although one may have lived
to be more fastidious in the matter of mere execution
(by which, of course, I mean the technical craft of
the artist). And, indeed, what does not the great
<a href="../../../authors/dickens/index.html">Dickens</a> himself owe to <a href="../cruikshank/index.html">Cruikshank</a> and <a href="../phiz/index.html">Hablot
Browne</a>, those two delightful etchers who understood
and interpreted him so well!</p>

<p>Our recollections of Bill Sikes and Nancy, and
Fagin, and Noah Claypole, and the Artful Dodger,
of Pickwick and the Wellers, pere et Jils, Pecksniff,
Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Prig, Micawber. Mr. Dombey,
Mr. Toots, and the rest, have become fixed, crystallised, and solidified into imperishable concrete by
these little etchings in that endless gallery, printed
on those ever-welcome pages of thick yellow paper,
which one used to study with such passionate interest
before reading the story, and after, and between.
One may have forgotten much that Mr. Pecksniff
has thought, or said, or done in this world; but what
he looked like, never! And no new portrait of him,
by the hand of howsoever consummate an artist, can
ever displace the old one for such of us as are in the
middle fifties.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know for certain what
Charles Dickens thought of these illustrations — 
whether they quite realised for him the people he
had in his mind, or bettered them, even — for such a
thing is not impossible; indeed, it is the business of
the true illustrator to do this if he can. I believe
that <a href="../../../authors/wmt/index.html">Thackeray</a> was more pleased with the outward
shape that <a href="../walker/index.html">Fred Walker</a> had given to his Philip (on
his way through the world) than with even his own
mental conception of the same, which was quite
different.</p>

<p>There was (or rather, happily, there is) another
illustrator of this long past period, far greater as a
craftsman than than two I have mentioned, Cruikshank
and Browne.  He did not etch, however; his illustrations were designed on wood, and although most of his pictures were in books, and not of modern life,
he did not disdain to illustrate the humble <span class="book">London
Journal</span>, that used to appear once a week. It must
be nearly forty years ago since I used regularly to
buy that paper for <a href="../gilbert/index.html">Sir John Gilbert</a>'s admirable woodcuts, which are, perhaps, now forgotten in the
far more important works he has produced in oil and
water-colour.   But they will never be forgotten
by me.</p>

<p><a href="../leech/index.html">Leech</a> and <a href="../doyle/index.html">Doyle</a> are so much better known by
their work in <a href="../../../periodicals/punch/index.html"><span class="book">Punch</span></a> than by their book illustrations,
that I will do no more than allude to them, excellent
as they are.  Colonel Newcome and Barnes are
well remembered, as well as the "Comic Histury
of England," "Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour," 
&c. And of <a href="../tenniel/index.html">John Tenniel</a>, Charles Keene, Linley
[350/351] Sambourne, and <a href="../furniss/index.html">Harry Furniss</a> I shall have occasion to speak further on.</p>

</p>


<p>Then, in 1860 [actually 1857], appeared the illustrated volume
of <a href="../moxon.html">Poems</a>, by <a href="../../../authors/tennyson/index.html">Alfred Tennyson</a>; and about the
same time <a href="../../../periodicals/cornhill/index.html"><span class="book">The Cornhill Magazine</span></a> and <a href="../../../periodicals/onceaweek.html"><span class="book">Once a
Week</span></a> were started, whereby a new impulse was
given to the art of illustrating books.   <a href="../millais/index.html">Millais</a>,
<a href="../dgr/index.html">Rossetti</a>, <a href="../whh/index.html">Holman Hunt</a>, and others well known
to fame, designed small woodcuts for the former
most charming volume, the publishing of which
made an epoch in English book illustration. A
new element was imported, to which I find it
difficult to give a name. Anyhow, some of these
drawings gave some of us — I can answer for one
who wanted to illustrate books  —  extraordinary
pleasure. They do still.</p>


<p class="aq">I still adore the lovely, wild, irresponsible moonface of Oriana, with the gigantic mailed archer
kneeling at her feet in the yew-wood, and stringing
his fatal bow; the strange beautiful figure of the
Lady of Shalott, when the curse comes over her, and
her splendid hair is floating wide, like the magic
web; the warm embrace of Amy and her cousin
(when their spirits rushed together at the touching
of the lips), and the dear little symmetrical wavelets
beyond; the queen sucking the poison out of her
husbands arm; the exquisite bride at the end of the
Talking Oak; the sweet little picture of Emma
Morland and Edward Grey, so natural and so
modern, with the trousers treated in quite the proper
spirit; the chaste Sir Galahad, slaking his thirst
with holy water, amid all the mystic surroundings;
and the delightfully incomprehensible pictures to the
Palace of Art, that gave one a weird sense of comfort,
like the word "Mesopotamia," without one's knowing
why.</p>

</p>

<p>Then it was that <span class="book">Once a Week</span> and <span class="book">The Cornhill
Magazine</span> came, with Millais, Fred Walker, Charles
Keene, <a href="../sandys/index.html">Frederick Sandys</a>, Pinwell, and others.
The life of our time — which had been illustrated
humorously by Leech, Doyle, and Keene in <span class="book">Punch</span>;
humorously and seriously by Hablot Browne in
Dickens and Lever; and by Sir John Gilbert in
<span class="book">The London Journal</span> — was now being treated from
quite a serious point of view.</p>

<p>The chimney-pot hat and the trousers, the crinoline and the spoon-bonnet were taken in hand by
cunning craftsmen, and duly "invested with artistic
merit;" the artist trusted no longer to his impressions, his memory, his inner consciousness.   The
model became as indispensable to him as to the
historical painter. He made elaborate studies of the
fashionable skirt, sleeve, body, bonnet, and shawl, as
though he were concerned with some great classical
design.</p>

<p>Not, indeed, that it was all modern English in
either Once a Week or The Cornhill. The reader will
remember Charles Keene's beautiful cuts to "The
Cloister and the Hearth;" and others by Millais,
Leighton, Sandys, <a href="../../../painting/poynter/index.html">Poynter</a>, Lawless, Tenniel, in
which the costume was of another time and clime.</p>

<p>Frederick Walker, then quite a boy, leapt into
fame by his illustrations in <span class="book">Once a Week</span> and <a href="../../../periodicals/cornhill/index.html"><span class="book">The Cornhill Magazine</span>.</a> I can find no words to express
the admiration I felt for them as they appeared one
after another, each better than the last, till they
culminated in the famous picture of "Philip in
Church;" an admiration that left no room for any
petty feeling of personal envy.</p>

<p>He had founded himself, I think, partly on Sir
John Gilbert, partly on Sir John Millais; but in
an incredibly short time he became Fred Walker, a
rock for the foundation of others; for he has <span class="book">made
school</span>, as the French say, in wood-draughtsmanship,
as well as in oil painting and water-colours.</p>

<p>Putting aside the charm of his composition, the
grace and naturalness of his figures, the sweetness of
his landscapes, the exquisite deftness and dexterity of
his manipulation (those effective little cross-hatchings
that are to be found more or less in almost every
woodcut executed since his time), he was the first
to quite understand, in their "inner significance,"
the boot, the hat, the coat-sleeve, the terrible
trousers, and, most difficult of all, the masculine
evening suit.  Even Millais and Leech, who knew
the modern world so well, could not beat him at
these.</p>

<p>So that I look upon Sir John Gilbert, Sir John
Millais, and Frederick Walker as the grandfathers
and fathers of our modern school of illustration;
that is, of such illustration as illustrates the life of
to-day, which, of course, is not everything. For
the most successful illustrated English books of
our generation — at least, I venture to think so — 
have not treated of the immediate life around us.
For instance, in the <a href="../tenniel/alice/gallery1.html">two little books</a> that describe
the adventures of "Alice in Wonderland" and
"Through the Looking Glass," the pictures seem
to me simply perfect, but that I should have preferred for Alice herself a more really childish figure of
a child. The stories are charming in themselves, but
what has Mr. Tenniel not done for them besides  
It is like <a href="../../../mt/sullivan.html">Sir Arthur Sullivan</a>'s music to <a href="../../../mt/gilbert/gilbertov.html">Mr. Gilbert</a>'s
delightful librettos. These little pictures are a joy
for ever; they stick in the mind like charming tunes
that won't allow themselves to be forgotten. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the words, the cuts
are truly creations. Of course, they belong to the
old school — the good old school — the <a href="../tenniel/alice/9.3.html">Mock-turtle</a>
and the Jabberwock have not been drawn straight
from nature. Perhaps we, of the new school, are too
much the slaves of the model — a pernicious habit 
[351/352]
has to deal with Jabberwocks and Mockturtles.</p>

<p>Then there are the two books about "Bracebridge
Hall'" and "Christmas," by Washington Irving,
which have been brought back to vigorous life by
Randolph Caldecott, a true illustrator, if ever there
was one. That is, an enhancer of the charm and
humour of his text, wliose art seems of the slightest
 — a very few strokes were enough for him to work
wonders with. It is magic ! Grace, charm, beauty,
humour, character, pathos — all were his; and he was
as skilled in landscape and animals as in the human
figure, and " good alike at grave or gay." There
is also his immortal series of picture-books, equally
beloved by old and young and middle-aged, by
babies even — a gallery that never palls.</p>

<p>I must also mention Mr. <a href="../../../painting/crane/index.html">Walter Crane</a>'s beautiful
and not-to-be-forgotten coloured pictures to the fairy
tales, and Mr. Linley Sambourne's illustrations to
the "Water-Babies," and Miss Kate Greenaway's
nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>Nor, among the great English illustrators of our
day, must I omit the gifted Frenchman, <a href="../dore/index.html">Gustave
Dor&eacute'</a>; whose weird genius, however, seems to have
been most successful when its inspiration was drawn
from French sources — Rabelais and Balzac. His
drawings to the Bible are wonderful enough, but
not conceived in an English spirit; those to the
is "Idylls of the King" are, I think, a failure.</p>

<p>The old<span class="book"> Cornhill Magazine</span>, even more than
<span class="book">Once a Week</span>, has a high record as an illustrated
periodical.   In it, no less important a novel than
"<a href="../leighton/index.html">Romola</a>" was illustrated by no less important
a person than the <a href="../../../painting/leighton/index.html">present President</a> of the Royal
Academy;  "Framley Parsonage" and "The Small
House at Allington," by Millais; "Philip on his
Way Through the World" by F. Walker; "Far
from the Madding Crowd," by Mrs. Allingham
(Helen Paterson); George Leslie, Luke Fildes,
<a href="../mstone/index.html">Marcus Stone</a>, now Royal Academicians; F. Dicksee,
A.R.A.; W. Small, F. Sandys, and others have
also illustrated those brilliant pages. And for many
years I had the honour and pleasure of providing
every month a page-drawing and an initial letter.
That illustrated <span class="book">Cornhill</span> is no more; and the old
<span class="book">Once a Week</span> has long become extinct. To parallel
them for the merit and interest of their illustrations
we must seek across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>There are, as perhaps the reader knows, two
different ways of drawing for wood.  One is, to
paint a finished picture in black and white, using
the brush and washes of different degrees of intensity; picking out the lights with white, or leaving
the white paper for them. The engraver translates
this in his own way, cutting his own lines to represent or, rather, interpret the value of the tone left by the artist. In this case the artist is very much
at the mercy of his engraver. Moreover, little is left
to the imagination. Every detail must be put in — 
background, sky, wall, the ground, the grass, tha
carpet; no blanks are left, except here and there
where the light falls on a white surface, between
which and the blackest point of the picture is
employed every possible shade of grey.  Speaking
from memory and under correction, I believe <span class="book">The
Graphic</span> was the first illustrated paper to encourage
this school in England.  In its first number was
an admirable picture by <a href="../../../painting/fildes/index.html">Luke Fildes</a>, R.A., "The
Casual Ward" (from which he afterwards painted
a <a href="../../../painting/fildes/paintings/3.html">work in oils</a>), and, if I remember rightly, it
was treated in this manner.  And since then, in
the pages of <span class="book">The Graphic</span> have appeared many
illustrations of the highest merit by Frank Holl,
Luke Fildes, <a href="../../painting/herkomer/index.html">H. Herkomer</a>, H. Woods, W. Small,
A. Hopkins, <a href="../../../painting/misc/thompson1.html">Miss Thompson</a> (Lady Butler), <a href="../green/index.html">C.
Green</a>, <a href="../hall/index.html">Sydney Hall</a>, E. Gregory, J. Nash, G.
Durand, Paul Renouard, and many others; built, I
believe, on the same principle, namely, the interpretation of the tone which the artist has laid in with a
wash, by the engraver, who uses lines more or less
thick, or dots, or hatchings of his own, according to
the depth of the tone wanted. Parallel with <span class="book">The
Graphic</span> runs <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/index.html"><span class="book">The Illustrated London News</span></a>.</p>

<p>The other way is to draw one's picture with
pencil, or, better still, with pen and ink, using a  
simple conventional black outline to give the shape  
and enclose the form and face; then adding more
lines and pen-and-ink scratches, simple or cross-hatched, to suggest colour and tone, as an etcher 
does with his needle, and leaving blank all that the
artist judges non-essential to his picture — leaving it in fact, to the imagination. The engraver cuts all
this in facsimile; it is more than his place is worth
to add a line of his own, or leave out one of the
artist's. Or it may be "processed."</p>

<p>It does not do for two pictures — one of them 
designed in the first manner, the other in the second
 — to appear in juxtaposition on the same page; the
first by its completeness, and depth of tone and
colour, kills the second. Yet I confess that, to me,
the second is the more attractive of the two.</p>

<p>Among the followers of the first mentioned school
(if, indeed, he be not one of its originators) I will
cite, as an example, Mr, William Small, whose admirable illustrations are so well known to the readers
of <span class="book">The Graphic</span>. But to fully appreciate the beauty,
power, and delicacy of his work, one must see it in
the original design, before even the best of engravers
has had his will of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Abbey is an equal master of either
method. He has shown us, in his beautiful illustrations to "She Stoops to Conquer," specimens of his
[352/353]
perfection in both. I have seen the originals, and as
far as his absolute craft is concerned, I don't know
which of the two to admire the most. But for my
own taste, I infinitely prefer the scratchy pen-and-ink designs, which give just the essence of what one
most wishes to see, and leave out everything else;
and then, when the drawings are duly "processed"
and printed, no interpreter comes between Mr. Abbey
and myself, no middle-man.</p>

<p>Therefore, the latter method seems to me the
highest and most legitimate; the most fascinating
when it is well done, and by far the hardest to do
well. It was the method of J. Gilbert, J. E. Millais,
and F. Walker, among many others.   It is the
method of Mr. Charles Keene, who is universally
admitted (especially by those who know, because
they have tried to do it themselves) to be the
greatest master of the art of drawing on wood with
pen and ink that we have, or ever have had. His
knowledge of what can be done with mere black
lines of different thickness to give the illusion of
light and shade, colour, shape, texture, weather,
nearness, or distance, and his instinct, especially, for
feeling what he ought to leave out, or can afford to
leave out — seem to me to be only matched by a like
knowledge and instinct in the German Menzel. If
his picture were executed in washes, and made a
literal transcript of nature in black and white (however well), how infinitely it would lose of light and
breadth, of freedom and breeziness, and large and
happy suggestiveness! It would cease to be the
work of a conjurer.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from Small's method, and
Abbey's, and Keene's to R. Caldecott's, who can
tell so much in a little pen-and-ink outline! One
may have one's individual preferences, but who can
say, for certain, that one method is better than
another ?</p>

<p>As for the book illustrators of our day, they
are many and admirable, whatever their method.
Besides those I have named, there are Caton Woodville, <a href="../barnard/index.html">Barnard</a>, <a href="../sullivan/index.html">Sullivan</a>, <a href="../parsons/index.html">Parsons</a>, Millet, <a href="../reinhart/index.html">Reinhardt</a>, Partridge, and others, whose names escape me at
the moment — only to be remembered when it is too
late, probably.  But many as they are, they are
not too many for the work they have to do, and
their number will have to be increased. In mere
technical equipment they immeasurably surpass their
popular predecessors, Cruikshank and Hablot Browne.
In all arts and crafts the standard of mere technical
excellence seems to have gone up, and to be easily
reached by a far greater number of aspirants; in
painting, verse-making, play-writing, the padding
of magazines', the scoring of music, the dexterous
pouring of old wine into new bottles, and what not!
 — in all, perhaps, save the manufacture of novels,
whereof the humble illustrator has a right to his
opinion, since he has sometimes to read and re-read
them so carefully. And if the disappointed author
says to him "Why can't you draw like Phiz?"
he can fairly retort: "Why don't you write like
Dickens?"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, such amenities are
not often exchanged between author and artist; and
I, for one, have met with nothing but kindness and
courtesy from those I have illustrated. When I
have failed to please, the only revenge has been a
discreet silence; indeed, in one case, where I failed
conspicuously and disastrously, through the unsuitability of the subject-matter to my pencil, the
author has heaped coals of fire on my liead, by
becoming my intimate friend.   It is true that I
only accepted the commission to please the publisher,
who was the common friend of us both, not seeing
at the time how unfit I was for this particular task.</p>

<p>And here, at the risk of letting it be thought
that I am too much puffed up with vaingloriousness,
I will go so far as to say that on three or four
occasions I have actually been the recipient of compliments and thanks from the author himself in his
own handwriting". I will even mention the names
of Mr. <a href="../../../authors/meredith/index.html">George Meredith</a>, Mr. <a href="../../../authors/hardy/index.html">Thomas Hardy</a>, and
Mr. James Payn; and hereby return my compliments and thanks for theirs.

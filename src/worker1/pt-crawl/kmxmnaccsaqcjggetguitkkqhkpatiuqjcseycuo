<P>In Florence this year, 16 May 1996, an inscribed tablet was
unveiled, that read (roughly translated):</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <div align="center"><font color="#00FF00">Here Antonio Meucci, the inventor of the telephone, was
    born on 13 April 1808. Placed by his fellow citizens 16 May 1996.</font></div>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Meucci joined other claimants as inventors of the telephone,
challenging the universal fame gained by Alexander Graham Bell:
Johann Philipp Reis, Innocenzo Manzetti, and Charles Bourseul in
Europe, and Amos Dolbear, Sylvanus D. Cushman, Daniel Drawbaugh,
Edward Farrar, James McDonough, and Elisha Gray in the United
States.</P>

         <P>The unveiling of the Meucci memorial tablet before the
         house in which the inventor was born was attended by 300
         people, including many tourists. Afterwards, once everyone
         was seated in a magnificent salon in the Palazzo Vecchio,
         once the residence of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, now the
         residence of the City Administration, the Mayor of Florence,
         Professor Mario Primicerio, spoke briefly. He thanked
         Telecom Italia, Italy's main telecommunications provider,
         for organizing the meeting, and he read two telegrams. One
         was from the Order Sons of Italy in America, in Washington,
         DC; the other was from the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum and the
         film producer Tony De Nonno, both of New York, praising the
         project as well as the book titled <I>Antonio Meucci:
         l'inventore e il suo tempo</I> (in English, <I>Antonio
         Meucci: The Inventor and his Times</I>) by yours truly,
         Basilio Catania. After speeches by the chair of the Culture
         Council, Prof. Guido Clemente, and the President of Telecom
         Italia, Dr. Umberto Silvestri, it was my turn, as author of
         the book, to speak.</P>
         
         <P>Reiterating my full speech is beyond the scope of this
         newsletter, but I will relate its basic point, that is
         covered in the second volume of my book (available only in
         Italian for the time being). It stems from a drawing (shown
         below) found in an affidavit sworn by Antonio Meucci and
         Michael Lemmi before Charles Taylor, a New York County
         notary public, on 28 September 1885.<SUP>1</SUP> The drawing
         consists of four circuit diagrams for long-distance
         telephone lines. Each uses a ground return path and an
         electromagnetic telephone at either end of the circuit.</P>
      </TD>

</CENTER>

<P>The circuit "No. 1" shows the experiment that Antonio Meucci
stated that he performed on 27 September 1870. Circuits "No. 2" and
"No. 3" differ from "No. 1" only in the insertion midway along the
long-distance line of an inductor formed around an iron core in the
shape of either a horse-shoe or a cylinder. In circuit "No. 4,"
Meucci placed an inductor at both ends of the line between the
telephone and the ground.</P>

<P>Telecommunications engineers will immediately recognize the
technique illustrated in this drawing: the inductive loading of
telephone lines. The technique was used for many decades after 1900
to improve the performance (both range and quality) of telephone
lines by a factor of two to three. <a name=lemmi2></a>The invention
of this technique is commonly attributed to Michael Idvorsky Pupin,
an American of Yugoslave origin, who obtained two U.S. patents for
the technique on 19 June 1900. The Bell Telephone Company later
acquired both patents. Regardless of who first invented the
technique, the inductive loading of telephone lines was commonly
referred to as "pupinization."</P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#FF0099">Meucci's experiments on inductive loading&mdash;Drawing reproduced from <I>Lemmi's
Affidavit</I>, 1885</FONT></P>
</CENTER>

<P>Among the others with a claim to inventing the loading coil was
the Englishman Oliver Heavyside. In June 1887 he predicted, on the
basis of mathematical calculations, that telephone signals could be
transmitted without distortion by increasing the line's
self-induction, as did the French telecommunications engineer Alfred
Vaschy in the 2 July 1887 issue of the <I>Lumi&egrave;re
&Eacute;lectrique</I>. Moreover, the fundamental contribution of
George A. Campbell, contemporary to Pupin's patents, deserves
mention, as well.<SUP>2</SUP> In any case, the Meucci circuit
diagrams, notarized in September 1885 (though dated 27 September
1870), clearly predate Pupin, Campbell, Heavyside, and Vaschy.</P>

<P>Associated with the Meucci diagrams is a text translated by
Michael Lemmi, Meucci's friend and lawyer, from all passages of
Meucci's 63-page laboratory notebook dealing with the telephone. The
original notes were in Italian, since Meucci had a limited knowledge
of English. Lemmi also reproduced Meucci's drawings and also
translated explanatory labels, such as ""Long distance" and "earth"
in the above drawings.<SUP>3</SUP> The text associated with the above
drawing is from pages 35-36 of Meucci's notebook, dated 27 September
1870. It reads:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="#00FF00">Experiment made the 27th inst. I put a magnetized
   horse-shoe at the middle of the conductor. The two bars, that is
   to say, the two poles, North and South, were linked to the
   conductor. This arrangement gave satisfactory results, but if the
   conductor were copper instead of iron, I think it would be better
   (to be tried) to join a strong induction coil to the midpoint of
   the conductor, placing a strong magnetic iron bar in the center of
   said coil, or if not, connecting one pole &#91;of the induction
   coil&#93; to the transmitting tube and the other pole to the
   earth. ... The best method is a coil with a loadstone
   &#91;core&#93;, but the horse-shoe &#91;coil&#93; is better when
   placed before the &#91;telephone&#93; instrument, be it the
   receiver or the transmitter, so as to receive electricity from the
   earth &#91;path&#93;, placing the conductor as shown in drawing
   No. 4, which works as if it were helped by a galvanic
   battery.</font><SUP>4</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Fortunately for us, Michael Lemmi reproduced Meucci's drawing;
without it, these notes alone are baffling. Most amazing are the last
four lines, in which Meucci states that, by splitting the inductive
load into two parts (as shown in circuit "No. 4"), the result was
even better. This statement concurs with what Pupin patented three
decades later.</P>

<P><TABLE width="1064" BORDER=0>
<TR>
      <TD WIDTH=753>
        <P align="left">Even more amazing are Meucci's earlier notes dated 20 May
         1862 and translated by Lemmi in the same affidavit, as
         follows: <font color="#00FF00">"At the midpoint of the wire, a strongly magnetized
         iron inside a coil. Do not need any battery at all, and is a
         good conductor of the sound."</font> This notebook entry suggests
         that as early as 1862, 38 years before Pupin, Antonio Meucci
         had discovered the effectiveness of the inductive load on a
         long-distance telephone line, even to the point of
         eliminating the battery.</P>
         
        <P>To infer the length of Meucci's long-distance line, we
         take a look at another note, dated 17 August 1870, which
         reads: <font color="#00FF00">"I have obtained a distance of about one mile."</font></P>
         
        <P>If anyone thinks that Antonio Meucci discovered the
         inductive loading of long-distance telephone lines, but did
         not invent the telephone, I would reply that perhaps there
         will be another occasion to go deeper into the matter.</P>

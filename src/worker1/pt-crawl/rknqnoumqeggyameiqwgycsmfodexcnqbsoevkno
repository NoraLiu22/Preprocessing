<P> A castrated and androgynous man (if we should grant that he be a man), one who is enfeebled in soul through the study of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A> and has become womanish.

<P> There was a man (if we could grant him to be a man) enfeebled in spirit by the works of Epicurus, and become effeminate, a eunuch and a she-male, who, as if forgetting, came and thrust himself into the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaron">megaron</A>, where of course it was lawful for the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierophant">hierophant</A> only to enter.</B>
<P> As those of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athens.html#1">Athenians</A> who are renowned for determining these things say: they pray to Boulaia and to the maiden, through the agency of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierophant">hierophants</A> and the torch-bearers, for salvation for them . . .

<P> [He], sharing in evil wisdom and the atheistic words of Epicurus and cultivating she-males just for the pleasure of it, which that man praises, that youth and she-male, . . .
<P> ( <FONT CLASS="orange"> EUSTATHIUS </FONT> &nbsp; <I>That <FONT CLASS="Greek">&chi;&lambda;&omicron;&#973;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf;</FONT> means a eunuch, is made clear in its use not only by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aeschylus.html#1">Aeschylus</A>, but in particular by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aelian.html#1">Aelian</A> in his 'On Providence'.</I> )   
<P> Then he set at naught the holy things of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eumolpidae.html#1">Eumolpidae</A> and the Ceryces and the other families who were holy and dear to the gods, choosing a wisdom infamous and effeminate.
<P> And burning to show that god does not care about human affairs, he went to the megaron and thrust himself in; there of course only the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierophant">hierophant</A> was permitted to go, according to the rule of the rite, but for him it was not allowed. But when he had dared this audacity, a shuddering overcame him and he fell sick with a lengthy disease, and consumption took him; and whatever he dared, crying out and saying, and declaiming tragically in the manner of the most impious persons, and vowing to break off [the life-thread of] the infamous and accursed soul, and at length succeeding in this.

<P> A most impressive reputation was flowing about the woman.
<P> And the queen sought for there to be wedding gifts, <I>saying, in accordance with</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menander.html#3">Menander</A>'s [phrase], 'so that I also may play some game', - she herself being a 'Tricorysian queen', wishing to be mistress of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pontus.html#1">Pontus</A>.
<P> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mithridates.html#6">Mithridates</A> described the departure of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lucullus.html#4">Lucullus</A> as a stroke of luck for him.
<P> When she learned [this], as out of the current situation [<A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/bacchides.html#2">Bacchides</A>] had given to each woman a choice of death as painless and gentle as possible, taking off the diadem which she wore on her head as a symbol and a witness of her authority, she then put it around the neck making a noose for the present need.  The light <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarentum.html#1">Tarentine</A> shawl being sheer and delicate, when it was first stretched out, was then torn apart. But she was aggrieved and said, 'O despicable and infamous rag, you were not serviceable to me even for this need.' And throwing it off, she killed herself with a sword.

<P> [Apollo] orders him to render to Nicanor a bundle of Byblian <I>papyrus</I> worth four hundred gold pieces; but if he is unwilling, he will continually raise the price and demand the amount of gold pieces that are added, until he gives in and renders as much as he has been asked at that point by the voice [applying?] to all.
<P> But Apollo orders him to render to Nicanor a bundle of Byblian <I>papyrus</I> worth four hundred gold pieces and to make ashes and soaking with the water of the Mareian lake to spread [it] on [his] eyes.

<P> The <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sybaris.html#1">Sybarites</A>, having progressed to an extreme of luxury and having come to an extreme of wealth, seemed to themselves and to others to be worthy of envy.
<P> When they learned these things, the Sybarites began to record for themselves everlasting happiness. For [they said] they would not sail so far out of their right minds as ever to honour men more than gods.
<P> And they laid down a law, [to the effect that] if they were to become such [men] under so great a god, it was good fortune - they having recorded it as communal.

<P> [There was] a man [called] Euphronius, an ill-starred man, and he rejoiced in the nonsense of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A> and he adopted two bad things from that [nonsense], [namely] to be an atheist and a licentious man.

<P> He, suffering miserably from an illness (the children of the Asclepiadae call it inflammation of the lungs) at first was in need of medical treatment from human beings and had depended on them.
<P> The disease was more forceful than the knowledge of the doctors.
<P> Since, however, he was already riding on the edge [of death], his relatives took him into [a shrine of] <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asclepius.html#1">Asclepius</A>.
<P> And some one of the priests seemed to say to him, as he was falling sleep, that there is one way of safety for the man and one drug [effective against] established evils - if, having burned the books of Epicurus, he will soak up the dust of the atheists and the impious and the marks of the effeminate with liquid wax, and plaster over his belly and whole chest and bind it with fillets.
<P> He confesses to his household servants what he heard, and they were filled at once with an excessive joy at not having expelled a man who had been demeaned and dishonoured by the god.
<P> And after drawing some instruction from him they then imitated [him] with a view to [behaving] well and nobly.

 order, killing these men.
<P> Marcus, one of the well-born, an <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedile">aedile</A> in rank, was proscribed. Then indeed, wanting to escape notice, he shaved his head and beard, assuming <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/egypt.html#1">Egyptian</A> clothing, the sort that the attendants of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isis.html#1">Isis</A> wear, and he leapt about shaking a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistrum">sistrum</A> and going from one city to the next, collecting [alms] in the name of the goddess and gratefully accepting necessary sustenance, as a remedy against hunger.

<P> . . . and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodotus.html#1">Herodotus</A> was right to set no store by provocations and madnesses concerning women.

<P> Each was eager to obtain the girl through abduction. Thus an exotic war began and intensified, though it was quite unexpected since it had a cause that was neither noble nor seemly.
<P> Each of them, having seized the giftless fate of the girl with their own lot, as a tragic poet would say, murdered themselves.
<P> . . . but with those men too having been allocated to the faction.
<P> Striking out at their friends and servants, they were killing them as [if they were] enemies.
<P> Being excited along with them and fanned up by this insane love of honour, the worst of demons, they have perished.

<P> A bloom produced on the face, such as no moist and delicate and flourishing meadow can bring forth with the dew of spring, a beautiful blush and a very sweet smile. 
<P> [She was] a woman from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syria.html#1">Syria</A> and wagon-crushed by every comer. For she was a well-known courtesan and more passionate in licentiousness than those in the mimes, and with her postures appearing to the general view enticing the audience to the passions of the body, and prompting the people, and whoever [was] with the people, towards a swinish and manic wantonness.
<P> Certain gatherings took place at her [house] and assemblages of unruly men and lewd women and youths who had opted for a ruinous life.
<P> He did not fail [in] upright judgment as among licentious men concerning the faction of the mime-actress; for with resplendent beauty of body she was practiced in the art of deceit.
<P> For moving softly and ground-seeking with her feet, and being lightly dressed, she got the better of all the jugglers that went before; having an agreeable voice and singing with art, she was not judged second to anyone of those who were admired for their songs, and since she was experienced in sexual intermeddling, flirting when the opportunity arose and cleverly moving the man to jealousy, she brought to herself not inconsiderable wealth, but him, pining little by little with love, she released from the present situation.

<P> Becoming a robber of sacred things and habitually overturning the very abodes of the gods and committing accursed murders and having shredded the laws and having renounced the nature of men and having made marriages that were both without sacrifices and without marriage, which I know shook even the god, and I recognized other omens when I was under the sun and still ruling . . .
<P> The sacrilegious man left his homeland and continued roaming.

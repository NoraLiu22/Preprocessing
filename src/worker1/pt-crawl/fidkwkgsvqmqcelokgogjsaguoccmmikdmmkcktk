<P> <I>It is generally supposed that Strombichos was serving in the Macedonian garrison on the Mouseion hill in Athens, when he earned the gratitude of the Athenians by co-operating with them.  Pausanias records that Olympiodoros led "the old men and the youths" of the Athenians to take possession of the hill ( <A HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=1&query=Paus.%201.26">1.26'1</A> ). This probably happened at the same time as the &quot;liberation&quot; of Athens in 288/7 B.C., but some writers suggest that it occurred a few years later, perhaps in 283/2 B.C.; see J. Gabbert, &quot;Antigonus II Gonatas: A Political Biography&quot;, pp.74-5, n.16 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=eG2IAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA74">Google Books</A> ).</I>

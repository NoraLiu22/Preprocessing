  Color Paperback, 354 pages. January, 2024 edition.<br>

<p>Two hundred and sixty-six bright, fantastical paintings by science fiction master Rudy Rucker, some realistic, and some abstract. Includes his commentaries on the individual works. Rucker took up painting twenty-five years ago, when he was writing a novel about the old master, Peter Bruegel. The paintings draw on Rudy's deepest thoughts, although, in transreal style, many of them connect to his SF novels. This is the January, 2024, edition of <em>Better Worlds</em>. It replaces all earlier editions.</p>

<h3>Thirty Illustrations of <span class="h3book">Great Expectations</span> (from the Household Edition)</h3>

<p class="one">Many of these small-scale plates contain just two or three figures, having 
the effect of a television mid-range shot; the plate on page 48 (114 in the Collier 
edition) contains four figures cleverly balanced and juxtaposed, Joe and Pip right, Miss 
Havisham and the shadowy Estella immediately behind her, left, to suggest that Estella is 
Miss Havisham's apprentice in the ghastly "trade" of breaking men's hearts. A pattern in 
these 28 plates is that, in illustrations containing three figures, one is often the 
observer, as in "Orlick . . . . Was Very Soon Among the Coal-dust, and in No Hurry To 
Come Out of It" (p. 53; p. 129 in the Collier edition), in which a small Pip observes the 
battling giants from the right, or in "'Now This,' Said Mr. Trabb . . . . 'Is a Very 
Sweet Article" in which Trabb's boy is the observer. Such "group" plates as that on page 
77 (Collier edn., p. 187) and that on page 116 (Collier edn., p. 273) tend to be rather 
cluttered, despite the artist's best attempts at using block groups, costume, gender, and 
gesture to provide a focus and an organisational principle.</p>

<p>One of the best group plates, the significant scene in which Estella insists Pip take 
her purse on page 124 (Collier ed., p. 294), involves the foregrounding of the two 
principals while other figures go about their affairs (we note that one of the porters in 
the right foreground appears to be observing and overhearing the conversation, exactly as 
the readers are). The artist has generally avoided single-figure compositions, so that 
Pip's return home, in the garb of a London "gentleman" on page 129 (Collier edn., p. 309) 
admirably conveys a sense of the protagonist's sense of dislocation and alienation, a 
dark pillar against the white plaster walls of the village cottages in the background. 
The running head "How My Sister's Death Affected Me" underscores the reflective the mood 
created by the plate.</p>

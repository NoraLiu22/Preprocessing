		  <h3>All Announcements</h3>
		  <ul>
			<li>November 9, 2011
			<p>Announcing <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/publications/neh2011-2011-11-08-announcement.pdf">"Working with text in a digital age"</a>,
			an NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities.
			Co-directors: Monica Berti and Gregory Crane, Tufts University;
		       	Anke L&uuml;deling, Humboldt University.</p>
			<p><b>July 23-August 11, 2012</b> Tufts University, Medford MA</p>
			<p>This institute will provide participants with three weeks in which (1) to develop hands on experience with TEI-XML, (2) to apply methods from information retrieval, text visualization, and corpus and computational linguistics to the analysis of textual and linguistic sources in the humanities, (3) to rethink not only their own research agendas but also new relationships between their work and non-specialists.</p>
			<p>A call for applications will follow shortly.</p>

				<p>Perseus is pleased to announce collaboration with the Pelagios and Pleiades projects. Please refer to the <a href="http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/2011/11/perseus-and-pelagios.html">blog post</a> for details.</p>
				<p>We have also recently addressed errors in the sort order of the Greco-Roman collection list and fixed a number of typographical errors, broken abbreviations and text links.</p>
				<p>Please note that due to the recent increase in amount of available morphological data on Perseus,  we have run into resource limitations updating our frequency tables, so frequency scores may currently be inaccurate for many of the lemmas. We are working to address this problem as quickly as possible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>September 23, 2011
				<p>Perseus is pleased to announce the availability of the 
				<a href="http://catalog.perseus.tufts.edu/jstor/">Thematic Index of Classics in JStor</a>, 
				an automatically generated index of themes in a collection of more than 130,000 research 
				articles archived in JStor. This work was developed by David Mimno under the Cybereditions 
				Project, an effort led by the Perseus Project at Tufts University and funded by the Mellon Foundation. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>September 19, 2011
				<p>Perseus wishes to announce the publication of the first digital 
				edition of <a href="/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2002.02.0015">Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon</a>
				- the major English lexicon for Classical Arabic, now available under in TEI XML under a Creative Commons 
				License. Perseus has published a number of lexica and lexicographic resources, including Salmon&#x00e9;'s Arabic 
				English Lexicon, but Lane's monumental lexicon for Classical Arabic posed particular challenges because 
				of its organization according to roots rather than dictionary words. The resulting complications 
				affected not only the structure of an inherently complex document but the services 
				by which readers can find relevant words. Harry Diakoff of <a href="http://alpheios.net">The Alpheios Project, Ltd.</a>
				created a working TEI XML edition of Lane and integrated it with the Alpheios reading 
				environment tools.</p>
				<p>Perseus also wants to highlight the release on <a href="http://alpheios.net">Alpheios.net</a> 
				of key texts in Classical Arabic, including
				<a href="http://repos1.alpheios.net/exist/rest/db/xq/alpheios-text.xq?urn=urn:cts:arabicLit:perseus201002.perseus0001.alpheios-text-ara1:01.0">

					The Autobiography Of The Constantinopolitan Story-Teller</a>,
				<a href="http://repos1.alpheios.net/exist/rest/db/xq/alpheios-text.xq?urn=urn:cts:arabicLit:perseus201003.perseus0002.alpheios-text-ara1:1.1">

	     <p>This release includes parses for 139,385 additional Greek forms and 100,328 additional Latin forms, resulting in 22% more Greek morphological analyses and 39% more Latin. The majority of the primary source texts in the Greco-Roman collection have also been updated as part of an ongoing effort to standardize the markup scheme. Most  of the updates to the texts were structural, with only minor, if any, changes to the content.  Please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:perseus_webmaster@tufts.edu">report</a> any problems you may see with any of the texts.</p>

	     <p>Perseus submitted a <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/publications/dpla/beta-sprint-tufts.html">contribution to the Beta Sprint</a> for the 
	     <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/dpla">Digital Public Library of America</a>. 
	     We offer technological examples such as the Perseus Digital Library itself, 
	     as well as the <a href="http://books.cs.umass.edu/beta-sprint/">Proteus Book search 
	     system</a> and the <a href="http://alpheios.net">Alpheios reading environment</a>. 
             We would also like to point out the <a href="http://www.mukurtuarchive.org/">Mukurtu 
	     project</a> provides a content management system in which indigenous communities
     	     can distinguish content that they can release under a Creative Commons open license 
	     from materials that are only appropriate for particular lineages or groups within 
	     their communities.  The <a href="http://historyengine.richmond.edu/">History Engine</a> 
	     gives students the opportunity to learn history by doing the work — researching, writing, 
	     and publishing — of a historian. The result is an ever-growing collection of historical 
	     articles or "episodes" that paints a wide-ranging portrait of life in the United States 
	     throughout its history and that is available to scholars, teachers, and the general 
	     public in their online database.</p></li>

		    in which these poems are quoted. The 200,000 words of Lucian represent roughly 70% 
		    of the surviving works attributed to that author. In all, this places more than 1.6 
		    million words of Greek in circulation. With this release, we have also changed the

				<li><strong>Install Perseus 4.0 on your computer</strong>: All of the source code 
				for the Perseus Java Hopper and much of the content in Perseus is now available 
				under an open source license. You can download the code, compile it, and run it 
				on your own system. This requires more labor and a certain level of expertise for 
				which we can only provide minimal support. However, since it will be running on your 
				own machine, it can be much faster than our website, especially during peak usage 
				times. You also have the option to install only certain collections or texts on your 
				version, making it as specialized as you wish. Also, if you want to use a different 
				system to make the content available, you can do so within the terms of the 
				<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licences/by-nc-sa/3.0/us">Creative Commons</a> 
				license. This is the first step in open sourcing the code as you can modify the code 
				as much as you want, but at this time, we cannot integrate your changes back into our 
				system. That is our ultimate goal, so keep a look out for that!

		   	<li><span class="date">March 15, 2006</span>: Improvements to the Perseus Digital Library
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Migration of core data to the Tufts University Repository</strong>: We are beginning 
			  to shift core Perseus data to the Tufts Institutional Repository, where it will become a part of 
			  the university's permanent collection. There are several implications: </li>
			  <li><strong>Preservation</strong>: This step addresses the long term needs of preservation and 
			  access: while Perseus has been in operation for almost two decades, libraries are better suited 
			  to maintain collections over time than particular projects. </li>
			  <li><strong>Separation of production from research</strong>: The on-line version of the 
			  Perseus Digital Library, now more than ten years old, has combined services with research 
			  and development activities. As time progresses, established services will shift to the 
			  institutional repository, with the Perseus Digital Library focusing progressively more 
			  on research and development. As research services become established and prove useful, 
			  they will subsequently migrate to the production server. </li>
			  <li><strong>Named entity browsing and searching</strong>: Perseus has extracted placenames 
			  and dates from full text for more than five years. This version of the Perseus Digital 
			  Library adds additional functionality:
			    <ul>
			      <li>You can now search for and browse placenames and dates in Perseus documents. </li>
			      <li>We are adding personal names and will soon add other categories (e.g., 
			      organizations). Personal names are in the new Perseus American collection and will 
			      be added to classical texts. Classical texts have placenames and dates marked in 
			      their public XML source.</li>
			    </ul>
			  </li>
			  <li><strong>Downloadable XML source texts</strong>: Public domain primary materials 
			  are now available under a Creative Commons license for download in their native XML 
			  format.</li>
			  <li><strong>Bug fixes and incremental modifications</strong>: many general optimizations 
			  have been implemented, and various display issues have been fixed, based on user 
			  reports.</li>
			  <li><strong>Improved hardware</strong>: we are adding new servers that are not only 
			  faster but easier to manage. This should improve not only speed but reliability.</li>
			</ul>

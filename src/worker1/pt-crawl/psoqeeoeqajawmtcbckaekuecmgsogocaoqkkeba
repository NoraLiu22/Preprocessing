<H2>Ordinary Decent Criminal (2000)</H2>

<P>D: Thaddeus O'Sullivan<BR>
S: Kevin Spacey, Linda Fiorentino</P>

<P>The third version of the Martin Cahill story (following <I>Vicious Circle</I>
and <I><A HREF="gen.htm">The General</A></I>) is an appalling mess, desperate
to establish its own identity by upping the pace and changing the names
of the characters, but painfully inauthentic in every respect. Headlining
Kevin Spacey (<I><A HREF="abeaut.htm">American Beauty</A></I>) and Linda
Fiorentino (<I><A HREF="dogma.htm">Dogma</A></I>) in the leads, scripted
by Gerry Stembridge (<I>Guiltrip</I>), and directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan
(<I>Nothing Personal</I>), the film must have seemed so attractive on paper
that Clarence Pictures and Little Bird couldn't bear to pull the plug even
though it was blatantly obvious that it had nowhere to go. Though the lives
of American gangsters have inspired many films with different takes on the
same characters, John Boorman's account of the life and times of Ireland's
best-known criminal of recent years in <A HREF="gen.htm"><I>The General</I>
</A>took the classic gangster film structure and added layers of sociological
and psychological detail, pretty much telling the story as well as it could
be. O'Sullivan's film cannot escape the shadow of its predecessor, and despite
the slippery narrative structure, rapid pace and overall dumbing-down of
the characters and situation, it fails to achieve any kind of impact.</P>

<P>The story of Cahill's life of crime has been tweaked slightly into a
tale of the cost of fame by writer Gerry Stembridge. Instead of a melancholy
study of urban crime and the psychology of the criminal fraternity, <I>Ordinary
Decent Criminal</I> is a slapstick farce about how a fun-loving criminal
achieves fame and notoriety to the cost of his career and friendships. Robbed
of its social context and any semblance of believable characterisation,
the film concentrates on broad, silly comedy. It borders awkwardly on parody,
but really this is more evidence of the panic which has affected the film
on the whole. It also tries hard to make Cahill (here called &quot;Michael
Lynch&quot; although he lives the same polygamous life, does many of the
things Cahill did in real life, and caps his career with the theft of a
painting; albeit Caravaggio's <I>The Taking of Christ</I> in this film,
which provides an opportunity for some weak thematic rambling about the
character's messianic fantasies) and his gang as 'cool' as possible by having
them all dressed in black leather, by having none of them particularly violent
(one cruel scene stands out and seems incongrous amid this laddish fantasy),
and by generally making it seem more of a cartoon than a drama (as <A HREF="lsb.htm"><I>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</I> </A>did). These criminals
are more like Sgt. Bilko's outfit than a group of thugs and robbers, and
the Gardai are potrayed as even stupider and country-fried than they were
in <A HREF="gen.htm"><I>The General</I>.</A> When the few dramatic scenes
then come (&quot;Lynch&quot; breaking under pressure, his betrayal by gang
members, his brushes with the IRA), they fall completely flat, and the whole
film feels unbalanced, inappropriate and embarrassing.</P>

<P>Spacey is a capable performer, but his is badly miscast. He does his
best under the circumstances, but his accent is woefully misjudged, his
characterisation shallow and the result is fatally artificial. Fiorentino
has less screen time as his wife, but is again a little too sophisticated
for the character and seems badly out of place. Support from Helen Baxendale
(TV's <I>Friends</I>) and Peter Mullan (<I><A HREF="joe.htm">My Name is
Joe</A></I>), among others, is less intrusive, but with the leads so clearly
wrong for the film, the rest falls by the wayside. Compounding their problems
are the relentlessly up-beat music score by Damon Albarn (<I><A HREF="rav.htm">Ravenous</A></I>)
and the rapid editing (matching Stembridge's flash-back/flash-forward script),
all of which feels too much like an attempt to distract audiences from the
familiarity of the basic story ingredients and dupe them into thinking the
film really has a character of its own. If it had, it wouldn't have been
so desperate to prove it. It doesn't, and no amount of technique will cover
this up.</P>

<P><I>Ordinary Decent Criminal</I> is a huge disappointment coming, as it
does, from filmmakers and performers of this calibre. Stembridge's <I>Guiltrip</I>
was one of the most notable Irish feature films of the last decade, as were
O'Sullivan's <I>December Bride</I> and <I>Nothing Personal</I>. But this
is a frankly dreadful film: difficult to watch, painfully wrongheaded, and
obviously in frantic search of a young (possibly American) audience who
will not really care how shallow and uninvolving it is and how badly it
has misrepresented both the letter and the spirit of the story it pretends
not to tell. Irish viewers will want to see it out of curiosity, but unless
you felt <A HREF="wn.htm"><I>Waking Ned</I> </A>was the most intelligent
and subtle film you've ever seen about the effect of greed on a small community,
you're better off sticking with <A HREF="gen.htm"><I>The General</I>.</A></P>

<H1> Cicero: Academica</H1> 
<BR>

<P> <I>In his 'Academica', written in 45 B.C., Cicero discussed problems of epistemology - the extent and reliability of knowledge. As in most of his philosophical works, he described the propositions of Greek philosophers, so that they could be understood by a Roman audience.</I>

<P> <I>The state of the text of the 'Academica', as it has survived, is somewhat confusing. Soon after he had written it, Cicero thoroughly revised the text, and published a second edition. The first edition was divided into two books, dedicated to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Lutatius_Catulus_Capitolinus">Catulus</A> and <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucullus">Lucullus</A>. The second edition was divided into four books, dedicated to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Terentius_Varro">Varro</A>. &nbsp; Book 1, as we have it, belongs to the second edition, and Book 2 belongs the first edition. One quarter of the argument (Book 2 of the second edition, describing the scepticism of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carneades">Carneades</A>) has been completely lost. &nbsp; Book 1 is sometimes called 'Academica Posteriora' by modern scholars, and Book 2 is sometimes called 'Lucullus'.</I>

<P> <I>The translation is by H. Rackham (1933). The Latin text, edited by O. Plasberg  (1922), can be found in <A HREF="http://perseus.uchicago.edu/">Perseus under PhiloLogic</A>.</I>

The proceedings contain a large and authoritative body of   evidence in the case for the priority of Antonio Meucci's   invention of the telephone. They are, however, difficult to   retrieve since they were never printed and distributed and because   the typewritten or handwritten papers, which are located at the   National Archives, in the USA, are, still today, unorganized and   scattered in various files. The Author is presenting here some of   the evidence of fundamental importance in order to illustrate how   the history of the invention of the telephone is very faulty on   this point and demands, therefore, a congruent   revision.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In a previous article &#91;1&#93;, it wasdemonstrated how some documents, proofs of Antonio Meucci's priorityin the invention of the telephone, are retrievable nowadays, withmuch difficulty, only at the National Archives and RecordsAdministration, College Park, Maryland (USA). They are indisorganized files belonging to the lawsuit brought by the UnitedStates Government against Alexander Graham Bell and against theAmerican Bell Telephone Company (hereafter referred to as US/Bell).This lawsuit was aiming at invalidating the two original patents&#91;2,3&#93; of A. G. Bell on the telephone. Within those files isfound, in particular, the sworn affidavit of Michael Lemmi&#91;4&#93;, which contained the English translation of Meucci'snotes on the telephone experiments as he recorded them on his labnotebook (also known as <I>Memorandum Book</I>). Included in thisnotebook were his drawings, which, equally important to the notes,had so much bearing in the recent international acknowledgment ofMeucci's merit &#91;1,5,6,7&#93;, as well as in </FONT><A HREF="us_congr_res.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">ResolutionNo. 269</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"> voted by the US Congress on 11June 2002.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">With this article we would like to reconstructthe little known history <SUP>1</SUP> of those important proceedingsand to highlight the role that the United States Government had infavor of Antonio Meucci. This is not, as the Reader will see, ascientific article nor does it have any legal pretense, but it willillustrate how all the people involved had perceived the importanceof the discovery of the telephone and the role that Meucci had in it.Indeed, what the United States Government set out to prove was thatthe electromagnetic telephone was discovered by Antonio Meucci andthe carbon microphone was discovered by the German Philipp Reis<SUP>2</SUP>.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="immagini/meucci_portr.jpg" WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=244 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Fig. 1 - AntonioMeucci at the time of the trial.</FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B><I>The monopolysyndrome.</I></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Contrary to what we may think today, itwas not the likes of Antonio Meucci, Philipp Reis and others whoclaimed precedence on the invention of the telephone that movedpublic opinion and later the Government of the United States againstAmerican Bell, but American Bell itself due to the effect of what canbe called "the monopoly syndrome". In the XIX century, there were nolimitations to monopoly, since the US Patent Laws granted the ownerof a patent, for 17 years, the exclusive right to commercial profitin whatever way and at whatever price wished, preventing anyone toenter the market other than as a licensee. Consequently, due to thedominance of the patent owner within the market, those negativeaspects of monopoly that today we know all too well began to takeplace: exorbitant prices, lack of attention to the complaints and/orthe needs of customers, arrogance and the ever increasing abuse ofpower.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The problem of how to curb and limit the abuseof power of a monopoly has been a constant concern for the Governmentof the United States &#91;9,10&#93; since the last decades of the XIXcentury to day. The consensual closing of the proceedings of US/Bellin 1897 was but the first step in a long battle between the UnitedStates and American Bell, that culminated in the well knowndivestiture of AT&amp;T (American Telephone and Telegraph Co., heirto American Bell Telephone Co.), which was decreed in 1982 andcarried out in 1984, almost a century from the beginning of the trialin question. Similar measures were later adopted in other EuropeanCountries with the goal of gradually limiting the monopoly status ofthe national telephone companies in each particularCountry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As reported in &#91;11,12&#93;, subscribers'complaints about American Bell Telephone Co. became quite pressing in1880 so much so that, in August 1882, about 1200 people gatheredtogether at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia for a meeting.There they discussed and condemned the poor quality of the telephoneservice, in the presence of executives from the Company. Since thesemaintained that the service was to be considered "average", thePresident of the Assembly, William W. Goodwin, proposed theestablishment of a committee, called "Phil'a Committee", with thetask of preparing a draft for a resolution asking the Company for aclear commitment on the quality of service that it would guarantee todeliver in the future. Toward the end of 1882, the "Phil'a Committee"met again to realize that no reasonable answer had been provided byAmerican Bell and, therefore, a Syndicate was formed to look intoalternative telephone systems other than Bell. At the time, a youngelectrical engineer who worked for American Bell of New York,reported that in that city "there was an old Italian who couldfurnish conclusive evidence that he was the original inventor of thetelephone". The news (following other similar ones about allegedinventors of the telephone) was initially not taken seriously, but,just as a precaution, they thought it wise to ask a subcommittee ofexperts to make a thorough investigation on that "elderly Italianman," who was no less than Antonio Meucci.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">After a few months, in the Spring of 1883, thesubcommittee concluded its investigation with astonishing results&#91;11&#93;, confirming the validity of Meucci's invention. Thefindings were sent to the wealthy businessman, Robert Garrett,President of Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. (known as B&amp;O),who sent them to his lawyers for a legal scrutiny. In the meantime,on April 2<SUP>nd</SUP> 1883, and independently from the Philadelphiaevents, the <I>Globe Telephone Co.</I> was established in New York,with the purpose "to manufacture, sell, license and lease or renttelegraphic, telephonic and electrical instruments and suppliestherefor, &#91;&#133;&#93; to acquire by purchase or license&#91;&#133;&#93; patents and patent rights" as an alternative to Bellproducts (&#91;13&#93;, Part 2, p. 43-46). A few weeks later, theaforementioned Syndicate of Philadelphia, founding out theinitiative, took over of the new company and, in the subsequentreorganization, nominated William W. Goodwin as its President&#91;12,14&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B><I>AntonioMeucci's protest.</I></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;As the Reader can gather from the eventsdescribed, Meucci found himself involved in a situation that wouldhave exploded even without his intervention, or that of hissupporters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Going back a little in respect to those events,we must consider that on his part, and in spite of the his direeconomic conditions, Meucci had immediately reacted to Bell's twopatents of 1876-1877 which he considered "usurped" from hisinvention. Initially (1877-1879) &#91;15,16&#93;, he had relied onhis lawyer Thomas D. Stetson, who had filed his caveat "SoundTelegraph" &#91;17&#93; in 1871. Later on, in 1880, he sought thehelp of Prof. Parmelee, of Col. William Bennett and others, whopromised to uphold his priority, but without any direct commitment ontheir part &#91;16,18&#93;. Nevertheless, with the money provided byCol. Bennett, Meucci was able to rebuild the principal models of thetelephone that he had created between 1853 and 1871, and which weresimilar to those that his wife had sold during the serious illnessthat he suffered following the explosion of the Westfield ferry&#91;16,19&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Furthermore, since the beginning of 1879,Meucci gathered as many affidavits as possible for his case, drawingup 24 of them between January and July 1880. Of these, 15 have beenfound &#91;20 &#247; 34&#93; by this author. Of three more&#91;18,35,36&#93; (probably drawn up in Italian), he found theEnglish version, made in 1885. These affidavits were mentioned anddescribed in two articles published in 1884 &#91;37,38&#93;, wheresix more were mentioned (drawn up by Henry King, Patrick Kehoe,Reuben Lord, Giuseppe De Gregorio, Antonio Lazzari and L. Meriance),which we have not been able to retrieve.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Due to limited space, we cannot comment on thedetails of each of them. We can say, however, that they contain validtestimony on the following topics:</FONT></P><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The experiment that Meucci performed in   Havana in 1849;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">His later experiments in Clifton from 1852   on;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The </FONT><A HREF="havana2.htm#corradi"><FONT FACE="Arial">drawing   executed for Meucci by the painter Nestore   Corradi</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"> in 1858;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The publication of Meucci's invention on   the newspaper <I>L'Eco d'Italia</I> in 1861;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">His friend Bendelari's mission to identify   venture capitalists interested in the telephone for Italy, in   1860-1861;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The disaster of the Westfield ferry of July   30th , 1871, in which Meucci was seriously wounded, laying between   life and death for many months;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The establishment of the </FONT><A HREF="telettrofono_co.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Telettrofono   Company</I></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><I> </I>with three   Italian partners, to promote his invention, on the 12<SUP>th</SUP>   of December 1871;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The caveat "Sound Telegraph" filed at the   Patent Office on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of December 1871;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">His poverty from 1871 on;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">His request to Mr. Grant, Vice President of   American District Telegraph Company of New York, for testing his   telephone, in 1872, and the latter's statement, in 1874, that he   had lost all documents and prototypes received from   Meucci.</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Meucci, furthermore, after getting acertified copy of his caveat from the Patent Office, in November 1879&#91;15&#93;, turned many times to the Press. He gave an interview tothe <I>New York World</I> &#91;16,39,40&#93;, wrote to the<I>Messager Franco-Americain</I> (letter mentioned in &#91;41&#93;)and to <I>L'Eco d'Italia</I> &#91;41&#93; (Figure 2). The same<I>L'Eco d'Italia</I> went back on the topic in an editorial&#91;42&#93; of February 9, 1882 in which, in addition to statingthat "we will recognize Mr. Antonio Meucci as the first, the one andonly inventor", it recounted the history of Meucci's invention and italso implied the possibility that, for their patents, Bell and Grayused the information that Meucci gave to Mr. Grant. The editorialconcluded with an invitation to all Italian businessmen residing inNew York to give financial support to the legal battle for Meucci'spriority. In the Spring of 1881, Adolfo Rossi, who only a few monthsbefore had become Director of the <I>Progresso Italo-Americano</I>,joining the old and well established <I>L'Eco d'Italia</I> in NewYork, interviewed Meucci many times and printed a detailed history ofhis invention in a series of newspaper articles that were latersummarized in his book &#91;43&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the end of this long period of preparation,on April 25, 1883, Meucci gave power of attorney to Law Firm ofMichele Lemmi and Carlo Bertolino, to protect his rights over theinvention of the telephone and consequently put in their custody allthe affidavits in his hands, copy of his caveat and the renewals ofthe same, and the 26 prototypes of telephone that he had rebuilt&#91;44&#93;. The first occasion for the Lemmi &amp; Bertolino LawFirm to promote Meucci's cause was when, on July 21, 1883, thenewspapers published the Patent Office decision, largely favorable toBell, after examination of the various patents and applications forpatents "interfering" with Bell's patents<SUP>3</SUP>.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Fig. 2 - </FONT><A HREF="immagini/eco_1880.gif"><FONT FACE="Arial">AntonioMeucci's letter of 4 March 1880</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">,published on L'Eco d'Italia of 6 March 1880 (the header of thenewspaper has been placed over the article).</FONT></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Three days after, that is on July 24,1883, the law firm of Lemmi &amp; Bertolino sent to all the majornewspapers of New York a letter signed by Meucci, in which he claimedpriority in the invention of the telephone, citing his caveat "SoundTelegraph", filed on December 28, 1871, its renewals up to the end of1874, and concluding as follows "I shall not abandon my rights, and Ishall call myself, by valid documents, the first American citizen whohas obtained from said Patent Office of Washington, a caveat whichentitles me to the priority of invention of the great contendedtelephone". This letter was published, among others, in the <I>NewYork Herald</I> &#91;45&#93;, and the <I>Telegraphic Journal andElectrical Review</I> &#91;46&#93;. These articles produced animmediate positive reaction that attracted the attention of AmericanBell as well. As we will see in more details later, the law firm ofLemmi &amp; Bertolino, in August of 1883, received some importantproposals, among them those of E.B. Welch of Boston and of Alfred P.Willoughby of Chicago.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The negotiations with Mr. Welch (who wasconnected with American Bell, as shown in &#91;8&#93;), as well asthe following direct contacts with American Bell, are described indetail in the affidavits &#91;44,47&#93; and amply illustrated in aneditorial of the<I> Chicago Evening Journal</I> &#91;48&#93;. Itsuffices to say here that they were but maneuvers aiming at findingout as much as possible on Meucci's claims in order to dismantlethem. However, the law firm of Lemmi &amp; Bertolino were quick atidentifying them and avert them at their very beginning. We wouldlike to remind that representatives of American Bell, during ameeting with members of the Syndicate, hinted at an estimate forMeucci's invention of about one million dollars (affidavit of RobertR. Dearden, drawn up on the end of the affidavit &#91;47&#93; of Mr.Goodwin).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">On the other hand, the contacts with Mr.Willoughby (connected with the aforementioned Syndicate ofPhiladelphia), seemed genuine and went well. Therefore, on September22nd, 1883, Antonio Meucci signed the transfer of his rights on thecaveat "Sound telegraph", for $1 <SUP>4</SUP>, to a Syndicate made upby Alfred P. Willoughby of Chicago and by Messrs. William W. Goodwin,James Work and Robert R. Dearden of Philadelphia. A few weeks later,Meucci's lawyer Carlo Bertolino relinquished to the Syndicate all thetelephone prototypes created by Meucci and all the affidavits swornin his favor up to that time. On December 4<SUP>th</SUP>, 1883,Meucci signed another deed of transfer to the same Syndicate for hispatent application " Marine Telegraph", filed on 8 July 1880(&#91;13&#93;, Part 1, p.70) and a (ready to be made) patentapplication "Method of and apparatus for transmitting soundtelegraphically" derived from his caveat "Sound telegraph"<SUP>5</SUP>. Finally, on December 7, 1883, Meucci notified thePatent Office that the lawyers O.E. Duffy of Washington, DC andHoward Munnickhuysen of Baltimore, MD, (both legal representatives ofthe Syndicate) were going to represent him in relation to the caveat"Sound Telegraph" and its future development (&#91;13&#93;, Part 2,p.5).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the meantime, something was happening inBaltimore, where the aforementioned Robert Garrett, after receivingfrom his lawyers, in the fall of 1883, the final report on AntonioMeucci, decided to intervene against the gigantic monopoly ofAmerican Bell "in order to break the powerful grip that allowed thiscompany to maintain its isolation in the market". In fact, on January31</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><SUP>st</SUP></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">,1884, the Globe Telephone Company of Baltimore was established with acapital of one million dollars. The newspapers reported that thefounding members were capitalists well known in the financial world(one of them from London) and that they were connected with the GlobeTelephone of New York &#91;11,52,53,54&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The following March 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 1884, thecorporate capital of 10 million dollars of the Globe TelephoneCompany of New York was deposited. The headquarters of the companywas at the Mills Building, 15 Broad Street. The nameplate at theentrance of the offices, as well as the letterhead and the newsletter&#91;12,13&#93; released by the company, bore the name of AntonioMeucci as <I>Electrician</I>, to mean the technical expert of thecompany. Meucci's "magic moment" continues in September, with thepublication of the article &#91;11&#93; in <I>Electrical World</I>,that recalls the entire story of his invention of the telephone andthe events that lead to the creation of the Globe Telephone Companyin New York. The article came out September 6<SUP>th</SUP>, 1884, afew days before the inauguration of the <I>Philadelphia ElectricalExhibition</I>, open to the public from September 14<SUP>th</SUP> toOctober 18<SUP>th</SUP>, 1884, where the two principal prototypes ofMeucci's telephone were shown.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also the <I>Telegraphic Journal and ElectricalReview </I>of October 11<SUP>th</SUP>, 1884 &#91;37&#93;, with thetitle "The Philadelphia Electrical Exhibition &endash; First Notice"recalls the story of Meucci's invention and reports that Meucci'stelephone devices are shown at the exhibit. Another quite similararticle, titled "The Telephone Claimed by Meucci," referring to thesame exhibit, was published shortly afterward in the prestigious<I>Scientific American</I> &#91;38&#93;. In both was reportedthat</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>the Globe Telephone   Company (New York) exhibit is one that at present attracts   (amongst telephone men) considerable notice. This company was   formed to work the Shaw patents &#91;&#133;&#93;. But it is in the   Meucci invention, shown here, that the greatest interest lies   &#91;&#133;&#93;.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The article continues with a detaileddescription of 18 affidavits, among those mentioned previously insupport to Meucci's priority in the invention of the telephone, andconcludes</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>by giving a drawing   of one of Meucci's telephones (1857) exhibited here, together with   a copy of the caveat filed in 1871 and a reproduction of the   drawing said to be the original on which the caveat was   based.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is not possible to quote here the content ofthe numerous other articles and/or interviews on Meucci, published orreferred to in the period from 1883 to 1885, therefore we only givetheir bibliographic references &#91;55&#247;63&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the Spring of 1885, as we shall see lateron, some industrial companies started an action attempting to involvethe Government towards hindering American Bell monopoly. The GlobeCo., in view of joining the initiative, began to prepare the body ofevidence in favor of Meucci. The person that took on the task was Dr.Seth R. Beckwith, a surgeon of Elizabeth, N.J., who also had a degreein Law and who, in 1883, was General Manager of the OverlandTelephone Company of New York. There he had acquired a substantialknowledge in the telephonic field and had become an admirer ofMeucci. Beginning June 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 1885, and following hisrequest, Beckwith was hosted at the offices of the Globe Co., in NewYork, where he talked with many people who had seen Meucci'stelephones before 1875, had talked through them and were able todescribe them. He had them draw up 36 affidavits, most of them new,whereas some were rewritten or translated in English from previousones, already mentioned, done in 1880.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">On August 20<SUP>th</SUP> of the same year,Beckwith was appointed General Manager of the Globe Co.&#91;64,65&#93;. The following September 12<SUP>th</SUP>, he made thecompany publish and distribute a newsletter &#91;12&#93; that carriedthe history of Meucci's invention in which he enumerated the proofsof Meucci's priority with respect to Bell, stating that the Globe Co.had in its possession a total of 50 affidavits supporting whatstated.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have been able to trace 27 affidavits (swornafter 1880) which added to the 24 mentioned before, make a total of51 affidavits, which figure is not too far from that mentioned insaid newsletter. Those affidavits were listed and/or commented uponin a letter of lawyer David Humphreys, legal counsel to the GlobeCo., addressed to the acting Attorney General of the United States,Hon. John Goode &#91;66&#93;, and/or in a letter of Hon. Lucius Q.C.Lamar, Secretary of the Interior of the United States, to the sameGoode &#91;67&#93;. Some of these 27 affidavits&#91;4,16,19,39,40,44,47,54&#93; have already been recalled in thiswork in different instances; the other &#91;68 &#247; 85&#93; havebeen traced by this author at the National Archives, except the onedrawn up by R. Benedetti, cited in &#91;66&#93;, which was notretrieved.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Again, we do not have the space here to commenton these more affidavits. We would like to cite, however, the longaffidavit &#91;79&#93; sworn by John Fleming, the secondhand dealerwho bought from Meucci's wife all the telephone prototypes and otherpieces and electrical components -- which filled "a box 3 x 3 feet,so heavy that I could not move it". In his affidavit, Fleming gives adetailed description of the things he bought, with precise referenceto some of the prototypes reconstructed by Meucci in 1880.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B><I>Powerless against AmericanBell.<BR>The Government is asked to intervene.</I></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">From 1878 to 1885, when the American Governmentfinally intervened, American Bell had been able to gain, in localcourts, a substantial series of victories against those who tried toattack its monopoly. The word however was that they were obtainedthanks to the ability of its lawyers, as well as the connivance ofsome judges and people from the Patent Office rather than theobjective superiority of Bell's patents in respect to the inventionsboosted by other inventors. The lawyers for American Bell were evenable to obtain from the judges, and in a very short time (a few weeksfrom the beginning of the lawsuit), a preliminary injunction which,<I>pendente lite</I>, forced the plaintiff to suspend all businessactivities. This, in turn, by preventing the company to generateincome, forced it to exhaust its capital in legalexpenses.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is impossible for us to summarize all thecourt proceedings mentioned; however, it is important to point outthat the first and most important court case that saw theconfrontation of American Bell with the giant Western Union TelegraphCompany (which controlled the telephone inventions by Thomas Edison,Amos Dolbear and Elisha Gray and owned much of the US telegraphnetwork) was resolved with an out of court settlement, signed onNovember 10, 1879. The settlement provided for the division of themarket between the two companies: the telephone market for AmericanBell and the telegraph market for Western Union, plus the officialacknowledgment by Western Union of A.G. Bell's priority in theinvention of the telephone. American Bell, on its part, agreed to pay20% of the profits derived from any telephone subscriber for a periodof 17 years and to buy the 56,000 telephones and exchanges thatWestern Union had already installed in 55 cities (&#91;8&#93; p.175&#93;).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">This agreement was heavily laden withsuspicions of collusion. In particular, there were well foundedsuspicions &#91;8,86,87,88&#93; that it was reached in part toprevent Antonio Meucci's invention from becoming public. WesternUnion, it seems, had obtained a complete documentation of it from itsaffiliate, American District Telegraph Company, more precisely fromits aforementioned vice president Edward B. Grant as well as itssuperintendent Henry W. Pope, brother of the chief technical expertof Western Union, Frank L. Pope<SUP>6</SUP>. Its disclosure, in fact,would have annulled or raised questions about the telephone patentsof both sides, since the then current patent law (Patent Act, July 8,1871) ruled, in SEC. 24, that any patent in order to be valid, had todescribe an invention "not known or used by others in this country"and, in SEC. 30, that "the applicant shall make oath or affirmation&#91;&#133;&#93; that he does not know and does not believe that thesame &#91;invention&#93; was ever before known or used&#91;&#133;&#93;" &#91;89&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The maneuvers to involve the Government againstthe monopoly of American Bell began in the second half of 1885, inthe South of the United States and were facilitated by the rise topower of the Democratic Party (very strong in the South). In theadministration of the new President, Stephen Grover Cleveland<SUP>7</SUP>, were, among others, Gen. Augustus H. Garland, AttorneyGeneral, and Lucius Q.C. Lamar, Secretary of the Interior, whosenames will come up often later on.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The person who started the fire was Watson VanBenthuysen of New Orleans, Louisiana, President of the NationalImproved Telephone Company <SUP>8</SUP>. On July 12, 1885 -- a fewdays following one of the many preliminary injunctions that AmericanBell obtained against National Improved -- Van Benthuysen wrote aletter &#91;92&#93; to the Attorney General Garland, inviting him tostart a lawsuit on behalf of the Government with the purpose ofannulling the two main patents of A.G. Bell on the telephone and,later, he drew up an affidavit in which he accused the presidingCourt of collusion with American Bell &#91;91&#93;. Moreover, thefollowing August 24, 1885, from Memphis, Tennessee, Van Benthuysensent a memorial &#91;93&#93; to Hon. Henry W. McCorry, United StatesDistrict Attorney for Western Tennessee "on behalf of the citizens ofMemphis", underwritten by Charles P. Huntington (Mississippi), J.R.Beckwith <SUP>9</SUP> (well known lawyer of New Orleans, Louisiana,and legal counsel to the National Improved), and by Col. George B.Gantt of Memphis (a director of the National Improved). In thememorial they extensively outlined the reasons why the two principalpatents of Bell should be annulled, and again invited the Governmentto bring a lawsuit for the annulment, suggesting that the trialshould preferably take place in Memphis, on behalf of the Governmentof the United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">On 31 August 1885, Hon. H.W. McCorry forwardedsaid memorial to the Attorney General, with an accompanying lettersaying that, after examining the evidence and the affidavits enclosedwith the memorial, he believed that Bell's patents had been"improvidently and irregularly issued" and , therefore, that hefavored the initiation of a trial "wholly under the control of thegovernment, so that it should be a suit of the government, in fact aswell as in name." &#91;94,95&#93;. In absence of Gen. Garland, theletter was read, as per norm, by his second in command, Gen. JohnGoode. He signed the authorization requested by McCorry, who, onSeptember 9, 1885, filed the bill of complaint of the United StatesGovernment against American Bell &#91;95,96&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Obviously, American Bell was not about to takelightly an attack so violent and dangerous. First of all, itunleashed a furious press campaign with articles on the <I>New YorkWorld</I> and the <I>New York Times</I> condemning the JusticeDepartment and its decision to proceed against American Bell andaccused Attorney General Garland of wanting to promote the interestsof Pan Electric of which he was a stockholder &#91;95&#93;. TheAdministration issued a press release, denying the accusations&#91;97&#93; <SUP>10</SUP>, but, at the same time, on October 9,1885, ordered McCorry to suspend the legal action against AmericanBell and turn over the entire documentation in his possession to theDepartment of the Interior, in charge of awarding and controllingpatents, for preliminary examination and recommendation. ThoughMcCorry, on October 14, reiterated his request to be authorized toproceed, three days later, Hon. Goode denied the request&#91;91,94,95&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">At this point, other opponents of AmericanBell, such as the Globe Telephone Company &#91;98&#93;, theWashington Telephone Company, the North American Telephone Companyand others, came to the aid of National Improved filing with theDepartment of Justice petitions asking the Government to intervenefor annulling Bell's patents. The New York Chamber of Commerce aswell approved a resolution in favor of the trial &#91;94&#93;. Lateron, Pan Electric Company sent many affidavits, signed by eminentscientific personalities -- among them Thomas Edison &#91;99&#93; --who denied A.G. Bell's priority in the invention of the telephone&#91;100&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">On its part, American Bell began to prepareitself for the inevitable confrontation with the Government and thenew opponents. In particular, in order to face the Globe Co., ithired <I>Pinkerton's National Detective Agency</I> to follow Meucciand gather as much information as possible to use in its own defenseand/or to start a legal action against the Globe Co.&#91;49&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Secretary of the Interior, Hon. Lucius Q.C.Lamar (Figure 3)<SUP>11</SUP>, did not waste time in bureaucraticexaminations, and announced hearings, open to the public and thepress (this also to avert another campaign against theAdministration), from November 9 to November 14, 1885, so as toelucidate <I>erga omnes</I> the parties positions. Hon. Lamar had twoAssts. Secretaries sitting with him, Henry L. Muldrow and George A.Jenks, as well as the Commissioner of Patents, Martin V.B.Montgomery. The <I>Evening Post</I> of November 10 &#91;100&#93;reported that the parties in the lawsuit were three: American Bell, agroup of companies "which base their claims in considerable measureupon the patents of Reis and Meucci", and an "unknown interest whichis represented by Professor Elisha Gray".</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="immagini/lamar.gif" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=197 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>&nbsp;</FONT><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Fig. 3 - LuciusQuintus Cincinnatus Lamar,<BR>Secretary of the Interior 1885-1888, Justice of the Supreme Court1888-1893.</FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;On the opening of the trial, on November9, Counsel David Humphreys was the first to speak, saying that he hadproofs on Meucci's priority and that Meucci had a telephone since1849 &#91;98, 101&#93;. Humphreys also read a sensational affidavit&#91;71&#93;, sworn by Major Zenas Fisk Wilber <SUP>12</SUP>, formerChief Examiner of the Patent Office, only a month before thebeginning of the hearings. In his affidavit, Wilber denounced theirregularities committed by the Patent Office in favor of A.G. Bell,stating in particular:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>At the time, in   December, 1871, Antonio Meucci filed a caveat for "Sound   Telegraphs," I was an assistant under Prof. B. S. Hedrick,   principal examiner, and engaged under him in the examination of   cases relating to electrical inventions; hence the Meucci caveat   came under my charge at that time. At the time of the last renewal   thereof, in Dec., 1873, I was in charge of applications involving   or relating to electricity as principal examiner myself; and the   Meucci caveat was still in my charge.</I></FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>During 1876 the   electrical department was under my charge as principal examiner,   and I received as such examiner, from the proper division of the   office, the Bell application which became U. S. Patent No. 174465   of March 7th, 1876, and the caveat of Elisha Gray   &#91;&#133;&#93;. If this case had the usual course of suspension   of the application been followed Bell would never have received a   patent, and had Mr. Meucci's caveat been renewed in 1875, no   patent could have been issued to Bell.   &#91;&#133;&#93;</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>From my experience in   examining a vast number of electrical specifications, I have   become familiar with the terms and nomenclature used and have   found that the terms used by Reiss and Meucci are expressed or   meant by different later inventions under different names. I have   noticed &#91;for instance, that&#93; the "closed circuit" of Bell   is the "continuous metallic conductor" of Meucci   &#91;&#133;&#93;."</I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Note that in a later affidavit&#91;70&#93; drawn up only two days before the beginning of thehearings, Wilber described Reis's and Meucci's telephones as "theprototypes of all speaking telephones" (referring, probably, to theloose-contact transmitter of Reis and to the electromagnetictransmitter and receiver of Meucci).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">After Counsel Humphreys, Dr. Seth R. Beckwithspoke, read Meucci's affidavit &#91;16&#93; and showed the telephonemodels built by him, his <I>Memorandum Book</I> and the manyaffidavits signed in his favor &#91;102&#93;. Thereafter, GeorgeGantt, Casey Young and J.R. Beckwith illustrated the alreadymentioned Memorial on behalf of the citizens of Memphis. Although theposition of these latter speakers was essentially in support ofPhilipp Reis, they did not hesitate to express appreciation forMeucci. George Gantt, in particular, stated </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;103&#93;:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>If human testimony   is worth anything then Meucci anticipated Bell. I refer to the   large volume of proof offered in support of his claim   &#91;&#133;&#93;; but leave to others more familiar with it to   prove it, at such length as its importance deserves.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It was clear from the beginning of the hearingthat things were not going well for American Bell. In a preemptivemove, the day after the beginning of the aforementioned hearing, thatis the 10<SUP>th</SUP> November of 1885, in the Southern DistrictCourt of New York, American Bell brought suit against the GlobeTelephone Co., Antonio Meucci, Dr. Seth R. Beckwith and Amos Rogers(secretary of the Globe), reiterating its tactic of gaining localvictories in order to create a situation of <I>res adjudicata</I> inan eventual trial with the Government and to create an obstacle tothe Globe's efforts in Washington in favor of Meucci&#91;104&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, the New York District Court waspresided by the same judge, William J. Wallace, who had ruled fourtimes in favor of American Bell. This move allowed the lawyers ofAmerican Bell to announce triumphantly, during their concludingarguments of November 14, before the Hon. Lamar, that "a suit ispending under the Bell patents in New York against Meucci and theGlobe company" &#91;118&#93;. In the concluding session of the sameday, all parties summarized their arguments in support of theirpositions. Dr. Seth R. Beckwith in particular, gave a longdissertation on Meucci's priority &#91;102,105&#93;, blaming the moveof American Bell as follows:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>During this hearing   it </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;the American   Bell&#93; </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>has shown   disrespect to your Honors, for on the 3<SUP>d</SUP> day of your   sitting a suit has been entered against Antonio Meucci.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Once the hearings were completed, theassistants to Hon. Lamar each prepared a report. Mr. Montgomery senthis report on December 12 &#91;91&#93;. On December 22, followed thereports from Assistant Secretaries Muldrow &#91;106&#93; and Jenks&#91;86&#93;. They all agreed in recommending to proceed againstAmerican Bell. In his report, Assistant Secretary Jenks wrote, amongother things &#91;86&#93;:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>There   is also evidence that as early as 1849, Antonio Meucci began   experiments with electricity, with reference to the invention of a   speaking telephone </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;&#133;&#93;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>.   Up to 1871, </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;&#133;&#93;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>   although much of the time very poor, he constructed several   different instruments with which in his own house, he conversed   with his wife, and others </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;&#133;&#93;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>.   His testimony is corroborated by his wife, and by affidavits of a   very large number of witnesses. He claims that in 1872, he went to   Mr. Grant, Vice President of the New York District Telegraph   Company, explained his invention, and tried repeatedly to have it   tried on the wires of the Company. This, it is claimed, was used   by the telegraph company, and was the basis of the contract   between the Western Union Telegraph Company and the Bell Telephone   Company, dated November 10, 1879.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;It should be noted that in the longreport of the Hon. Jenks, only Philipp Reis and Antonio Meucci werementioned as the inventors of the telephone that precededBell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In his report, Assistant Secretary Muldrowcommented in details the affidavits in favor of Meucci, concluding&#91;106&#93;:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>So   many witnesses having sworn that the inventions of Meucci, Reis,   and others antedated those of Bell in the speaking telephone   </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;&#133;&#93;   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>I therefore believe   it to be the duty of the Government to judicially inquire whether   these facts do not warrant the institution of a suit to cancel the   patent of March 7,1876, which bears the seal of the Government,   and which confers upon him a monopoly of the use of one of the   forces of nature at the expense of whole communities.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;And so, once again, the names of Reis andMeucci came up, the same ones that would fill in the numerousarticles that appeared during those days in the major Americannewspapers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Encouraged by the unanimous opinions of hisassistants, Hon. Lucius Lamar, on January 14, 1886, wrote a letter toHon. John Goode (acting Attorney General), enclosing the threeaforementioned reports and the sixty documents exhibited during thehearings, recommending, in particular that </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;67&#93;:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>&#133; the   proceeding should be in the name of and wholly by the Government,   not on the relation or for the benefit of all or any of the   petitioners, but in the interest of the Government and the people,   and wholly at the expense and under the conduct and control of the   Government.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hon. Lamar's letter raised Meucci's and hissupporters' enthusiasm (not to mention Reis's supporters) to the sky;with the open support of the Government of the United States, thisenthusiasm became so extreme that it took a legal victory for grantedeven before the trial began <SUP>13</SUP>. Meucci himself, in anaffidavit signed on July 23, 1886 &#91;107&#93; statedthat</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>the Interior   Department of the United States has practically decided in his   favor, giving him priority of invention of telephony over all   others. (See decisions of Assts. Secretaries, Muldrow and   Jenks.).</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Soon after the conclusions of Hon. Lamar weresent to the Department of Justice, American Bell launched a harshattack against the Government at the House of Representatives,through the representatives of Massachusetts (who were close to it).These managed to have a resolution passed, on February 26, 1886, toestablish a federal investigation committee, made up of nine members,with the purpose "to investigate charges against certain publicofficers<SUP>14</SUP> relating to the Pan-Electric Telephone Companyand to suits by the United States to annul the Bell telephonepatents." &#91;91&#93;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ad-hoc committee gathered depositions,documents and sworn testimonies from March 12 to May 27, 1886. Theywere printed in a volume of almost 1300 pages, in possession of thiswriter. At the end of the investigation two reports were prepared:one from the majority (Democrat) and one from the minority(Republican). Both were presented to the House of Representatives onJune 30, 1886. The Majority report concluded that the Governmentofficials implicated had done nothing wrong while the Minority statedthe contrary, and thus things remained unchanged.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, also on the Globe-Meucci front, Hon.Lamar's letter produced some impressive effects. With surprisingswiftness, on February 27, 1886, (deed recorded on March1<SUP>st</SUP> ), Dr. S.R. Beckwith founded, with the approval of theGlobe Co. and Meucci, the "Meucci Telephone Company" in Elizabeth,NJ, with its headquarters in the Herald Building, 109 Broad Street&#91;65,108,109&#93;. It should be noted that none of the Globestockholders were part of the new company. S.B. Ryder was itsPresident and S.R. Beckwith its General Manager. As a matter of fact,Beckwith offered $25,000 to the Globe Co. in order to purchase itsrights on Antonio Meucci for the newly established company in NewJersey.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">A detailed account on this company is given inthe valuable manuscript &#91;65&#93; by Francesco Moncada, who didresearch in the USA in 1932. He tells us that Dr. S.R. Beckwith, onApril 26, 1886, issued a short circular where he stated(&#91;108&#93;, Ans. No. 139):</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099">&nbsp;<I>The company   uses the Meucci telephone that was patented in the Patent Office   in 1871, five years before the Bell patent was granted. The   American Bell Company has been ordered by the government to appear   forthwith in the United States Court on a charge that Bell   obtained his patent by fraud, collusion, and his untruthful oath   that he was the original inventor. The government demands an   "injunction to perpetually prohibit and enjoin the Bell Company   from again setting up any pretence of right or claim under and by   virtue of Bell's supposed Letters Patent." The Bell Company or its   agents will be liable for every telephone used, rented, or sold as   a patented article, as soon as the patents of Bell are cancelled   and made void by the government. Each and every subscriber using   our telephone will be protected in its use against any damages   annoyances or suits instituted by any person or   company.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;These words are a clear indication of theeuphoria that Hon. Lamar's conclusions produced. Works to build thetelephone exchange in Elizabeth, NJ and connect the subscribersproceeded quite rapidly. Thanks to the courtesy of AT&amp;T Archivesof Warren, NJ, we have been able to retrieve the first list ofsubscribers of the Meucci Telephone Company (Fig. 4), which lists atotal of 116 subscribers, 49 of whom already connected on May 21,1886, the others to be connected by August 1st &#91;110&#93;. Eventhe lawyer Charles Swan of American Bell had to admit that&#91;91&#93;:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>In April, 1886,   Beckwith had made such progress with his exchange in Elizabeth   that the Bell Company thought best to apply immediately for a   preliminary injunction.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Fig. 4 - </FONT><A HREF="immagini/meucci_telco.gif"><FONT FACE="Arial">SubscriberList of the Meucci Telephone Company of New Jersey, as of 1 August1886</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>(Courtesy of AT&amp;T Archives, Warren, NJ)</FONT></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The injunction was requested on April 20, 1886,in the Bell/Globe trial in New York, alleging ties between the twocompanies. Nevertheless, the following May 28, Judge Wallace refusedto grant the injunction against the Globe Co. since no significantties had emerged between the Globe Co. and the Meucci TelephoneCompany. For this reason, on June 8, 1886, American Bell sued theMeucci Telephone Company in New Jersey. The trial went on untilJanuary 9, 1892, when it was officially closed, many years after BellCompany had won the lawsuit against the Globe Co. (1887) and theMeucci Telephone Company had stopped all activities (November1888).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Going back to the events that followed thedecision of Hon. Lamar, the Globe Co., seeing the brilliant successof Beckwith's initiative in New Jersey and fearing to loose theopportunity offered by the prestige suddenly acquired by Meucci'sname, opened a second Meucci Telephone Company in Nashville,Tennessee, on April 15, 1886. The Company had also offices inPhiladelphia, where they planned to hold their meetings, given thatGoodwin and other members from the Syndicate ran their business there&#91;111&#93;. Thomas Bowen was appointed as General Manager of thenew Company. The stockholders were for the most part the same asGlobe's. Meucci Telephone Company of Tennessee did little if nothingat all (&#91;64&#93;, Ans. No. 160), essentially because they werewaiting "to bring the Meucci matter before the Patent Office"(&#91;112&#93;, Ans. No. 79).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Tennessee (the State where the US DistrictAttorney McCorry had repeatedly tried to bring American Bell totrial) was chosen by Globe officers as the seat of the new company onthe grounds that it would not have been easy for American Bell to getan injunction against it, nor to win a possible trial with the sameease as in the States up North. For the same reasons, on August 28,1886, the Globe Co. and the Philadelphia Syndicate relinquished allrights on Meucci's inventions to the Meucci Telephone Company ofTennessee &#91;50&#93;, as a safeguard of a (probable) legal defeatof the Globe Co. in New York.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The hesitancy and prudence of the Globe Co.,particularly of Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Humphreys, were in stark contrastwith the swiftness and boldness of Dr. S.R. Beckwith. Beckwith evenmade precise plans to expand the activity of Meucci Telephone Companyof New Jersey to Washington, DC, and Alexandria, VA, as shown by acontract signed with a W.H. McDonald of Washington, DC, on May 28,1886 &#91;113&#93;. The contract provided that the telephones,complete of accessories, were to be supplied by the factory inElizabeth, NJ.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">These opposite approaches caused some quarrelsbetween Beckwith and Humphreys which initially were just antagonisticbut eventually degenerated in a vulgar fight with reciprocalaccusations even before the court in New Jersey. Meucci found himselfcaught in between, but ultimately he was to side with the Globe Co.,which was the formal owner of his rights.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B><I>Governmentversus American Bell: the lawyers win.</I></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;On March 17, 1886, the Government issuedan order to sue American Bell, and the relative bill of complaint wasfiled at the District Court of South Ohio on March 23, 1886. TheSolicitor General, John Goode, assisted by a staff of lawyers, wasrepresenting the Government of the United States &#91;91&#93;. Thelawyers for American Bell raised an objection concerning the Courtjurisdiction and asked for a motion which was granted on December 7,1886, obtaining at the same time that the case be closed. Because ofthis, almost all 1886 was wasted.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The venue for the trial was then moved toBoston, Massachusetts, where American Bell had its headquarters. Thenew bill of complaint was filed on January 13, 1887. The prosecutingattorney was the Hon. George M. Stearns under the direction of theSolicitor General George A. Jenks. The lawyers for Bell, however,raised another objection, sustained by judges LeBaron Colt and ThomasL. Nelson on November 26, 1887 (another year wasted!). This time,however, the Government appealed to the Supreme Court of Washington,DC, which, on November 12, 1888, reversed the verdict of judges Coltand Nelson and forced them to reject American Bell's objection and toresume the trial (nevertheless, yet another year was lost). This lastsentence lifted Meucci's spirits and was considered by many as avictory for him, even if only interlocutory. Unfortunately, though,Meucci died on October 18, 1889, before he could find out the finaloutcome of the Government action.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">After many other legal squabbles, finally, onDecember 6, 1889, the depositions began. The Government counsel wereheaded by the intelligent and persevering jurist Charles S. Whitmanof Washington, DC. On January 30, 1893, when Bell's second patentexpired, and the depositions were still going on, Bell's lawyersmaintained that it did not make sense to continue a trial to cancelpatents that had already expired. However, the Hon. Whitman repliedthat in any case a sentence would have provided a reference point forissues of fundamental importance for the Country and continued to goahead with the Government action. Unfortunately, though, he died inSeptember 1896 and, with his death, the effort of the Governmentquickly lost its impetus. The then Attorney General, Hon. JudsonHarmon, made a recommendation to Congress that the case be closedwith a minimum cost possible since he had made an agreement with theother party (American Bell) that the latter would not have in any waytaken advantage of the Government inaction &#91;91&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the meantime, with the end of 1897,President Cleveland was concluding his second mandate and WilliamMcKinley, a Republican, was elected President. The new AttorneyGeneral, Joseph McKenna, on November 30, 1897, announced that for alleffects and purposes, the lawsuit between the Government and AmericanBell was to be considered closed. So, in the end, there were neitherwinner nor losers: the only ones who had gained from this long andcomplex trial were the lawyers from both sides who charged theirclients stratospheric fees.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B><I>Conclusions</I></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;We believe that we have amplydemonstrated in this article that the Government of the United Statesof America for many years extensively honored the name of AntonioMeucci as the inventor of the telephone, upholding that he, togetherwith the German Philipp Reis (for the loose-contact transmitter),preceded Alexander Graham Bell. We have also amply illustrated howlong and fiercely Meucci fought to defend his priority, until deathtook him, while the Globe Co. was still defending his memory byappealing to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC &#91;114&#93; andthe Government of the Unites States was aiming to the same goal withits trial against American Bell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Meucci's memory was honored by many and formany years after the end of both trials. Among the many, we mustremember Guglielmo Marconi who fought strenuously to have the meritsof his unlucky fellow-countryman recognized internationally&#91;115,116&#93;. Still in 1976, the Smithsonian Institution'spublication &#91;117&#93;, celebrating the Centennial of theinvention of the telephone, featured only eight portraits, chosenamong the many dozens of known inventors in the telegraph andtelephone fields: one of them was that of Antonio Meucci.

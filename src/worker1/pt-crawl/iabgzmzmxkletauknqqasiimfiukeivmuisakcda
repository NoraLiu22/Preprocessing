</span></p>

<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The concept of reality television wasn't really
a thing when Tomoaki Hamatsu, a Japanese comedian better known as Nasubi,
&quot;auditioned&quot; to take part in a popular TV show, and that makes &quot;Susunu!
Denpa Sh&#333;nen&quot; worthy of some note in the history of entertainment. <i>The
Contestant</i>, director Clair Titley's account of Nasubi's ordeal on the show,
makes a good case that reality TV probably should have died before it actually
started, because this recounting of what amounted to physical and psychological
torture in the name of mass entertainment makes for a notorious start to what
has basically become the norm of modern television.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Imagine if people back in the late 1990s knew
about Nasubi's experiences then as this documentary reveals. On TV and in the
studio audience of the show, people were treated to the supposedly wacky
exploits of a man, shut up in a small room and trying to survive with the only
the hope that some things might be delivered to him. The gimmick of the segment,
called &quot;A Life in Prizes,&quot; watched as Nasubi tried to win things from
magazine sweepstakes in order to live.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Yes, this included food, which technically was
initially given to him by the show's producers, if pieces of cracker throughout
the day can be considered any form of real nutrition. As soon as Nasubi won his
first food item, though, the crackers stopped, so the message was clear: He'd
have to earn his own meals from now on. Prisoners are treated better, but
apparently, struggling comedians who are willing to participate in such a show
are seen as less than that by TV producers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Nasubi recalls his story or as much as he can
remember of it, since he was stuck in one room for almost a year—before the
big &quot;twist&quot; the show had in store for him—and was clearly suffering
from malnutrition, depression, and other physical and mental ailments. Watching
clips from the show, which would edit down 24 hours' worth of footage over the
course of a week to six-minute segments, makes these signs apparent, but the
program was so popular that the audience either didn't notice or didn't care
what Nasubi was going through for them to laugh at him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">This was abject cruelty, beginning with jokes
about Nasubi's long face (his nickname is Japanese for &quot;eggplant&quot;) and
ending with a final televised appearance that looks as if the man is suffering
from literal, medical shock. It's as much on the audience as it is on the show's
producer Toshio Tsuchiya, whom the filmmakers also interview 25 years after the
experiment, joke, or torture—depending on one's perspective—started. If
one's expecting any sort of awareness or admission of wrongdoing or apology on
Tsuchiya's part, it comes only in vague terms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">In a split-screen moment of the two main
interview subjects, Nasubi explains that he continued this ordeal past his
breaking point in part because he saw the producer as a kind of god in his
cramped-up world. Now, he sees Tsuchiya as a devil. Sure enough, the producer,
seemingly unprompted, says he's not any kind of a god, but he definitely sees
himself as a devil. He's proud of the fact, because that way of thinking made
for popular television.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Tsuchiya has some clarifications or excuses.
For example, Nasubi was never locked in a room, contrary to press coverage at
the time and urban legends after the fact, but that doesn't alter Nasubi's
perspective of the stunt. He was told he had to stay in a room until he could
earn a million yen in those giveaway prizes, and if the show would blindfold him
and tell him to strip naked and deny him food even if he needed it, what else
would they be willing to do to keep the thing going?</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">He had no idea, because Nasubi never signed any
contract for his participation. If that seems wrong, it gets worse. When asked,
Tscuhiya made it clear that none of the recorded footage in the room would be
broadcast. Before the 11 months—and then some—were finished, the clips would
make Nasubi a national celebrity, a bestselling author (since his private
diaries in the room were published), and the subject of one of the earliest
examples of a 24-hour internet livestream. He didn't agree to any of that, and
if his mother's sole warning before heading from Fukushima to Tokyo to pursue an
entertainment career, it's almost a guarantee Nasubi definitely wouldn't have
agreed to appear naked on any of those platforms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The film is at its best simply showing us what
happened and allowing Nasubi to explain what he was thinking, how he was
feeling, and why he continued going along with the setup as the days, weeks, and
months progress. His words often sound like those one might hear from someone
who was a hostage, because he essentially was one—even if technically and
legally he presumably wasn't. When possible, the televised segments are
translated into English, but in either language, the way the show frames Nasubi
as the target of mockery, with a complete disinterest in him as a person, is
obvious.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Cambria" size="3">The Contestant</font></i><font face="Cambria" size="3">
is much weaker in actually confronting the ethical failings and eventual
consequences of Nasubi's experience, especially by the end, when it attempts to
put a positive spin on his celebrity. He may have learned some things and gained
a greater appreciation for other people, but that's not the main takeaway from
watching this story unfold in this way. There are many questions left unanswered
or, particularly when it comes to Tscuhiya, unasked, but as an account of the
inhumanity of the exploitation of a real person for questionable entertainment,
the film is harrowing.</font>

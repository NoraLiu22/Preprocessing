	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="1">1</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.1">1</A> It is said of Helvia, the mother of Cicero, that she was well born and lived an honourable life; but of his father nothing can be learned that does not go to an extreme. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.2">2</A> For some say that he was born and reared in a fuller's shop, while others trace the origin of his family to Tullus Attius,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="

onMouseOut="nd();">1</A> an illustrious king of the Volscians, who waged war upon the Romans with great ability. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.3">3</A> However, the first member of the family who was surnamed Cicero seems to have been worthy of note, and for that reason his posterity did not reject the surname, but were fond of it, although many made it a matter of raillery. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.4">4</A> For "<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">cicer</SPAN>" is the Latin name for <SPAN CLASS="source">chick-pea</SPAN>, and this ancestor of Cicero, as it would seem, had a faint dent in the end of his nose like the cleft of a chick-pea, from which he acquired his surname. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.5">5</A> Cicero himself, however, whose Life I now write, when he first entered public life and stood for office and his friends thought he ought to drop or change the name, is said to have replied with spirit that he would strive to make the name of Cicero more illustrious than such names as Scaurus or Catulus.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref:Scaurus_or_Catulus" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note:Scaurus_or_Catulus
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,MyNote,WIDTH,150)"
onMouseOut="nd();">a</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.6">6</A> Moreover, when he was quaestor in Sicily and was dedicating to the gods a piece of silver plate, he had his first two names inscribed thereon, the


<A ID="p85"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p85 </SPAN></A>Marcus and the Tullius, but instead of the third, by way of jest, he ordered the artificer to engrave a chick-pea in due sequence. This, then, is what is told about his name.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="2">2</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.1">1</A> It is said that Cicero was born, without travail or pain on the part of his mother, on the third day of the new Calends,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref2" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note2

It would seem also that a phantom appeared to his nurse and foretold that her charge would be a great blessing to all the Romans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.2">2</A> And although these presages were thought to be mere dreams and idle fancies, he soon showed them to be true prophecy; for when he was of an age for taking lessons, his natural talent shone out clear and he won name and fame among the boys, so that their fathers used to visit the schools in order to see Cicero with their own eyes and observe the quickness and intelligence in his studies for which he was extolled, though the ruder ones among them were angry at their sons when they saw them walking with Cicero placed in their midst as a mark of honour. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.3">3</A> And although he showed himself, as Plato&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref3" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note3
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">3</A> thought a nature should do which was fond of learning and fond of wisdom, capable of welcoming all knowledge and incapable of slighting any kind of literature or training, he lent himself with somewhat greater ardour to the art of poetry. And a little poem which he wrote when a boy is still extant, called Pontius Glaucus,


<A ID="p87"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p87 </SPAN></A>and composed in tetrameter verse. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.4">4</A> Moreover, as he grew older and applied himself with greater versatility to such accomplishments, he got the name of being not only the best orator, but also the best poet among the Romans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.5">5</A> His fame for oratory abides to this day, although there have been great innovations in style; but his poetry, since many gifted poets have followed him, has altogether fallen into neglect and disrepute.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="3">3</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.1">1</A> After he had finished the studies of boyhood, he attended the lectures of Philon the Academic, whom, above all the other disciples of Cleitomachus, the Romans admired for his eloquence and loved for his character. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.2">2</A> At the same time he consorted with Mucius Scaevola, a statesman and leader of the senate, and was helped by him to an acquaintance with the law; and for a little while he also did military service under Sulla in the war against the Marsians.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">4</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.3">3</A> Then, seeing that the commonwealth was hurrying into factions, and from factions into unlimited monarchy, he betook himself to a retired and contemplative life, associated with Greek scholars, and pursued his studies, until Sulla got the mastery and the state appeared to be somewhat settled.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note5
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.4">4</A> About this time Chrysogonus, a freedman of Sulla's, put up at public auction the estate of a man who, as it was said, had been put to death under proscription, and bought it in<!-- sic --> himself for two thousand drachmas.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">6</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.5">5</A> Then Roscius, the son and heir of the deceased, was indignant and set


<A ID="p89"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p89 </SPAN></A>forth clearly that the estate was worth two hundred and fifty talents, whereupon Sulla, enraged to have his actions called in question, indicted Roscius for the murder of his father, Chrysogonus having trumped up the evidence. No advocate would help Roscius, but all avoided him through their fear of Sulla's cruelty, and so at last, in his destitution, the young man had recourse to Cicero. Cicero's friends encouraged him to undertake the case, arguing that he would never again have a more brilliant or a more honourable opportunity to win fame. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.6">6</A> Accordingly, he undertook the defence of Roscius,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note7
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">7</A> won his cause, and men admired him for it; but fearing Sulla, he made a journey to Greece, after spreading a report that his health needed attention. For in fact he was spare and lean, and owing to a weakness of the stomach could only with difficulty take a little light food late in the day; his voice, however, was full and strong, but harsh and unmodulated, and since, owing to the vehemence and passion of his oratory, it was always forced into the higher tones, it made men apprehensive for his health.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="4">4</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.1">1</A> On coming to Athens he attended the lectures of Antiochus of Ascalon, and was charmed by his fluency and grace of diction, although he disapproved of his innovations in doctrine. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.2">2</A> For Antiochus had already fallen away from what was called the New Academy and abandoned the sect of Carneades, either moved thereto by the clear evidence of the <SPAN CLASS="whole">sense-perceptions</SPAN>,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note8
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">8</A> or, as some say, led by a feeling of ambitious opposition to


<A ID="p91"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p91 </SPAN></A>the disciples of Cleitomachus and Philon to change his views and cultivate in most cases the doctrine of the Stoics. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.3">3</A> But Cicero loved the systems which Antiochus discarded and devoted himself the rather<!-- sic --> to them, purposing, in case he was altogether driven out of a public career, to change his home to Athens, away from the forum and the business of the state, and spend his life in the quiet pursuit of philosophy.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.4">4</A> But word was now brought to him that Sulla was dead,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note9
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">9</A> and since his body, strengthened by exercise, was taking on a vigorous habit, while his voice, acquiring modulation, had grown pleasant to the ear, and had been moderated into keeping with the habit of his body; and since, moreover, his friends at Rome earnestly besought him by letter and Antiochus strongly urged him to apply himself to public affairs, he once more sought to prepare for service therein his instrument, as it were, to wit his rhetorical style, and to rouse to action his political powers, diligently cultivating himself in declamation and taking lessons of the popular rhetoricians. With this end in view he made a voyage to Asia and Rhodes. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.5">5</A> In Asia, he studied oratory with Xenocles of Adramyttium, Dionysius of Magnesia, and Menippus the Carian; in Rhodes, oratory with Apollonius the son of Milon, and philosophy with Poseidonius.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note10
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">10</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.6">6</A> Apollonius, we are told, not understanding the Roman language, requested Cicero to declaim in Greek, with which request Cicero readily complied, thinking that in this way his faults could


<A ID="p93"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p93 </SPAN></A>better be corrected. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.7">7</A> After he had declaimed, his other hearers were astounded and vied with one another in their praises, but Apollonius was not greatly moved while listening to him, and when he had ceased sat for a long time lost in thought; then, since Cicero was distressed at this, he said: "Thee, indeed, O Cicero, I admire and commend; but Greece I pity for her sad fortune, since I see that even the only glories which were left to us, culture and eloquence, are through thee to belong also to the Romans."

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="5">5</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.1">1</A> However, though Cicero, full of hope, was being borne on towards a political career, a certain oracle took the edge from his eager desire. When he inquired, namely, of the god at Delphi how he could become most illustrious, the Pythian priestess enjoined upon him to make his own nature, and not the opinion of the multitude, his guide in life. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.2">2</A> And so during the first part of his time at Rome&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref11" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note11
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">11</A> he conducted himself with caution, was reluctant to sue for office, and was therefore neglected, being called "Greek" and "Scholar," those names which the low and ignorant classes at Rome were wont to give so readily. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.3">3</A> But he was naturally ambitious and was urged on by his father and his friends, and so when he gave himself in earnest to the work of an advocate, he did not advance slowly to the primary, but his fame shot forth at once, and he far surpassed those who strove with him for distinction in the forum.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.4">4</A> But it is said that he too, no less than Demosthenes, was weak in his delivery, and therefore


<A ID="p95"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p95 </SPAN></A>sought with care to imitate now Roscius the comedian, and now Aesop the tragedian. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.5">5</A> This Aesop, they tell us, was once acting in a theatre the part of Atreus planning to take vengeance on Thyestes, when one of the assistants suddenly ran across the scene, and the actor, losing control of himself in the intensity of his passion, smote him with his sceptre and laid him dead. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.6">6</A> Now, Cicero's delivery contributed not a little to his persuasive power. Moreover, of those orators who were given to loud shouting he used to say jestingly that they were led by their weakness to resort to clamour as cripples were to mount upon a horse. And his readiness to indulge in such jests and pleasantry was thought indeed to be a pleasant characteristic of a pleader; but he carried it to excess and so annoyed many and got the reputation of being malicious.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="6">6</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.1">1</A> He was appointed quaestor&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref12" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note12
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">12</A> at a time when grain was scarce, and had the province of Sicily allotted to him, where he annoyed people at first by compelling them to send grain to Rome. But afterwards they found him careful, just, and mild, and honoured him beyond any governor they had ever had. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.2">2</A> Moreover, when large numbers of young men from Rome, of illustrious and noble families, were accused of lack of discipline and courage in the war and sent up for trial to the praetor of Sicily, Cicero pleaded their cause brilliantly and won the day. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.3">3</A> While he was journeying to Rome, then, highly elated over these successes, he had a laughable experience, as he tells us.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref13" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note13
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">13</A> In Campania, namely, he


<A ID="p97"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p97 </SPAN></A>fell in with an eminent man whom he deemed his friend, and asked him what the Romans were saying and thinking about his achievements, supposing that he had filled the whole city with the name and fame of them; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.4">4</A> but his friend said: "Where, pray, have you been, Cicero, all this while?" At that time, then, as he tells us, he was altogether disheartened, seeing that the story of his doings had sunk into the city as into a bottomless sea, without any visible effect upon his reputation; but afterwards he reasoned with himself and abated much of his ambition, convinced that the fame towards which he was emulously struggling was a thing that knew no bounds and had no tangible limit. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.5">5</A> However, his excessive delight in the praise of others and his too passionate desire for glory remained with him until the very end, and very often confounded his saner reasonings.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="7">7</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.1">1</A> And now that he was engaging in public life with greater ardour, he considered it a shameful thing that while craftsmen, using vessels and instruments that are lifeless, know the name and place and capacity of every one of them, the statesman, on the contrary, whose instruments for carrying out public measures are men, should be indifferent and careless about knowing his <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-citizens</SPAN>. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.2">2</A> Wherefore he not only accustomed himself to remember their names, but also learned to know the quarter of the city in which every notable person dwelt, where he owned a <SPAN CLASS="whole">country-place</SPAN>, what friends he had, and what neighbours; so that whatever road in Italy Cicero travelled, it was easy for him to name and point out the estates and villas of his friends.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.3">3</A> His property, though sufficient to meet his expenses, was nevertheless small, and therefore men


<A ID="p99"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p99 </SPAN></A>wondered that he would accept neither fees nor gift for his services as advocate, and above all when he undertook the prosecution of Verres. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.4">4</A> This man, who had been praetor of Sicily, and whom the Sicilians prosecuted for many villainous acts, Cicero convicted, not by speaking, but, in a way, by actually not speaking. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.5">5</A> For the praetors favoured Verres, and by many obstacles and delays had put off the case until the very last day,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref14" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note14
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">14</A> since it was clear that a day's time would not be enough for the speeches of the advocates and so the trial would not be finished. But Cicero rose and said there was no need of speeches,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref15" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#note15
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">15</A> and then brought up and examined his witnesses and bade the jurors cast their votes. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.6">6</A> Nevertheless, many witty sayings of his in connection with this trial are on record. For instance, "<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">verres</SPAN>" is the Roman word for a castrated <I>porker</I>; when, accordingly, a freedman named Caecilius, who was suspected of Jewish practices, wanted to thrust aside the Sicilian accusers and denounce Verres himself, Cicero said: "What has a Jew to do with a Verres?" <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.7">7</A> Moreover, Verres had a young son, who had the name of lending himself to base practices. Accordingly, when Cicero was reviled by Verres for effeminacy, "You ought," said he, "to revile your sons at home." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.8">8</A> And again, the orator Hortensius did not venture to plead the cause of Verres directly, but was persuaded to appear for him at the assessment of the fine, and received an ivory


<A ID="p101"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p101 </SPAN></A>sphinx as his reward; and when Cicero made some oblique reference to him and Hortensius declared that he had no skill in solving riddles, "And yet," said Cicero, "thou hast the Sphinx at thy house."

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.1">1</A> The schemes of Catiline were still to remain concealed from the multitude, but great preliminary struggles awaited the <SPAN CLASS="whole">consul</SPAN>&shy;ship of Cicero. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.2">2</A> For, in the first place, those who were prevented from holding office by the laws of Sulla, and they were neither few nor weak, sued for offices and tried to win the favour of the people, making many charges against the tyranny of Sulla which were just and true, indeed, but disturbing the government at an improper and unseasonable time; and, in the second place, the tribunes were introducing


<A ID="p111"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p111 </SPAN></A>laws to the same purpose, appointing a commission of ten men with unlimited powers, to whom was committed, as supreme masters of all Italy, of all Syria, and of all the territories which Pompey had lately added to the empire, the right to sell the public lands, to try whom they pleased, to send into exile, to settle cities, to take moneys from the public treasury, and to levy and maintain as many soldiers as they wanted. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.3">3</A> Therefore many of the prominent men also were in favour of the law, and foremost among them Antonius the colleague of Cicero, who expected to be one of the ten. It was thought also that he knew about the conspiracy of Catiline and was not averse to it, owing to the magnitude of his debts; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.4">4</A> and this was what gave most alarm to the nobles.

	<P CLASS="justify">
This alarm Cicero first sought to allay by getting the province of Macedonia voted to his colleague, while he himself declined the proffered province of Gaul; and by this favour he induced Antonius, like a hired actor, to play the second rôle to him in defence of their country. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.5">5</A> Then, as soon as Antonius had been caught and was tractable, Cicero opposed himself with more courage to the innovators. Accordingly, he denounced the proposed law in the senate at great length, and so terrified the very promoters of it that they had no reply to make to him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.6">6</A> And when they made a second attempt and after full preparation summoned the consuls to appear before the people, Cicero had not the slightest fear, but bidding the senate follow him and leading the way, he not only got the law rejected, but also induced the tribunes to desist

These were to be found in all parts of Italy, but the greatest numbers and the most warlike of them had been scattered among the cities of Etruria, and were again dreaming of robbing and plundering the wealth that lay ready to hand. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.3">3</A> These men, I say, with Manlius for a leader, one of the men who had served with distinction under Sulla, associated themselves with Catiline and came to Rome to take part in the consular elections.

And there were also human testimonies which were true, indeed, but not sufficient for the conviction of a man of reputation and great power like Catiline. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.5">5</A> For this reason Cicero postponed the day of the elections, and summoning Catiline to the senate, examined him concerning what was reported. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.6">6</A> But Catiline, thinking that there were many in the senate who were desirous of a revolution, and at


<A ID="p117"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p117 </SPAN></A>the same time making a display of himself to the conspirators, gave Cicero the answer of a madman: "What dreadful thing, pray," said he, "am I doing, if, when there are two bodies, one lean and wasted, but with a head,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref25" HREF="

His


<A ID="p133"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p133 </SPAN></A>designs were still unnoticed by the rest, but to Cicero he had given many grounds for suspicion, and yet no hold which could lead to his conviction, although many were heard to say that he had come near being caught by Cicero, but had eluded him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="20.7">7</A> Some, however, say that Cicero purposely <SPAN CLASS="whole">over&shy;looked</SPAN> and neglected the information against him through fear of his friends and his power, since it was clear to every one that the other conspirators would be included in Caesar's acquittal, rather than Caesar in their punishment.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="21.1">1</A> When, then, it was Caesar's turn to give his opinion, he rose and declared it to be against putting the conspirators to death, but in favor of confiscating their property and removing them to whatever cities of Italy Cicero might deem best, there to be put in fetters and closely guarded until Catiline should be defeated. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="21.2">2</A> The proposal of Caesar was <SPAN CLASS="whole">merci</SPAN>&shy;ful and its author a very able speaker, and Cicero added no little weight to it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="21.3">3</A> For when he rose to speak himself,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref39" HREF="

All his friends, too, thinking that Caesar's proposal was an advantageous one for Cicero, who would be less subject to censure if he did not put the conspirators to death, chose the second proposal rather, so that Silanus also changed his position and excused himself by saying that even his proposal had not meant death: for "extremest punishment," in the case of a Roman senator, meant the prison. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="21.4">4</A> Lutatius Catulus was the first to oppose the opinion which Caesar had given; then Cato followed him, helping


<A ID="p135"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p135 </SPAN></A>by the vehemence of his speech to fix suspicion upon Caesar, and filled the senate with angry resolution, so that a decree of death was passed upon the conspirators. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="21.5">5</A> As regarded the confiscation of their property, however, Caesar made opposition, deeming it wrong that the <SPAN CLASS="whole">merci</SPAN>&shy;ful part of his own proposal should be rejected and the one part that was most severe adopted. And when many of the senators insisted upon it, he invoked the aid of the tribunes, but they would not listen to his appeal; Cicero himself, however, yielded the point, and remitted that part of the vote which called for confiscation.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.1">1</A> Then he went with the senate to fetch the conspirators. These were not all in the same place, but different praetors had different ones under guard. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.2">2</A> And first he took Lentulus from the Palatine hill and led him along the Via Sacra and through the middle of the forum, the men of highest authority surrounding him as a body-guard, and the people shuddering at what was being done and passing along in silence, and especially the young men, as though they thought they were being initiated with fear and trembling into some ancient mysteries of an aristocratic regime. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.3">3</A> When Cicero had passed through the forum and reached the prison, he delivered Lentulus to the public executioner with the order to put him to death. Then Cethegus in his turn, and so each one of the others, he brought down to the prison and had him executed. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.4">4</A> And seeing that many members of the conspiracy were still assembled in the forum in ignorance of what had been done and waiting for night to come, with the idea that the men were still living and might be rescued, he cried to them with a loud voice and said: "They have

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.5">5</A> It was now evening, and Cicero went up through the forum to his house, the citizens no longer escorting him on his way with silent decorum, but receiving him with cries and clapping of hands as he passed along, calling him the saviour and founder of his country. And many lights illuminated the streets, since people placed lamps and torches at their doors. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.6">6</A> The women, too, displayed lights upon the house-tops in honour of the man, and that they might see him going up to his home in great state under escort of the noblest citizens.

Cicero accepted these terms and came forward to pronounce his oath; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="23.3">3</A> and when he had obtained silence, he pronounced, not the usual oath, but one of his own and a new one, swearing that in very truth he had saved his country and maintained her supremacy.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="24.1">1</A> So at this time Cicero had the greatest power in the state, but he made himself generally odious, not by any base action, but by continually praising and magnifying himself, which made him hateful to many. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="24.2">2</A> For there could be no session either of senate or assembly or court of justice in which one was not obliged to hear Catiline and Lentulus endlessly talked about. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="24.3">3</A> Nay, he even went so far as to fill his books and writings with these praises of himself; and he made his oratory, which was naturally very pleasant and had the greatest charm, irksome and tedious to his hearers, since this unpleasant practice clung to him like a fatality. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="24.4">4</A> But nevertheless, although he cherished so strong an ambition, he was free from envying others, since he was most ungrudging in his encomiums upon his predecessors and contemporaries, as may be gathered from his writings. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="24.5">5</A> There are also many sayings of his on record which prove this; for instance, he said of Aristotle that he was a river of <SPAN CLASS="whole">liquid</SPAN> gold,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref44" HREF="

And when he was asked which of the speeches of Demosthenes he thought the best, he replied, "the longest." And yet some of those who pretend to be imitators of Demosthenes dwell much upon an expression which Cicero used in a letter to one of his friends, to the effect that in some parts of


<A ID="p143"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p143 </SPAN></A>his speeches Demosthenes nods; but of the great and admirable praises which he often bestows upon him, and of the fact that those speeches of his own to which he devoted most labour, namely, the speeches against Antony, were entitled by him Philippics, they say nothing.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="24.7">7</A> Moreover, of the men of his own time who were famous for eloquence or learning, there is not one whom he did not make more famous by what he said or wrote in favour of him.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="25.1">1</A> These complaints were characteristic of


<A ID="p145"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p145 </SPAN></A>ambition, as well as the fact that he was often led on by the cleverness of his speech to disregard propriety. For instance, he once served as advocate for Munatius, who was no sooner acquitted than he prosecuted a friend of Cicero's, Sabinus, whereupon, it is said, Cicero was so transported with anger as to say: "Was it, pray, on your own merits, Munatius, that you were acquitted, and not because I spread much darkness about the court when before there was light?" <A CLASS="sec" NAME="25.2">2</A> And again, he gained great applause by an encomium on Marcus Crassus from the rostra, and then a few days afterwards as publicly reviled him, whereupon Crassus said: "What, did you not stand there yourself a day or two ago and praise me?" "Yea," said Cicero, "exercising my eloquence by way of practice on a bad subject." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="25.3">3</A> Again, Crassus once said that no Crassus had lived in Rome to be older than sixty years, and then tried to deny it, exclaiming, "What could have led me to say this?" "You knew," said Cicero, "that the Romans would be delighted to hear it, and by that means you tried to court their favour." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="25.4">4</A> And when Crassus expressed his satisfaction with the Stoics because they represented the good man as rich, "Consider," said Cicero, "whether your satisfaction is not rather due to their declaration that all things belong to the wise." Now, Crassus was accused of covetousness. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="25.5">5</A> Again, one of the sons of Crassus who was thought to resemble a certain Axius, and on this account had brought his mother's name into scandalous connection with that of Axius, once made a <SPAN CLASS="whole">success</SPAN>&shy;ful speech in the senate, and when Cicero was asked what he thought of him, he answered with the Greek words "<SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">Axios Krassou</SPAN>."<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref48" HREF="

Being thus compelled to speak, he said that he was looking for an attendant of Pompeia named Abra, whereupon the maid, perceiving that his voice was not that of a woman, raised a cry and called the women together. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="28.4">4</A> These shut the doors, searched carefully all about, and found Clodius, who had taken refuge in the chamber of the girl with whom he came into the house.

Moreover, many men of the better class bore witness against Clodius for perjury, recklessness, bribery of the multitude, and debauching of women. And Lucullus actually produced female slaves who testified that Clodius had commerce with his youngest sister when she was living with Lucullus as his wife. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.5">5</A> There was also a general belief that Clodius had intercourse with his other two sisters, of whom Tertia was the wife of Marcius Rex, and Clodia of Metellus Celer; the latter was called Quadrantia, because one of her lovers had put copper coins into a purse and sent them to her for silver, and the smallest copper coin was called "<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">quadrans</SPAN>."

For Caesar, when he saw him approaching far in advance of the rest, got down and embraced him and journeyed on for many furlongs conversing with him alone.

And a list was made out by them of men who must be put to death, more than two hundred in number. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.3">3</A> The proscription of Cicero, however, caused most strife in their debates, Antony consenting to no terms unless Cicero should be the first man to be put to death, Lepidus siding with Antony, and Caesar holding out against them both. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.4">4</A> They held secret meetings by themselves near the city of Bononia for three days, coming together in a place at some distance from the camps and surrounded by a river. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.5">5</A> It is said that for the first two days Caesar kept up his struggle to save Cicero, but yielded on the third and gave him up. The terms of their mutual concessions were as follows. Caesar was to abandon Cicero, Lepidus his brother Paulus, and Antony Lucius Caesar, who was his uncle on the mother's side. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.6">6</A> So far did anger and fury lead them to renounce their human sentiments, or rather, they showed that no wild beast is more savage than man when his passion is supplemented by power.

	<P CLASS="justify">
So then Quintus, not many days afterwards, was betrayed by his servants to those who were in search of him, and put to death, together with his son. But Cicero was brought to Astura, and finding a vessel there he embarked at once and coasted along as far as Circaeum, with the wind in his favour. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.5">5</A> From there his pilots wished to set sail at once, but Cicero, whether it was that he feared the sea, or had not yet altogether given up his trust in Caesar, went ashore and travelled along on foot a hundred furlongs in the direction of Rome. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.6">6</A> But again losing resolution and changing his mind, he went down to the sea at Astura. And there he spent the night in dreadful and desperate calculations; he actually made up his mind to enter Caesar's house by stealth, to slay himself upon the hearth, and so to fasten upon Caesar an


<A ID="p205"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p205 </SPAN></A>avenging daemon. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.7">7</A> But a fear of tortures drove him from this course also; then, revolving in his mind many confused and contradictory purposes, he put himself in the hands of his servants to be taken by sea to Caieta, where he had lands and an agreeable retreat in summer time, when the breath of the Etesian winds is most pleasant.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.8">8</A> The place has also a temple of Apollo, a little above the sea. From thence a flock of crows flew with loud clamour towards the vessel of Cicero as it was rowed towards land; and alighting on either end of the sail-yard, some cawed, and others pecked at the ends of the ropes, and everybody thought that the omen was bad. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.9">9</A> Nevertheless Cicero landed, and going to his villa lay down to rest. Then most of the crows perched themselves about the window, cawing tumultuously, but one of them flew down upon the couch where Cicero lay with muffled head, and with its beak, little by little, tried to remove the garment from his face. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.10">10</A> The servants, on seeing this, rebuked themselves for waiting to be spectators of their master's murder, while wild beasts came to his help and cared for him in his undeserved misfortune, but they themselves did nothing in his defence. So partly by entreaty, and partly by force, they took him and carried him in his litter towards the sea.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="48">48</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.1">1</A> But meantime his assassins came to the villa, Herennius a centurion, and Popillius a tribune,

Then, we are told, a youth who had been liberally educated by Cicero, and who was a freedman of Cicero's brother Quintus, Philologus by name, told the tribune that the litter was being carried through the wooded and shady walks towards the sea. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.3">3</A> The tribune, accordingly, taking a few helpers with him, ran round towards the exit, but Herennius hastened on the run through the walks, and Cicero, perceiving him, ordered the servants to set the litter down where they were. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.4">4</A> Then he himself, clasping his chin with his left hand, as was his wont, looked steadfastly at his slayers, his head all squalid and unkempt, and his face wasted with anxiety, so that most of those that stood by covered their faces while Herennius was slaying him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.5">5</A> For he stretched his neck forth from the litter and was slain, being then in his <SPAN CLASS="whole">sixty-fourth</SPAN> year.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref101" HREF="

<A ID="p209"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p209 </SPAN></A>rostra, a sight that made the Romans shudder; for they thought they saw there, not the face of Cicero, but an image of the soul of Antony. However, he showed at least one sentiment of fair dealing in the case when he handed over Philologus to Pomponia, the wife of Quintus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.3">3</A> And she, having got the man into her power, besides other dreadful punishments which she inflicted upon him, forced him to cut off his own flesh bit by bit and roast it, and then to eat it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.4">4</A> This, indeed, is what some of the historians say; but Cicero's own freedman, Tiro, makes no mention at all of the treachery of Philologus.

Thus the heavenly powers devolved upon the family of Cicero the final steps in the punishment of Antony.

 Elections are a fraught issue in much of Africa, as recent events
in Cote d'lvoire continue demonstrate. And this year alone, there
will be 17 presidential elections on the continent. So when a former
military leader organises an election and hands over power to the
winning civilian, that is a cause for celebration. Julius Maada Bio,
ex-military leader of Sierra Leone, handed over power to Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah in 1996, and then went off to the USA to study at the American
University. He has since returned home and is now aspiring to become the
opposition Sierra Leone People's Party's (SLPP) presidential
candidate for 2012. As part of our special series to welcome Sierra
Leone's 50th independence anniversary, which falls on 27 April, we
sent our correspondent, Lansana Gberie, to interview Julius Maada Bio.
Here is his report.

<BR><BR> THERE IS SOMETHING EXTRAORdinary about Julius Maada Bio. Alone of
all the core members of the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC),
the fresh-faced junta that ruled Sierra Leone from 1992 to 1996, Bio has
somewhat thrived, and has remained a national figure. His senior
colleague, Valentine Strasser, who headed the NPRC for a time and was
pushed aside by Bio, is a shambling, barely recognisable figure who
occasionally rants incoherently from his home outside Freetown.

<BR><BR> [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]

<BR><BR> [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]

<BR><BR> When he handed over power to President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah after
elections in 1996, Bio went to study in the USA, including at the
American University in Washington, where he earned a masters degree in
International Relations. He then returned to his country and started a
pharmaceutical business. When that went nowhere, Bio started another
business, exporting cocoa and coffee. He also re-entered politics,
joining and contesting (without success) the Sierra Leone Peoples Party
(SLPP) leadership position. Now, 46, Bio is campaigning once again to
become presidential flag-beater of the SLPP (the key opposition in
Sierra Leone); if he is successful in March, he will then face the
current president, Ernest Bai Koroma, at the polls in 2012. And he will
have a credible prospect of becoming, once again, President of Sierra
Leone.

<BR><div class="sw" id="sw8"></div><BR> Although this may be unfair, it might be said that Bio's
continuing gravitas--compared to his ex-junta colleagues--is due to his
descent from a ruling house: he has a distinctly regal demeanour and
perhaps a sense of entitlement. But Bio thinks otherwise. "I am one
of 35 children of Paramount Chief Charlie Vonie Bio. In fact, I was the
33rd child. That's not the greatest start in life," he said,
sardonically, when I met him at Mamba Point Hotel in Freetown.

<BR><BR> Somewhat to my surprise, Bio went on: "Most of my values, the
driving principles of my life, I acquired from my mother. She was a
calm, hardworking and calculated person, and she had a strong belief in
God." Bio is associated, among his friends and colleagues, with
three of those qualities. And a strong belief in God? "Yes, I am a
life-long Catholic. I went to a Roman Catholic primary school, and was
baptised early. My belief in God has remained unshaken through all these
years."

<BR><BR> The Bio family home was too crowded: 35 children and nine wives
(not to mention the many dependants of a ruling house). It was more like
a village than a home.

<BR><BR> For his studies, Bio had to move elsewhere. He went to stay with
his elder sister Agnes, who was a schoolteacher in Pujehun, many miles
away. Bio stayed with Agnes for five years, and remembers those years
with great fondness. From the way he speaks about it, Agnes was more of
a mother than an elder sister to him. Her influence over him was
overwhelming.

<BR><BR> Agnes sent Bio off to the Bo School, a famous boarding school some
miles away from Pujehun, where he spent seven years, and became Prefect for Discipline. He left in 1984 with 'A' levels and became a
teacher at a Methodist secondary school. He taught there for a year.

<BR><BR> The army

<BR><BR> Aged 21, Bio applied in 1985 to enter Fourah Bay College which,
founded in 1827, is the oldest Western-style university in West Africa,
and perhaps the region's most famous. Shortly after he did so,
however, someone mentioned to him that the army was recruiting new
cadets. "I was instantly thrilled. I had always wanted to do public
service: it was the way I was brought up. And the army offered the most
direct and unambiguous opportunity for that, so I applied
immediately," Bio recounted.

<BR><BR> This explanation appears correct--but only correct: the Sierra
Leone army did not have a high reputation for public service in 1985. It
had been politicised and degraded by the then president, Siaka Stevens,
and his All People's Congress (APC) one-party state. The army was
headed by a pliable Falstaffian character named Joseph Momoh, who
Stevens had made a member of parliament, and would soon become his
successor as president.

<BR><div class="sw" id="sw9"></div><BR> By the time Bio applied to become a cadet, it was already clear
that Momoh would replace Stevens as president. This would have provided
an attraction of sorts for an ambitious young man, in more ways than
one. Bio's colleague and exact contemporary, Valentine Strasser,
told Ann Bushby of the London Observer newspaper shortly after he became
leader of the NPRC that he had joined the army, at about the same time
as Bio, primarily to carry out a coup against the "rotten" APC
regime.

<BR><BR> Bio trained at Benguema, and graduated in October 1987 as a Second
Lieutenant. He was posted at the Lungi Airport, and then later in the
Kambia District as part of the Economic Emergency Unit created by the
already faltering Momoh regime to combat the deepening meltdown and
criminality of the state.

<BR><BR> The following year, 1988, Bio was re-posted at Lungi to be trained
by the UN in aviation security. After the training, somewhat curiously,
he was sent to Benguema as a platoon commander. In 1990, he was brought
back to Lungi. War had broken out in Liberia, triggering a massive
humanitarian crisis. Tens of thousands of Liberians were fleeing to
Sierra Leone every week, exposing the country's fragile security
and adding to the economic hardship.

<BR><BR> West African leaders, including Sierra Leone's, decided to set
up a peacekeeping force called ECOMOG to stem the tide of the Liberian
carnage. Sierra Leone contributed troops to the force: the first batch
that left included Strasser.

<BR><BR> Bio had in the meantime been deployed at Gendema on the Sierra
Leonean-Liberian border. "While at Gendema," Bio reveals,
"we had cogent intelligence relating to plans by some of Charles
Taylor's forces to invade Sierra Leone. We informed the army
intelligence officer about these plans, and despatched him straight to
Freetown to inform the government. Nothing came out of this."

<BR><BR> Shortly after, Bio was despatched to Liberia as part of the second
batch of Sierra Leone's contribution to ECOMOG. The soldiers sent
to Liberia were the best that the country had; as such, after their
departure the borders of Sierra Leone were left largely unprotected.
Momoh appeared too busy with other matters to envisage that there would
be repercussions for such negligence. Of course in Liberia, "there
was no peace to keep," Bio said. "I really wonder why, given
how tense the situation was at our own borders with Liberia, we were
sent to ECOMOG at all."

<BR><BR> In March 1991, Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
invaded Sierra Leone from Liberia, and overran the border regions in the
Eastern and Southern Provinces. It was not until September that year
that Bio and some of his colleagues were redeployed to Sierra Leone, in
the Kailahun District.

<BR><BR> "We were part of a new battalion called Gladio, under Major
Anderson," Bio said. "This battalion was hastily put together.
SAJ Musa was a part of it as well. There were 600 men in all, but most
of these were hasty new recruits, poorly trained, and not at all
prepared for combat. It was a mishmash really, not a team. Within five
minutes of our deployment in Kailahun, we were attacked by the rebels
with heavy bombardment. Two-thirds of our battalion simply ran away.
Yes, two-thirds. It was a disaster."

<BR><BR> The army was also poorly armed. The soldiers had guns from the
Second World War: often the guns couldn't fire. "Our weapons
were no match for those that the rebels had," Bio remembers.
"We felt that we were set up to be slaughtered. Our guns were not
firing at crucial moments. This was what created the myth of Rambo: the
invincible rebel whose body was impervious to bullets. Well, the bullets
weren't getting to him, you see."

<BR><BR> At the time, it riled. Bio said: "I spent four weeks with
Gladio, and then I was transferred to Segbwema, where Prince Benjamin
Hirsch was the commanding officer. Prince and I had trained together,
and we were friends. We formed a team. We were both very bitter
officers, very concerned about the rot that passed for our government in
Freetown. Then we started talking--there was really no plan at this
point--we started talking about changing the system."

<BR><BR> Many other young officers, it turned out, were doing the same
thing. Strasser, who had also fought in the Kailahun area and had
sustained a bullet wound in the leg (which partially disabled him), was
now at Benguema as paymaster. But he was in touch with Bio and Hirsch;
he visited them any time he could.

<BR><BR> "One evening, we were sitting at 'Bodehose' in
Segbwema--myself, Strasser, Prince and some others. We vented our
bitterness," Bio recounted. "We were not getting food, our
[weapons] weren't firing, we were neglected. And here was this
government which created the conditions for the war itself, seen as
benefitting from the war. We were being killed for their crimes and
profit. We knew Momoh and his APC weren't interested in the
multiparty business; they were trying to sit it out. We decided that
they had to go. We wanted a clean slate."

<BR><BR> That romantic language--a "clean slate", suggesting
optimism about the depth of possible change--is unusual with Bio, who
does not even use the word "comrade", preferring
"colleagues" or "friends".

<BR><BR> In the event, while Bio and Hirsch were preparing to launch an
attack against the RUF at Lalehun, Hirsch was murdered. "My hunch
tells me that he was killed by ULIMO [an anti-Taylor faction that was
being supported by the Sierra Leone government at the time].

<BR><BR> "Hirsch was very strict with soldiers who engaged in looting;
we were alter all operating in his home district. He had apprehended a
few ULIMO fighters that week while they were looting, and he was rather
harsh with them," Bio recalled. "He was killed close to a
ULIMO checkpoint. He had left us on the way to Lalehun to collect some
stuff in Segbwema. The RUF was not active in the area. We found his
bullet-riddled body, and ULIMO didn't say a word. They simply
vanished from the area."

<BR><BR> Bio first met John Benjamin, the elder brother of Hirsch, at the
"40 days" funeral ceremony of Hirsch at Segbwema.
"Benjamin was naturally very bitter about the death of his brother,
and about the terrible conditions we soldiers endured," Bio said.
"He intensely disliked the Momoh regime. So I thought he would be
safely brought into the plan. I told him we planned to unseat the
government, and of course he was enthusiastic."

<BR><BR> Strasser and Bio did all the planning. Bio said SAJ Musa, Tom Nyuma
and Lt. Sandy were later brought in. "We had planned to move
against Momoh on 30 April," Bio said. "But overzealous Nyuma
and SAJ Musa forced our hands [so we had] to act earlier, a day before.
They commandeered a vehicle belonging to Major S.B. Kami in Kenema on
the 28th, and drove it all the way to Freetown.

<BR><BR> "You can see from this that the state had collapsed. Two
junior officers commandeering a vehicle belonging to a senior officer,
who they simply pushed out, and [they] drive that vehicle past Bo right
down to Freetown! And there was nobody to stop them!"

<BR><BR> Bio and Strasser had already mobilised 40 hardened soldiers in
Freetown, who were ready to spring into action. Strasser was in
Freetown, while Bio was still in Segbwema planning to move to Freetown
the night of the 27th (Sierra Leone's independence anniversary
day).

<BR><BR> Nyuma and Musa crashed into Freetown on the 29th, and Strasser
quickly mobilised the 40 waiting men. The soldiers easily occupied State
House, and the slothful Momoh fled to Guinea. The NPRC was launched. Bio
was 28 at the time, and Strasser 25.

<BR><BR> And what about Major Yayah Kanu? I asked Bio. "He knew nothing
about the coup plot," Bio replied. "He was commanding officer
for Nyuma and Sandy. After Nyuma and the others occupied State House, he
approached them. Perhaps he was sent by the APC to talk his boys out of
it. But later, after Momoh fled, I think he wanted to commandeer the
coup by using Nyuma to take power for him.

<BR><BR> "Nyuma is a decisive man, but he can be easily swayed. And
Yayah Kanu nearly got him to do his bidding. But Musa and Strasser
quickly intervened. That was the start of Kanu's troubles. SAJ had
him immediately detained."

<BR><BR> NPRC and executions

<BR><BR> Surprisingly, giving the leading role he played in the coup, Bio
initially took the fairly minor position of secretary of state for the
south, and then, quickly, the post of secretary of information and
broadcasting, though he was a key member of the Supreme Council of
State, the NPRC governing body.

<BR><BR> Strasser became head of state and chairman of the NPRC, and SAJ
Musa the deputy. Nyuma was appointed secretary of state for the east;
and Benjamin, the only civilian member of the coup, was made chief
secretary of state, or prime minister.

<BR><BR> On 29 December 1992, the NPRC, barely seven months in power,
announced that it had foiled an attempted coup. Strasser announced that
"a group of officers and civilians had attacked the presidential
residence at Kabassa Lodge" in Freetown. The very next day, he
announced that the coup plotters, according to him numbering 26, had
been executed after a trial by a military court. Much of what preceded
this announcement became clearer only later.

<BR><BR> It emerged that Lt. SAJ Musa, Strasser's choleric deputy, had
coordinated the arrests and brutal murder of the alleged plotters who,
in fact, numbered 29, and they included: a palm wine tappet; a pregnant
woman of no known political affiliation; about half a dozen
newly-recruited police trainees; several people who had been in
detention at Pademba Road prison at the time of the alleged plot; and a
fortune teller or "herbalist" who had been allegedly consulted
by the alleged plotters.

<BR><BR> [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]

<BR><BR> [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]

<BR><BR> Even for a nation inured to brutality, the announcement was
shocking, and was made even more bewildering by the NPRC's press
statement that day. It baldly stated: "The special military
tribunal convened by His Excellency the Captain to immediately try the
suspects apprehended has met and they have proved beyond all reasonable
doubt that [the alleged plotters] did try to overthrow the government of
the NPRC and has found each of them guilty of treason and has sentenced
them to death by fifing squad. The confirming authority of the NPRC have
met and endorsed the sentence recommended and have ordered that the
executions take place immediately."

<BR><BR> It was a sordid moment in the life of the regime, and it certainly
helped change the trajectory of the NPRC from the course of brash reform
and national and international embrace, to condemnation and a lapse into
self-defensive neurosis.

<BR><BR> What was Bio's responsibility for this? He says he stands by
his testimony to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC); its
report in 2004/05 had this to say: "SAJ Musa had known some of
those implicated in the coup from their time together in the army; he
regarded them unambiguously as traitors who had betrayed him, personally
and politically.

<BR><BR> "According to Maada Bio, who had known in advance of SAJ
Musa's volatile temperament and the likelihood that he would
attempt to carry out some kind of summary justice, some of the
implicated men were taken to Musa's own residence and subjected to
torture by Musa himself: 'When I went there at night, he had
actually tortured them very seriously--their ears were cut off and they
were practically dead".

<BR><BR> "SAJ realised that by daybreak they had been really badly
tortured in his compound: 'It was better to do away with them, than
to keep them on his hands in this terrible state'--he was then
alleged to have organised the summary executions.

<BR><BR> "Maada Bio lamented their inability to put the coup plotters
through proper judicial process, blaming it on SAJ Musa's ambitions
for power: 'To a very large extent, SAJ was somebody who liked
power and could do anything to retain it. ... that was the darkest side
of our whole period in power'," Bio told the TRC. "SAJ
Musa's quest for power was an obsession for the man; and he had a
wife who inculcated that into him; so it was a terrible combination.

<BR><BR> "SAJ was also responsible for the killings of looters. At this
point in time, he was actually the key actor; Strasser was much more
laid back, and to an extent he let SAJ get on with his business."

<BR><BR> This account has been corroborated by others who were in a position
to know at the time, and who are no friends of Bio's. The TRC,
however, concluded with a non-sequitur: "Maada Bio's account
is an attempt to shift responsibility for a gross failure of leadership
by their government to the shoulders of one person. The execution of the
alleged coup plotters did not advance SAJ Musa's lust for power in
any way." It somewhat betrays an ignorance of how the early NPRC, a
ramshackle junta, operated. Strasser, weak, often dissipated, was hardly
in control, and SAJ Musa was virtually running riot. But again, why did
some members of the NPRC, including Strasser himself, defend and
continue to defend the killings? Clearly there was no trial, though the
NPRC's spokesman at the time, Karefa Kargbo, told the BBC shortly
after the killings that he and his colleagues had concrete evidence of
the coup plot, including the most telling: "a written
agreement" between the coup plotters and "an illiterate
herbalist".

<BR><BR> Talking about the 30 December killings was the most uncomfortable
point of my conversation with Bio: he still clearly thinks that it was
the most disastrous thing that happened under the NPRC, and Bio's
bitterness at SAJ Musa's murderous behaviour that day was
undisguised.

<BR><BR> Bio as head of state

<BR><BR> The revulsion that the killings caused for the NPRC became very
infectious. Things began to fall apart for the junta. In a move that was
orchestrated by Bio, SAJ Musa was chased out of the country, and Bio,
tapidly promoted to brigadier, became Strasser's deputy and chief
secretary of state. In that position, Bio became the most powerful man
in the country. Strasser, now remote and unengaged, was, rather,
something of a figurehead. He wasn't even attending cabinet
meetings, and he became too beholden to certain civilian members of the
NPRC who had formed a political patty, the National Unity Party (NUP),
to contest elections scheduled for 1996. As a result, Strasser was
dispatched out of the country, in a helicopter, to Guinea in 1995, and
Bio took over as head of state. The palace coup was an anti-climax of
sorts. I asked Bio what his proudest achievements were. "We had
three goals as a government," he said." We wanted to end the
war, revive the economy, and then hand over to a democratically elected
government. You can judge us on what we did. The war derailed most of
out plans."

<BR><BR> [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]

<BR><BR> But even so, under the NPRC, he said, electricity was largely
restored, there were no longer long queues for petrol and rice (as was
common under Momoh), roads were being constructed, substantive peace
talks were begun with the RUF, and "most important, we handed over
the government to a democratically-elected president. We reintroduced
credible plural politics, and we left peacefully, setting a standard
which would be hard to mess with."

<BR><BR> There had been some speculations that Bio was not serious about
either the peace talks or the democratic process. I followed both very
closely at the time, attending the peace talks in Cote d'Ivoite as
well as coveting the democratic process daily.

<BR><BR> On taking over from Strasser, Bio made a terse appeal, broadcast
live on national TV and radio: "To you, Corporal Foday Sankoh, the
message from my government is that we are prepared to meet with you
anywhere, any time and without preconditions."

<BR><BR> The RUF, it seemed, had been waiting for such a gesture. Sankoh
quickly sent word through the International Committee of the Red Cross that he was willing to talk to Bio, who responded publicly that he too
was ready to talk. He announced that both Ivorian president Henri Konan
Bedie and Burkina Faso's Blaise Compaore were actively attempting
"to get the NPRC and the RUF to the table".

<BR><BR> A few days later, over an ICRC radio hook-up at the British High
Commission (which I witnessed), Sankoh told Bio that he had to postpone
the scheduled elections before any progress towards negotiations could
be made. Bio's response was that such a decision was ultimately up
to Sierra Leoneans and suggested that the two meet in Cote d'Ivoire
or Burkina Faso.

<BR><BR> Sankoh rejected the two venues at first in favour of talks within
Sierra Leone, but his resistance quickly evaporated and a meeting was
set up in Abidjan for the end of February 1996. I arrived in Abidjan a
week or so before the peace delegates did. With my friend the late
Ambrose Ganda, I visited the place where some of the RUF representatives
in the country were living, a gated house in one of the suburbs of
Abidjan.

<BR><BR> The peace talks, at least as far as Bio's involvement went,
did not at all appear rigged. Bio certainly kept w the timetable to hand
over power. That power went to the SLPP and its new leader, Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah. Some of Bio's colleagues were not at all happy: they had
set up a new party, the National Unity Patty (NUP), and they had
expected Bio to manipulate the outcome of the polls to give power to
them.

<BR><BR> The future

<BR><BR> Bio left the country after handing over power, and took two degrees
in the USA. Strasser, on the other hand, flunked his studies at Warwick
University in the UK, and returned to Sierra Leone a diminished man. I
asked Bio which candidate he takes most seriously as a rival for the
SLPP flag-bearer position. He didn't hesitate. "Three people
really, and for various reasons," he said. "The first is Dr
Kadie Sesay. She has excited potentially the same people who would
support me, and many of them are coming to me to suggest that she and I
pool together. I'm very open to that.

<BR><BR> "The other is Andrew Kellie, for similar reasons. And then
there is Usman Boie Kamara, for the simple reason that he has a lot of
money, and this current phase is about winning [over] delegates. You see
what I mean." Knowing what odds he has had to overcome in his life,
underestimating Bio may not be well advised.

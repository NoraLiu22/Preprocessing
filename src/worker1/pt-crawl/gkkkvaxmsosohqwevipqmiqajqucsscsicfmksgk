<div class="note" topic="historicalAndRevision"><span class="heading centered">1988 Act</span>
<p>Subsection (k) is based on <a href="/rio/citation/Pub._L._100-202">Pub. L. 100–202, § 101(b) [title VIII, § 8042]</a>, <a href="/rio/citation/101_Stat._1329-69">101 Stat. 1329–69</a>.</p>
<p>Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (<a href="/rio/citation/Pub._L._100-202">Public Law 100–202</a>) established a requirement for the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/dod_osd_secretary_of_defense" occur="17" src="named_federal_agencies">Secretary of Defense</span> to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing<a aria-label="Definitions -  United States " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> United States </a>forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as <a href="/uscode/text/10/113#k">section 113(k) of title 10</a>, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.</p>
<p>The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/cong_senate" occur="4" src="named_federal_agencies">Senate</span> Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100–235) states that this new annual report “should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years” (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.</p>
<p>In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term “<a aria-label="Definitions - United States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">United States</a> troops” in the source law to “<a aria-label="Definitions - United States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">United States</a> forces” for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed “overseas” to “outside the <a aria-label="Definitions - United States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">United States</a>” and defined “<a aria-label="Definitions - United States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">United States</a>” for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the <a aria-label="Definitions - United States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">United States</a>. The committee was concerned that the term “overseas” read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/cong_senate" occur="5" src="named_federal_agencies">Senate</span> report referred to above states “For the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the<a aria-label="Definitions -  United States " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> United States </a>and its territories.”. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures “overseas” and costs incurred “overseas” are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the<a aria-label="Definitions -  United States " class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=10-USC-2032517217-397636830&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> United States </a>and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.</p>

<p>As we observe the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, we reflect with solemn reverence upon the valor of a generation that served with honor. We pay tribute to the more than 3 million servicemen and women who left their families to serve bravely, a world away from everything they knew and everyone they loved. From Ia Drang to Khe Sanh, from Hue to Saigon and countless villages in between, they pushed through jungles and rice paddies, heat and monsoon, fighting heroically to protect the ideals we hold dear as Americans. Through more than a decade of combat, over air, land, and sea, these proud Americans upheld the highest traditions of our Armed Forces.</p>
<p>As a grateful Nation, we honor more than 58,000 patriots—their names etched in black granite—who sacrificed all they had and all they would ever know. We draw inspiration from the heroes who suffered unspeakably as prisoners of war, yet who returned home with their heads held high. We pledge to keep faith with those who were wounded and still carry the scars of war, seen and unseen. With more than 1,600 of our service members still among the missing, we pledge as a Nation to do everything in our power to bring these patriots home. In the reflection of The Wall, we see the military family members and veterans who carry a pain that may never fade. May they find peace in knowing their loved ones endure, not only in medals and memories, but in the hearts of all Americans, who are forever grateful for their service, valor, and sacrifice.</p>
<p>In recognition of a chapter in our Nation’s history that must never be forgotten, let us renew our sacred commitment to those who answered our country’s call in Vietnam and those who awaited their safe return. Beginning on Memorial Day 2012, the Federal Government will partner with local governments, private organizations, and communities across America to participate in the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War—a 13-year program to honor and give thanks to a generation of proud Americans who saw our country through one of the most challenging missions we have ever faced. While no words will ever be fully worthy of their service, nor any honor truly befitting their sacrifice, let us remember that it is never too late to pay tribute to the men and women who answered the call of duty with courage and valor. Let us renew our commitment to the fullest possible accounting for those who have not returned. Throughout this Commemoration, let us strive to live up to their example by showing our Vietnam veterans, their families, and all who have served the fullest respect and support of a grateful Nation.</p>

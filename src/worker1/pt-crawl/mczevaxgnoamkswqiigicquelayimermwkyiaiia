              <p>Today, <a href="http://www.thebulletin.org"><i>The Bulletin of 

                the Atomic Scientists</i></a> published an article, &quot;Nixon's 

                Nuclear Ploy,'' by National Security Archive senior analyst William 

                Burr and Miami University historian Jeffrey Kimball,<a href="#1">(1)</a> 

                that discloses for the first time one of the Nixon administration's 

                most secret military operations. During October 1969, President 

                Richard Nixon ordered the Pentagon to undertake secretly a series 

                of military measures designed to put U.S. nuclear forces on a 

                higher state of readiness. For nearly three weeks, U.S. nuclear 

                bombers were on higher alert, while U.S. air defense forces, tactical 

                aircraft, and nuclear missile submarines in the Pacific took measures 

                to raise their combat readiness. Moreover, U.S. destroyers, cruisers, 

                and aircraft carriers were engaged in a variety of maneuvers in 

                the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Aden, and the Sea 

                of Japan. These measures were officially known as the &quot;Joint 

                Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Readiness Test.&quot; Although they were 

                executed secretly so that the public in the United States and 

                allies would not notice them, they were supposed to be detectable, 

                but not alarming, to the leadership of the Soviet Union and its 

                intelligence services. </p>

              <p>The U.S. commanders-in-chief (CINCs)--of the Strike, Strategic 

                Air, and Continental Air Defense Commands, and of U.S. forces 

                in Alaska, the Atlantic, in Europe, in the Pacific, and elsewhere--who 

                presided over the alert and readiness measures did not know why 

                Nixon had ordered them. Indeed, they could only guess about the 

                purpose because Pentagon officials could not or would not give 

                them any information. Indeed, the Pentagon demanded strict secrecy 

                for the readiness test and enjoined public affairs officials throughout 

                the military services to avoid any comment in the event of leaks. 

                They could only say, &quot;we do not comment on readiness tests.&quot; 

                It was not until the early 1980s that any information on these 

                events reached the mass media, when Seymour Hersh published <i>The 

                Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House</i> (Summit 

                Books, 1983).</p>

              <p>Even after Hersh's book, the full scope of the readiness and 

                the reasons behind it remained obscure and classified. Newly declassified 

                documents confirm what Strategic Air Command officers suspected, 

                that Vietnam War concerns were behind Nixon's decision. As White 

                House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman recorded in his diary on 17 

                October 1969, as the readiness test was underway, Kissinger had 

                told him that &quot;he has all sorts of signal-type activity going 

                around the world to try to jar Soviets + NVN [North Vietnam].&quot; 

                [See <a href="nnp08.pdf">Document 8</a>] Irritated by Soviet military 

                assistance to North Vietnam, Nixon was testing his &quot;madman 

                theory&quot; by ratcheting up the readiness level of nuclear forces. 

                If his military moves made Moscow concerned enough, Nixon apparently 

                believed, the Soviets might use their leverage to induce Hanoi 

                to be more cooperative in the Paris peace talks.<br>

              </p>

              <p> This compilation suggests the variety of material used to prepare 

                these articles. Years before either of the authors understood 

                the purpose of the JCS Readiness Test, the Air Force release was 

                declassified documents that suggested that a significant military 

                operation had taken place in October 1969. (For example, see <a href="nnp11.pdf">Document 

                11</a>). But it was difficult to describe the full scope of the 

                readiness test without access to a file --entitled &quot;381 World-Wide 

                Increased Readiness Posture&quot;<a href="#2">(2)</a> -- in the 

                records of JCS Chairman Earle Wheeler held at the National Archives 

                in the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (RG 218). The Archive 

                filed a Freedom of Information Act request for this file in 1994, 

                but it was not declassified until August 2002, eight years later.<a href="#3">(3)</a> 

                With the availability of this file and documents from the Nixon 

                papers at the National Archives, it finally became possible to 

                interpret the White House decisions that led to the readiness 

                test and the Pentagon's efforts to carry out presidential orders.</p>

              <p>&quot;Nixon's Nuclear Ploy&quot; elucidates the intersection 

                between Vietnam diplomacy, the &quot;madman theory,&quot; and 

                nuclear operations during October 1969. The article in The Bulletin 

                of the Atomic Scientists draws upon a longer, fully-sourced and 

                footnoted essay, &quot;Nixon's Secret Nuclear Alert: Vietnam War 

                Diplomacy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Readiness Test, October 

                1969,&quot; that will appear in the January 2003 issue of <i><a href="http://www.frankcass.com/jnls/index.htm">Cold

                De Gaulle 2/28-3/2/69</font><br>

              </p>

              <blockquote> 

                <p>Richard Nixon admired French president Charles de Gaulle and 

                  made a point of meeting with him privately, with only translators 

                  present, when he made his first presidential visit to Europe 

                  in late February-early March 1969. During three lengthy conversations, 

                  Nixon discussed the Vietnam negotiations and made it clear that 

                  he expected Soviet help on Vietnam if there was to be any progress 

                  in a detente with Moscow. Rightly or wrongly, Nixon believed 

                  that Moscow was in a position to help because, he told the General, 

                  the Soviets had &quot;great influence on the North Vietnamese&quot; 

                  and supplied them with &quot;85 percent of their weapons.&quot; 

                  Serving as translator and notetaker was the linguistically skilled 

                  General Vernon Walters, the U.S. Defense Attach&eacute; in Paris, 

                  who would later help arrange Kissinger's secret meetings with 

                  Chinese and North Vietnamese diplomats.<br>

              <blockquote> 

                <p>During the first weeks of the new Republican administration, 

                  Nixon, national security assistant Kissinger, JCS chairman Wheeler, 

                  and defense secretary Melvin Laird discussed possible military 

                  actions to make gains in the Vietnam negotiations. Laird's memorandum 

                  to Kissinger notes that in late January, they had discussed 

                  &quot;potential military actions which might jar the NorthVietnamese 

                  into being more forthcoming at the Paris talks.&quot; Laird 

                  sent Kissinger a Joint Staff paper that reviewed possible options, 

                  including &quot;technical escalation,&quot; a plan for the feigned 

                  nuclear escalation against North Vietnam. In the reply to Laird, 

                  Kissinger asked for actions with a &quot;lower profile&quot; 

                  and less risk on the grounds that &quot;actual or feigned military 

                  action&quot; might produce &quot;international and domestic 

                  turbulence.&quot;<br>

              <blockquote> 

                <p>During the summer and early fall of 1969, Nixon and Kissinger 

                  tried to signal North Vietnam that if they did not cooperate 

                  at Paris, the United States would punish them with massive bombing 

                  raids. After a trip to Asia in late July and early August 1969, 

                  Nixon stopped in Romania, partly to &quot;needle&quot; the Soviets 

                  by showing them that he would deal with East European countries 

                  whether they liked it or not (and they did not).<a href="#4">(4)</a> 

                  Nixon also used the meetings to make carefully modulated threats 

                  to North Vietnam. During discussions with President Ceaucescu, 

                  Nixon said that &quot;I don't make idle threats&quot; and that 

                  the Vietnamese were &quot;making a grave mistake if they think 

                  they can wait us out.&quot; Recognizing that Bucharest had its 

                  own channels to Hanoi, undoubtedly Nixon expected Ceaucescu 

                  to pass the message on to North Vietnam.</p>

              <blockquote> 

                <p>Beginning in early 1969, Nixon and Kissinger established a 

                  confidential &quot;back channel&quot; to Moscow through ambassador 

                  Anatoly Dobrynin. During their many conversations, Kissinger 

                  would push for more assistance from Moscow on Vietnam, while 

                  Dobrynin would consistently object to Kissinger's efforts to 

                  link Vietnam with progress in other areas such as arms control 

                  and the Middle East. During this meeting in late September, 

                  Kissinger took a prearranged phone call from Nixon, who wanted 

                  Dobrynin to know that the &quot;train had just left the station 

                  and was heading down the tracks.&quot; In other words, without 

                  Soviet cooperation on Vietnam, a dangerously uncontrollable 

                  situation could arise.</p>

                <p>After Nixon ordered the Pentagon to take military readiness 

                  measures, Laird's military assistant, General Robert Pursley 

                  and the Joint Staff, developed specific plans that met White 

                  House criteria for actions that the Soviets would notice without 

                  alarming them. By 10 October 1969, a few days after Nixon's 

                  decision, the Pentagon had an action plan for implementation 

                  by the CINCs. To notify them about the ongoing planning, Wheeler 

                  informed the CINCs about a decision by &quot;higher authority&quot; 

                  to &quot;test our military readiness.... to respond to possible 

                  confrontation by the Soviet Union.&quot; No one had a confrontation 

                  in mind, and references to &quot;confrontation&quot; were quickly 

                  dropped but the cable spelled out the main lines of action on 

                  which the CINCs could receive instructions, such as stand-downs, 

                  alert measures, and radio silence. Significantly, Wheeler asked 

                  the CINCs to suggest further actions that were compatible with 

                  the goals of the operation.</p>

                <p>Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, Admiral John McCain (father of 

                  the Arizona senator) responded to Chairman Wheeler's message 

                  with a number of suggested actions for testing U.S. military 

                  readiness. The Pacific Command and the Department of Energy 

                  excised nuclear-related suggestions (the deletions are under 

                  appeal), but various suggestions survived the review process, 

                  e.g., measures to increase the readiness posture of Pacific 

                  fleet units, intensify intelligence activities, prosecute submarine 

                  contacts, and increase the readiness of air defense units. McCain 

                  discussed the possibility of intensifying PARPRO (peacetime 

                  application of reconnaissance programs) activities against the 

                  Soviets, he advised against it partly because of the &quot;increased 

                  risk to PARPRO aircraft.&quot; Pentagon planners had also discussed 

                  the possibility of increasing reconnaissance flights on the 

                  Soviet periphery but ruled against that option because of the 

                  risks of incidents.</p>

                  of conventionally armed tactical and air defense aicraft&quot; 

                  and increasing surveillance of Soviet ships en route to North

              <blockquote> 

                <p>Throughout the course of the readiness test, the Pentagon high 

                  command and the White House were interested in whether Soviet 

                  intelligence had detected any of the military measures. Unless 

                  Moscow noticed unusual patterns in U.S. military activity around 

                  the world, the readiness test would not make the Soviets think 

                  twice, which is what Nixon wanted them to do. During the readiness 

                  test, CINCSTRIKE (Commander-in-Chief, Strike Command)--an ancestor 

                  of today's Central Command--had sent MIDEASTFOR (Middle East 

                  Force) ships into the Gulf of Aden (part of the MEAFSA, or Middle 

                  East/Southern Asia and Africa South of the Sahara, region). 

                  As indicated in Wheeler's report the Soviet navy has noticed 

                  the movement of U.S. ships in the Gulf of Aden. In light of 

                  the Soviet reaction, and presumably to ensure that the Soviets 

                  kept on noticing, the Joint Chiefs recommended continuing the 

                  naval exercise.</p>

                <p>CINCSAC, General Bruce Holloway, also came up with suggestions 

                  to increase the readiness level of U.S. military forces in ways 

                  that presumably would be visible to Soviet observers. Typifying 

                  the technical and organizational complexity of military action, 

                  this message to SAC commanders in the field ordered them to 

                  prepare selected aircraft for &quot;maintenance generation&quot; 

                  and airborne alert. The former meant that aircraft would be 

                  on the &quot;highest state of maintenance readiness&quot;: while 

                  not in &quot;cocked&quot; ground alert posture with crews on 

                  board, the bombers would have nuclear weapons on board and would 

                  be otherwise ready to fly. For the airborne alert mission, codenamed 

                  &quot;Giant Lance,&quot; aircraft from the 92nd strategic aerospace 

                  wing would fly nuclear-armed airborne alerts in the &quot;Eilson 

                  East SEAGA orbit&quot; with &quot;implementation hour&quot; 

                  beginning late in the day on 26 October. In other words, they 

                  would be flying in an orbit over Eastern Alaska, not far from 

                  Eilson air base. The Eilson East orbit was one of a number of 

                  &quot;orbits&quot; (Northern Pacific, Western Alaska, Eastern 

                  Atlantic, etc.) in which alerted bomber and tanker aircraft 

                  could fly in the SEAGA--Selective Employment of Air and Ground 

                  Alert--program. SAC had established SEAGA in the late 1960s 

                  to give policymakers various nuclear alert options during a 

                  politico-military crisis.</p>

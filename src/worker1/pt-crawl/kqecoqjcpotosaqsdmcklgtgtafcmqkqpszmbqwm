<h4 id="b">What's New On Correction To Data Products</h4>

<ul>
<li>07/10/2007: Version 2 of ISCCP D1 and D2 for the period 200410-200412 has been generated. The difference between version 1 and 2 of both sets should be restricted over the sea-ice pixels: Version 1 used a DX that did not have sea-ice flag set correctly (see entry below), and therefore the cloud detection over those pixels is biased. Version 2 uses the corrected DX that has sea-ice flag present.
<li>07/05/2007: New versions of ISCCP DX for the period 200410-200412, NOA-17 v1, and NOA-16 v2, have been released. The older versions had sea-ice flag filled with 0 instead of 0,1,2 and 3 for water pixels.  The new version corrects this problem.
<li>03/02/2007: ISCCP B3 MTS-1 satellite data for 200511-200606, version 1 was replaced: The on-planet DAY time flag (PLANFL in b3read) was set to 1 instead of 0.
<li>06/26/2006: A tape writing error corrupted some of the Nov. 1997 NOAA-14 DX data being archived to tape. 
The files do not contain viable data, and would not be capable of being read by DXREAD software.  This affected 
all of the N and S sector files (north and south polar areas) and some of the F sector files (a total of 542 of 
1386 files for this month). This did not affect the creation and archiving of the D1 and D2 datasets.</li>
<li>06/26/2006: An error occurred in creating the BT tables for the additional channels of data. This affects data for MET-7 only,
for the period 199806-200110. Since these channels are not used in the ISCCP algorithm, this did not affect the D1 or D2 datasets.
Thanks to Gary Robinson of NERC Environmental Systems Science Centre for notifying us of the problem.</li>
<li>03/10/2006: An error in BT data for MET-5 for normal and absolute radiance for thermal IR has been found. 
This affects data for the period 1998 Jul. through 2005 Dec.  An error in the code created BT files with table 
2 and 3 (normal and absolute radiance) for the thermal channels to be set to 0 (zero). This error did not affect 
D1 or D2 datasets.</li>
<li>03/06/2006: ISCCP BT data, version 1, for the satellites GMS-5 
(200301-200305) and GOE-9 (200305-200312) has been corrected. Due to a bug 
in the code the BT files for these 2 satellites for 2003 are incorrect 
for the images where the visible channel is not present.  In this case the 
tables for the last channel (11.5 microns, channel 4) are missing.  
The new replacement version corrects this. Pertinent BT data has been
delivered to the archive centers and can also be found in
our <a href="/pub/data/BT">BT data directory</a>.
<li>08/08/2005: ISCCP D2 data for the period October 2001 and beyond 
has been revised and a replacement version 0 has been delivered to the archive centers.<br>
ISCCP DX data for NOAA-16 and D1, D2 datasets beyond April 2003 have been revised and version 1 was
delivered to the appropriate centers.</li>
<li>07/07/2005: ISCCP DX data for NOAA-16 and D1, D2 beyond April 2003 are currently under revision.
The software did not catch the transition from AVHRR 3a/3b channel configuration to 3b only (3.7 microns)
therefore the cloud amount for this satellite over POLAR REGIONS ONLY in day time is overestimated 
(beyond April 2003 only). 
All other DX is correct as shipped.</li>
<li>06/16/2005: ISCCP D2 data and/or plots beyond September 2001 are currently under revision. 
  If you have downloaded any plots/data prior to this date that include D2 data past September 2001 you should not use them.</li>

<li>10/27/2004: A processing error has been found which affects D2 cloud 
  climatology anomaly analysis. The pertaining plots and data will be 
  replaced and made available in our website, sections Data Analysis 
  <a href="/analysis/climanal1.html">Part 1, Figure 1</a> and cloud type browse section 
  <a href="/analysis/climanal7.html">Part 7</a>.</li>

<li>01/26/2004: DX Snow/Ice maps covering the period Jan. 1998 - Sep. 2001 were made incorrectly in the 
  northern hemisphere. The original problem only affected the land areas in the northern hemisphere.
  The ISCCP DX/D1/D2 data products were reprocessed during October, November, and December 2003.</li>

<li>09/12/2001: D data for 1995-1997 will be replaced to decrease visible
  calibration by 5%.</li>

<li>04/30/2001: The <a href="/errors.html#i">Known and Fixed Data Errors</a> 
  page has been updated to document errors in cloud top temperature/pressure
  (ISCCP D-series dataset) and monthly-mean atmospheric temperature profiles,
  as well as to document the change to daily atmospheric temperature profiles
  in the daily TOVS files.</li>

<li>09/16/1998: A processing error has been found which affects some DX and all D1/D2 for September 1988 through March 1989.  All data has now been replaced.</li>

<li>01/31/1997: <A href="/errors.html">Data errors page updated</A> to document spurious sea ice reports, flipped North Polar DX array indices, and spurious land pixels in METEOSAT DX.</li>
<li>08/15/1996: <A href="/docs/docerrs.html">Correction pages for B3 radiance document and the D-data document</A> have been posted. </li> 
<li>06/07/1996: <A href="/errors.html">Incorrect precipitable water amounts and surface temperatures</A> added to "Known and Fixed Data Errors" page.</li>
<li>03/22/1996: <A href="/errors.html">Known and Fixed Data Errors</A> is a new page that will be updated as necessary.</li>

<h4 id="c">What's New On Radiance Calibration</h4>

<ul>
<li>02/18/2002: Radiance calibrations are now available through September
  2001. Values are final through September 1999.</li>

<li>09/18/2001: Calibrations are available through December 2000; values
  are final through 1998.</li>

<li>05/10/2001: The error in normalized calibration of GOES-8/9 water vapor
  channel has now been posted to our <a href="/errors.html#m">Known and Fixed 
  Data Errors</a> page.</li>

<li>01/15/1999: The recalibration has been completed. Shipment to the DAAC 
  will commence shortly.</li>

<li>11/04/1998: All BT released (with the exception of NOAA-12) for the 
  period of September 1994 and forward is being recalibrated to correct an 
  error on the visible channel. We hope to release the recalibrated data by 
  the end of the calendar year.</li>

<h4 id="e">What's New On Changes to Software</h4>

<ul>
<li>12/01/2005: The following declaration in B3READ software<br>
  <code>INTEGER   (KIND=INT4)::SCALNV/.05/,SCLNVM/.01/</code> was replaced by<br>
  <code>REAL   (KIND=REAL4)::SCALNV/.05/,SCLNVM/.01/</code></li>

<li>08/29/2005: A new version of <A href="/products/software.html#b3">B3read</a> software is available that handles all satellite channels.</li>
<li>03/31/2003: All of the read software was updated to contain a function
     (ICHAR_) to replace the fortran function ichar due to a change in the
     IBM version 8 xlf compiler which returns a signed integer rather than
     an unsigned integer as in previous versions. Thanks to Dan Shea at NCAR
     for pointing out the difference and providing the solution.
<li>08/27/2002: The <A href="/products/software.html#dx">DXREAD</a>

<li>02/13/1998: A new version of the

  divide BYTES 10-19 (Frequency of Mean Cloud Amount) by 2.0. Thus 
  these bytes are frequencies ranging from 0-100% but coded as 0-200%.

<P align=left>Josephine Butler grew up in a wealthy and politically prominent 
family in England. Her father John Grey was an advocate of social reform. 
Josephine shared her father's views, principles and hatred of injustice. She 
voiced her opinions on inequality and injustice no matter the price her 
reputation would take. She was an argued for the improvement of women's 
employment, women's education and campaigned for reform of the Contagious 
Diseases Act.<BR><BR>In 1863, Josephine decided to get involved in charity work 
as a way to deal with the death of her young daughter. She visited local 
workhouses and began to rescue young prostitutes. Josephine felt that many young 
women were forced into prostitution because of low wage earnings and 
unemployment in the country. She also became involved in improving women's 
education and employment. Josephine became the president of the North of England 
Council for the Higher Education of Women. She also persuaded Cambridge 
University into offering more courses and opportunities for women. The result 
was the establishment of Newnham College, an all-women college.<BR><BR>Josephine 
wrote two works: <I>The Education and Employment of Women </I>and<I> Women's 
Work</I> <I>and Women's</I> <I>Culture</I>. In the first work, she argued for 
opportunities in education and employment for single women. In the second work 
she angered many feminists because she warned women not to rival men since women 
had a different part to play in society. Josephine felt that women were 
different from men. A woman's role was to protect and care for the weak. A woman 
should be able to vote because their needs and abilities are different from men. 
Feminists felt that women should be rivals with men and are able to compete with 
men in every way. <BR><BR>She became the leader of the Ladies National 
Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act of 1870. The act was 
to prevent contagious diseases in the armed forces. The bill meant that any 
woman who was said to be a prostitute could be forcibly examined and imprisoned 
if she resisted. If she had a venereal disease, she could be kept in the 'Lock 
Hospital' for three months. Instead of being innocent until proven guilty, the 
women were defined as guilty and had to prove their innocence. The examinations 
were conducted by men and often times painful and humiliating. There was no 
pressure on men to be treated for venereal disease. Josephine campaigned against 
these Acts to educate middle class women of the hypocrisy of male dominated 
morality toward women of their own class and the cruelty of other women. The 
campaigned attacked sex and class dominance within one of the most taboo areas 
of Victorian sexual culture. Also, it was led by a woman who insisted that upper 
class men be subject to their own moral code. <BR><BR>Josephine went all over 
the country giving speeches about the Contagious Diseases Act. She was an 
excellent orator, who attracted a large audience. Many were shocked that a woman 
was giving explicit speeches about sexual matters. Her husband stood by her side 
although he was criticized and told that his support would hurt his academic 
standing in the country. Parliament finally repealed the Acts in 1886; this was 
considered a major feminist triumph.<BR><BR>Josephine Butler was a revolutionary 
feminist. She forced the Parliament to change the legal age of prostitutes from 
13 to 16 years of age, helped advance the opportunities of women in education 
and brought forth the hypocrisy of male morality on women through the Contagious 
Diseases Act. Josephine used her standing in society to help the less fortunate 
women of her country. She died in 1906.</P>

1860-1914</I>. J<U>ournal of Social History </U>36.4 (2003) 1081-1083.<BR></B>The author of this journal 
examines the emergence and causes of prostitution. It also examines the 
reformation of acts such as the Contagious Diseases Act and its impact on 
prostitution and women. The author examines ways to keep girls from turning to 
prostitution and ways to reform those who are already prostituting. The journal 
is good but a bit lengthy. <BR><BR><B>BBC. "Historic Figures: Josephine Butler"

(19 December 2005).<BR></B>This website is a great site for information 
on Josephine Butler and other Victorian women. It has a short but good biography 
and many links to British history. I would recommend this site for anyone 
interested in British history.<BR><BR><B>Brittain, Vera. <I>Lady Into Woman</I>. 
New York, N.Y.: MacMillan, 1953.<BR></B>This book follows the history of women 
from the Victorian days to the 1950s. The book is easy to read and the chapters 
are clearly defined. The source contains many women, including Josephine Butler 
and their accomplishments. Although the book is dated, I would recommend this 
book as a starting point for research on women's history. <BR><BR><B>DiCaprio, 
Lisa and Wiesner, Merry. <I>Lives and Voices: Sources in European Women's 
History</I>. Boston, MA.: Houghton Mifflin, 2001.<BR></B>This book is great for 
use in the classroom. It utilizes primary sources to learn about women's history 
starting from the Bible to present day. The book contains an article, "Letter to 
My Countrywomen, Dwelling in the Farmsteads and Cottages of England." The 
purpose of this article was to stir up support against the Contagious Diseases 
Act by the working class and religious organizations. The book is a great read 
because it gives a summary of the time period, a summary of the work and the 
primary source itself. I strongly suggest this book for any professor to use in 
college.<BR><BR><B>Hooper, Katy. "The Josephine Butler Collections" University

(19 December 2005).<BR></B>I found this to be a very useful source. It 
includes many links to information about Josephine Butler including personal 
letters to and from her husband and public figures and also, her diary. The site 
has a detailed biography and includes a few pictures of Josephine. There is also 
a link for the Women's Library at the London Metropolitan University. The 
Women's library has many collections with an abundance of information on 
Josephine Butler. <BR><BR><B>Norton, Katie. "Josephine Butler" Virginia Tech.

(19 December 2005).<BR></B>The webpage was written by an English Major 
at Virginia Tech. The Biography is good and easy to read. There is not much to 
this site. There are no further external links. I would recommend this page if 
someone is interested in a short biography of Josephine Butler but would not 
recommend this site for anyone who needs in-depth research material. 
<BR><BR><B>Petrie, Glen. <I>A Singular Iniquity: The Campaigns of Josephine 
Butler</I>. New York, N.Y.: Viking Press, 1971.<BR></B>This is a great book for 
information on Josephine Butler since it is dedicated to her history and life's 
work. Included in the book are excerpts of personal letters to and from her 
children and her husband George. It also explains the campaigns against her by 
Parliament and the upper class men of Victorian society. The book is a bit 
lengthy but I would still recommend this book to any level reader. 
<BR><BR><B>Rowbotham, Sheila. <I>Hidden from History</I>. New York, N.Y.: 
Pantheon, 1974.<BR></B>This book studies women's history from the Puritan 
Revolution to the 1930s. It investigates how sex, work, family and societal 
demands have shaped and hindered the woman's struggle from equality. This source 
explains the campaign of Josephine Butler against the Contagious Diseases Act 
and her work with prostitutes. She examines the effect of Josephine Butler had 
on class domination and sexual taboos in Victorian society. The author uses 
primary documents such as letters to reveal the real history of women. This was 
an excellent book even though the book is slightly difficult to read. I would 
recommend this book for upper level readers. <BR><BR><B>Wohl, Anthony S. "The

href="http://www.victorianweb.org/gender/contagious.html">http://www.victorianweb.org/gender/contagious.html</A>&gt;
(19 December 2005).<BR></B>This is the best website to access 
information about history, literature and culture of the Victorian Era. The site 
explains the Contagious Diseases Act in detail. The information on this site is 
easy to read. The site is easy to navigate also. The website includes 
information about gender matters, politics, religion, science and much more. 
This is highly recommended for the study of the Victorian Era.

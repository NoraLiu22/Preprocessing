<p><font size="5" color="#5A4614"><b>The Fur Trade Era (1818-42)</b></font><hr noshade></p>

<p>The onset of the War of 1812 put an end to the activity of American
fur traders in the West before they were able to ransack such remote
areas as the Yellowstone region, and, following that conflict, the
better-organized British concerns monopolized the trade in the northern
Rocky Mountains for a few years. Their advantage lay in the adoption of
a method of trapping based upon the use of roving brigades of
<i>engagees</i>&#151;mainly Iroquois and French Canadians who did not
have to wait at established trading posts for Indians to bring in the
furs, as the Americans did. After 1821, the latter began to use similar
tactics and soon took over the fur trade of the far West entirely.</p>

<p>A brigade of North West Co. men operating under Donald McKenzie came
within sight of the Teton Range in 1818, and Alexander Ross, who was
their scribe, mentions that "Boiling fountains having different degrees
of temperature were very numerous; one or two were so very hot as to
boil meat." [<a href="ieee.htm#113">13</a>] They may have been in the
Yellowstone region, but the failure to mention landmarks makes that
uncertain.</p>

<p>There was a visitor the following year who is known only by the
initials "J. O. R." carved into the base of a pine tree, over the date
"AUG. 29. 1819." [<a href="ieee.htm#114">14</a>] Superintendent Philetus
W. Norris, who found this evidence of white penetration of the
Yellowstone wilderness, has described it thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next earliest evidence of white men in the Park [Colter's primacy
had just been discussed], of which I have any knowledge, was discovered
by myself at our camp in the little glen, where our bridle-path from the
lake makes its last approach to the rapids, one-fourth of a mile above
the upper falls. About breast-high upon the west side of a smooth pine
tree, about 20 inches in diameter, were found, legibly carved through
the bark, and not materially obliterated by overgrowth or decay, in
Roman capitals and Arabic numerals, the following record:</p>

<p align="center">J.O.R.<br>
AUG. 29, 1819</p>

<p>The camp was soon in excitement, the members of our party developing
a marked diversity of opinion as to the real age of the record, the most
experienced favoring the theory that it was really made at the date as
represented. Upon the other side of this tree were several small wooden
pins, such as were formerly often used in fastening wolverine and other
skins while drying (of the actual age of which there was no clew further
than they that were very old), but there were certain hatchet hacks near
the record, which all agreed were of the same age, and that by cutting
them out and counting the layers or annual growths the question should
be decided. This was done, and although the layers were unusually thin,
they were mainly distinct, and, in the minds of all present, decisive;
and as this was upon the 29th day of July [1881], it was only one month
short of sixty-two years since some unknown white man had there stood
and recorded his visit to the roaring rapids of the "Mystic River,"
before the birth of any of the band of stalwart but bronzed and grizzled
mountaineers who were then grouped around it. This is all which was then
or subsequently learned, or perhaps ever will be, of the maker of the
record, unless a search which is now in progress results in proving
these initials to be those of some early rover of these regions.
Prominent among these was a famous Hudson Bay trapper, named Ross. . . .
The "R" in the record suggests, rather than proves, identity, which, if
established, would be important, as confirming the reality of the
legendary visits of the Hudson Bay trappers to the Park at that early
day. Thorough search of the grove in which this tree is situated only
proved that it was a long abandoned camping ground. Our intelligent,
observant mountaineer comrade, Phelps, upon this, as upon previous and
subsequent occasions, favored the oldest date claimed by any one, of the
traces of men, and, as usual, proved to be correct. [<a href="ieee.htm#115">15</a>] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Superintendent Norris never did find out who J. O. R. was, though it
now appears they may have lived in the same State. About the turn of the
century, a writer who was assisting Olin D. Wheeler with the preparation
of Northern Pacific Railroad publicity had an opportunity to interview
an aged Frenchman by the name of Roch who lived at Luddington, Mich. In
recalling that interview after a lapse of more than 30 years, Mr. Decker
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He claimed to be over a hundred years old. I met his son at the same
time, who was then seventy-five years old. He said his father was
between a hundred and a hundred and nine years of age. In my interview
with him, he said he went to the Park when a young man as hunter for a
fur company, and he spoke of a tree that was marked and dated, and he
said it would probably be found by somebody. . . . As near as I can get
it, Mr. Roch was in the Park in 1818.  [<a href="ieee.htm#116">16</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexander Ross, the man Norris thought might have been J. O. R. (an
unlikely presumption considering the dissimilarity of the first
initials), returned to the Missouri headwaters in 1824 as the leader of
a brigade of Hudson Bay Co. trappers. Agnes Laut examined the foolscap
folios which made up his official report to the company, and she
summarizes the activity of the brigade thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One week, the men were spread out in different parties on the Three
Forks of the Missouri. Another week they were on the headwaters of the
Yellowstone in the National Park of Wyoming. They did not go eastward
beyond sight of the mountains but swung back and forward between
Montana and Wyoming. [<a href="ieee.htm#117">17</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Laut copied a passage from that as-yet-unpublished report which
hints that Ross' brigade was among the great geysers of the Yellowstone:
"Saturday 24th [April, 1824]&#151;we crossed beyond the Boiling
Fountains. The snow is knee-deep half the people are snowblind from sun
glare."</p>

<p>The record of British trapping activity in the Yellowstone region is
admittedly sketchy, and all that can be added to it is the surmise of
Superintendent Norris that the cache of iron traps found near Obsidian
Cliff by his workmen, during the construction of the Norris road, was
made by Hudson's Bay Co. men more than 50 years earlier. [<a href="ieee.htm#118">18</a>]</p>

<p>Just when American trappers began taking fur on the Yellowstone
Plateau is uncertain. An exploration by Jedediah S. Smith and six
unidentified trappers, northward from Green River in 1824, seems to have
gotten no closer than Jackson's Hole and Conant Pass; [<a href="ieee.htm#119">19</a>] however, they definitely were there in 1826.
A letter written to a brother in Philadelphia by one of the young men
who went to the Rocky Mountains with General Ashley's expedition in 1822
contains the first clear description of Yellowstone features, and that
portion is presented here just as written by Daniel T. Potts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At or near this place heads the Luchkadee or Californ [Green River]
Stinking fork [Shoshone River] Yellow-Stone South fork of Masuri and
Henrys fork all those head at an angular point that of the Yellow-Stone
has a large fresh water Lake near its head on the very top of the
Mountain which is about one hundred by fourty Miles in diameter and as
clear as Crystal on the South borders of this Lake is a number of hot
and boiling springs some of water and others of most beautiful fine clay
and resembles that of a mush pot and throws its particles to the immense
height of from twenty to thirty feet in height The Clay is white and of
a pink and water appears fathomless as it appears to be entirely hollow
under neath. There is also a number of places where the pure suphor is
sent forth in abundance one of our men Visited one of those wilst taking
his recreation there at an instan the earth began a tremendious
trembling and he with dificulty made his escape when an explosion took
place resembling that of thunder. During our stay in that quarter I
heard it every day. From this place by a circutous rout to the Nourth
west we returned. [<a href="ieee.htm#120">20</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daniel T. Potts continued in the fur trade until the fall of 1828,
when he went to Texas and began buying cattle for shipment to the New
Orleans market. It has been presumed that he died soon afterward in the
foundering of a cattle boat in the Gulf of Mexico. The Potts Hot Spring
Basin on the shore of West Thumb Bay has been named for this trapper
whose rude but very recognizable description of Yellowstone features was
the first to appear in print.</p>

<p>During the period 1827 to 1833 American trappers are reported as
having visited the Yellowstone region every year; [<a href="ieee.htm#121">21</a>] however, only the visit of Joseph L. Meek in
1829 can be documented. According to the reminiscence Mrs. Frances F.
Victor obtained from the aged trapper about 1868, Joe was a novice of
only 7 months experience with the firm of Smith, Jackson &amp; Sublette
when he approached the Yellowstone region from the north with a party
led by William Sublette. They had crossed the mountains which lie
between the West Fork of Gallatin River and the Yellowstone Valley and
were resting their horses in the latter, near the Devils Slide, when
they were suddenly attacked by a Blackfoot war party. Two men were
killed and the trappers were scattered with the loss of most of their
horses and equipment.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old recruit escaped across the Yellowstone River with
only his mule, blanket, and gun, making his way southward into what is
now Yellowstone National Park where, 5 days later, he</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... ascended a low mountain in the neighborhood of his camp&#151;and
behold! the whole country beyond was smoking with the vapor from boiling
springs, and burning with gasses, issuing from small' craters, each of
which was emitting a sharp whistling sound. When the first surprise of
this astonishing scene had passed, Joe began to ad mire its effect in an
artistic point of view. The morning being clear, with a sharp frost, he
thought himself reminded of the city of Pittsburg, as he had beheld it
on a winter morning a couple of years before. This, however, related
only to the rising smoke and vapor; for the extent of the volcanic
region was immense, reaching far out of sight. The general face of the
country was smooth and rolling, being a level plain, dotted with
cone-shaped mounds. On the summits of these mounds were small craters
from four to eight feet in diameter. Interspersed among these, on the
level plain, were larger craters, some of them from four to six miles
across. Out of these craters issued blue flames and molten
brimstone.</p>

<p>For some minutes Joe gazed and wondered. Curious thoughts came into
his head, about hell and the day of doom. With that natural tendency to
reckless gayety and humorous absurdities which some temperaments are
sensible of in times of great excitement, he began to soliloquize. Said
he, to himself, "I have been told the sun would be blown out, and the
earth burnt up. If this infernal wind keeps up, I shouldn't be surprized
if the sun war blown out. If the earth is <i>not</i> burning up over
thar, then it is that place the old Methodist preacher used to threaten
me with. Any way it suits me to go and see what it's like."</p>

<p>On descending to the plain described, the earth was found to have a
hollow sound, and seemed threatening to break through. But Joe found the
warmth of the place most delightful, after the freezing cold of the
mountains, and remarked to himself again, that "if it war hell, it war a
more agreeable climate than he had been in for some time." [<a href="ieee.htm#122">22</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there is no Yellowstone thermal area even remotely
resembling Meek's description&#151;a fact which caused historian
Chittenden to admit the necessity for "making some allowance for the
trapper's tendency to exaggeration;" and yet, he probably did blunder
into the Norris Geyser Basin. Such a traumatic experience as he had
undergone (a wild flight from a scene of butchery, into a wilderness
where he even lost his mule), is liable to leave larger-than-life
impressions upon a stripling mind. Fortunately for Joe, he was found by
two experienced trappers sent out by Captain Sublette to track down the
fugitives.</p>

<p>Two of the shadowy forays into the Yellowstone region during this
period deserve a mention because of their consequences. One is the
venture through which Johnson Gardner's name became attached to a
beautiful mountain valley at the head of the river in Yellowstone
National Park which now immortalizes him. Records kept at Fort Union, a
fur post at the mouth of the Yellowstone River, indicate that it was
probably in the fall of 1831 or the spring of 1832 when that illiterate,
often brutal, trapper discovered the valley known thereafter among his
peers as "Gardner's Hole," [<a href="ieee.htm#124">24</a>] and the
place-name which now identifies the river flowing from that vale is the
second oldest in Yellowstone Park&#151;only the name Yellowstone having
an earlier origin.</p>

<p>The other barely known visit which is of great importance through
discovery of the great geysers of the Firehole River basins was that of
a party of trappers led there by Manuel Alvarez in 1833.25 The stories
told by these men at the annual rendezvous determined a clerk of the
American Fur Co.&#151;Warren Angus Ferris&#151;to make an excursion to
the geysers at the opening of the next summer season. Of this visit,
which made him the first Yellowstone "tourist" (because his motive was
curiosity, rather than business), he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had heard in the summer of 1833, while at rendezvous, that
remarkable boiling springs had been discovered on the sources of the
Madison, by a party of trappers, in their spring hunt; of which the
accounts they gave, were so very astonishing, that I determined to
examine them myself, before recording their description, though I had
the united testimony of more than twenty men on the subject, all
declared they saw them, and that they really <i>were</i> as extensive
and remarkable as they had been described. Having now an opportunity of
paying them a visit, and as another or better might not soon occur, I
parted with the company after supper, and taking with me two
Pen-d'orielles, (who were induced to make the excursion with me, by the
promise of an extra present,) set out at a round pace, the night being
clear and comfortable. We proceeded over the plain about twenty miles,
and halted until day-light, on a fine spring, flowing into Cammas Creek.
Refreshed by a few hour's sleep, we started again after a hasty
breakfast, and entered a very extensive forest, called the Piny Woods;
(a continuous succession of low mountains or hills, entirely covered by
a dense growth of this species of timber;) which we passed through, and
reached the vicinity of the springs about dark, having seen several
small lakes or ponds on the sources of the Madison, [<a href="ieee.htm#126">26</a>] and rode about forty miles; which was a hard
day's ride, taking into consideration the rough irregularity of the
country through which we had travelled.</p>

<p>We regaled ourselves with a cup of coffee, the materials for making
which, we had brought with us, and immediately after supper, lay down to
rest, sleepy and much fatigued. The continual roaring of the springs,
however, (which was distinctly heard,) for some time prevented my going
to sleep, and excited an impatient curiosity to examine them, which I
was obliged to defer the gratification of, until morning, and filled my
slumbers with visions of waterspouts, cataracts, fountains, jets d'eau
of immense dimensions, etc. etc.</p>

<p>When I arose in the morning, clouds of vapour seemed like a dense fog
to overhang the springs, from which frequent reports or explosions of
different loudness, constantly assailed our ears. I immediately
proceeded to inspect them, and might have exclaimed with the Queen of
Sheba, when their full reality of dimensions and novelty burst upon my
view, "the half was not told me."</p>

<p>From the surface of a rocky plain or table, burst forth columns of
water of various dimensions, projected high in the air, accompanied by
loud explosions, and sulphurous vapors, which were highly disagreeable
to the smell. The rock from which these springs burst forth, was
calcareous, [<a href="ieee.htm#127">27</a>] and probably extends some
distance from them, beneath the soil. The largest of these wonderful
fountains, projects a column of boiling water several feet in diameter,
to the height of more than one hundred and fifty feet, in my opinion;
but the party of Alvarez, who discovered it, persist in declaring that
it could not be less than four times that distance in
height&#151;accompanied with a tremendous noise. These explosions and
discharges occur at intervals of about two hours. [<a href="ieee.htm#128">28</a>] After having witnessed three of them, I
ventured near enough to put my hand into the water of its basin, but
withdrew it instantly, for the heat of the water in this immense
chauldron <i>[sic],</i> was altogether too great for my comfort; and the
agitation of the water, the disagreeable effluvium continually exuding,
and the hollow unearthly rumbling under the rock on which I stood, so
ill accorded with my notions of personal safety, that I retreated back
precipitately, to a respectful distance. The Indians, who were with me,
were quite appalled, and could not by any means be induced to approach
them. They seemed astonished at my presumption, in advancing up to the
large one, and when I safely returned, congratulated me on my <i>"narrow
escape."</i> They believed them to be supernatural, and supposed them to
be the production of the Evil Spirit. One of them remarked that hell, of
which he had heard from the whites, must be in that vicinity. [<a href="ieee.htm#129">29</a>] The diameter of the basin into which the
waters of the largest jet principally fall, and from the centre of
which, through a hole in the rock of about nine or ten feet in diameter,
the water spouts up as above related, may be about thirty feet. There
are many other smaller fountains, that did not throw their water up so
high, but occurred at shorter intervals. In some instances the volumes
were projected obliquely upwards, and fell into the neighbouring
fountains, or on the rock or prairie. But their ascent was generally
perpendicular, falling in and about their own basins or apertures. These
wonderful productions of nature, are situated near the centre of a small
valley, surrounded by pine-crowned hills, through which a small fork of
the Madison flows.</p>

<p>From several trappers who had recently returned from the Yellow
Stone, I received an account of boiling springs, that differ from those
seen on Salt river only in magnitude, being on a vastly larger scale;
some of their cones are from twenty to thirty feet high, and forty to
fifty paces in circumference. Those which have ceased to emit boiling,
vapour, Etc., of which there were several, are full of shelving
cavities, even some fathoms in extent, which give them, inside, an
appearance of honey-comb. The ground for several acres extent in
vicinity of the springs is evidently hollow, and constantly exhales a
hot steam or vapour of disagreeable odour, and a character entirely
to prevent vegetation. They are situated in the valley at the head of
that river, near the lake, which constitutes its source. [<a href="ieee.htm#130">30</a>]</p>

<p>A short distance from these springs, near the margin of the lake,
there is one quite different from any yet described. It is of a circular
form, several feet in diameter, clear, <i>cold</i> and pure; the bottom
appears visible to the eye and <i>seems</i> seven or eight feet below
the surface of the earth or water, yet it has been sounded with a lodge
pole fifteen feet in length, without meeting any resistance. What is
most singular with respect to this fountain, is the fact that at regular
intervals of about two minutes, a body or column of water bursts up to
the height of eight feet, with an explosion as loud as the report of [a]
musket, and then falls back into it; for a few seconds the water is
roiley, but it speedily settles, and becomes transparent as before the
efluxion. A slight tremulous motion of the water and a low rumbling
sound from the caverns beneath, precede each explosion. This spring was
believed to be connected with the lake by some subterranean passage, but
the cause of its periodical eruptions or discharges, is entirely
unknown. I have never before heard of a <i>cold</i> spring, whose waters
exhibit the phenomena of periodical explosive propulsion, in form of a
jet. [<a href="ieee.htm#131">31</a>] The geysers of Iceland, and the
various other European springs, the waters of which are projected
upwards, with violence and uniformity, as well as those seen on the head
waters of the Madison, are invariably hot. [<a href="ieee.htm#132">32</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A point worthy of notice, and one which gives the observations of
Warren Angus Ferris a particular value, is the fact that he had been
trained as a surveyor, and it was that occupation to which he devoted
his life upon abandoning the fur trade in 1835.</p>

<p>The year Ferris left the mountains, the Yellowstone region was
visited for the first time by a trapper who came to know the area well
during the 9 years he spent in the northern Rocky Mountains; even more
important, he left a reliable record of what he saw during those years,
for he, too, was a competent journalist. [<a href="ieee.htm#133">33</a>]
He was Osborne Russell, a Maine farm boy who joined Nathaniel J. Wyeth's
Columbia River Fishing &amp; Trading Co. in 1834, becoming a member of
the garrison left at Fort Hall, on Snake River, that summer. It was from
that isolated post that he went out the following March with a "spring
hunt" intended to tap the fur-wealth of the Yellowstone region.</p>

<p>Because of their leader's poor knowledge of the country, the party
Russell was with entered the confines of the present Yellowstone
National Park by a difficult route which brought them onto the
headwaters of Lamar River [<a href="ieee.htm#134">34</a>] from the North
Fork of the Shoshone. Here is Russell's introduction to the Yellowstone
country, as recorded in his manuscript:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[p. 33] 28th [July, 1835] We crossed the mountain in a West direction
thro. the thick pines and fallen timber about 12 mls and encamped in a
small prairie about a mile in circumference Thro. this valley ran a
small stream in a north direction which all agreed in believing to be a
branch of the Yellow Stone. 29th We descended the stream about 15 mls
thro. the dense forest and at length came to a beautiful valley about 8
Mls. long and 3 or 4 wide [<a href="ieee.htm#135">35</a>] surrounded by
dark and lofty mountains. The stream after running thro. the center in a
NW direction rushed down a tremendous canyon of basaltic rock
apparently just wide enough to admit its waters. The banks of the stream
in the valley were low and skirted in many places with beautiful Cotton
wood groves.</p>

<p>Here we found a few Snake Indians [<a href="ieee.htm#136">36</a>]
comprising 6 men 7 women and 8 or 10 children who were the
only Inhabitants of this lonely and secluded spot. They were all neatly
clothed in dressed deer and Sheep skins of the best quality and seemed
to be perfectly contented and happy. They were rather surprised at our
approach and retreated to the heights where they might have a view of us
without apprehending any danger, but having persuaded them of our
pacific intentions we then succeeded in getting them to encamp with us.
Their personal property consisted of one old butcher Knife nearly worn
to the back two old shattered fusees which had long since become useless
for want of ammunition a Small Stone pot and about 30 dogs on which they
carried their skins, clothing, provisions etc on their hunting
excursions. They were well armed with bows and arrows pointed with
obsidian. The bows were beautifully wrought from Sheep, Buffaloe and Elk
horns secured with Deer and Elk sinews and ornamented with porcupine
quills and generally about 3 feet long. We obtained a large number [p.
34] of Elk Deer and Sheep skins from them of the finest quality and
three large neatly dressed Panther Skins in return for awls axes kettles
tobacco ammunition etc. They would throw the skins at our feet and say
"give us whatever you please for them and we are satisfied. We can get
plenty of Skins but we do not often see the Tibuboes" (or People of the
Sun). They said there had been a great many beaver on the branches of
this stream but they had killed nearly all of them and being ignorant of
the value of fur had singed it off with fire in order to drip the meat
more conveniently. They had seen some whites some years previous who had
passed thro, the valley and left a horse behind but he had died during
the first winter. They are never at a loss for fire which they produce
by the friction of two pieces of wood which are rubbed together with a
quick and steady motion. One of them drew a map of the country around us
on a white Elk Skin with a piece of Charcoal after which he explained
the direction of the different passes, streams etc. From them we
discovered that it was about one days travel in a SW direction to the
outlet or northern extremity of the Yellow Stone Lake, but the route
from his description being difficult and Beaver comparatively scarce our
leader gave out the idea of going to it this season as our horses were
much jaded and their feet badly worn. Our Geographer also told us that
this stream united with the Yellow Stone after leaving this Valley half
a days travel in a west direction. The river then ran a long distance
thro. a tremendous cut in the mountain in the same direction and emerged
into a large plain the extent of which was beyond his geographical
knowledge or conception.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two days later this party continued down the Lamar River to the
crossing of the Yellowstone, [<a href="ieee.htm#137">37</a>] where they
laid over a day while a search was made for a hunter who failed to come
into camp. Efforts to locate the lost man failing, the trappers
continued westward over the Blacktail Deer Plateau to "Gardner's Hole,"
[<a href="ieee.htm#138">38</a>] where they stopped again. After trapping
for more than 2 weeks in that beautiful mountain valley, the party
crossed the Gallatin Range, onto the river which drains its western
flank, and were soon out of present Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>Osborne Russell entered the Yellowstone region the following summer
with some of Jim Bridger's trappers, with whom he had joined after
quitting the Columbia River Fishing &amp; Trading Co. The route followed
was the conventional one from Jackson's Hole to the upper Yellowstone
River via Two Ocean Pass. Continuing from Russell's manuscript, he
says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[p. 53] 9th [August, 1836] . . . we came to a smooth prarie about 2 Mls
long and half a Ml. wide lying east and west surrounded by pines. On the
South side about midway of the prarie stands a high snowy peak from
whence issues a [p. 54]. Stream of water which after entering the plain
it divides equally one half running West and the other East thus bidding
adieu to each other one bound for the Pacific and the other for the
Atlantic ocean. [<a href="ieee.htm#139">39</a>] Here a trout of 12 inches
in length may cross the mountains in safety. Poets have sung of the
"meeting of the waters" and fish climbing cataracts but the "parting of
the waters and fish crossing mountains" I believe remains unsung as yet
by all except the solitary Trapper who sits under the shade of a
spreading pine whistling blank-verse and beating time to the tune with a
whip on his trap sack whilst musing on the parting advise of these
waters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Two Ocean Pass, the trappers traveled down Atlantic Creek to the
valley of the upper Yellowstone River, [<a href="ieee.htm#140">40</a>]
which was followed to Yellowstone Lake. The trail then passed along the
east shore of the lake to a pleasant camping place near the outlet. [<a href="ieee.htm#141">41</a>] While encamped there, Russell wrote this
description of Lake Yellowstone and the hot springs at Steamboat
Point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[p. 55] The Lake is about 100 Mls. in circumference bordered on the
East by high ranges of Mountains whose spurs terminate at the shore and
on the west by a low bed of piney mountains its greatest width is about
15 Mls lying in an oblong form south to north or rather in the shape of
a crescent. [<a href="ieee.htm#142">42</a>] Near where we encamped were
several hot springs which boil perpetually. Near these was an opening
in the ground about 8 inches in diameter from which steam issues
continually with a noise similar to that made by the steam issuing from
a safety valve of an engine and can be heard 5 or 6 Mls. distant. I
should think the steam issued with sufficient force to work an engine of
30 horse power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Osborne Russell and six other trappers separated from the main party
and proceeded to the Lamar Valley by way of Pelican Creek. Enroute they
camped in a grassy glen where elk ribs were broiled before a blazing
fire, and afterward the evening hours were whiled away in storytelling.
That this was only the preferred entertainment of men isolated for long
periods from civilization and no reflection on their veracity, is made
clear by Russell, who says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[p. 56] The repast being over the jovial tale goes round the circle
the peals of loud laughter break upon the stillness of the night which
after being mimicked in the echo from rock to rock it dies away in the
solitary glens. Every tale puts an auditor in mind of something similar
to it but under different circumstances which being told the "laughing
part" gives rise to increasing merriment and furnishes more subjects for
good jokes and witty sayings such as Swift never dreamed of. Thus the
evening passed with eating drinking and stories enlivened with witty
humor until near Midnight all being wrapped in their blankets lying
around the fire gradually falling to sleep one by one until the last
tale is "encored" by the snoring of the drowsy audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After trapping 4 days in that "secluded valley" described by Russell
the previous year, this small party continued to Gardners Hole where
they rejoined Jim Bridger's camp and soon passed out of the Yellowstone
mountains.</p>

<p>Osborne Russell came back to the Yellowstone region in 1837, entering
it again by way of Two Ocean Pass&#151;called the "Yellowstone Pass" by
some trappers. This third visit followed the same general route as that
of 1836 until the Lamar River was reached at a point somewhat south of
the "secluded valley"; from there, they turned eastward, to the Hoodoo
Basin, and then climbed over the Absaroka Range and out of the park
area. After trapping for some time on the North Fork of the Shoshone
River (the Stinkingwater River of an earlier day), Russell and his
comrades crossed over to the Clark Fork above its great canyon and
worked up that stream back into what is now Yellowstone Park. However,
they did not tarry on the tributaries of the Lamar River but continued
northward over the divide into the Boulder River drainage on September
13.</p>

<p>Osborne Russell went into the Yellowstone region for the last time in
the summer of 1839&#151;a visit which provided new sights and
experiences. This time he entered the Yellowstone region directly up
Snake River from Jackson Lake, very much as the South Entrance Road now
does; however, his party passed around the west side of Lewis Lake,
continuing up its inlet stream to Shoshone Lake. [<a href="ieee.htm#143">43</a>] At the west end of the lake they came upon
"about 50 springs of boiling hot water," including at least one active
geyser. [<a href="ieee.htm#144">44</a>] This "hour spring" was described
thus by Russell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[p. 120] the first thing that attracts the attention is a hole about
15 inches in diameter in which the water is boiling slowly about 4
inches below the surface at length it begins to boil and bubble
violently and the water commences raising and shooting upwards until the
column arises to the hight of sixty feet from whence it falls to the
ground in drops on a circle of about 30 feet in diameter being perfetly
cold when it strikes the ground. It continues shooting up in this manner
five or six minutes [p. 121] and then sinks back to its former state of
Slowly boiling for an hour and then shoots forth as before My Comrade
Said he had watched the motions of this Spring for one whole day and
part of the night the year previous and found no irregularity whatever
in its movements. [<a href="ieee.htm#145">45</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Shoshone Geyser Basin, Russell's party crossed the divide
into the drainage of the Firehole River. They appear to have passed
through the geyser basins without seeing a major geyser in action. The
peculiarly sculptured cone of Lone Star Geyser was mentioned by Russell,
and he was impressed with the convenience of cookery in the geyser
basins, where the "kettle is always ready and boiling"; but only one
feature of the wonder-filled area was described in detail. Of it he
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[p. 122] At length we came to a boiling Lake about 300 ft in diameter
forming nearly a complete circle as we approached on the South side. The
steam which arose from it was of three distinct Colors from the west
side for one third of the diameter it was white, in the middle it was
pale red, and the remaining third on the east light sky blue [<a href="ieee.htm#146">46</a>]. Whether it was something peculiar in the
state of the atmosphere the day being cloudy or whether it was some
Chemical properties contained in the water which produced this
phenomenon. I am unable to say and shall leave the explanation to some
scientific tourist who may have the Curiosity to visit this place at
some future period&#151;The water was of deep indigo blue boiling like an
imense cauldron running over the white rock which had formed [round] the
edges to the height of 4 or 5 feet from the surface of the earth sloping
gradually for 60 or 70 feet. What a field of speculation this presents
for chemist and geologist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Lower Geyser Basin, the trappers followed the Firehole River
to its junction with the Gibbon&#151;from which he identifies the "Burnt
Hole" of the trappers as the present Madison Valley [<a href="ieee.htm#147">47</a>]&#151;and then turned eastward into Hayden
Valley. After nearly 6 weeks of trapping in familiar country northeast
of Yellowstone Lake, the party was encamped on its northern shore when
surprised by Blackfoot Indians, who despoiled them. [<a href="ieee.htm#148">48</a>] Left destitute, and with himself and another
wounded, Russell and his two remaining comrades managed to make their
way out of the present park area by passing around the west shore of
Lake Yellowstone, crossing over to Heart Lake and down its outlet stream
and Snake River. They then made their way across the Teton Range by the
Conant Pass and onto the Snake River Plain, where they ultimately found
succor at Fort Hall. Though Russell never went back to the Yellowstone
region, he had seen enough of it to write the most comprehensive account
of that wilderness extant prior to definitive exploration.</p>

<p>Another party of trappers met Blackfoot Indians near Pelican Creek
that fall and the resulting battle appears to have been a particularly
sanguinary affair. All that is known of this collision comes from "Wild
Cat Bill" Hamilton, a trapper who was not a participant but had this
story from men he knew well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the year 1839 a party of forty men started on an expedition up the
Snake River. In the party were Ducharme,  [<a href="ieee.htm#149">49</a>]Louis Anderson, Jim and John Baker, Joe
Power, L'Humphrie, and others. They passed Jackson's Lake, catching many
beaver, and crossed the Continental Divide, following down the Upper
Yellowstone&#151;Elk [<a href="ieee.htm#150">50</a>]&#151;River to the
Yellowstone Lake. They described accurately the Lake, the hot springs at
the upper end of the lake; Steamboat Springs on the south side; the
lower end of the lake, Vinegar Creek, and Pelican Creek, where they
caught large quantities of beaver and otter. They also told about the
sulphur mountains, and the Yellowstone Falls, and the mud geysers . . .
.</p>

<p>They also described a fight that they had with a large party of
Piegan Indians at the lower end of the lake on the north side, and on a
prairie of about half a mile in length. The trappers built a corral at
the upper end of the prairie and fought desperately for two days, losing
five men besides having many wounded. The trappers finally compelled the
Piegans to leave, with the loss of many of their bravest warriors. After
the wounded were able to travel, they took up an Indian trail and struck
a warm-spring creek. This they followed to the Madison River, which at
that time was not known to the trappers. [<a href="ieee.htm#151">51</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trappers of the fur trade days were not entirely oblivious to the
value of their geographical discoveries. Ferris prepared a manuscript
map in 1836 which showed his extensive, and essentially correct,
knowledge of the physiography of the northern Rocky Mountains&#151;of
interest here because of its notations, "Boiling water volcanoes"
southwest of Yellowstone Lake and "Spouting Fountains" on the headwaters
of the Madison River (the latter vaguely included within the dashed line
enclosing a "Burnt Hole"). However, this map did not influence the
cartography of the fur trade era because it remained in the hands of its
author and his heirs. [<a href="ieee.htm#152">52</a>]</p>

<p>The information attributed to "William Sublette and others," [<a href="ieee.htm#153">53</a>] which appears on a map prepared by Capt.
Washington Hood, of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, in 1839, was
more useful. In addition to "Yellowstone L." and "Burnt Hole," this
excellently drawn map showed a "Yellowstone Pass" (Two Ocean Pass)
south of the lake, and a "Gardner's Fork" emptying into Yellowstone
River north of the lake. But, most interestingly, the drainage of
Gardner River bears the notations "Boiling Spring" and "White Sulphur
Banks," the latter being an obvious allusion to the Mammoth Hot
Springs. [<a href="ieee.htm#154">54</a>] (See <a href="images/ieem3.jpg">map 3</a>.)</p>

<p>William Sublette, the fur trader who provided much of the information
for Captain Hood's map, is said to have guided the Scottish sportsman,
Sir William Drummond Stewart, through the Yellowstone region in
1843&#151;a visit recalled in the words of a young gentleman of St.
Louis, who was a member of that party. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. . . we reached a country that seemed, indeed, to be Nature's
wonderworld. The rugged grandeur of the landscape was most impressive,
and the beauty of the crystal-clear water falling over huge rocks was a
picture to carry forever in one's mind. Here was an ideal spot to camp;
so we broke ranks and settled down to our first night's rest in the
region now known as Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<p>On approaching, we had noticed at regular intervals of about five or
ten minutes what seemed to be a tall column of smoke or steam, such as
would arise from a steamboat. On nearer approach, however, we discovered
it to be a geyser, which we christened "Steam Boat Geyser." Several
other geysers were found near by, some of them so hot that we boiled our
bacon in them, as well as the fine speckled trout which we caught in the
surrounding streams. One geyser, a soda spring, was so effervescent that
I believe the syrup to be the only thing lacking to make it equal a
giant ice cream soda of the kind now popular at a drugstore. We tried
some experiments with our first discovery by packing it down with
armfuls of grass; then we placed a flat stone on top of that, on which
four of us, joining hands, stood in a vain attempt to hold it down. In
spite of our efforts to curb Nature's most potent force, when the moment
of necessity came, Old Steam Boat would literally rise to the occasion
and throw us all high into the air, like so many feathers. It inspired
one with great awe for the wonderful works of the Creator to think that
this had been going on with the regularity of clockwork for thousands of
years, and the thought of our being almost the first white men to see it
did not lessen its effect. [<a href="ieee.htm#155">55</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The improbability that four men could come away unscathed from such
an attempt to throttle a major geyser, combined with the generally vague
nature of the foregoing account, justifies a suspicion that it was
created to entertain home folks, and only entered the realm of the
historical through a daughter's desire to record her father's
reminiscences. Thus, until such time as the Sublette-Stewart party s
presence so far north of the Oregon Trail route as the Yellowstone
region shall be confirmed, Kennerly's experiences there should be viewed
with skepticism.</p>

<p>Three years later, James Gemmell&#151;an old trapper known as "Uncle
Jimmy" in Montana&#151;passed through the Yellowstone region with Jim
Bridger. Olin D. Wheeler, the eminent historian of the Northern Pacific
Railway Co. and a dedicated Yellowstone buff, has recorded the visit
thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gemmell said: "In 1846 I started from Fort Bridger in company
with old Jim Bridger on a trading expedition to the Crows and Sioux. We
left in August with a large and complete outfit, went up Green River and
camped for a time near the Three Tetons, and then followed the trail
over the divide between Snake River and the streams which flow north
into Yellowstone Lake. We camped for a time near the west arm of the
lake and here Bridger proposed to show me the wonderful spouting springs
on the head of Madison. Leaving our main camp, with a small and select
party we took the trail by Snake Lake (now called Shoshone Lake) and
visited what have of late years become so famous as the Upper and Lower
Geyser Basins. There we spent a week and then returned to our camp,
whence we resumed our journey, skirted the Yellowstone Lake along its
west side, visited the Upper and Lower Falls, and the Mammoth Hot
Springs, which appeared as wonderful to us as had the geysers. Here we
camped several days to enjoy the baths and to recuperate our animals,
for we had had hard work in getting around the lake and down the river,
because of so much fallen timber which had to be removed. We then worked
our way down the Yellowstone and camped again for a few days' rest on
what is now the [Crow Indian] reservation, opposite to where Benson's
landing now is. [<a href="ieee.htm#156">56</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet another of these belated forays of trappers into the Yellowstone
region has been recorded by Captain Topping in <i>Chronicles of the
Yellowstone.</i> He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Lou Anderson, Soos, and about twenty others
on a prospecting trip, came from St. Louis, overland, to the Bannock
Indian camp on Green River, late in the fall of 1849. They fixed up
winter quarters and stayed with these Indians till spring. Then they
went up the river and as soon as the snow permitted crossed the
mountains to the Yellowstone and down it to the lake and falls; then
across the divide to the Madison river. They saw the geysers of the
lower basin and named the river that drains them the Fire Hole. Vague
reports of this wonderful country had been made before. They had not
been credited, but had been considered trapper's tales (more imagination
than fact). The report of this party made quite a stir in St. Louis, and
a party organized there the next winter to explore this country, but
from some, now unknown, cause did not start. . . . The explorers went
down the Madison till out of the mountains and then across the country
to the Yellowstone. [<a href="ieee.htm#157">57</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever stir was created by the information brought back to St.
Louis by this party, it left no lasting trace. However, those "trapper's
tales," which were discredited in their own day, have proven very
durable, and a few words about them are in order.</p>

<p>As Osborne Russell has clearly shown, storytelling was the principal
form of entertainment among the illiterate and semiliterate men of the
fur trade, [<a href="ieee.htm#158">58</a>] a proclivity which those who
knew them understood and considered no reflection upon their veracity
when speaking of serious matters. Capt. W. F. Raynolds, who was willing
enough to have Jim Bridger for his guide in unexplored country, thought
it was not at all surprising that such men "should beguile the monotony
of camp life by 'spinning yarns' in which each tried to excell all
others, and which were repeated so often and insisted upon so
strenuously that the narrators came to believe them most religiously."
[<a href="ieee.htm#159">59</a>]</p>

<p>The storytelling of Jim Bridger has been described by Capt. Eugene F.
Ware, an artillerist stationed at Fort Laramie in 1864, whose statements
have been combined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Major Bridger was a regular old Roman in actions and appearances, and
he told stories in such a solemn and firm, convincing way that a person
would be likely to believe him . . . One of the difficulties with him
was that he would occasionally tell some wonderful story to a pilgrim,
and would try to interest a new-coiner with a lot of statements which
were ludicrous, sometimes greatly exaggerated, and sometimes imaginary.
. . . He wasn't the egotistic liar that we so often find. He never in my
presence vaunted himself about his own personal actions. He never told
about how brave he was, nor how many Indians he had killed. His stories
always had reference to some outdoor matter or circumstances . . . He
had told each story so often that he had got it into language form, and
told it literally alike. He had probably told them so often that he got
to believing them himself. [<a href="ieee.htm#160">60</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>James Stevenson, who knew Jim Bridger well during the period
1859-60, thought Bridger's stories, as told by him, were uncouth.
[<a href="ieee.htm#161">61</a>]</p>

<p>Of the seven stories about the Yellowstone region attributed to Jim
Bridger, there is evidence indicating that four&#151;or tales similar to
them&#151;were a part of his repertoire, while the others appear to be
relatively recent literary accretions of the type Elbert Hubbard called
"kabojolisms" (stories attributed to a person who did <i>not</i> tell
them, in order to gain popular acceptance for them)&#151;a process best
typified as plagiarism in reverse.</p>

<p>The petrified forest story is one of the Yellowstone tales attributed
to Jim Bridger. However, it is but a re-phrasing of a story Moses
"Black" Harris put into circulation in 1823. A fellow trapper, James
Clyman, noted in his diary that autumn:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A mountaineer named Harris being in St. Louis some years after
[seeing the petrified trees] undertook to describe some of the strange
things seen in the mountains, [and] spoke of this petrified grove, in a
restaurant, where a caterer for one of the dailies was present; and the
next morning his exaggerated statement came out saying a petrified
forest was lately discovered where the tree branches, leaves and all,
were perfect, and the small birds sitting on them, with their mouths
open, singing at the time of their transformation to stone. [<a href="ieee.htm#162">62</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A quarter-century later, this story was still being told, in an
amplified form&#151;and still attributed to trapper Harris; but the
petrifactions were now located in the Black Hills and the year had been
advanced to 1833. [<a href="ieee.htm#163">63</a>] Undoubtedly, Jim
Bridger was aware of that persistent tale almost from its origin, but he
is not identified with it&#151;as a narrator&#151;until 1859. In that
and the following year he served as a guide for the Raynolds expedition
to the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, and, while in that service,
he told some of those "Munchausen tales," which Captain Raynolds thought
"altogether too good to be lost." That officer recorded a petrified
prairie story (presumably Jim's) which goes thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In many parts of the country petrifactions and fossils are very
numerous; and, as a consequence, it was claimed that in some locality (I
was not able to fix it definitely) a large tract of sage is perfectly
petrified, with all the leaves and branches in perfect condition, the
general appearance of the plain being [not] unlike that of the rest of
the country, but <i>all is stone,</i> while the rabbits, sage hens, and
other animals usually found in such localites are still there, perfectly
petrified and as natural as when they were living; and more wonderful
still, these petrified bushes bear the most wonderful
fruit&#151;diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, etc., etc., as large
as black walnuts, are found in abundance. "I tell you, sir", said one
narrator, "it is true, for I gathered a quart myself, and sent them down
the country." [<a href="ieee.htm#164">64</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the petrified forest story had, toward the end of its fourth
decade, been generalized and divested of its specifics of time and place
and was very likely a part of Bridger's repertoire. That he finally did
turn that into a stock petrified forest story based on a Yellowstone
feature seems probable from a second-hand tale told by General Nelson A.
Miles in 1897. According to him,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. . . one night after supper, a comrade who in his travels had gone
as far south as the Zuni Village, New Mexico, and had discovered the
famous petrified forest of Arizona, inquired of Bridger:</p>

<p>"Jim, were you ever down to Zuni?"</p>

<p>"No, thar ain't no beaver down thar."</p>

<p>"But Jim, there are some things in this world besides beaver. I was
down there last winter and saw great trees with limbs and bark all
turned to stone."</p>

<p>"O," returned Jim, "that's peetrifaction. Come with me to the
Yellowstone next summer, and I'll show you peetrified trees a-growing,
with peetrified birds on 'em a-singing peetrified songs." [<a href="ieee.htm#165">65</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a remark hardly justifies the additions Historian Chittenden
made to this vague oral tradition of the trapping fraternity, where he
poetically states: "Even flowers are blooming in colors of crystal, and
birds soar with wings spread in motionless flight, while the air floats
with music and perfume silicious, and the sun and the moon shine with
petrified light!" [<a href="ieee.htm#166">66</a>]</p>

<p>In a similar manner, the glass mountain story which Bridger is
credited with telling to tenderfeet along the emigrant road was altered
to fit Obsidian Cliff in present Yellowstone Park. This we have on the
authority of Superintendent Norris, who says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So with his famous legend of a lake with millions of beaver nearly
impossible to kill because of their superior cuteness; with haunts and
houses in inaccessible grottoes in the base of a glistening mountain of
glass, which every mountaineer of our party at once recognized as an
exaggeration of the artificial lake [Beaver Lake] and obsidian mountain
[Obsidian Cliff] which I this year discovered . . . . [<a href="ieee.htm#168">68</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other two authentic Bridger stories referring to the Yellowstone
region are those concerning the stream-heated-by-friction and
Hell-close-below. The former was recorded by Raynolds, [<a href="ieee.htm#169">69</a>] while we are indebted to Ware for the latter.
[<a href="ieee.htm#170">70</a>] Several other tall tales concerned with
the use of an echo as an alarm clock, the convenient suspension of
gravity, and the shrinking ability of certain waters, have no traceable
antecedents in fur trade days, and probably are of more recent
origin.</p>

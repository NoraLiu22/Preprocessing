            "articleBody": "More than 40 European leaders gathered in Prague today for the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) but much remains unclear over what this new organisation actually stands for and can achieve.\u00a0 This first meeting was held just five months after\u00a0Emmanuel Macron first pitched the community as a response to Russia's war in Ukraine and the complete geopolitical rethink it triggered across European capitals. This new format was also meant to soothe the feathers of counties in the waiting room for EU membership\u00a0that had been ruffled by Ukraine, Moldova's fast-tracked applications to join in the aftermath of Russia's invasion.\u00a0 Macron stressed the EPC was not to be an alternative to accession but rather allow for deeper cooperation with democratic countries across the continent.\u00a0 For Steven Blockmans, director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), the rapidity with which this meeting was organised suggests that it signals that there are \u0022issues here which transcend the bilateral disputes and which concern the future of the European security order.\u0022 It also shows \u0022Russia and Belarus that the rest of Europe is basically uniting in defence of that European security order,\u0022 he added. A new forum to discuss the future of the continent Most of the commentary written since  Macron's Europe Day announcement  has been fairly positive about the proposal. Both the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine have led to accusations that the EU has been too complacent about its own dependencies and about the influence of foreign actors such as Russia and China in its own backyard.\u00a0 This new organisation would therefore be a \u0022welcome addition to the international organisations and other inter-governmental conferences that exist,\u0022\u00a0Blockmans said. Most European countries already belong to one or several organisations including the EU, the NATO military alliance, the Council of Europe, which aims to uphold human rights and rule of law in its member countries, and the\u00a0Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) whose mandate includes issues such as arms control, freedom of the press, and free and fair elections. But the latter two have been ineffective at reigning in Russia. Moscow left the Council of Europe hours before a vote for its expulsion while the OSCE, whose decisions are taken on a unanimity basis,\u00a0\u0022has been hijacked for the last couple of years by Russia and its ally Belarus, in addressing issues of dispute settlement of conflict resolution,\u0022\u00a0according to Blockmans. The European Political Community or EPC, as envisioned by Macron and European Council President Charles Michel in recent speeches, would instead offer space for political and strategic discussions about the future of the continent. \u0022It really has the potential to build a new forum for strategic exchange and\u00a0policy-making on a pan-continental scale, which is very much what the geopolitical situation requires at the moment,\u0022\u00a0Daniela Schwarzer, executive director for Europe and Eurasia at Open Society Foundations, told Euronews. \u0022We know Europe didn't invest enough in its own neighbourhood for a long time,\u0022 she went on. \u0022So if this European Political Community becomes a forum and a place for policymaking, that actually shows the EU's neighbours that it's interesting to partner more closely with the EU, that will create more stability in the EU's neighbourhood.\u0022 What we know Still, little light has been shed since Macron's 9 May address on the shape and scope the political community will have going forward. One of the few things that have been released is the guest list of invited participants featuring 44 names.\u00a0 The 27 EU countries have, unsurprisingly, been invited as well as third countries currently in the various stages of EU accession \u2014\u00a0 Albania ,  Bosnia & Herzegovina ,\u00a0 Moldova , the  Republic of North Macedonia ,  Montenegro ,  Serbia ,  Turkey  and  Ukraine  \u2014 or that have aspirations of joining the bloc:  Georgia  and  Kosovo . Close EU allies  Switzerland ,  Norway , and  Iceland  also made the cut, as did former EU member  Britain  and the leaders of  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan  and the microstate  of Liechtenstein. \u00a0Finally, the presidents of the European Council and European Commission were also invited.\u00a0 The European Council, which co-organised this first meeting with the Czech Republic, said in the invitation letter that this meeting aims to provide a platform for \u0022political coordination\u0022 by putting leaders \u0022on an equal footing\u0022. This is in order to foster cooperation on areas of common interests and thus strengthen \u0022the security, stability and prosperity of Europe as a whole\u0022. Leaders started by meeting in a plenary session in the early afternoon before breaking up for roundtable discussions that covered topics including peace and security, energy and climate, the economic situation, migration and mobility. They then had the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings before reconvening for a closing plenary session held over dinner. What we don't know Pretty much everything else about the EPC is up for debate.\u00a0 The European Council has already said, for instance, that there will be no joint statement released at the end of the meeting to outline if leaders reach a consensus on the topics broached or on the future of the organisation itself.\u00a0 \u0022The best outcome of the first meeting would be, I think, to agree on a sort of minimal terms of reference under which condition they would meet again because there is a real need to redefine the EU's relationships with its neighbours in a fresh way,\u0022 Schwarzer said. How it will be structured The risk is that this meeting could be a one-hit wonder without a proper structure in place such as a secretariat that would do the\u00a0administrative work and organise the subsequent meetings.\u00a0 The EU Council is of the opinion that EPC leaders should meet twice a year. The compromise scenario would be that it is modelled on the\u00a0G20 with summits organised on a rotating basis by each participating country with the host alternating between an EU member state and a third country. How decisions will be made There is also a question of budget and whether or not there should be a common pot of money to pay for the different projects that may be undertaken or whether countries should just pitch in depending on their interests. And that leads to how decisions are made: Should they be taken as a group of more than 40 or should so-called \u0022coalitions of the willing\u0022 be allowed to proceed with their own projects? Much will also depend on the type of voting required for decisions to be taken: unanimity or qualified majority. This is currently the subject of much soul-searching in the EU where decisions on foreign policy including sanctions as well as on defence, membership, and budget require the backing of every single member state. Critics of unanimity voting say this has made the bloc slow to adapt and respond to crises and several leaders have now called for a revision of the treaties to scrap this rule. \u0022I think it shouldn't have the ambition to organise everything in groups of over 40 countries,\u0022\u00a0Schwarzer said. The criteria for inclusion But even which countries should be included and on what basis is unclear. EU candidate countries, for instance, are expected to espouse a similar line on foreign policy, especially when it comes to sanctions. Yet Serbia, which has been negotiating EU membership since 2014, has so far refused to impose any sanctions on Moscow over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For Schwarzer \u0022a commitment to the fundamental values enshrined in the EU treaties, the Charter of Human Rights, of the Council of Europe, and the participation in the sanctions policy vis a vis Russia should be a prerequisite.\u0022 Meanwhile, Blockmans argued that the list of invited participants shows that \u0022the\u00a0initial references by Macron to bring democratic nations of Europe together around the table has also been left behind otherwise, one would not see the leaders of Azerbaijan, potentially even Turkey, around the table\u0022 and that the focus of the EPC is shifting from a democratic alliance to a geopolitical alliance. \u0022And, of course, geopolitics are not necessarily defined along the lines of respect for fundamental freedoms and democracy, but rather in terms of power and the ability to exert power,\u0022 he stressed.

Blockmans, director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), the rapidity with which this meeting was organised suggests that it signals that there are "issues here which transcend the bilateral disputes and which concern the future of the European security order."</p><p>It also shows "Russia and Belarus that the rest of Europe is basically uniting in defence of that

too complacent about its own dependencies and about the influence of foreign actors such as Russia and China in its own backyard.&nbsp;</p><p>This new organisation would therefore be a "welcome addition to the international organisations and other inter-governmental conferences that exist,"&nbsp;Blockmans said.</p><p>Most European countries already belong to one or several organisations including the EU, the NATO military alliance, the Council of Europe, which aims to uphold human rights and rule of law in its member countries, and the&nbsp;Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) whose mandate includes issues such as arms control, freedom of the press, and free and fair elections.</p><p>But the latter two have been ineffective at reigning in Russia.</p><p>Moscow left the Council of Europe hours before a vote for its expulsion while the OSCE, whose decisions are taken on a unanimity basis,&nbsp;"has been hijacked for the last couple of years by Russia and its ally Belarus, in addressing issues of dispute settlement of conflict resolution,"&nbsp;according to Blockmans.</p><div class="ads small-12 column text-center

would instead offer space for political and strategic discussions about the future of the continent.</p><p>"It really has the potential to build a new forum for strategic exchange and&nbsp;policy-making on a pan-continental scale, which is very much what the geopolitical situation requires at the moment,"&nbsp;Daniela Schwarzer, executive director for Europe and Eurasia at Open Society Foundations, told Euronews.</p><p>"We know Europe didn't invest enough in its own neighbourhood for a long time," she went on. "So if this European Political Community becomes a forum and a place for policymaking, that actually shows the EU's neighbours that it's interesting to partner more closely with the EU, that will create more stability in the EU's neighbourhood."</p><h2>What we know</h2><p>Still, little light has been shed since Macron's 9 May address on the shape and scope the political community will have going forward.</p><p>One of the few things that have been released is the guest list of invited participants featuring 44 names.&nbsp;</p><div class="ads small-12 column text-center show-for-small-only u-show-for-small-only"><div class="enw-MPU "><div data-ad-name="adzone-mpu" data-ad-index="3" class="enw-MPU__img advertising js-adzone"></div></div></div><p>The 27 EU countries have, unsurprisingly, been invited as well as third countries currently in the various stages of EU accession &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>Albania</strong>, <strong>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Moldova</strong>, the <strong>Republic of North Macedonia</strong>, <strong>Montenegro</strong>, <strong>Serbia</strong>, <strong>Turkey</strong> and <strong>Ukraine</strong> &mdash; or that have aspirations of joining the bloc: <strong>Georgia</strong> and <strong>Kosovo</strong>.</p><p>Close EU allies <strong>Switzerland</strong>, <strong>Norway</strong>, and <strong>Iceland</strong> also made the cut, as did former EU member <strong>Britain</strong> and the leaders of <strong>Armenia</strong> and <strong>Azerbaijan</strong> and the microstate <strong>of Liechtenstein.</strong>&nbsp;Finally, the presidents of the European Council and European Commission were also invited.&nbsp;</p><p>The European Council, which co-organised this first meeting with the Czech Republic, said in the invitation letter that this meeting aims to provide a platform for "political coordination" by putting leaders "on an equal footing".</p><p>This is in order to foster cooperation on areas of common interests and thus strengthen "the security, stability and prosperity of Europe as a whole".</p><p>Leaders started by meeting in a plenary session in the early afternoon before breaking up for roundtable discussions that covered topics including peace and security, energy and climate, the economic situation, migration and mobility.</p><div class="ads small-12 column text-center show-for-small-only u-show-for-small-only"><div class="enw-MPU "><div data-ad-name="adzone-mpu" data-ad-index="4" class="enw-MPU__img advertising js-adzone"></div></div></div><p>They then had the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings before reconvening for a closing plenary session held over dinner.</p><h2>What we don't know</h2><p>Pretty much everything else about the EPC is up for debate.&nbsp;</p><p>The European Council has already said, for instance, that there will be no joint statement released at the end of the meeting to outline if leaders reach a consensus on the topics broached or on the future of the organisation itself.&nbsp;</p><p>"The best outcome of the first meeting would be, I think, to agree on a sort of minimal terms of reference under which condition they would meet again because there is a real need to redefine the EU's relationships with its neighbours in a fresh way," Schwarzer said.</p><h3>How it will be structured</h3><p>The risk is that this meeting could be a one-hit wonder without a proper structure in place such as a secretariat that would do the&nbsp;administrative work and organise the subsequent meetings.&nbsp;</p><p>The EU Council is of the opinion that EPC leaders should meet twice a year. The compromise scenario would be that it is modelled on the&nbsp;G20 with summits organised on a rotating basis by each participating country with the host alternating between an EU member state and a third country.</p><div data-stories-id="6692134,6130026" data-event="widget_related" class="widget widget--type-related widget--size-fullwidth widget--align-center"><div class="widget__wrapper"><div class="widget__ratio widget__ratio--auto"><div class="widget__contents"><ul class="widget__related_list"><li class="widget__related_listItem"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221018060311/https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/05/11/what-do-we-know-about-macron-s-idea-for-a-two-tier-europe">What do we know about Macron's idea for a two-tier Europe?</a></li><li class="widget__related_listItem"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221018060311/https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2021/10/06/eu-commits-9-billion-to-western-balkans-but-political-divisions-over-enlargement-persist">EU commits &euro;9 billion to Western Balkans but political divisions over enlargement persist</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><h3>How decisions will be made</h3><p>There is also a question of budget and whether or not there should be a common pot of money to pay for the different projects that may be undertaken or whether countries should just pitch in depending on their interests.</p><p>And that leads to how decisions are made: Should they be taken as a group of more than 40 or should so-called "coalitions of the willing" be allowed to proceed with their own projects?</p><p>Much will also depend on the type of voting required for decisions to be taken: unanimity or qualified majority.</p><p>This is currently the subject of much soul-searching in the EU where decisions on foreign policy including sanctions as well as on defence, membership, and budget require the backing of every single member state. Critics of unanimity voting say this has made the bloc slow to adapt and respond to crises and several leaders have now called for a revision of the treaties to scrap this rule.</p><p>"I think it shouldn't have the ambition to organise everything in groups of over 40 countries,"&nbsp;Schwarzer said.</p><h3>The criteria for inclusion</h3><p>But even which countries should be included and on what basis is unclear.</p><p>EU candidate countries, for instance, are expected to espouse a similar line on foreign policy, especially when it comes to sanctions. Yet Serbia, which has been negotiating EU membership since 2014, has so far refused to impose any sanctions on Moscow over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>For Schwarzer "a commitment to the fundamental values enshrined in the EU treaties, the Charter of Human Rights, of the Council of Europe, and the participation in the sanctions policy vis a vis Russia should be a prerequisite."</p><p>Meanwhile, Blockmans argued that the list of invited participants shows that "the&nbsp;initial references by Macron to bring democratic nations of Europe together around the table has also been left behind otherwise, one would not see the leaders of Azerbaijan, potentially even Turkey, around the table" and that the focus of the EPC is shifting from a democratic alliance to a geopolitical alliance.</p><p>"And, of course, geopolitics are not necessarily defined along the lines of respect for fundamental freedoms and democracy, but rather in terms of power and the ability to exert power," he stressed.</p></div></div></section><footer><section class="c-article-footer__section u-show-for-small-only js-footer-social-widget u-margin-top-4 u-padding-top-5"><div

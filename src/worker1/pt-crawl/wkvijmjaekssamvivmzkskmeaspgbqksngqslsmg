This Privacy Policy applies to our collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).

For example, in order to permit your connection to the Outkick Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Outkick Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.</p><p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Outkick&apos;s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Outkick Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.</p><p>Other parties that support the Outkick Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Outkick Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Outkick Services or other parties&#x2019; services. Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Outkick does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled &quot;To deliver relevant advertisements,&quot; below.</p><p>Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the &quot;Help&quot; section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser. For more information about Google Analytics, please review the site &quot;How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services,&quot; located at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.

Other Important Information&#xA0;</strong></br></br></p><p><strong>Updates to Privacy Policy.</strong>&#xA0;Outkick may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Outkick Services.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Location of Data. </strong>The Outkick Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. The United States and other countries&#x2019; data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.</p><p><strong>Linked Services.</strong> The Outkick Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. Outkick is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Outkick Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service. In addition, Outkick is not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of other organizations, such as Meta, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in connection with any information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Outkick Services.</p><p><strong>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.</strong> In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (&quot;Payment Service&quot;). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service&apos;s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service&apos;s use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p><p>If you subscribe to a VIP membership or otherwise make payments, we and/or Payment Service provider(s) may use payment information to help provide the Outkick Services. For example, payment information may be used to retrieve account information for a subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and to detect abuse of the Outkick services.</p><p><strong>Data Retention.</strong>&#xA0;We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</p><p>Remember that even after you cancel your VIP membership, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements.</p><p><strong>Deidentified Information</strong>. To the extent we process &quot;deidentified&quot; personal information, as defined under applicable law, we will maintain and use that information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information except as permitted by applicable law.<br><a name="contact-us" id="undefined"/><br><strong>7.

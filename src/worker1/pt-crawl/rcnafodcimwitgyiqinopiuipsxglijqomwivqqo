         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">POPULISM
         and railroads have historically been depicted as mortal
         enemies. Ever since the Populist party became a significant
         political force in the early 1890's, party members and
         railroaders have been portrayed as major antagonists in
         America's Gilded Age. On one side stood the railroads, often
         pictured as big business, establishment, Republican, and
         conservative. Against this hydra-like transportation
         monopoly stood the Populists, usually shown as liberal,
         reformist, and heroically trying to harness and control the
         railroads in the interest of all the people.</font>

         was this conflict between Populist and railroader more
         pronounced than in Kansas during the 1890's. Throughout the
         decade, party political platforms in the state mirrored the
         frustrations felt by the High Plains farmer and businessman
         toward the rail corporations. As early as the August, 1890,
         party convention in Topeka, Kansas Populists demanded the
         government become the exclusive owner and operator of the
         railroads. &#91;</font><a href="#Note1"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">1</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;
         During both the disastrous campaign of 1894 and the great
         victory of 1896, Populist candidates in Kansas ran on
         platforms calling for maximum freight rate laws for the
         state. &#91;</font><a href="#Note2"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">2</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;
         Even as the party approached its nadir in 1900, the
         Populists outlined problems and declared the people could ".
         . . look for no permanent relief except in government
         ownership of railroads. &#91;</font><a href="#Note3"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">3</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font>
         
         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
         is not difficult to understand the antagonism between the
         Populists and the railroads in Kansas and the other states
         of the Western Plains. Their major complaint concerned
         freight rates. Kansas Populists claimed the rail rates
         farmers and shippers had to pay remained excessively high.
         The railroads countered by saying anything less would be
         unprofitable. Actually, a degree of truth can be found on
         both sides of the argument.</font>
         
         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
         farmer and shipper in Kansas and nearby states were in fact
         paying a freight rate definitely higher than the national
         average. As shown in Table 1, this condition remained
         throughout Populism's formative years from 1890 to
         1895.</font></p>

         had only to look eastward to see that freight rates in New
         York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio ran only about two thirds of
         what they did on the Plains. This situation helped breed the
         discontent Populism hoped to counter through railroad
         reform. It must be pointed out, however, that the highest
         rates were not in and around Kansas; rather, they could be
         found higher yet along the West Coast, in Texas, and along
         the Northern Rockies. &#91;</font><a href="#Note4"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">4</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;

         traffic density in turn meant a higher rate of fixed costs
         and overhead. Only by charging a higher rate for rail
         services could Western railroads expect to make a profit or
         even make expenses. The advantage in traffic density as well
         as in freight rates lay with the Eastern roads. Although
         less than in the East, density was similar across the entire
         western half of the country, and no state or region had a

         traffic density. On the other hand, the highest rates were
         not found in Kansas; farmers and shippers in several other
         western areas experienced even higher transportation costs.
         Nevertheless, rates remained sufficiently high and density

         their annual report for 1890, the Board of Railroad
         Commissioners appeared generally satisfied with the railroad
         situation in Kansas. They reported that in recent years
         service had increased while the percent of earnings was
         down, thus implying increased railroad efficiency to the
         benefit of the customer. The board also announced the total
         number of railroad miles in Kansas had grown to 8,891, one
         of the highest state totals in the nation. They confidently
         reported: "All the principal lines of the railroad in the
         State are in good condition, physically, and service thereon
         is first class in every respect." But the railroad
         commissioners did give some hint of future problems as they
         recognized the farmers' battle against drought and poor crop
         yields. This, in turn, was beginning to affect railroad
         business adversely, particularly in the western portion of
         the state. They quickly added, however, that even with crop
         troubles, ". . . the financial showing of the
         &#91;railroad&#93; properties is far from discouraging."

         was also harmony between the Republican controlled state
         government and the railroads. In Kansas around 1890,
         cooperation and mutual support prevailed between state
         officials and rail executives. The state might regulate the
         railroads, but powerful railroad influence in Topeka insured
         the legislators maintained

         railroaders expressed their feelings in May, 1888, by
         stating:</font></p>

<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">. . . the relations between the people of Kansas and their railways appear to be on the whole very harmonious and satisfactory, each appreciating how closely its interests are identified with those of the other. [<a href="#Note8">8</a>]</font>

         times, though, the railroads disagreed with the policies of
         state government, even when the Republicans were still
         solidly in office. One occasion took place when the railroad
         board required a rail company to furnish coal cars to a
         shipper previously denied this transportation. The
         <i>Railway Age </i>voiced strong opposition in that the
         railroad concerned would suffer a monetary loss in complying
         with the directive of the board. The railroaders felt this
         beyond what a railroad should be expected to provide.

         men and the <i>Railway Age</i> reserved their loudest
         denunciations for the Farmers Alliance and the People's
         party that followed the alliance. Railroaders voiced disgust
         when the alliance in Kansas began to store farm products
         hoping for better market prices. This was nothing more than
         the farmers forming grain pools after declaring pools by
         other industries amounted to robbery. Since people must eat,
         the rail leaders felt these grain pools were of great
         concern not only to the railroads but to the general public
         as well. &#91;</font><a href="#Note10"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">10</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font>

         also rebuked the Farmers Alliance for crying financial ruin
         and advocating railroad confiscation when crop yields were
         plentiful. The <i>Railway Age</i> editorialized:</font>
         
         <blockquote><font size="-1" face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=Ref11></a></font><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">While
            Kansas Farmers' Alliance demagogues are crying that the
            farmers are ruined by the railways and are clamoring for
            the practical confiscation of the roads and for the issue
            of unlimited amounts of "flat" money there is good
            prospect that this year's yield of corn in that state
            will aggregate 250,000,000 bushels and that of wheat not
            less than 65,000,000 bushels, beside which there will be
            vast sums received from live stock and other productions.

         Populists organized as a political party and as such tried
         to reach their railroad reform goals primarily through the
         medium of the American political system. They sought to name
         win candidates, win elections, and appoint party advocates

         greatest Populist effort in Kansas took place in the
         legislature. Here the party became a major force throughout
         the 1890's, holding a majority in the senate during four
         sessions and twice in the house of representatives. In each
         legislative session throughout the decade the Populist
         reformers introduced bills designed to place new
         restrictions on intrastate rail operations, primarily in the
         form of maximum freight rates.</font>

         Republicans, however, frequently succeeded in thwarting
         major Populist reforms by maintaining control of the second
         legislative house. So in 1891 when the Populists passed
         House Bill 743 to broaden the power of the railroad
         commission and to prohibit free transportation passes,

         senate Republicans buried the legislation in committee. The
         committee on railroads advised the senate that the house
         bill in the long run would increase short haul rates, hurt
         railroad business, and result in "... and almost limitless
         field of legal and business absurdities."
         &#91;</font><a href="#Note13"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">13</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;
         In 1893 Republicans dragged their feet through the famous
         legislative war, and then refused to consider a Populist
         sponsored bill, stating insufficient time remained until the
         session ended. &#91;</font><a href="#Note14"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">14</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;
         Two years later, the Populist-controlled senate passed
         several bills aimed mainly at increased railroad commission
         responsibilities and maximum freight rates. But again the
         senate bills died in the Republican house when its committee
         on railroads recommended the legislation not be passed.

         had every reason for concern. In his opening message to the
         1897 legislature, Governor Leedy, a staunch railroad fighter
         for many years, encouraged the house and senate to enact
         both a maximum freight rate law and a law to strengthen the

         legislative session of 1897 offered a change from the old
         dissension and controversy that pitted Populist against
         Republican. This time it became Populist against Populist,
         particularly in the senate where two factions emerged. One
         backed Governor Leedy and proposed to enact the freight rate
         law he recommended. The second favored placing all the rate
         making responsibility in the hands of a more powerful
         commission. Both groups drafted legislation.

         the end a compromise had to be worked out if anything was to
         be accomplished. The result was a weakened bill whereby
         freight rates by the railroad commissioners won out over
         freight rates by law. The bill finally passed by a
         surprising vote of 44 to 0 and went to the house.

         though there was a strong desire in the house for a maximum
         rate law, the bill, without that provision, passed the house
         by an equally surprising 121 to 1 vote. The near unanimous
         vote, however, is misleading. Although voting in the
         affirmative, 44 house members filed a protest stating the
         bill as passed was not</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">what
         they promised the people. Interestingly, the protestors

         Leedy, however, did not sign the bill; instead, he vetoed
         it. In his veto message he outlined six reasons for his
         surprising action. The basic thrust of his explanation was
         the law</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">failed
         to help the shipper in any way or provide the railroad
         commission with sufficient power. Under the bill, he
         declared the commission would be "utterly impotent."

         recent author has expressed it more strongly, stating the
         real reason behind the veto was simply that Governor Leedy
         wanted a maximum freight rate schedule as part of the bill.
         When he failed to get it, he vetoed the legislation rather
         than accept less or attempt a compromise with the

         failed to</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">obtain
         the necessary two-thirds majority. For the fourth straight
         time the legislature had adjourned without enacting Populist
         railroad legislation. Only this time it was much worse
         because they could not put the blame on the opposition
         Republicans. Previously, the Populists controlled only one
         house in the legislature; but in 1897, they had all the
         legislative reins, the statehouse, senate, and house of
         representatives. And they still failed.</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">The

         final Populist attempt to harness the railroads, and
         certainly the most dramatic, concerned the Court of
         Visitation. When the Republicans registered a stunning
         victory in the November, 1898, elections, Governor Leedy
         faced the proposition of leaving</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">office
         without any new Populist railroad legislation. In less than
         two months Republicans would control both the statehouse and

         would the Populist party retain a majority. The situation

         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=Ref23></a>Governor
         Leedy elected to call a special session of the legislature
         for the express purpose of enacting a new railroad law. In
         his opening message, the governor stated that times had
         changed since his previous veto. A bill establishing maximum
         rates actually set by the legislature was now ruled out, he
         said, by a United States supreme court decision. Instead, he
         recommended legislation that would give the railroad
         commissioners broad new responsibilities and "... full
         judicial power to try, hear and determine all questions as
         to the reasonableness and unreasonableness of every charge
         made by a railroad company for services rendered wholly
         within this state in the transportation of property ...."

         the legislature created an entirely new body to handle
         railroad matters, the Court of Visitation. The new law gave
         this court not only the administrative responsibilities
         performed previously by the railroad commission but also
         significant judicial functions as well. Its major powers
         included determining reasonable intrastate freight rates,
         ruling on certain strike situations, and trying court cases
         dealing with rail transportation. It could summon juries,
         classify freight, regulate rail crossings, and apportion
         charges among connecting railroads. &#91;</font><a href="#Note24"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">24</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font>

         transition had been made. Finally, after so many years and
         after so many attempts, the Populists had managed to get a

         signed by the governor. The Populist administration left
         office, however, fully realizing that the court they
         established would have to face a hostile Republican

         expected, the new Republican administration disliked the new

         the calling of the special session and the railroad law it
         produced. He</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">asked,

         Stanley's advice made political sense, for the Republicans

         obstacle to any Republican ideas about repeal. A direct

         future.</font>

         the Republicans could not accomplish through the
         legislature, they succeeded in bringing about in the courts.
         In February, 1900, a case reached the Kansas supreme court
         involving the Santa Fe and a cattle shipper. The Santa Fe
         had made an attempt to base fees on cargo weight rather than
         charge a flat rate per car, a procedure which the now
         defunct railroad commission had successfully blocked
         earlier. Shippers argued that fees based on weight raised
         the price to an unreasonable level. The supreme court
         disagreed. The court with its Republican majority ruled in
         favor of the Santa Fe and, even more significantly, struck
         down the Court of Visitation as unconstitutional. The
         supreme court stated that no organization may possess powers
         associated with</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">all
         three governmental ranches. In rendering its decision, it
         declared the Court of Visitation</font>
         
         <blockquote align=left><a name=Ref28></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">.
            . . is unconstitutional and void, for the reason that, in
            the powers conferred upon that tribunal, legislative,
            judicial and administrative functions are commingled and
            interwoven in a manner violative of the constitutional
            requirement that the three great departments of
            government be kept separate, and the powers and duties of
            each exercised independently of the others.

         its last significant endeavor in the arena of railroad
         reform, Kansas Populism, in the person of Chief Justice
         Frank Doster, refused to concur in the demise of the Court
         of Visitation. Doster, the lone Populist of the three-member
         supreme court, dissented when the court rendered its
         decision. The chief justice, ever the disciple of the

         With its ruling, the Kansas supreme court destroyed any
         opportunity the Court of Visitation may have had to
         implement strong railroad controls. Never would the Court of
         Visitation carry out the desires of the Populist legislators
         who had created it. Instead, Kansas was left with no
         executive agency whatsoever to supervise railroad activities
         in the state. The legislature disbanded the Board of
         Railroad Commissioners, the supreme court ended the Court of
         Visitation, the legislature was not in session to form a new
         agency. It would be almost a year before any state control
         over the railroads would be again instituted, and this would
         be accomplished by Republican initiative, not
         Populist.</font></p>

         the 1890's, railroaders criticized their treatment in
         Kansas. They fiercely opposed Populist activities in state
         government, and did not hesitate to voice stern opposition
         when the state acted contrary to rail interests. The
         <i>Railway Age </i>remained a major spokesman during the
         decade. The wrath of the railroaders became particularly
         strong when the Populist administration increased the
         railroads' tax assessment in 1893. The editors of the
         <i>Railway Age</i> expressed their disgust in the following
         editorial:</font>
         
         <blockquote align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=Ref30></a>The
            populist government of Kansas has adopted the easy way of
            cutting down the farmer's taxes by increasing the
            assessment upon the railways. The total valuation of
            railway property this year is $61,731,035, an increase of
            $10,326,491, or over 20 per cent, and the Atchison,
            Topeka &amp; Santa Fe is raised from $16,462,309 to
            $20,726,718, an increase of $4,265,408, or over 25 per
            cent. The Kansas populists have ruined the credit of
            their state in the eastern money markets, and seem
            determined to prey upon eastern investors in railways as
            long as any blood is left. &#91;</font><a href="#Note30"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">30</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font></blockquote>

         men hammered at the theme that it was difficult to make a

         As the Populists assumed control of the state government and
         the legislature in January, 1897, E. P. Ripley, president of
         the Santa Fe, obviously become concerned over the
         possibility of railroad reform legislation. Therefore, he
         wrote a letter to the Kansas legislature outlining the
         situation and position of his company. He began:</font>
         
         <blockquote align=left><font size="-1" face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">Continuing,
         Ripley recognized overexpansion as the basic cause of much
         of the friction between shipper and railroad, and outlined
         the effect on his company. He wrote further:</font>
         
         <blockquote align=left><font size="-1" face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">In

            itself to expand too greatly; it built railroads as the
            citizens built towns -- in the belief they could be
            sustained. That belief proved to be fallacious, and as a
            consequence the A. T. &amp; S. F. company has upon its
            hands some 2,500 miles of road in Kansas, much of which
            does not pay expenses, and nearly half of which

         Ripley also explained to the legislature that his company
         was not paying an adequate dividend on its stock, the rates
         in Kansas were as low as could be expected, and the small
         population and arid weather meant "... fully a third of
         Kansas contributes practically noting to support of its
         railroads." He felt that service had improved on the Santa
         Fe while rates had declined over the past several years.
         Therefore, he asked the legislature not to impose additional

         months later, the railroads in Kansas united in opposing the
         Board of Railroad Commissioners when the board proposed an
         across-the-board rate reduction in May, 1897. President
         Ripley responded personally to the commissioners for the
         Santa Fe. He wrote that he regretted he could not comply
         with their desires but it was impossible to decrease the
         rates in Kansas. He repeated the theme that rates there were
         no higher than in surrounding states, yet the population in
         the state was insufficient in many areas to support the
         railroads adequately. Without additional operating income,
         it was absolutely necessary that the Santa Fe retain the
         rates in effect. &#91;</font><a href="#Note34"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">34</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;
         Other Kansas railroads replied in a similar vein. The Rock
         Island road executives stated they could not lower the
         freight tariff and still meet tax obligations.
         &#91;</font><a href="#Note35"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">35</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;
         The Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas officials argued the
         proposed reduction " ...would prove disastrous and make it
         impossible for the railroads to furnish the people of the
         state adequate and safe transportation facilities."
         &#91;</font><a href="#Note36"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">36</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;
         Therefore, these railroads would not comply voluntarily,
         either. The railroads in Kansas received support from their
         colleagues outside the state. In expressing the view of the
         railroaders, the<i> Railway Age </i>editorialized:</font>

            fall that Kansas proposes to make it very unpleasant for
            the railroads. The legislature in its wrath overshot its
            mark, and it appears that the railroad commission is
            doing the same thing. There is no room for any rate
            reductions on a general scale in Kansas now; and such
            reductions as are proposed are simply an irrational

         railroads became particularly wary of the danger represented
         by Governor Leedy, the strong advocate of strict railroad
         control, coupled with the Populist dominated legislature. In
         reporting the failure of the 1897 railroad bill, the
         <i>Railway Age </i>commented: "Legislative process, from the
         populist point of view, is simply a machine for stinging,
         injuring, poisoning...." At the same time, the railroads
         recognized the potential hazard should Governor Leedy call a
         special legislative session. The <i>Railway Age
         </i>continued: "Meanwhile there is talk in Kansas of an
         extra session of the legislature being called to pass a new
         railroad bill-one with stings and fangs and poison enough to
         suit the most bloodthirsty." &#91;</font><a href="#Note38"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">38</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;.
         Once Governor Leedy announced the special session, the
         <i>Railway Age</i> voiced strong opposition. But it was
         inevitable that the legislature would convene again before
         the Populists lost their majority. The <i>Railway Age
         </i>expressed the feelings of the railroads thusly: "At all
         events let us hope that a sufficient degree of reason will
         prevail during the coming session to enable Kansas to escape
         any further infliction at the hands of its irresponsible
         legislature." &#91;</font><a href="#Note39"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">39</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font>

         might be expected, railroad men rejoiced over the defeat of
         Governor Leedy and the Populists in November, 1898. The
         <i>Railway Age </i>expressed confidence in the new
         Republican administration of Governor Stanley and noted his
         opening address and " ...a touch of fairness toward railways
         and other corporations which has not characterized the
         legislative halls for many years...." Railroaders in Kansas
         entered the new century optimistic over no more Populist
         attempts at reform in the legislature and predicting
         cooperation between the people of Kansas and the railroads
         serving the state. &#91;</font><a href="#Note40"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">40</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font></p>

         conflict between Kansas Populist and railroader had
         continued in earnest throughout the 1890's. The reformer
         complained bitterly about his treatment at the hands of the
         railroads, and retaliated by attempting to force stringent
         controls on rail operations in the state. The railroads, in
         turn, painted a picture of financial ruin at the hands of
         Populism. Railroaders continued to bemoan how difficult it
         was to make any profit on the rail lines in Kansas. In spite
         of the cries of anguish, most rail lines in</font>
         <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">Kansas
         continued to report an income on their passenger an
         operations throughout the Populist era. With this in mind, a
         yearly comparison of income over an entire rail line with
         income derived in Kansas should suggest the extent of
         internal Kansas influences upon the railroads. Kansas' own
         Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe offers an excellent example.
         As the state's largest rail operator, the AT&amp;SF usually
         maintained a yearly income in Kansas of over two million
         dollars. Of the major railroads in the state, the Santa Fe
         also had the largest percentage of its operation located in
         Kansas. As shown in Table 3, income from Kansas operations
         amounted to almost half of the total income of the
         line.</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">The
         table also suggests that the AT&amp;SF profit derived from
         its Kansas lines remained relatively stable during the
         1890's about 45 percent of the total. We may attribute the
         dip in mid-decade to</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">the

         any misfortune Populism may have inflicted on the Kansas
         railroads in the 1890's remained minimal, rail executives
         never lost sight of Populism's potential danger. During the
         decade, the railroads followed a policy of no new
         construction in the state. The Populists' desire to
         eliminate the railroads as a private enterprise undoubtedly
         influenced this policy. Finally, in 1899 as Populism waned
         in Kansas, the <i>Railway Age</i> reported the laying of
         nine miles of new track. The editors found this noteworthy
         since construction in Kansas had practically ceased under
         Populism. They summarized the previous 15 years as
         follows:</font>
         
         <blockquote align=left><font size="-1" face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=Ref41></a></font><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">It
            is undoubtedly true that railway building in Kansas was
            overdone during the boom period of 1886 and 1887, but had
            it not been for the hostile attitude of the Populists and
            oppressive legislation the State would have continued to
            develop her vast agricultural resources, and with liberal
            treatment and helpful legislation much of the new milage,
            instead of being a burden to the railway companies, might
            have developed into paying property. As it is more road
            has been abandoned since 1890 in Kansas than has been
            constructed in the same period. &#91;</font><a href="#Note41"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">41</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font></blockquote>
         
         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
         gain an accurate perspective of railroad opposition, one
         must consider two contrasting facts. First, much of the
         opposition voiced by the railroads consisted of what we
         would term today as</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">"'propaganda."
         Strongly prorailroad, it attempted to win favor for railroad
         management. As such, it is logical to view these actions as
         tending to overstate or overemphasize the true railroad
         feeling. Conversely, in spite of the name "Gay Nineties,"
         the last decade of the 19th century was a period of
         uncertainty in Kansas. Railroad receipts dropped with poor
         crop yields on the Plains and</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">a
         nationwide depression. The Populist threat, then, hit the
         railroads at the very time their economic position was
         anything but favorable. In this light, one must view a major
         portion of the fears expressed by the railroads as
         genuine.</font>
         
         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=Ref42></a>Interestingly,
         the first decade of the 20th century saw unprecedented
         railroad legislation in Kansas. This came not at the
         hands</font> <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">of
         the Populists who by this time were no longer effective
         political force, but from the Republicans. Many of the
         reforms advocated by the Populists earlier became reality
         between 1900 and 1910 -- maximum freight and passenger rate
         laws,, fiscal controls, new railroad safety regulations, and
         restrictions on free passes. All this helped cause Mrs. Mary
         Elizabeth Lease, grand lady of Kansas Populism and an arch
         railroad foe, to in remark in 1914: "In these later years I
         have seen, with gratification, that my work in Kansas in the
         good old Populist days was not in vain .... The seed we
         sowed out in Kansas did not fall on barren ground."
         &#91;</font><a href="#Note42"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">42</font></a><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&#93;</font>
         
         <p align=left><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
         their direct assaults on the railroads failed during the
         1890's, the Populists did contribute indirectly to bringing
         about much of the railroad control they advocated. In both
         the legislature and on the campaign trail throughout the
         state, the Populists told the story of railroad abuse,
         corruption, and discrimination. Consequently, when a more
         favorable time for railroad reform arrived a decade later,
         Kansans gave their support to controls earlier considered
         radical. The result was maximum freight laws and and other
         regulations that in the end placed more restrictions on the
         railroads than at any time previously and gave former
         Populists the feeling their efforts had been
         successful.</font></p>

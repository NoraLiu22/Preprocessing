For example, in neighbouring French Somaliland, Somalis there had their own French Overseas Territories citizenship; in Ethiopia, beyond the Haud and Reserved Areas inhabited by British Somaliland protected persons, other Somalis would have been considered as being Ethiopian citizens; and in Somalia, the last law that dealt with their citizenship was the <B>Somalia Citizenship Law</B> - <A HREF="./Citizenship_Law_Somalia_IT_Feb_1960.pdf"><B><I>Cittadinanaza Somala</I></B></A> (Law No. 9 of 12 February 1960) {in Italian}.</SPAN></P>

These were&nbsp; Bechuanaland (now Botswana), Gambia, Kenya , Nigeria, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Northern Territories of the Gold Coast (now part of Ghana), Nayasaland (now Malawi), Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Uganda, Tanganyika Territories (now Tanzania), Cameroons under British Mandate (now part of Cameroons), Togoland under British Mandate (Now Togo). With independence on 26 June 1960, Somaliland became a fully-fledged state under international law and its people acquired Somaliland nationality under the Law set out above. </SPAN></SPAN></P>

Yet a few years later, the Somali Government, according to UNCHR, was recruiting or forcibly conscripting the same refugees in Northern Somalia (Somaliland) into the army on the basis that they were Somali citizens so that they can assist in the suppression and war against the Somaliland population that hosted them as refugees.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

Although citizenship is essentially governed by national legislation, the competence of states in this field may be exercised only within the limits set by international law. This is often said to be the difference between the terms &#8220;citizenship&#8221; and &#8220;nationality&#8221;, the latter importing the international context.&nbsp;Indeed as far back as 1930, Article 1 of The Hague Convention of 1930 on Certain Questions relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws provided that whilst it is for each State to determine under its own law who are its nationals, such law shall be recognized by other States only &quot;insofar as it is consistent with international conventions, international custom and the principles of law generally recognized with regard to nationality&quot;. The footnotes below therefore take note of the international law in this area, and in the <B><U>postcript</U></B>, below, the vexing issue of how succession of states affects nationality and its relevance to this law, specially in the light of the International Law Commission&#8217;s&nbsp;&#8220;<I>Draft Articles on Nationality of Natural persons In Relation to the Succession of States</I>&#8221; and the relevant clauses in the European Convention on Nationality (which take into consideration legal developments in the new East European States) are addressed.</SPAN></P>

States are free to determine under their own laws who their citizens are, but because the concept of nationality has an international flavour, international customary law and conventions have a considerable bearing on the formulation and interpretation of citizenship laws.&nbsp; Ever since the Hague Convention on certain questions relating to the conflict of nationality laws was concluded in 1930, the number of international instruments containing provisions on nationality has grown considerably, and has been affected further by the development of human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important other agreements include the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, the 1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons, the 1957 Convention on the Nationality of Married Women, the 1961 Convention on the reduction of statelessness, the Optional Protocols concerning Acquisition of Nationality to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the 1964 Convention of the International Commission on Civil Status on the exchange of information concerning acquisition of nationality, the 1966 International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 1967 European Convention on the Adoption of Children, the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights, the 1973 Convention of the International Commission of Civil Status to reduce the number of cases of statelessness, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Almost all the muslim countries which ratified the Convention have lodged reservations to article 9 of the Convention (see note 6 above).&nbsp; The Somali Republic did not accede to the Convention and, of course,&nbsp; neither has the Republic of Somaliland.&nbsp; Article 8 of the Constitution of Somaliland affirms equality of citizens, but this has to be read with Article 36 which expressly states that &#8220;t<I>he rights, freedoms and duties laid down in the Constitution shall be enjoyed equally by men and women save for matters which are specifically ordained in Islamic Sharia</I>&#8221;.&nbsp; The interplay between tradition, Sharia and citizenship is an issue of contention in countries like Egypt. Interestingly Egypt&#8217;s reservation to Article 9 of the CEDAW is said to be needed &#8220;&#8230; <I>in order to prevent a child&#39;s acquisition of two nationalities where his parents are of different nationalities, since this may be prejudicial to his future. It is clear that the child&#39;s acquisition of his father&#39;s nationality is the procedure most suitable for the child and that this does not infringe upon the principle of equality between men and women, since it is customary for a woman to agree, upon marrying an alien, that her children shall be of the father&#39;s nationality</I>&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The other potential difficulty in this Clause is that it leaves unclear the position of adult grandchildren of a male&nbsp; Somaliland citizen residing abroad. Clearly they are entitled to citizenship by birth under Clause 1 of this Article, and it is arguable that as their fathers were also Somaliland Citizens, then they could also be covered by the procedure in this Clause (3) which allows them to claim citizenship on their first return.&nbsp; If that is the case, then this Clause is simply procedural in its effect. But if that is not correct, then they have to await the return of their father to Somaliland, before they, in turn, return and exercise their right to citizenship.&nbsp; The latter may be in line with the practice of some countries, which set up some form of a &#8220;take-up&#8221; procedure for descendants of citizens who habitually live abroad so as to avoid automatic retention of nationality by new generations who have no longer any links with their forefather&#8217;s country.</SPAN></P>

Interestingly, in this respect, the 1960 Somaliland Nationality and Citizenship Law stated that loss of citizenship arose &#8220;If a woman, upon marriage to a person who at the time of such marriage posses the nationality or citizenship of a foreign state provided that she acquires her husband&#8217;s nationality or citizenship by operation of the law of that State.&#8221; </SPAN></P>

It was then re-asserted, in May 1991 at the Grand Conference of the Somaliland Communities held at Burao, by the re-birth of the same state, which has the same international borders and indigenous population. The Somaliland population (like that of the former Italian Somalia) is uniquely identifiable through the Somaliland clan system, and despite the existence of the union for some 30 years, this clan structure of the population remained the same and was indeed targeted for oppressive and near genocidal treatment during the long brutal regime of the Somalia dictatorship.&nbsp;It is, therefore, understandable that citizenship of the Somaliland Republic is based primarily on descent from persons who were resident in the territory of Somaliland prior to the union, or as Article 1 of the Law states on 26 June 1960, the date of the independence of the State of Somaliland.&nbsp; Other countries also base their citizenship by birth on a descent from persons at an operative date &#8211; an example of a nearby country is Article 10 of the Uganda Constitution which bases citizenship by birth primarily on descent from persons who were &#8220;<I>of the indigenous communities existing and residing within the borders of Uganda as at the first day of February 1926</I>&#8221;. </SPAN></P>

The first is where a state is dissolved and ceases to exist and various parts of the territory form two or more successor states, and the other is when part or parts of a territory of a state separate and form one or more successor states while the predecessor state continues to exist.&nbsp; Whilst, many may see the situation of Somaliland as being akin to the latter, it is submitted (as set out above) that neither of these situations apply &#8220;on all fours&#8221; to Somaliland.&nbsp; As emphasised earlier the case of Somaliland is one of dissolution of a union of two states, with Somaliland re-acquiring its former statehood.&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
              <P STYLE="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The ILC Articles (see 22 to 26) state that citizenship of successor states in both situations covered by the Articles shall be attributed to persons having <U>habitual residence</U> and persons persons having an appropriate legal connection with it, as well as persons who are not entitled to nationality of any state, but born in or have habitual residence in the territory.&nbsp; Whilst the concept of habitual residence has been used in many countries and was mooted as far back as the 1929 Harvard Draft Convention on Nationality (article 18b), it is by no means the only relevant criterion.&nbsp; The European Convention on Nationality (in Article 18) recommends that &#8220;<I>in deciding on the granting or the retention of nationality in cases of State succession, each State Party concerned shall take account in particular of: a) the genuine and effective link of the person concerned with the State; b) the habitual residence of the person concerned at the time of State succession; c) the will of the person concerned; d) the territorial origin of the person concerned&#8221;. </I>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
              <P STYLE="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Some of these other criteria have been used as the basis for defining core citizenship in constituent states after dissolution of a union.&nbsp; Examples of such dissolved unions abound (the United Arab Republic, Cape Verde &amp; Guinea-Bissau etc), but a recent one was the separation of Singapore and Malaysia, whereby Singapore re-asserted its citizenship.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in Eritrea, another country which was a separate state before its annexation by Ethiopia, Article 3 of the Eritrean Constitution bases citizenship primarily on birth to an Eritrean father or mother.&nbsp; In basing citizenship primarily on descent, and making a provision for aliens to naturalise on the basis of habitual residence, the Somaliland Citizenship Law is therefore not out of step with international law and practice. The question as to whether some special provision should be made for persons residing in Somaliland and who are entitled to citizenship of&nbsp; Somalia (ex-Italian Somalia) because of descent through the Somali clan system and hence through territorial origin is one that will be addressed when one or more peaceful state/s arise out of the Somalia.&nbsp;In the meantime, the Somaliland Government already accords all ethnic Somalis (be they citizens of the Republic of Djibouti, the Federal Republic of Ethiopia or Somalia) preferential status in travel to and residence in Somaliland, but this Law will ensure that, with the coming elections [<I>in 2002 - Editor</I>], citizenship of Republic of Somaliland is clearly defined again.</SPAN></P>

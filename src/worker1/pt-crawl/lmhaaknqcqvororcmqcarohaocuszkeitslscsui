         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Basilio
         Catania was born in Maletto (CT), Sicily (Italy), on 16 May 1926. At the age of
         three, he went to Milan, were he was educated, and where, in
         1952, he received his doctorate degree in Electrical
         Engineering from the Polytechnic of Milan.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A NAME="Microwave Links"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">He
         started working as a researcher in the Magneti Marelli's
         Radio Laboratory, near Milan, from 1952 to 1963, being
         primarily engaged in research on broadband microwave links
         and on advanced measurement instrumentation for the same. He
         first got a two-three years training on the field,
         installing and testing all along Italy the first Microwave
         Link network for RAI television. His subsequent main
         achievements were a broadband FM demodulator for 2700
         telephone channels, a low-threshold FM demodulator for the
         Italian satellite earth station, a new theory on FM limiters
         and on distortions in FM microwave links, and
         <A NAME=Measurement></A>a compact, multifunction microwave
         link test equipment, that he demonstrated in many countries
         of the world and was approved by the Bell Laboratories
         (Western Electric KS No. 20548) for use in their networks.
         In the above fields of activity, he received US Patents Nos.
         3,227,958, 3,195,060, 3,361,986, 3,763,427 and, later,
         4,002,982.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">In the same
         period, he also worked, in his spare time, as assistant to
         Prof. Francesco Vecchiacchi, at the Electrical Communication
         Laboratory of the Polytechnic of Milan.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">After
         Magneti Marelli's Radio branch was acquired by USA's General
         Telephone &amp; Electronics, he engaged, from 1963 to 1971,
         in the design and development of said product lines, as
         Assistant Technical Director of
         GT&amp;E-Telecomunicazioni.</FONT></P>

         the same period, as an Adjunct Professor, he lectured in
         postgraduate courses on microwave technology at the
         Polytechnics of Milan and Turin and was chairman of the
         "Satellite Systems" working group of the International
         Electrotechnical Commission.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">In the year
         1972, he joined CSELT (Centro Studi e Laboratori
         Telecomunicazioni), the corporate Research Laboratory of the
         IRI-STET Group in Turin, where he was responsible for
         research in the fields of radio links, millimeter waveguides
         and optical fibers.<A NAME="Optical Fibers"></A> In the
         (then new) field of optical fibers, he worked closely with
         Corning Glass, Pirelli and Sirti to set up an operational
         optical cable system in the telephone network of Turin. To
         this end, he developed an original optical fiber system's
         theory, that, on October 1975, was awarded the "prize for
         the paper of the highest scientific level" from the
         International Institute of Communications, in
         Genoa.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">The optical
         link, in Turin, was designed according to that theory, and
         was inaugurated on 15 September 1977. It turned out to be
         the first of the kind in the world, thus rendering CSELT
         internationally known. Many other "firsts" followed, with
         improvements in system capacity (140 Mb/s in late 1977, 560
         Mb/s in 1978).</FONT></P>

        <P align="left">&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Following
         the above achievements, he took a leading role in the
         founding and management of international conferences, such
         as the European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC)
         and the Integrated Optics and Optical Communication
         Conference (IOOC). He was invited to lecture and/or chair
         many conferences around the world and was editor of the
         900-page book "Optical Fiber Communication", published by
         McGraw Hill in the USA, in 1981. Noteworthy was the invited
         lecture "Optical Technology and Network Requirements" given
         at the Royal Society in London, on 29 June 1988.<BR>
         Soon after his first achievements in the field of optical
         fibers, in December 1976, he was appointed director general
         of CSELT, remaining in that position until October 1989,
         when he retired. During this latter period, he promoted at
         CSELT activities on new research fields, such as artificial
         intelligence, computer aided design and solid state
         technology, acting both as a manager and as a scientific
         leader, as proved by the more than seventy papers published
         on various technical magazines or presented at national and
         international conferences. About twelve papers were
         concerned with the management of research. From 1983 to
         1989, he was chairman of the planning committee of the
         European Industrial Research Management Association (EIRMA),
         in Paris.</FONT></P>

         the first introductory document; then, as chairman of the

         <A NAME="Antonio Meucci"></A>Since then, he almost entirely
         devoted his activity to an extensive research on the life
         and work of Antonio Meucci, a Florentine, who emigrated
         first to Cuba and then to the United States, and who claimed
         to have invented the telephone. The first (516-page) volume
         of Basilio Catania's four-volume work, entitled "Antonio
         Meucci - l'inventore e il suo tempo" (in English "Antonio
         Meucci - The inventor and His Times"), dealing with Meucci's
         life in Florence and Havana, was presented at the Lincei
         Academy in Rome on 1 June 1994. The second (768-page)
         volume, dealing with the first twenty years of Meucci's life
         in the USA, was presented at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence
         on 16 May 1996. The author is actively working to complete

	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="1">1</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.1">1</A> Eumenes of Cardia, according to Duris, was the son of a man whom poverty drove to be a waggoner, in the Thracian Chersonesus, but received a liberal education in literature and athletics. While he was still a boy, Duris says further, Philip, who was sojourning in the place and had an hour of leisure, came to see the young men and boys of Cardia exercising in the pancratium&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note1
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">1</A> and in wrestling, among whom Eumenes had such success and gave such proofs of intelligence and bravery that he pleased Philip and was taken into his following. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.2">2</A> But in my opinion those historians tell a more probable story who say that a tie of guest-friendship with his father led Philip to give advancement to Eumenes. After Philip's death Eumenes was thought to be inferior to none of Alexander's followers in sagacity and fidelity, and though he had only the title of chief secretary, he was held in as much honour as the king's principal friends and intimates, so that on the Indian expedition he was actually sent out as general with a force under his own orders,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref2" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note2
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">2</A> and received the command in the cavalry which Perdiccas had held, when Perdiccas, after Hephaestion's death, was advanced to that officer's position. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.3">3</A> Therefore when Neoptolemus, the commander of the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Shield-bearers</SPAN>, after Alexander's


<A ID="p81"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p81 </SPAN></A>death, said that he had followed the king with shield and spear, but Eumenes with pen and paper, the Macedonians laughed him to scorn; they knew that, besides his other honours, Eumenes had been deemed worthy by the king of <SPAN CLASS="whole">relation</SPAN>&shy;ship in marriage. For Barsiné the daughter of Artabazus, the first woman whom Alexander knew in Asia, and by whom he had a son, Heracles, had two sisters; of these Alexander gave one, Apama, to Ptolemy, and the other, also called Barsiné,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref3" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note3
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">3</A> to Eumenes. This was at the time when he distributed the other Persian women as consorts among his companions.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note4
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="2">2</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.1">1</A> However, Eumenes was often in collision with Alexander, and he got himself into danger through Hephaestion. In the first place, for instance, when Hephaestion assigned to Euius the <SPAN CLASS="whole">flute-player</SPAN> the quarters which his servants had already taken up for Eumenes, Eumenes, accompanied by Mentor, came in a passion to Alexander and cried out that it was best for him to throw away his arms and be a <SPAN CLASS="whole">flute-player</SPAN> or a tragic actor. The immediate result was that Alexander shared his indignation and heaped abuse upon Hephaestion. Soon, however, he changed his mind and was angry with Eumenes, feeling that he had indulged in insolence towards himself more than in bold words against Hephaestion.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.2">2</A> Again, when Alexander was sending out Nearchus with a fleet to explore the outer sea, he asked money of his friends, since the royal treasury was empty. Eumenes was asked for three hundred talents, but gave only a hundred, and said that even these had been slowly and with difficulty collected for him by


<A ID="p83"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p83 </SPAN></A>his stewards. Alexander made no reproaches, nor did he take the money, but ordered his servants secretly to set fire to the tent of Eumenes, wishing to take its owner in a manifest lie when the treasure was carried out of it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.3">3</A> But before that could be done the tent was consumed, and the destruction of his papers made Alexander repent him of his orders. Still, the gold and silver that was melted down by the fire was found to be more than a thousand talents' worth. Alexander took none of it, however, but actually wrote to his satraps and generals everywhere to send copies of the documents that had been destroyed, and ordered Eumenes to take them all in charge.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.4">4</A> And still again, Eumenes had a quarrel with Hephaestion about a certain gift, and much abusive language passed between them. At the time, indeed, Eumenes was no less in favour than before; but a little while afterwards Hephaestion died, and the king, in his bitter sorrow, dealt harshly and was severe with all who, as he thought, had been jealous of his favourite while he lived and now rejoiced at his death. Eumenes, in particular, he suspected of such feelings, and often reproached him for his former quarrels with Hephaestion and his abusive language towards him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.5">5</A> But Eumenes, who was wily and persuasive, tried to make what threatened his ruin conduce to his salvation. He sought refuge, namely, in Alexander's ardent gratitude towards Hephaestion, suggesting honours which were most likely to adorn the memory of the deceased, and contributing money for the construction of his tomb lavishly and readily.

	<P CLASS="justify" ID="p85"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p85 </SPAN>
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="3">3</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.1">1</A> When Alexander was dead&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note5
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">5</A> and a quarrel had arisen between the Macedonian men-at‑war and his principal officers, or companions,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note6
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">6</A> Eumenes sided with the latter in his opinions, but in what he said he was a kind of common friend to both and held himself aloof from the quarrel, on the ground that it was no business of his, since he was a stranger, to meddle in disputes of Macedonians. Moreover, when the rest of the principal officers had withdrawn from Babylon, he remained behind in the city and mollified many of the men-at‑war and made them more disposed towards a settlement of the quarrel. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.2">2</A> And when the officers, having conferred with one another, brought their first tumultuous proceedings to an end, and were distributing satrapies and commands, Eumenes received Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, and the southern coast of the Euxine sea as far as Trapezus. It is true that at the time this territory was not subject to the Macedonians, for Ariarathes held royal sway over it; but Leonnatus and Antigonus, with a great army, were to conduct Eumenes thither and declare him satrap of the country.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.3">3</A> Now, Antigonus paid no heed to the edicts of Perdiccas, being already lifted up in his ambitions and scorning all his associates; but Leonnatus came down from the interior into Phrygia in order to undertake the expedition in behalf of Eumenes. Here, however, Hecataeus the tyrant of Cardia joined him and besought


<A ID="p87"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p87 </SPAN></A>him to go rather to the assistance of Antipater and the Macedonians besieged in Lamia.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note7
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">7</A> Leonnatus therefore determined to cross over to Greece, invited Eumenes to go with him, and tried to reconcile him with Hecataeus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.4">4</A> For they had a hereditary distrust of one another arising from political differences; and frequently Eumenes had been known to denounce Hecataeus when a tyrant and to exhort Alexander to restore its freedom to Cardia. Therefore at this time also Eumenes declined to go on the expedition against the Greeks, saying he was afraid that Antipater, who had long hated him, would kill him to please Hecataeus. Then Leonnatus took him into his confidence and revealed to him all his purposes. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.5">5</A> Assistance to Antipater, namely, was what he alleged as a pretext for his expedition, but he really meant, as soon as he had crossed into Europe, to lay claim to Macedonia; and he showed certain letters from Cleopatra&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note8
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">8</A> in which she invited him to come to Pella and promised to marry him. But Eumenes, either because he was afraid of Antipater, or because he despaired of Leonnatus as a capricious man full of uncertain and rash impulses, took his own equipment and decamped by night.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note9
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">9</A> And he had three hundred horsemen, two hundred armed <SPAN CLASS="whole">camp-followers</SPAN>, and in gold what would amount to five thousand talents of money. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.6">6</A> With this equipment he fled to Perdiccas, and by telling him of the designs of Leonnatus at once enjoyed great influence with him and was made a member of his council. Moreover, a little while after he was conducted into Cappadocia with an army


<A ID="p89"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p89 </SPAN></A>which Perdiccas commanded in person. There Ariarathes was taken prisoner, the country was brought into subjection, and Eumenes was proclaimed satrap. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.7">7</A> He entrusted the cities of the country to his own friends, appointed commanders of garrisons, left behind him such judges and administrators as he wished, Perdiccas not at all interfering in these matters, and then marched away with Perdiccas, desiring to pay court to that general, and not wishing to be separated from the kings.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="

onMouseOut="nd();">10</A>

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="4">4</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.1">1</A> However, Perdiccas felt confident of carrying out his projects by himself, and thought that the country they had left behind them needed an efficient and faithful guardian, and therefore sent Eumenes back from Cilicia, ostensibly to his own satrapy, but really to reduce to obedience the adjacent country of Armenia, which had been thrown into confusion by Neoptolemus.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref11" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">11</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.2">2</A> Accordingly, although Neoptolemus was a victim of ostentation and empty pride, Eumenes tried to constrain him by personal intercourse; then, finding that the Macedonian men-at‑war were conceited and bold, he raised a force of cavalry as a counterpoise to them by offering the natives of the country who were able to serve as horsemen immunity from contributions and tributes, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.3">3</A> and by distributing horses that he had bought among those of his followers in whom he placed most confidence; the spirits of these men, too, he incited by honours and gifts, and developed their bodies by exercise and discipline; so that a part of the Macedonians were amazed, a part emboldened, when they saw that in a short time

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">16</A> and Neoptolemus to look to Eumenes for orders, and Eumenes to manage matters as he thought best. Alcetas, then, flatly refused to serve in the campaign, on the ground that the Macedonians under him were ashamed to fight Antipater, and were so well disposed to Craterus that they were ready to receive him with open arms. Neoptolemus, however, plotting treachery against Eumenes, was detected, and when he was summoned would not obey, but drew up his forces in battle array. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.3">3</A> Here first did Eumenes reap the fruit of his forethought and preparation; for when his infantry had already been defeated, he routed Neoptolemus with his cavalry, and captured his baggage, and when the men-at‑war of Neoptolemus were scattered in pursuit of their enemies, charged upon them with his entire body of horse and compelled them to lay down their arms and make oath with him to serve under him.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.4">4</A> Neoptolemus, then, collected a few of his men from the rout and fled to Craterus and Antipater.


<A ID="p93"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p93 </SPAN></A>But they had already sent an embassy to Eumenes inviting him to come over to their side; he would enjoy possession of his present satrapies, would receive additional troops and territory from them, would become a friend to Antipater instead of an enemy, and would not become an enemy to Craterus instead of a friend. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.5">5</A> On hearing this proposition Eumenes replied that he had been Antipater's enemy from of old and could not now become his friend, when he saw him treating his friends as enemies, but that he was ready to reconcile Craterus with Perdiccas and bring the two together on just and equal terms; if, however, either undertook to overreach the other he would give aid to the injured party as long as he had breath, and would rather lose his life than his honour.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="6">6</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.1">1</A> Craterus and Antipater, then, after getting this answer, were taking deliberate counsel about the whole situation, when Neoptolemus came to them after his flight, told them about the battle he had lost, and urged them to come to his aid, both of them if possible, but at any rate Craterus; for the Macedonians longed for him exceedingly, and if they should only see his cap and hear his voice, they would come to him with a rush, arms and all. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.2">2</A> And indeed the name of Craterus was really great among them, and after the death of Alexander most of them had longed for him as their commander. They remembered that he had many times incurred the strong displeasure of Alexander himself in their behalf, by opposing his gradually increasing desire to adopt Persian customs, and by defending the manners of their country, which, thanks to the spread of luxury and pomp, were already being treated with contempt.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.3">3</A> At the time of which I speak, then, Craterus sent


<A ID="p95"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p95 </SPAN></A>Antipater into Cilicia,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref17" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#note17
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">17</A> while he himself with a large part of the forces advanced with Neoptolemus against Eumenes. He thought that he should fall upon him when he was off his guard, and when, after their recent victory, his soldiers were in revelry and disorder. Now, that Eumenes should learn beforehand of his approach and get himself ready for it in advance, one might consider a mark of sober <SPAN CLASS="whole">general</SPAN>&shy;ship, though not of superlative ability; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.4">4</A> but that he should keep his enemies from getting any knowledge that would work him harm, and, besides this, that he should hurl his soldiers upon Craterus before they knew with whom they were fighting, and conceal from them the name of the opposing general, seems to me to have been an exploit peculiar to this commander. He gave out word, then, that Neoptolemus was once more coming against him, with Pigres, and that they had a force of Paphlagonian and Cappadocian cavalry. One night he was planning to decamp and then fell asleep and had a strange vision. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.5">5</A> He dreamed, namely, that he saw two Alexanders ready to give each other battle, each at the head of a phalanx; then Athena came to help the one, and Demeter the other, and after a fierce struggle the one who had Athena for a helper was beaten, and Demeter, culling ears of grain, wove them into a wreath for the victor.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.6">6</A> At once, then, he conjectured that the vision was in his favour, since he was fighting for a country that was most fertile and had at that time an abundance of fine young grain in the ear; for the land had everywhere been sown and bespoke a time of peace,


<A ID="p97"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p97 </SPAN></A>now that its plains were covered with a luxuriant growth; and he was all the more strengthened in his belief when he learned that the enemy's watchword was "Athena and Alexander." Accordingly, he too gave out a watchword, namely, "Demeter and Alexander," and ordered all his men to crown themselves and wreathe their arms with ears of grain. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.7">7</A> But though he often felt an impulse to speak out and tell his principal officers who it was against whom their struggle was to be, and not to keep hidden away in his own breast alone a secret so important, nevertheless he abode by his first resolution and made his judgment surety for the peril.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.1">1</A> However, he arrayed against Craterus not a single Macedonian, but two troops of foreign horse commanded by Pharnabazus the son of Artabazus and Phoenix of Tenedos, who had strict orders to charge at full speed when the enemy came into view and engage them at close quarters, without giving them a chance to withdraw or say anything, and without receiving any herald they might send. For he had strong fears that his Macedonians, if they recognized Craterus, would go over to him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.2">2</A> He himself, with a division of his best horsemen, three hundred in number, rode along to the right wing, where he purposed to attack Neoptolemus. When the forces of Eumenes had crossed the intervening hill and were seen coming on to the attack with a swift and impetuous dash, Craterus was dumbfounded and heaped much abuse upon Neoptolemus for having deceived him about the Macedonians changing sides; but he exhorted his officers to act like brave men, and he charged upon the enemy.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.3">3</A> The first collision was severe, the spears were


<A ID="p99"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p99 </SPAN></A>quickly shattered, and the fighting was done with the swords. Here Craterus did not disgrace Alexander, but slew many foes, and frequently routed the opposing arrays. At last, however, he was wounded by a Thracian who attacked him from the side, and fell from his horse. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.4">4</A> As he lay prostrate there all his enemies rode past him, not knowing who he was, except Gorgias, one of the officers of Eumenes; he recognized him, dismounted from his horse, and stood guard over his body, for he was now in an evil plight and struggling with death. In the meantime Neoptolemus also was engaged with Eumenes. They had long hated one another with a deadly hatred, but in two onsets neither had caught sight of the other; in the third, however, they recognized each other, and at once drew their swords and with loud cries rode to the attack. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.5">5</A> Their horses dashed together with the violence of colliding triremes, and dropping the reins they clutched one another with their hands, each trying to tear off the other's helmet and strip the breastplate from his shoulders. While they were struggling, their horses ran from under them and they fell to the ground, where they closed with one another and wrestled for the mastery. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.6">6</A> Then Eumenes, as Neoptolemus sought to rise first, gave him an undercut in the ham, and himself got to his feet before his adversary did; but Neoptolemus, supporting himself on one knee, and wounded in the other, defended himself vigorously from underneath. He could not, however, inflict fatal wounds, but was himself wounded in the neck, fell to the ground, and lay there prostrate. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.7">7</A> His sword, however, he still retained, and while Eumenes, transported with rage and ancient hatred, was stripping off his armour and


<A ID="p101"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p101 </SPAN></A>reviling him, Neoptolemus surprised him with a wound under the breastplate, where it reaches the groin. But the blow gave Eumenes more fright than harm, since lack of strength made it feeble.

	<P CLASS="justify">
After stripping the dead body, weak as he was from wounds received in legs and arms, Eumenes nevertheless had himself put upon his horse and hastened to the other wing, supposing that the enemy were still resisting. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.8">8</A> But when he learned of the fate of Craterus and had ridden up to where he lay, and saw that he was still alive and conscious, he dismounted, wept bitterly, clasped his hand, and had many words of abuse for Neoptolemus, and many words of pity for Craterus in his evil fortune, and for himself in the necessity which had brought him into a conflict with a friend and comrade, where he must do or suffer this harm.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref18" HREF="

Then, taking the opposite route in his flight to that of his pursuers, he changed his course before they knew it, and, passing along by them, came to the place where the battle had been fought. Here he encamped, collected the bodies of the dead, and burned them on pyres made from the doors of the neighbouring villages, which he had split into billets. He burned the bodies of the officers on one pyre, those of the common soldiers on another, heaped great mounds of earth over the ashes, and


<A ID="p107"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p107 </SPAN></A>departed, so that even Antigonus, when he came up later, admired his boldness and constancy.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="9.3">3</A> Again, when he came upon the baggage of Antigonus, and could easily have captured many freemen, many slaves, and wealth amassed from so many wars and plunderings, he was afraid that his men, if loaded down with booty and spoils, would become too heavy for flight, and too luxurious to endure wanderings and lapse of time. In lapse of time, however, he placed his chief hopes for ending the war, feeling that he could thus cause Antigonus to turn back. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="9.4">4</A> But since it was quite a difficult matter to deflect his Macedonians from good things which were within their reach, he ordered them to refresh themselves and bait their horses before advancing upon the enemy. He himself, however, sent a secret message to Menander, who was in charge of the enemy's baggage, implying that he was concerned for him as an old time friend and comrade, and advising him to be on his guard and withdraw as quickly as possible from his <SPAN CLASS="whole">low-lying</SPAN> and accessible position to the foot-hills near by, which could not be reached by cavalry or surrounded. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="9.5">5</A> Menander speedily comprehended his peril and decamped, and then Eumenes openly sent out scouts and ordered his soldiers to arm themselves and bridle their horses, as he was going to lead them against the enemy. But when the scouts brought word that Menander was altogether safe from capture now that he had taken refuge in a difficult region, Eumenes pretended to be vexed, and led his forces away. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="9.6">6</A> And it is said that when Menander bore witness of these things to Antigonus, and the Macedonians began to praise Eumenes and felt more


<A ID="p109"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p109 </SPAN></A>kindly towards him, because, when it was in his power to enslave their children and outrage their wives, he had spared them and let them go, Antigonus said: "Nay, my good men, that fellow did not let them go out of regard for you, but because he was afraid to put such fetters on himself in his flight."

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="10">10</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.1">1</A> After this, as he wandered about and sought to elude his enemies, Eumenes persuaded most of his soldiers to leave him,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref24" HREF="

Moreover, when Antigonus demanded to be addressed by him as a superior, Eumenes replied: "I regard no man as my superior so long as I am master of my sword." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.3">3</A> Nevertheless, after Antigonus had sent his nephew Ptolemy


<A ID="p111"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p111 </SPAN></A>into the fortress, as Eumenes had demanded, Eumenes went down to meet him, and they embraced one another with greetings of friendship and affection, since they had formerly been close associates and intimate companions. A long conference was held, in which Eumenes made no mention of his own safety or peace, but actually demanded that he should be confirmed in the possession of his satrapies, and that what was his by gift should be restored to him. At this the bystanders were amazed, and they admired his lofty spirit and confidence. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.4">4</A> But meanwhile many of the Macedonians came running together in their eagerness to see what sort of man Eumenes was; for no one else had been so much talked about in the army since the death of Craterus. Then Antigonus, afraid that Eumenes might suffer some violence, first loudly forbade the soldiers to approach, and pelted with stones those who were hurrying up, but finally threw his arms about Eumenes and, keeping off the throng with his bodyguards, with much ado removed him to a place of safety.

	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="11">11</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.1">1</A> After this, Antigonus built a wall round Nora, left troops to guard it, and retired; Eumenes, however, although closely besieged in a stronghold which had grain, water in abundance, and salt, but no other edible, not even a relish to go with the grain, nevertheless, with what he had, managed to render the life of his associates cheerful, inviting them all by turns to his own table, and seasoning the meal thus shared with conversation which had charm and friendliness. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.2">2</A> For he had a pleasant face, not like that of a war-worn veteran, but delicate and youthful, and all his body had, as it were, artistic proportions, with limbs of astonishing symmetry; and

This was thought to be more just, and the Macedonians accordingly administered this oath of Eumenes, raised the siege, and sent to Antigonus, that he too, on his part, might take the oath to Eumenes.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.3">3</A> Meanwhile, however, Eumenes gave back all the Cappadocian hostages whom he was holding in Nora, and received from those who came for them horses, beasts of burden, and tents. He also collected all the soldiers who had become scattered by his flight and were now wandering about the country, so that he had a force of almost a thousand horsemen. With


<A ID="p117"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p117 </SPAN></A>these he set out in flight, being rightly in fear of Antigonus. For Antigonus not only ordered his Macedonians to wall him in again and besiege him, but also wrote back bitter reproaches to them for accepting the correction of the oath.

These men, on receiving their letters, ostensibly treated Eumenes with friendliness, but were plainly full of envy and contentiousness, disdaining to be second to him. Eumenes therefore allayed their envy by not taking the money, alleging that he had no need of it; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.3">3</A> while upon their love of contention and love of command, seeing that they were as unable to lead as they were unwilling to follow, he brought superstition to bear.

Moreover, by flattering the Macedonian soldiery extravagantly and lavishing money upon them for banquets and sacrifices, in a short time they made the camp a hostelry of festal prodigality, and the army a mob to be cajoled into the election of its generals, as in a democracy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.6">6</A> Eumenes, however, perceiving that, while they despised one another, they feared him and were on the watch for an opportunity to kill him, pretended to be in need of money, and got together many talents by borrowing from those who hated him most, in order that they might put confidence in him and refrain from killing him out of regard for the money

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.1">1</A> The Macedonians, however, while there was no danger, continued to take gifts from their corrupters, and hung about the doors of these men, who now had body-guards and wanted to be generals. But when Antigonus encamped near them with a large force and the situation called aloud for a real general, not only did the common soldiers attach themselves to Eumenes, but also those who were great only when peace and luxury prevailed, every man of them, gave in to him and consented without a murmur to hold post which he gave them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.2">2</A> And, indeed, when Antigonus tried to cross the river Pasitigris, none of the other commanders who were watching his movements was even aware of it, but Eumenes, and he alone, withstood him, joined battle with him, slew many of his men and filled the stream with dead bodies, and took four thousand prisoners. But most of all in connection with the sickness that befell him did the Macedonians make it clear that they considered the others able to feast them splendidly and hold high festival, but him alone capable of wielding command and waging war, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.3">3</A> For Peucestas, having feasted them splendidly in Persis, and having given every man a victim for sacrifice, was expecting to be chief in command; and a few days afterwards, as the soldiers were marching against the enemy, it chanced that Eumenes, in consequence of a dangerous illness, was being carried along in a litter outside the ranks, where it was quiet and his sleep would not be broken.

Accordingly, the foremost Macedonians halted in their march and called with loud cries for Eumenes, declaring that they would not go forward unless he was in command of them; and grounding their arms they passed word to one another to wait, and to their leaders to keep still, and without Eumenes not to give battle or run any hazard even with the enemy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.5">5</A> When Eumenes heard of this, he quickened the pace of his bearers to a run and came to them, and lifting the curtains of his litter on either side, stretched forth his hand in delight.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.3">3</A> But the Macedonians opposed to him, after getting a little respite, once more acted like a capricious mob, and, mocking at their leaders, distributed themselves in winter quarters over almost the whole of Gabene, so that the rear was separated from the van by <A CLASS="conversion"
onMouseOver="return Ebox('almost 175 km',WIDTH,156)"

When Antigonus became aware of this, he set out suddenly against them, taking this time a road that was difficult and without water, but direct and short, hoping that, in case he fell upon them when they were scattered about in their winter quarters, it would no longer be easy for the mass of them to join their generals. But after he had entered an uninhabited country, dire winds and severe frosts gave trouble to his army and impeded their march. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.4">4</A> The only help, therefore, was to burn many fires, and this was what revealed his presence to the enemy. For the Barbarians living on the mountains which <SPAN CLASS="whole">over&shy;looked</SPAN> the uninhabited tract, amazed at the number of fires, sent messengers on dromedaries to Peucestas. And he, when he heard the news, being himself quite out of his mind with fear and seeing that the other officers were in a like state, set out to fly, after rousing up those of their soldiers especially who were quartered along the route. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.5">5</A> But Eumenes tried to put a stop to their confusion and panic fear, by promising so to check the speed of the enemy that they would come up three days later than they were expected. And when his hearers were persuaded, he sent round


<A ID="p127"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p127 </SPAN></A>messengers with orders that the forces in winter quarters and elsewhere should assemble with all speed; at the same time, too, he himself rode for with the other commanders, took possession of a place which could be seen at a distance by such as traversed the desert, measured it off, and ordered many fires to be made at intervals, as in an encampment. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.6">6</A> This was done, and when Antigonus saw these fires on the mountains, he was distressed and disheartened, supposing that his enemies had long been aware of his approach and were coming to meet him. In order, therefore, that he might not be forced to fight, when his men were worn and weary from their march, against those who had spent a comfortable winter and were ready for the conflict, he forsook the direct road and led his army through villages and cities, taking time to refresh it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.7">7</A> But when no one tried to obstruct his progress, the thing which usually happens when enemies are facing one another, and when the people round about said they had seen no army, but that the place was full of lighted fires, Antigonus perceived that he had been outgeneraled by Eumenes, and in deep resentment led his forces forward to try the issue in open battle.

	<P CLASS="justify">

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.1">1</A> But meanwhile most of the forces with Eumenes had assembled, and, admiring his sagacity, demanded that he should be sole commander. At this, Antigenes and Teutamus, the leaders of the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Silver-shields</SPAN>, were filled with vexation and jealousy, so that they plotted against the life of Eumenes, and, assembling most of the satraps and generals, deliberated when and how they might put him out of the way. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.2">2</A> They were unanimous in the decision to make every use of him in the ensuing battle, and after the battle


<A ID="p129"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p129 </SPAN></A>to kill him at once. But Eudamus, the master of the elephants, and Phaedimus, secretly brought word to Eumenes of this decision; not that they were moved by any goodwill or kindness, but because they were anxious not to lose the money they had lent him.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref33" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">33</A> These men Eumenes commended, and then went off to his tent, where he said to his friends that he was living in a great herd of wild beasts. Then he made his will, and tore up and destroyed his papers; he did not wish that after his death, in consequence of the secrets contained in these documents, accusations and calumnies should be brought against his correspondents. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.3">3</A> After this business had been finished, he deliberated whether to give over the victory to the enemy, or to take flight through Media and Armenia and invade Cappadocia. He came to no decision while his friends were with him, but after considering many expedients with a mind which was as versatile as his fortunes were changeable, he proceeded to draw up his forces, urging on the Greeks and the Barbarians, and himself exhorted by the phalanx and the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Silver-shields</SPAN> to be of good courage, since, as they felt sure, the enemy would not withstand their attack. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.4">4</A> And indeed they were the oldest soldiers of Philip and Alexander, war's athletes as it were, without a defeat or a fall up to that time, many of them now <SPAN CLASS="whole">seventy</SPAN> years old, and not a man younger than sixty. And so, when they charged upon the forces of Antigonus, they shouted; "It is against your fathers that ye sin, ye miscreants;" and falling upon them in a rage they crushed their whole phalanx at once, not a man withstanding them, and most of their opponents being cut to pieces at close quarters.

	<P CLASS="justify" ID="p131"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p131 </SPAN>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.5">5</A> At this point, then, Antigonus was defeated overwhelmingly, but with his cavalry he got the upper hand; for Peucestas fought in a way that was altogether lax and ignoble, and Antigonus captured all the baggage. He was a man who kept cool in the presence of danger, and he was aided by the ground. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.6">6</A> For the plain where<A CLASS="correction"
onMouseOver="return Ebox(CarelessLoeb80+'were</SPAN>',WIDTH,216)"

Therefore it was easy for Antigonus to capture the enemy's baggage unobserved.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="17">17</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.1">1</A> After the battle was over, Teutamus at once sent an embassy to treat for the baggage. And when Antigonus promised not only to give this back to the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Silver-shields</SPAN> but also to treat them kindly in other ways, the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Silver-shields</SPAN> formed a dire design to put the man alive into the hands of his enemies. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.2">2</A> So, to begin with, they drew near him, without awakening his suspicions, and kept him in ward, some making complaints about their baggage, others bidding him to be of good courage, since he was victorious, and others still denouncing their former commanders. Then they fell upon him, snatched their sword away from him, and tied his hands fast with his girdle. And when Nicanor had been sent by Antigonus to receive him and he was being led along through the Macedonians, he begged for leave to speak to them, not with a view to supplication or entreaty, but in order to set forth what was for their advantage.

	<P CLASS="justify" ID="p133"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p133 </SPAN>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.3">3</A> Silence was made, and standing on an eminence he stretched forth his hands, bound as they were, and said: "What trophy, O ye basest of Macedonians, could Antigonus have so much desired to set up over your defeat, as this which ye yourselves are now erecting by delivering up your general as a prisoner? It is not a dreadful thing, then, that in the hour of your victory ye should acknowledge yourselves defeated for the sake of your baggage, implying that victory lies in your possessions and not in your arms, but ye must also send your leader as a ransom for that baggage. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.4">4</A> As for me, then, ye lead me away undefeated, a victor over my enemies, a victim of my <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-soldiers</SPAN>; but as for you, by Zeus the god of armies and by the gods who hallow oaths, I bid you slay me here with your own hands. Even should I be slain yonder, it will be wholly your work. Nor will Antigonus find any fault; for he wants a dead and not a living Eumenes. And if ye would spare your own hands, one of mine, if released, will suffice to do the business. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.5">5</A> And if ye cannot trust me with a sword, cast me under the feet of your elephants, all bound as I am. If ye do this, I will absolve you from your guilt towards me, holding that ye have shown yourselves most just and righteous in your dealings with your own general."

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="18">18</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="18.1">1</A> As Eumenes said this, the rest of the throng was overwhelmed with sorrow, and some wept, but the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Silver-shields</SPAN> shouted to lead him along and pay no attention to his babbling; for it was not so dreadful a thing, they said, that a pest from the Chersonesus should come to grief for having harassed Macedonians with infinite wars, as that the best of the soldiers of Philip and Alexander,


<A ID="p135"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p135 </SPAN></A>after all their toils, should in their old age be robbed of their rewards and get their support from others, and that their wives should be spending the third night now in the arms of their enemies. At the same time they led him along at a quickened pace.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="18.2">2</A> But Antigonus, fearing their multitude (since no one had been left behind in the camp), sent out ten of his strongest elephants and a great number of Median and Parthian spearmen to drive away the throng. He himself could not endure to see Eumenes, by reason of their former intimate friendship, and when those who had received him asked how they should guard his person, he said: "Just as ye would an elephant or a lion." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="18.3">3</A> But after a little while he became compassionate and ordered the keepers to remove the prisoner's heavy fetters and admit one of his personal servants to anoint him, and permitted any one of his friends who wished to spend the day with him and bring what he needed. Then he deliberated many days what to do with him, and considered various arguments and suggestions, Demetrius his son and Nearchus the Cretan being eager to save the life of Eumenes, while the rest, almost all of them, were insistent in urging that he be put to death.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="18.4">4</A> We are told, also, that Eumenes asked his keeper, Onomarchus, why in the world Antigonus, now that he had got a hated enemy in his hands, neither killed him speedily nor generously set him free; and when Onomarchus insolently told him it was not now, but on the field of battle, that he should have faced death boldly, "Yea, by Zeus," said Eumenes, "then, too, I did so; ask the men who fought with me; I know that none I met was a


<A ID="p137"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p137 </SPAN></A>better man." "Well, then," said Onomarchus, "since now thou hast found thy better, why canst thou not bide his time?"

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="19">19</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="19.1">1</A> When, then, Antigonus had decided to kill Eumenes, he gave orders to deprive him of food. And so, after two or three days of fasting, the prisoner began to draw nigh his end. But camp was suddenly broken and a man was sent to dispatch him.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref34" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="19.2">2</A> Eumenes thus slain, on no other man than Antigonus did Heaven devolve the punishment of the soldiers and commanders who betrayed him, but he himself, regarding the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Silver-shields</SPAN> as impious and bestial men, put them into the violence of Sibyrtius the governor of Arachosia, ordering him to wear them out and destroy them in every possible way, that not a man of them might ever return to Macedonia or behold the Grecian sea.

Fourteen cubits, or <SPAN CLASS="whole">twenty-one</SPAN> feet, is about 4 meters. Now these houses may have been small — as houses often are in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern villages, all clumped together behind defensive walls and with an eye to shade and conserving resources — but this is just too small to be right. If as stated, Nora, the place they were stuck in, measured two stadia (just over 350 meters) in circumference, its area must have been something like 6000 to 7000 m<SPAN CLASS="superscript">2</SPAN>, just about that of a regulation American football field; and there would be room for a larger house than that. In <A HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Eumenes*.html#10.1.2
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,5,WIDTH,140)"
onMouseOut="nd();">10.1</A>, furthermore, Plutarch states that those who took refuge in Nora numbered 700, not counting those horses, stores of grain, the thickness of the walls of several houses, and some slight open space between them: so that even 7000 m<SPAN CLASS="superscript">2</SPAN> is almost certainly wrong as well. In sum, the figures in the text cannot be right, and there has surely been a manuscript transmission problem here.

<h3>Excerpt from Original Editorial Commentary "Fetching Home the Christmas Dinners"</h3>

<p class="one">"Something poetical is required about this Engraving — representing 
Londoners fetching home their Christmas Dinner.” Such was the request made to us. 
Poetical? Thought we. It is all very well to ask for poetry — but where is it to 
come from? — how is to be extracted from such a subject as that? Look at that 
comfortable young man, for instance, with the self-satisfied expression upon his vulgar 
countenance — he in the very middle — and declare, oh! Ye powers that preside 
at the birth of all things beautiful, what can be said of such a snob? Yet, why not? 
. . . . It is not every day in the week or year that the poor can dine; and however 
vulgar may be the snob that arrays himself in his best on Christmas Day and brings home 
his dinner steaming hot from the convenient shop of Rusk, the baker, it would be both 
churlish and snobbish in us, or any one else, to look with unsympathetic eyes, or turn up 
our noses contemptuously upon the harmless and well-won enjoyment that is expressed upon 
his countenance. . . . . Doubtless, he has a wife at home in their one little room on 
the two-pair front — a wife who has no kitchen, and who is obliged to make use of 
that good Mr. Rusk’s upon all such great occasions as Sundays and Christmasses; but who, 
being without a kitchen, and without worldly wealth, is not necessarily without a heart. 
A good appetite to them both, and many happy returns of the jovial season. No poetry in 
such a subject? Look at that venerable old lady — the occupant, doubtless, of an 
attic, or two-pair back, in some squalid street hard by. . . . . It is clear that she has 
guests this day. She does not dine alone at Christmas. That joint, small as it is, has 
been prepared for more than one — perhaps for a son, or grandson, or an old 
husband, feebler and more aged than herself, but not so feeble or so aged as to have lost 
all interest in a day so dear to all Londoners, if not all Englishmen. . . . . As for the 
little boy with the Glengarry bonnet and the short trousers — proof alike of his 
poverty and of his growth — the mode in which he carries the pie, and the look of 
intense hunger as well as of deep admiration which he bestows upon it, is proof positive 
of a foregone conclusion in his mind that he will do more delightful duty to the pie than 
that of carrying it in his hands. We fear, however, from the shortness of his trousers, 
which is symptomatic of a household not so overburdened with means as it is with 
children, that he will not be allowed <i>carte blanche</i> at the dainty. [Cousin 
Charles, "Fetching Home the Christmas Dinners," p. 407]</p>

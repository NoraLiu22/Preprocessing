	<P CLASS="start justify" ID="p3"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p3 </SPAN>
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R1">1</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1">1</A> There are a number of branches of philosophy that have not as yet been by any means adequately explored; but the inquiry into the nature of the gods, which is both highly interesting in relation to the theory of the soul,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Natura_Deorum/1A*.html#note1
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">1</A> and fundamentally important for the regulation of religion, is one of special difficulty and obscurity, as you, Brutus, are well aware. The multiplicity and variety of the opinions held upon this subject by eminent scholars are bound to constitute a strong argument for the view that philosophy has its origin and <SPAN CLASS="whole">starting-point</SPAN> in ignorance, and that the Academic School were <SPAN CLASS="whole">well-advised</SPAN> in "withholding assent" from beliefs that are uncertain: for what is more unbecoming than <SPAN CLASS="whole">ill‑considered</SPAN> haste? and what is so <SPAN CLASS="whole">ill‑considered</SPAN> or so unworthy of the dignity and seriousness proper to a philosopher as to hold an opinion that is not true, or to maintain with unhesitating certainty a proposition not based on adequate examination, comprehension and knowledge? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2">2</A> As regards the present subject, for example, most thinkers have affirmed that the gods exist, and this is the most


<A ID="p5"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p5 </SPAN></A>probable view and the one to which we are all led by nature's guidance; but Protagoras declared himself uncertain, and Diagoras of Melos and Theodorus of Cyrene held that there are no gods at all. Moreover, the upholders of the divine existence differ and disagree so widely, that it would be a troublesome task to recount their opinions. Many views are put forward about the outward form of the gods, their <SPAN CLASS="whole">dwelling-places</SPAN> and abodes, and mode of life, and these topics are debated with the widest variety of opinion among philosophers; but as to the question upon which the whole issue of the dispute principally turns, whether the gods are entirely idle and inactive, taking no part at all in the direction and government of the world, or whether on the contrary all things both were created and ordered by them in the beginning and are controlled and kept in motion by them throughout eternity, here there is the greatest disagreement of all. And until this issue is decided, mankind must continue to labour under the profoundest uncertainty, and to be in ignorance about matters of the highest moment. <A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R2">2</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3">3</A> For there are and have been philosophers who hold that the gods exercise no control over human affairs whatever. But if their opinion is the true one, how can piety, reverence or religion exist? For all these are tributes which it is our duty to render in purity and holiness to the divine powers solely on the assumption that they take notice of them, and that some service has been rendered by the immortal gods to the race of men. But if on the contrary the gods have neither the power nor the will to aid us, if they pay no heed to us at all and take no notice of our actions, if they can exercise no possible influence upon the life of


<A ID="p7"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p7 </SPAN></A>men, what ground have we for rendering any sort of worship, honour or prayer to the immortal gods? Piety however, like the rest of the virtues, cannot exist in mere outward show and pretence; and, with piety, reverence and religion must likewise disappear. And when these are gone, life soon becomes a welter of disorder and confusion; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4">4</A> and in all probability the disappearance of piety towards the gods will entail the disappearance of loyalty and social union among men as well, and of justice itself, the queen of all the virtues.

	<P CLASS="justify">
There are however other philosophers, and those of eminence and note, who believe that the whole world is ruled and governed by divine intelligence and reason; and not this only, but also that the gods' providence watches over the life of men; for they think that the corn<A CLASS="comment"
onMouseOver="return Ebox('American readers: not what we call corn, remember (a New World plant), but British English for any grain, usually wheat.')"
onMouseOut="nd();">º</A> and other fruits of the earth, and also the weather and the seasons and the changes of the atmosphere by which all the products of the soil are ripened and matured, are the gift of the immortal gods to the human race; and they adduce a number of things, which will be recounted in the books that compose the present treatise, that are of such a nature as almost to appear to have been expressly constructed by the immortal gods for the use of man. This view was controverted at great length by Carneades, in such a manner as to arouse in persons of active mind a keen desire to discover the truth. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5">5</A> There is in fact no subject upon which so much difference of opinion exists, not only among the unlearned but also among educated men; and the views entertained are so various and so discrepant, that, while it is no doubt a possible alternative that


<A ID="p9"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p9 </SPAN></A>none of them is true, it is certainly impossible that more than one should be so.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R3">3</A>
Upon this issue we are able both to appease kindly critics and to silence malicious <SPAN CLASS="whole">fault-finders</SPAN>, causing the latter to repent of their censure and the former to welcome an accession to their knowledge. Friendly remonstrance must be met by explanation, hostile attack by refutation.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6">6</A> I observe however that a great deal of talk has been current about the large number of books that I have produced within a short space of time, and that such comment has not been all of one kind; some people have been curious as to the cause of this sudden outburst of philosophical interest on my part, while others have been eager to learn what positive opinions I hold on the various questions. Many also, as I have noticed, are surprised at my choosing to espouse a philosophy that in their view robs the world of daylight and floods it with a darkness as of night; and they wonder at my coming forward so unexpectedly as the champion of a derelict system and one that has long been given up.

	<P CLASS="justify">
As a matter of fact however I am no new convert to the study of philosophy. From my earliest youth I have devoted no small amount of time and energy to it, and I pursued it most keenly at the very periods when I least appeared to be doing so, witness the philosophical maxims of which my speeches are full, and my intimacy with the learned men who have always graced my household, as well as those eminent professors, Diodotus, Philo, Antiochus and Posidonius, who were my instructors. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7">7</A> Moreover, if it be true that all the doctrines of philosophy have a practical bearing, I may claim that in my public and private


<A ID="p11"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p11 </SPAN></A>conduct alike I have practised the precepts taught by reason and by theory. <A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R4">4</A> If again anyone asks what motive has induced me so late in the day to commit these precepts to writing, there is nothing that I can explain more easily. I was languishing in idle retirement, and the state of public affairs was such that an autocratic form of government had become inevitable. In these circumstances, in the first place I thought that to expound philosophy to my <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-countrymen</SPAN> was actually my duty in the interests of the commonwealth, since in my judgement it would greatly contribute to the honour and glory of the state to have thoughts so important and so lofty enshrined in Latin literature also; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8">8</A> and I am the less inclined to repent of my undertaking because I can clearly perceive <INS CLASS="slip"
onMouseOver="return Ebox(SourceErr+'what</SPAN>')"
onMouseOut="nd();">that</INS> a number of my readers have been stimulated not only to study but to become authors themselves. A great many accomplished students of Greek learning were unable to share their acquisitions with their <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-citizens</SPAN>, on the ground that they doubted the possibility of conveying in Latin the teachings they had received from the Greeks. In the matter of style however I believe that we have made such progress that even in richness of vocabulary the Greeks do not surpass us. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="9">9</A> Another thing that urged me to this occupation was the dejection of spirit occasioned by the heavy and crushing blow&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref2" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Natura_Deorum/1A*.html#note2
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">2</A> that had been dealt me by fortune. Had I been able to find any more effective relief from my sorrow, I should not have had recourse to this particular form of consolidation; but the best way open to me of enjoying even this consolidation to the full extent was to devote myself not only to reading books but also to composing a treatise on the whole


<A ID="p13"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p13 </SPAN></A>of philosophy. Now the readiest mode of imparting a knowledge of the subject in all its departments and branches is to write an exposition of the various methods in their entirety; since it is a striking characteristic of philosophy that its topics all hang together and form a consecutive system; one is seen to be linked to another, and all to be mutually connected and attached.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R5">5</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="10">10</A> Those however who seek to learn my personal opinion on the various questions show an unreasonable degree of curiosity. In discussion it is not so much weight of authority as force of argument that should be demanded. Indeed the authority of those who profess to teach is often a positive hindrance to those who desire to learn; they cease to employ their own judgement, and take what they perceive to be the verdict of their chosen master as settling the question. In fact I am not disposed to approve the practice traditionally ascribed to the Pythagoreans, who, when questioned as to the grounds of any assertion that they advanced in debate, are said to have been accustomed to reply 'He himself said so,'&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref3" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Natura_Deorum/1A*.html#note3
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">3</A> 'he himself' being Pythagoras. So potent was an opinion already decided, making authority prevail unsupported by reason.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="11">11</A> To those again who are surprised at my choice of a system to which to give my allegiance, I think that a sufficient answer has been given in the four books of my <I>Academica</I>. Nor is it the case that I have come forward as the champion of a lost cause and of a position now abandoned. When men die, their doctrines do not perish with them, though perhaps they suffer from the loss of their authoritative exponent. Take for example the philosophical method referred


<A ID="p15"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p15 </SPAN></A>to, that of a purely negative dialectic which refrains from pronouncing any positive judgement. This, after being originated by Socrates, revived by Arcesilas, and reinforced by Carneades, has flourished right down to our own period; though I understand that in Greece itself it is now almost bereft of adherents. But this I ascribe not to the fault of the Academy but to the dullness of mankind. If it is a considerable matter to understand any one of the systems of philosophy singly, how much harder is it to master them all! Yet this is the task that confronts those whose principle is to discover the truth by the method of arguing both for and against all the schools. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12">12</A> In an undertaking so extensive and so arduous, I do not profess to have attained success, though I do claim to have attempted it. At the same time it would be impossible for the adherents of this method to dispense altogether with any standard of guidance. This matter it is true I have discussed elsewhere more thoroughly; but some people are so dull and slow of apprehension that they appear to require repeated explanations. Our position is not that we hold that nothing is true, but that we assert that all true sensations are associated with false ones so closely resembling them that they contain no infallible mark to guide our judgement and assent.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Natura_Deorum/1A*.html#note4
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">4</A> From this followed the corollary, that many sensations are <I>probable</I>, that is, though not amounting to a full perception they are yet possessed of a certain distinctness and clearness, and so can serve to direct the conduct of the wise man.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R6">6</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="13">13</A> However, to free myself entirely from <SPAN CLASS="whole">ill‑disposed</SPAN> criticism, I will now lay before my readers the doctrines of the various schools on the nature


<A ID="p17"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p17 </SPAN></A>of the gods. This is a topic on which it seems proper to summon all the world to sit in judgement and pronounce which of these doctrines is the true one. If it turn out that all the schools agree, or if any one philosopher be found who had discovered the truth, then but not before I will convict the Academy of captiousness. This being so, I feel disposed to cry, in the words of the <I>Young Comrades</I>:<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">6</A> for all of these matters ultimately depend upon this question of the nature of the immortal gods. Surely such wide diversity of opinion among men of the greatest learning on a matter of the highest moment must affect even those who think that they possess certain knowledge with a feeling of doubt.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="15">15</A> This has often struck me, but it did so with especial force on one occasion, when the topic of the immortal gods was made the subject of a very searching and thorough discussion at the house of my friend Gaius Cotta. It was the Latin Festival, and I had come at Cotta's express invitation to pay him a visit. I <A ID="p19"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p19 </SPAN></A>found him sitting in an alcove, engaged in debate with Gaius Velleius, a Member of the Senate, accounted by the Epicureans as their chief Roman adherent at the time. With them was Quintus Lucilius Balbus, who was so accomplished a student of Stoicism as to rank with the leading Greek exponents of that system.

	<P CLASS="justify">
When Cotta saw me, he greeted me with the words: "You come exactly at the right moment, for I am just engaging in a dispute with Velleius on an important topic, in which you with your tastes will be interested to take part."

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R7">7</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="16">16</A> "Well, I too," I replied, "think I have come at the right moment, as you say. For here are you, three leaders of three schools of philosophy, met in congress. In fact we only want Marcus Piso to have every considerable school represented."

	<P CLASS="justify">
"Oh," rejoined Cotta, "if what is said in the book which our master Antiochus lately dedicated to our good Balbus here is true, you have no need to regret the absence of your friend Piso. Antiochus holds the view that the doctrines of the Stoics, though differing in form of expression, agree in substance with those of the Peripatetics. I should like to know your opinion of the book, Balbus."

	<P CLASS="justify">
"My opinion?" said Balbus, "Why, I am surprised that a man of first-rate intellect like Antiochus should have failed to see what a gulf divides the Stoics, who distinguish expediency and right not in name only but in essential nature, from the Peripatetics, who class the right and the expedient together, and only recognize differences of quantity or degree, not of kind, between them. This is not a slight verbal discrepancy but a fundamental difference of


<A ID="p21"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p21 </SPAN></A>doctrine. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17">17</A> However we can discuss this some other time. For the moment we will, if you please, continue the topic which we had begun."

	<P CLASS="justify">
"Agreed," cried Cotta; "but to let the newcomer know what is the subject of discussion" — here he glanced at me — "I will explain that we were debating the nature of the gods: a question which seemed to me, as it always does, an extremely obscure one, and upon which I was therefore inquiring of Velleius as to the opinion of Epicurus. So if you do not mind, Velleius," he continued, "please resume the exposition that you had begun."

	<P CLASS="justify">
"I will do so," replied Velleius, "although it is not I but you who have been reinforced by an ally — since both of you," he said, with a smile in our direction, "are disciples of Philo, and have learned from him to know nothing."

	<P CLASS="justify">
"What we have learned," I rejoined, "shall be Cotta's affair; but pray don't think I have come to act as his ally, but as a listener, and an impartial and unprejudiced listener too, under no sort of bond or obligation willy nilly to uphold some fixed opinion."

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R8">8</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="18">18</A> Hereupon Velleius began, in the confident manner (I need not say) that is customary with Epicureans, afraid of nothing so much as lest he should appear to have doubts about anything. One would have supposed he had just come down from the assembly of the gods in the intermundane spaces of Epicurus!&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="

Can you suppose that a man can have even dipped into natural philosophy if he imagines that anything that has come into being can be eternal? What composite whole is not capable of dissolution? What thing is there that has a beginning but not an end?

<A ID="p25"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p25 </SPAN></A>the question, why did these deities suddenly awake into activity as <SPAN CLASS="whole">world-builders</SPAN> after countless ages of slumber? for though the world did not exist, it does not follow that ages did not exist — meaning by ages, not periods made up of a number of days and nights in annual courses, for ages in this sense I admit could not have been produced without the circular motion of the firmament; but from the infinite past there has existed an eternity not measured by limited divisions of time, but of a nature intelligible in terms of extension; since it is inconceivable that there was ever a time when time did not exist. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22">22</A> Well then, Balbus, what I ask is, why did your Providence remain idle all through that extent of time of which you speak? Was it in order to avoid fatigue? But god cannot know fatigue; and also there was no fatigue in question, since all the elements, sky, fire, earth and sea, were obedient to the divine will.

And are we to suppose that thenceforward the varied beauties which we see adorning earth and sky have afforded him pleasure? How can a god take pleasure in things of this sort? And if he did, he could not have dispensed with it so long. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="23">23</A> Or were these beauties designed for the sake of men, as your school usually maintains? For the sake of wise men? If so, all this vast effort of construction took place on account of a handful of people. For the sake of fools then? But in the first place there was no reason for god to do a service to the wicked and secondly, what good


<A ID="p27"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p27 </SPAN></A>did he do? inasmuch as all fools are beyond question extremely miserable, precisely because they are fools (for what can be mentioned more miserable than folly?), and in the second place because there are so many troubles in life that, though wise men can assuage them by balancing against them life's advantages, fools can neither avoid their approach nor endure their presence. <A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R10">10</A> Those on the other hand who said that the world is itself endowed with life and with wisdom, failed entirely to discern what shape the nature of an intelligent living being could conceivably possess. I will touch on this a little later; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="24">24</A> for the present I will confine myself to expressing my surprise at their stupidity in holding that a being who is immortal and also blessed is of a spherical shape, merely on the ground that Plato pronounces a sphere to be the most beautiful of all figures. For my own part, on the score of appearance I prefer either a cylinder or a cube or a cone or a pyramid. Then, what mode of existence is assigned to their spherical deity? Why, he is in a state of rotation, spinning round with a velocity that surpasses all powers of conception. But what room there can be in such an existence for steadfastness of mind and for happiness, I cannot see. Also, why should a condition that is painful in the human body, if even the smallest part of it is affected, be supposed to be painless in the deity? Now clearly the earth, being a part of the world, is also a part of god. Yet we see that vast portions of the earth's surface are uninhabitable deserts, being either scorched by the sun's proximity, or frost-bound and covered with snow owing to its extreme remoteness. But if the world is god, these, being parts of the


<A ID="p29"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p29 </SPAN></A>world, must be regarded as limbs of god, undergoing the extremes of heat and cold respectively.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="25">25</A> "So much, Lucilius, for the doctrines of your school. To show what <SPAN CLASS="emend">&#60;the older systems&#62;</SPAN> are like, I will trace their history from the remotest of your predecessors. Thales of Miletus, who was the first person to investigate these matters, said that water was the first principle of things, but that god was the mind that moulded all things out of water — supposing that gods can exist without sensation; and why did he make mind an adjunct of water, if mind can exist by itself, devoid of body? The view of Anaximander is that the gods are not everlasting but are born and perish at long intervals of time, and that they are worlds, countless in number. But how we conceive of god save as living for ever? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="26">26</A> Next, Anaximenes held that air is god, and that it has a beginning in time, and is immeasurable and infinite in extent, and is always in motion; just as if formless air could be god, especially seeing that it is proper to god to possess not merely some shape but the most beautiful shape; or as if anything that has had a beginning must not necessarily be mortal. <A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R11">11</A> Then there is Anaxagoras, the successor of Anaximenes; he was the first thinker to hold that the orderly disposition of the universe is designed and perfected by the rational power of an infinite mind. But in saying this he failed to see that there can be no such thing as sentient and continuous activity in that which is infinite, and that sensation in general can only occur when the subject itself becomes sentient by the impact of a sensation. Further, if he intended his infinite mind to be a definite living creature, it must have some inner principle of life to justify the name.


<A ID="p31"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p31 </SPAN></A>But mind is itself the innermost principle. Mind therefore will have an outer integument of body. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27">27</A> But this Anaxagoras will not allow; yet mind naked and simple, without any material adjunct to serve as an organ of sensation, seems to elude the capacity of our understanding. Alcmaeon of Croton, who attributed divinity to the sun, moon and other heavenly bodies, and also to the soul, did not perceive that he was bestowing immortality on things that are mortal. As for Pythagoras, who believed that the entire substance of the universe is penetrated and pervaded by a soul of which our souls are fragments, he failed to notice that this severance of the souls of men from the world-soul means the dismemberment and rending asunder of god; and that when their souls are unhappy, as happens to most men, then a portion of god is unhappy; which is impossible. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="28">28</A> Again, if the soul of man is divine, why is it not omniscient? Moreover, if the Pythagorean god is pure soul, how is he implanted in, or diffused throughout, the world? Next, Xenophanes endowed the universe with mind, and held that, as being infinite, it was god. His view of mind is as open to objection as that of the rest; but on the subject of infinity he incurs still severer criticism, for the infinite can have no sensation and no contact with anything outside. As for Parmenides, he invents a purely <SPAN CLASS="whole">fanci</SPAN>&shy;ful something resembling a crown — <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">stephanè</SPAN> is his name for it —, an unbroken ring of glowing lights, encircling the sky, which he entitles god; but no one can imagine this to possess divine form, or sensation. He also has many other portentous notions; he deifies war, strife, lust and the like, things which can be destroyed by disease or sleep or forgetfulness


<A ID="p33"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p33 </SPAN></A>or lapse of time; and he also deifies the stars, but this has been criticized in another philosopher and need not be dealt with now in the case of Parmenides. <A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R12">12</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29">29</A> Empedocles again among many other blunders comes to grief most disgracefully in his theology. He assigns divinity to the four substances which in his system are the constituent elements of the universe, although manifestly these substances both come into and pass out of existence, and are entirely devoid of sensation. Protagoras also, who declares he has no clear views whatever about the gods, whether they exist or do not exist, or what they are like, seems to have no notion at all of the divine nature. Then in what a maze of error is Democritus&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="

But how could the divine consciousness which he assigns to the heavens persist in a state of such rapid motion? Where moreover are all the gods of accepted belief, if we count the heavens also as a god? Again, in maintaining that god is incorporeal, he robs him entirely of sensation, and also of wisdom. Moreover, how is motion possible for an incorporeal being, and how, if he is always in motion, can he enjoy tranquillity and bliss? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34">34</A> Nor was his <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-pupil</SPAN> Xenocrates any wiser on this subject. His volumes <I>On the Nature of the Gods</I> give no intelligible account of the divine form; for he states that there are eight gods: five inhabiting the planets, and in a state of motion; one consisting of all the fixed stars, which are to be regarded as separate members constituting a single deity; seventh he adds the sun, and eighth the moon. But what sensation of bliss these things can enjoy it is impossible to conceive. Another member of the school of Plato, Heracleides of Pontus, filled volume after volume with childish fictions; at one moment he deems the world divine, at another the intellect; he also assigns divinity to the planets, and holds that the deity is devoid of sensation and mutable of form; and again in the same volume he reckons earth and sky as gods. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35">35</A> Theophrastus also is intolerably inconsistent; at one moment he assigns divine <SPAN CLASS="whole">pre‑eminence</SPAN> to mind, at another to the heavens, and then again to the constellations and stars


<A ID="p39"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p39 </SPAN></A>in the heavens. Nor is his pupil, Strato, surnamed the Natural Philosopher, worthy of attention; in his view the sole repository of divine power is nature, which contains in itself the causes of birth, growth and decay, but is entirely devoid of sensation and of form.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="36">36</A> "Lastly, Balbus, I come to your Stoic school. Zeno's view is that the law of nature is divine, and that its function is to command what is right and to forbid the opposite. How he makes out this law to be alive passes our comprehension; yet we undoubtedly expect god to be a living being. In another passage however Zeno declares that the aether is god — if there is any meaning in a god without sensation, a form of deity that never presents itself to us when we offer up our prayers and supplications and make our vows. And in other books again he holds the view that a 'reason' which pervades all nature&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref19" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">19</A> is possessed of divine power. He likewise attributes the same powers to the stars, or at another time to the years, the months and the seasons. Again, in his interpretation of Hesiod's <I>Theogony</I> (or Origin of the Gods) he does away with the customary and received ideas of the gods altogether, for he does not reckon either Jupiter, Juno or Vesta as gods, or any being that bears a personal name, but teaches that these names have been assigned allegorically to dumb and lifeless things. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37">37</A> Zeno's pupil Aristo holds equally mistaken views. He thinks that the form of the deity cannot be comprehended, and he denies the gods sensation, and in fact is uncertain whether god is a living being at all. Cleanthes, who attended Zeno's lectures at the same time as the last-named, at one moment says that the world itself is god, at another gives this


<A ID="p41"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p41 </SPAN></A>name to the mind and soul of the universe, and at another decides that the most unquestionable deity is that remote <SPAN CLASS="whole">all‑surrounding</SPAN> fiery atmosphere called the aether, which encircles and embraces the universe on its outer side at an exceedingly lofty altitude; while in the books that he wrote to combat hedonism he babbles like one demented, now imagining gods of some definite shape and form, now assigning full divinity to the stars, now pronouncing that nothing is more divine than reason. The result is that the god whom we apprehend by our intelligence, and desire to make to correspond with a mental concept as a seal tallies with its impression, has utterly and entirely vanished. <A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R15">15</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38">38</A> Persaeus, another pupil of Zeno, says that men have deified those persons who have made some discovery of special utility for civilization, and that useful and <SPAN CLASS="whole">health-giving</SPAN> things have themselves been called by divine names; he did not even say that they were discoveries of the gods, but speaks of them as actually divine. But what could be more ridiculous than to award divine honours to things mean and ugly, or to give the rank of gods to men now dead and gone, whose worship could only take the form of lamentation? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="39">39</A> Chrysippus, who is deemed to be the most skilful interpreter of the Stoic dreams, musters an enormous mob of unknown gods — so utterly unknown that even imagination cannot guess at their form and nature, although our mind appears capable of visualizing anything; for he says that divine power resides in reason, and in the soul and mind of the universe; he calls the world itself a god, and also the <SPAN CLASS="whole">all‑pervading</SPAN> world-soul, and again the guiding principle of that soul, which operates in the intellect and reason, and


<A ID="p43"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p43 </SPAN></A>the common and <SPAN CLASS="whole">all‑embracing</SPAN> nature of things; beside this, the fire that I previously termed aether; and also the power of Fate, and the Necessity that governs future events; and also all fluid and soluble substances, such as water, earth, air, the sun, moon and stars, and the <SPAN CLASS="whole">all‑embracing</SPAN> unity of things; and even those human beings who have attained immortality. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="40">40</A> He also argues that the god whom men call Jupiter is the aether, and that Neptune is the air which permeates the sea, and the goddess called Ceres the earth; and he deals in the same way with the whole series of the names of the other gods. He also identifies Jupiter with the mighty Law, everlasting and eternal, which is our guide of life and instructress in duty, and which he entitles Necessity or Fate, and the Everlasting Truth of future events; none of which conceptions is of such a nature as to be deemed to possess divinity. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41">41</A> This is what is contained in his <I>Nature of the Gods</I>, Book <SPAN CLASS="small">I</SPAN>. In Book <SPAN CLASS="small">II</SPAN> he aims at reconciling the myths of Orpheus, Musaeus, Hesiod and Homer with his own theology as enunciated in Book <SPAN CLASS="small">I</SPAN>, and so makes out that even the earliest poets of antiquity, who had no notion of these doctrines, were really Stoics. In this he is followed by Diogenes of Babylon, who in his book entitled <I>Minerva</I> rationalizes the myth of the birth of the virgin goddess from Jove by explaining it as an allegory of the processes of nature.

This property is termed by Epicurus <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">isonomia</SPAN>, or the principle of uniform distribution. From this principle it follows that if the whole number of mortals be so many, there must exist no less a number of immortals, and if the causes of destruction are beyond count, the causes of conservation also are bound to be infinite.

"You Stoics are also fond of asking us, Balbus, what is the mode of life of the gods and how they pass their days. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="51">51</A> The answer is, their life is the happiest conceivable, and the one most bountifully furnished with all good things. God is entirely inactive and free from all ties of occupation; he toils not neither does he labour, but he takes delight in his own wisdom and


<A ID="p53"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p53 </SPAN></A>virtue, and knows with absolute certainty that he will always enjoy pleasures at once consummate and everlasting. <A CLASS="chapter" NAME="R20">20</A> <A CLASS="sec" NAME="52">52</A> This is the god whom we should call happy in the proper sense of the term; your Stoic god seems to us to be grievously overworked. If the world itself is god, what can be less restful than to revolve at incredible speed round the axis of the heavens without a single moment of respite? but repose is an essential condition of happiness. If on the other hand some god resides within the world as its governor and pilot, maintaining the courses of the stars, the changes of the seasons and all the ordered process of creation, and keeping a watch on land and sea to guard the interests and lives of men, why, what a bondage of irksome and laborious business is his! <A CLASS="sec" NAME="53">53</A> We for our part deem happiness to consist in tranquillity of mind and entire exemption from all duties. For he who taught us all the rest has also taught us that the world was made by nature, without needing an artificer to construct it, and that the act of creation, which according to you cannot be performed without divine skill, is so easy, that nature will create, is creating and has created worlds without number. You on the contrary cannot see how nature can achieve all this without the aid of some intelligence, and so, like the tragic poets, being unable to bring the plot of your drama to a <SPAN LANG="fr" CLASS="French">dénouement</SPAN>, you have recourse to a god;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref24" HREF="

Well

But what value can be assigned to a philosophy which thinks that everything happens by fate? it is a belief for old women, and ignorant old women at that. And next follows your doctrine of <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">mantikē</SPAN>, or Divination, which would so steep us in superstition, if we consented to listen to you, that we should be the devotees of soothsayers, augurs, <SPAN CLASS="whole">oracle-mongers</SPAN>, seers and interpreters of dreams. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56">56</A> But Epicurus has set us free from superstitious terrors and delivered us out of captivity, so that we have no fear of beings who, we know, create no trouble for themselves and seek to cause none to others, while we worship with pious reverence the transcendent majesty of nature.

<h3>Ossett Grammar School 1735 - 1969 </h3>
<p align="justify"><img src="images/OGS_Badge.jpg" alt="OGS School Badge" width="177" height="200" hspace="8" vspace="3" align="left">In 1700, Ossett consisted of a number of scattered hamlets, arranged in a ring with the chapel-of-ease at the centre. The greater part of the district was unenclosed pasture land, on which householders had the right to feed sheep, cattle, and geese. It was on a vacant piece of land near the Church that the Founders built the &quot;Free School&quot; paying a rent of two pence a year to the Lord of the Manor &quot;if and when demanded.&quot; The school being variously described as Free School, Charity School and later, Grammar School. 'Charity School' was used of any school controlled by the Charity Commissioners, by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>School Committee and Public Subscriptions </strong><br>
In the early 1700s, education for all was highly topical and Locke, in 1693, published his famous essay, in which he pleaded for learning to be provided not only for the sons of the landed gentry and of professional men, lawyers, doctors, clergy, civil servants and such, but also for the children of farm labourers and mechanics. Five prominent men in London formed the National Society for Promoting Education of the Poor to arrange for the teaching  of children. Committees were organised in various districts throughout the country by this group to start and maintain educational establishments. One such Committee was formed in Ossett before 1727. </p>
<p align="justify">About ten years later, by collecting subscriptions and their own gifts, they raised sufficient funds  to erect a small classroom on waste land facing the chapel-of-ease in Ossett - the beginning of Ossett Grammar School, which was established specifically &quot;for teaching the poor children within the township of Ossett&quot;. Later, this classroom became a small, low kitchen attached to the master's dwelling house. After the building of the first school and school house, the money remaining from the contributions was used to purchase four cottages in Cluntergate, Horbury; rents and profits from these houses was paid to the schoolmaster in half-yearly payments. When the lands in Horbury were divided, the trustees received a quarry and a parcel of waste land at Addington, together with two sittings free of charge in Horbury St. Peters Church. On the enclosure of the common land in Ossett at the beginning of the of the 19th century, the Commissioners awarded to the school, the half of the field at the corner of where Horbury Road and Sowood Lane meet; the other half of the field was given to the school a little later. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Church Links </strong><br>
In 1795, the schoolmaster was the Reverend T. Whitaker, curate-in-charge of the Chapel of Ease, close to the school Other curates are likely to have acted as schoolmasters. Early in the nineteenth century, the school was still closely associated with the Church and Ossett townsfolk complained that the governors and trustees conducted the school as a Church institution. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1836, Ann Haigh bequeathed more land to the school and the school was regarded clearly as an institution associated with the Church. If the schoolmaster ceased to attend and be a member of the Church of England, the trustees themselves were to cease the rents and profits to be used for repairing and improving the school and schoolhouse.</p>
<p align="justify">Early in the 1820s, the schoolmaster was Mr. J. Webster. He was a man of exceptional energy and ability. He wrote a &quot;<em>Grammar of English Language</em>&quot; which was held in high repute as a text book. He also compiled an Arithmetic textbook and invented a system of Shorthand. Webster was succeeded by Mr. William Cullingworth who died in 1847. Cullingworth's widow remained in the schoolhouse for a time and kept a school for girls before she moved to Dewsbury.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Competition</strong><br>
There was competition from schools founded by religious denominations  and the expansion of elementary education in the first-half of the 19th century affected the Ossett school. It seems to have been mainly for primary education, though educational opportunities for older pupils were available. New sectarian schools drew away pupils and the Ossett school had to become an institution of higher education in spite of competition from established schools in Dewsbury and Wakefield. </p>
<p align="justify">External difficulties at this time were matched by internal problems. The practice of the headmaster receiving the rents from the school's properties in return for education fifteen poor scholars from Ossett had changed. The trustees had begun to keep the rents and now employed a master to instruct ten poor children with the profits from the fee-paying scholars. The rental income retained by the trustees was used to maintain the property and to keep it in good repair. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1805, the the trustees enlarged the school with an extension (in which the Ossett parish hearse was stored during the 1870s.)  In 1837, the trustees made a great effort and erected a two-storey building, the last important alteration and this is the building shown below pictured in about 1900. The school building has been described as 'more like a tithe barn or warehouse than a school' and the premises had a single large room with a coke store in the centre and a blackboard at one end. Such playground as the boys had was the market-place outside. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Old_Ossett_Grammar.jpg" alt="Old Ossett Grammar School circa 1900" width="500" height="346"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> Old Ossett Grammar School in the centre of Ossett, which was demolished to make way for the new Town Hall,  opened in 1908. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>35 Pupils</strong><br>
In 1828, a Commission of Enquiry was conducted and the school was placed again on its formal footing for internal administration. Unfortunately, the school was not as prosperous as it was, and the number of boys in the school fell to 35, though in 1867, at the inspection by the Endowed School Commissioners, the number had risen to 67. The headmaster at this time was Mr. S.H. Kendall. The additional numbers proved too much for the limited space available in the school premises and the Wesley Street school premises (next to the Wesleyan Chapel) had to be rented for the extra pupils. The curriculum seems to have been typical of 19th century Grammar Schools with mathematics and Latin included, but no science or modern languages - these were to be added later.</p>
<p align="justify">In Mr. Kendall's time as headmaster, with the growth in secondary education, the building in the town centre proved too small altogether, but the endowments were not sufficient to fund extensions. Various suggestions were rejected, for example, to provide places with the endowment for Ossett children at Dewsbury or Wakefield schools; to join the Ossett and Dewsbury endowments to build one school, or to make one school for Ossett, Horbury and Thornhill. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Expansion</strong><br>
The population of Ossett had begun to increase rapidly after 1837 and in 1845, an elementary school was erected in South Ossett at which point the &quot;Free Grammar School&quot; changed its character. Like the grammar schools of Dewsbury and Batley, Ossett Grammar School, was at first a &quot;Free School&quot;, that is an endowment was created to enable a certain number of scholars to be taught without the payment of fees. Gradually the names were changed to &quot;Free Grammar Schools&quot; and then to just &quot;Grammar Schools&quot;. It was deemed by the trust-deed that scholars must be taught &quot;reading, writing and accounts&quot; and legally, a charge could have been made for additional subjects, but this was never done at Ossett Grammar School. The trust-deed also required the master to attend divine service regularly every Sunday at church. </p>
<p align="justify">In June 1881, the number of Trustees, which had fallen to three was increased to seven. Their first act was to raise funds to improve the school and the master's dwelling house. They appointed Mr. Michael Frankland of York (from 90 applicants) to the headmastership in December 1881 and he held the appointment for 31 years. </p>
<p align="justify">At about the time that Frankland was appointed as headmaster, attempts were made to claim a share from the distribution of Wheelwright Charities in Dewsbury. The Ossett trustees wanted &pound;3,000. They would then sell the existing school site and building, but with the &pound;3,000, they would build a new secondary school. The Commissioners ruled instead that Ossett children should find scholarship places at the Dewsbury Wheelwright Grammar School. Another 25 years was to pass before further progress was made to re-site the Grammar School.</p>
<p align="justify">Attempts were made to bring the curriculum up to standard. French was introduced and so was Greek. Fees varied; &pound;3 per year for under-12s; &pound;8 per year for over-15s. Latin brought an increased fee; and &pound;1 was added if algebra went beyond simple equations, or if Euclid went beyond Book One. Seven free places were decided by examination - usually from between ten and twelve candidates. These free-place scholars had to carry out menial duties in the school, such as sweeping rooms and lighting fires. </p>
<p align="justify">The school now began to prepare pupils for entrance to Universities as well as for business life, and scholars from the school gained notable distinctions at various well-established Universities. The Trustees increased the annual value of the endowment from &pound;26 to &pound;54 and in 1892, Miss Hannah Pickard of Green Mount, Ossett bequeathed &pound;2,100 for the purpose of founding two scholarships open to pupils who had been born in Ossett. </p>
<p align="justify">When Ossett became a borough, the Grammar School site was coveted by the new Town Council for its proposed new civic hall. The 1902 Education Act and the subsequent establishment of the West Riding County Council as the local education authority paved the way for the trustees of, what was still at the time, a charitable foundation to transfer the trust property, money and endowments to the Education Committee of Ossett Town Council. Representatives from  Horbury Urban District Council were added to the Education Committee later. </p>
<p align="justify">A new scheme was approved by the trustees at their last meeting at 1, Sunnydale Terrace, Ossett on the 13th July 1906. Councillor Westwood chaired the meeting, attended by Messrs. Glover, Marsden and Smith and in September 1907 a new era began with the co-educational Ossett Grammar School opening at its new location at Park House, off Storrs Hill Road.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/OGS_Park_House.jpg" alt="Park House - Ossett Grammar School" width="500" height="318"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> Park House as it was before the red-brick extensions, on the left of the building, were added in the 1920s and 1930s to cater for an increase in pupils at the school.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Park House </strong><br>
  In 1904, the old Grammar School had to move from the  centre of Ossett, to make way for the construction of the new Town  Hall. For a while, the school was housed in the Central Baptist  schoolroom in old Church Street. When the Town Council took over the management of Ossett  Grammar School in 1905, it was decided that the School should be a dual  School with mixed-sex classes, the first of its type in the  West Riding. The trustees were replaced by a Board of Governors, composed of representatives from Ossett Town Council, Horbury UDC, the West Riding County Council and a representative from Leeds University. Two ladies were co-opted since the school was co-educational. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Ossett_Grammar_1907_Postcard.jpg" width="500" height="312" alt="Ossett Grammar School 1907"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> Park House pictured in 1907 after it became Ossett Grammar School.</p>
<p align="justify">Eventually, Ossett Corporation  purchased Park House for &pound;2,500, the value no doubt reduced because it  had been used for the convalescence of victims of a smallpox epidemic.  Meantime, the school continued at the Central Baptist schoolroom with  60 scholars until the end of the school year 1906-1907, whilst  alterations at Park House were completed. </p>
<p align="justify">Park  House, set in three acres of land (and nearby Rock House, which is virtually identical) was built in  1867 at a cost of &pound;20,000 for Philip Ellis, a partner in Ellis Brothers, cloth manufacturers, then the owners of the adjacent  Victoria Mills (Burmatex). The Ellis brothers made their fortune by  selling cloth for uniforms to both sides during the Franco-Prussian war  (1870-1871) and the company occupied an unrivalled position in the West Riding as the manufacturers of army clothes. Philip Ellis died in 1877 and then there was a major slump in the cloth weaving trade in 1880  caused by tariffs on British goods by Continental countries. Many  Ossett mill owners were unable to adapt and the Ellis family had to put  Park House up for sale. By 1893, the business failed completely, following the death of Mr. W. Gartside, a local dyer, who lived at Wesley House, and whose executors called upon Eli Ellis, the surviving partner of Ellis Brothers, to pay them outstanding debts of &pound;40,000 in cash. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Map_Park_House.jpg" alt="Park House Map 1900" width="493" height="380"></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Above:</strong> Late 19th or very early 20th century map of Park House as it was prior to the relocation of Ossett Grammar School from the Market Place. Nearby Victoria Mill was disused at the time this map was surveyed. </p>
<p align="justify">With its ornate staircase and beautiful stained-glass windows with representative designs of Art, Science, Literature and Music, Park House was formally opened by Alderman T.W. Bentley, Chairman of the Education Committee and of the newly-constituted Governors, for the commencement of the Autumn term, on the 24th September 1906, with a largely increased roll of 95 scholars and an augmented staff of 7. The new premises provided accommodation for 135 scholars, with Headmaster's and Governors' room, common rooms for male and female staff, six classrooms, and art room, dining room, chemistry laboratory, which was also arranged for tuition in physics, and a manual instruction and cookery room. All this enabled the Governors to widen the scope of instruction at the school.</p>
<p align="justify">In 1913, Mr. Frankland vacated the headship, and Mr. H.G. Mayo of Norwich School was appointed. Ossett and district shared with the remainder of the country the desire that their youth should have the benefits of a good secondary education, and the number of scholars at Ossett Grammar School gradually increased. In January 1918, Mr. Mayo took up a position at Bristol Grammar School and the headship was filled by Mr. G. Clark who had previously held the position of second master at the Lowestoft Secondary School. Mr Clark died in 1924 and his successor, Dr. H.G. Chapman was appointed on the 1st October 1924. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1921, the Governors erected three temporary wooden classrooms for the purpose of establishing a Preparatory Department, for which there had been a demand for a good many years. It is possible that this wooden building was still in use up to 1962 complete with gas lighting. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/OssettGrammarSchoolParkHse_jpg.jpg" alt="Ossett Grammar School" width="501" height="285"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> Park House, Ossett, which became Ossett Grammar School in September 1907. More modern extensions can be seen on the left, which date from the 1920s. Park House is typical of the Gothic style of the day, with many gables, semi-ecclesiastical windows, arched doorways and a great deal of heavily ornate carved stonework.</p>
<p align="justify">Inside, despite a 100 years' use as a school, Park House retains much of its original character. The highly decorative tiled floor of the main hallway, its pattern echoed in the tiles of the fireplace, still looks remarkably fresh and has worn far better than later tiling in some of the doorways. The fireplace retains its lavishly carved canopy mantelpiece. Elsewhere, there is carved wood in abundance. Pulpit-like carvings support the half arch at the foot of the stairs. The newel posts at each turn of the stairs are similarly ornate. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1919, the Governors in consultation with the local Education Authority and the West Riding County Council considered adding permanent extensions to the Park House building to provide additional accommodation for 300 scholars. Plans were prepared by the West Riding Education Architect for an additional assembly hall, gymnasium, baths, domestic science rooms, chemical and physics laboratory with lecture room, elementary and advanced art rooms, manual instruction and metal-working rooms, commercial and music rooms and a library. This work was finally completed in the late 1920s and the Rt. Hon. Lord Eustace Percy, President of the Board of Education opened the new permanent extensions on the 30th October 1928. By now, there were about 230 pupils at the school, with a staff consisting of the headmaster, second master, two assistant masters, senior assistant mistress, seven assistant mistresses, art master and visiting staff for domestic subjects, manual instruction and commercial subjects. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1927, the Governors had set aside and annual sum of &pound;30 from the school  endowment to provide a &quot;Leaving Scholarship&quot; to enable one student to proceed to University. There were also six Entrance Scholarships, known as the &quot;Pickard Scholarships&quot;, which were competed for annually by the children attending primary schools in Ossett. </p>
<p align="justify">The Hepworth Trust was created by Hepworth Bros. Ltd. In  1943, to provide scholarships to Ossett   Grammar School. When fees  were abolished as a result of the 1944 Education Act, the deed was amended so  that the funds might be used for other educational purposes. In 1950, it was  decided that these funds could most suitably be used for the refurnishing of  the school library, and a sum of money from the Trust Funds was allocated for  the purchase of new books</p>
<p align="justify">During WW2, it was decided that Ossett Grammar School should be protected against bombing and fire by having a team of firewatchers on duty each night. In the event, the precautions proved to be unnecessary but every night a team consisting one master and several of the senior boys did their bit for King and country. Among the boys, it was a popular activity and the nightly payment of 9d (3.75p) ostensibly to provide a supper was generally regarded as a useful supplement to pocket-money. </p>

I don't know the origin of this picture but judging from the foot in the foreground, it was by one of the boys. The playing field was to the right of the road which led to the Chemistry Room, which I think was part of the old Park House stable block. The field is on a steep slope, but I recall playing cricket there at break times in summer. The old Victoria Mill chimney is very prominent in the background of the picture. </p>

<p align="justify">Dr. Chapman was succeeded as headmaster by Mr. E.C. Axford in January 1945 who remained there until he retired in July 1965. I remember Mr. Axford well during my time at the school in the 1960s and he struck me as a kindly man dedicated to the school and its pupils. Mr Axford was replaced by Mr. J.E.H. Kingdon, who was headmaster from September 1965 to December 1972, when he left Ossett for another school. Mr. Kingdon's successor was Mr. Roy Yates, who took up his duties on the 1st January 1973. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1969 , as a result of the policy by the then Labour Government's Antony Crosland, who had been appointed as Secretary of State for Education and Science by Harold Wilson, Ossett Grammar School ceased to exist and was amalgamated with Ossett Secondary School (Southdale School) to form a comprehensive to be known as 'Ossett School'.  It seemed to be an urgent but in my view, a totally misguided personal crusade for Crosland, who vowed in his  famous quotation: "<em>If it's the last thing I do, I'm going to destroy  every f . . . . . g Grammar School in England - and Wales and Northern Ireland.</em>"  The outcome has been a source of controversy ever since, with the result that very few Grammar Schools now remain in England and the majority of those left are fee-paying. Quite the opposite of what the original founders of education for all classes of people had in mind in the 18th Century. </p>
<p align="justify">Selective places continued to be found for children from Horbury and the surrounding villages until September 1973, when Horbury Secondary School became a comprehensive school, taking all children at 11 years in a comprehensive intake. </p>
<p align="justify">Further extensions were added in 1967 and then again in 1969, when the school became a Comprehensive, with the addition of a new Sports Hall and a Lower and Upper School. With the raising of the school leaving age to 16 in 1973, the Upper School became crowded overnight, with nearly 300 16 year-olds now in the fifth year. </p>

The long driveway from Storrs Hill Road is visible centre right and the school sports complex is just to the north side of the driveway. Some of the old playing field on the south side of the driveway has now been turned into a staff car park.</p>
<p align="justify">On April 1st 1974, after local government re-organisation, under which the West Riding County Council and Ossett Borough Council disappeared, the school was placed under the administration of Wakefield District Council, with a board of Governors nominated by the District Council, plus three co-opted members, a teacher representative, a parent representative and the headmaster. </p>
<p align="justify"><img src="images/Ossett_School.jpg" alt="Ossett School" width="200" height="150" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="left">In the event, thanks to some very fine teachers and a progressive headmaster, <a href="https://ossett.accordmat.org/">Ossett Academy</a> has blossomed to become one of the best performing Comprehensive schools in the country. It is said that house prices have risen sharply in Ossett and Horbury as parents move to the area so that their children can attend the school. Ossett School has had Technology College status since 1996 and Sports College status since 2006. In the Spring of 2006, Ossett School became one of the few state schools to be awarded a dual specialist status. The school will now be known as a  Specialist Technology and Sports College. In 2008, there were 1,450 pupils at the school with 260 in the Sixth Form. The new Sixth-Form college, Drake House, was opened in 2005 and was named after David Drake, a long-standing Governor at Ossett School. </p>
<p>The OfSTED Report in January 2007 described the school as &lsquo;Outstanding&rsquo;:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Standards are above average and students achieve well  throughout the school. GCSE results are better than might be expected  in relation to students&rsquo; standards when they arrive in Year 7. The  proportion of students gaining five or more grades A*-C is especially  good and almost all students gain five or more passes at grades A*-G.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Students&rsquo; behaviour is exemplary in lessons and around the school.&quot;</em>

<h4>MICHAEL FRANKLAND <a name="Frankland"></a> - Headmaster when Ossett Grammar School relocated to Park House in 1906 </h4>

<h4>by Anne-Marie Fawcett </h4>
<p align="justify"><em><strong>&quot;INUTILE UTILE EX ARTE&quot;</strong></em><strong> - Ever wondered who decided to adopt this Latin phrase as the town's motto? Yes, the same Michael Frankland</strong>.</p>
<p align="justify">Michael Frankland was born in Beckfoot, Bingley on May 23rd, 1848. The Frankland family moved to Keighley some time later. He received his education under the<a href="https://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/history-william-booth" target="_blank"> Reverend W Booth.</a> After a short time at the Choir School of York Minster, in 1869  on his 21st birthday, he became the Headmaster of Lanercost Parish School, Northumberland.  During his time at Lanercost he assisted in founding the<em> &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;</em> newspaper and subscribed shares. When he left Lanercost he was presented with a microscope and a small library of books. </p>
<p align="justify">After about seven years in Northumberland, in 1876 he became Headmaster of Goathland Endowed School, where he founded a school library, which eventually became the parish library. As headmaster of Goathland school he introduced Latin and French. Within three years he had raised the number of scholars from 17 to 130. Many of these boys went on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and to London University. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/old_OGS.jpg" width="500" height="360" alt="The old Ossett Grammar School"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> Another view of the old Ossett Grammar School located in Ossett Market Place that was demolished in 1905, and located roughly where Ossett Town Hall now stands.</p>
<p align="justify">There was no school in Ossett for the poor until 1733 when a decision was made to found a school by public subscription and private donations. Two years later the opening of the school took place. In July 1754 the purpose of the school was slightly enlarged so that it could teach reading, writing and accounting. About 1832, due to rivalry with other schools and a drop in numbers (35 boys) it became a school of higher education. Mathematics and Latin were now introduced. By 1870 there were 67 boys in attendance. In 1881 it was decided that a properly qualified person should be engaged as school master.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Frankland_class.jpg" width="500" height="302" alt="Michale Frankland Class"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> Michael Frankland (seated centre) at Park House, the new Ossett Grammar School with  pupils or possibly pupil teachers.</p>
<p align="justify"> In 1881 Mr Frankland, his wife Mary Ann n&eacute;e Holmes (who died on Hallowe'en two years later, aged 37) and their four sons, Francis 6 , John 4 , Claude 3 and James 1, moved to Ossett where he became the Headmaster of Ossett Grammar School. He was the only permanent master at the school and he lived at the side of it. But not the school we know now. This school had only one room and was sited approximately where the Town Hall now sits. </p>
<p align="justify">Each month Mr Frankland would collect the rent from the school cottages. This money would then be used to pay the fees of the ten poor children who would enter the school. At 9 a.m. the 50 fee paying scholars, all boys, would line up with their money. A term cost &pound;1.6s.8d. The boys were taught simple equations and Geometry, French (introduced by Mr Frankland), Art/ Drawing (by Mr Wilson) plus History and Geography. </p>
<p align="justify">Science lessons were rare and the study of Commerce was taken very seriously. The Chamber of Commerce would award a gold medal to the best commercial scholar.  At midday the boys would go home to dinner and on their way they may have come across rivals from the Wesleyan School, which was located just around the corner. School finished at 4 p.m. Though at 5.30 p.m. the Pickard and Haigh Scholarship boys would return to school, where they would spend an hour studying Latin. </p>
<p align="justify">With the passing of the Education Act in 1902 a Board of Governors replaced the old trustees. In 1905 the old school was demolished to make way for the Town Hall. For a while, the school was housed in the Central Baptist schoolroom before taking up residence at Park House in 1906. After the old building had been sold and before a new one was found, the whole school was rearranged and it became a dual school, allowing girls to be educated alongside the boys. The first school of its kind in the West Riding.  </p>
<p align="justify">Due to the rapidly increasing number of pupils two large huts were built on the land adjacent to Park House. These soon became inadequate so it was decided to build a new extension.  The new building was erected in 1928 at a cost of &pound;20,000. Mr Frankland remained as headmaster until he retired in 1913. When he retired from OGS he was presented with gifts including an easy chair, Chamber's Encyclopedia and a purse of gold from past and present pupils.</p>
<p align="justify">The<em> &quot;Ossett Observer&quot;</em> of April 1932 said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> <em>&quot;Mr Frankland exerted a marked influence on the town from the time he entered it 50 years ago is indisputable and large numbers of its sons and daughters owe their success in life to his conscientious and efficient service. He had the satisfaction of seeing his pupils gain first place in the honours list at Cambridge, London and the Victoria Universities&quot;</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> He was succeeded at Ossett Grammar School by H.G. Mayo, who pre-deceased him. In 1932 (when Frankland died) the head teacher was Dr. Chapman who had been in charge since 1928, following the early death of the next head Mr. G. Clarke. </p>
<p align="justify">For 17 years, Frankland was a member of the committee of the Mechanics Institute and Technical School in Ossett. He was presented with a gold watch when he resigned. He was a member of the Yorkshire Association for the Promotion of Commercial Education and a member of several Yorkshire societies for the advancement of special branches of learning.  </p>
<p align="justify">He was secretary of Ossett Chamber of Commerce for 17 years and was president  in 1912. Frankland represented the chamber in Paris, Dublin and other conferences and was made a life member.  For some time he was secretary to the United Heavy Woollen District Chambers of Commerce, resigning in 1907. He was a vice president of the Yorkshire Dialect Society and wrote a lot about the subject. One year he  won first prize for his article on the Yorkshire dialect and this was published in several newspapers. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> 6, Sunnydale Terrace, the Ossett home of Michael Frankland.</p>
<p align="justify">For a long time he was a constant contributor to the press and also had his short  stories printed in London magazines.  He was president of the Ossett Chess Club, vice president of Dewsbury Chess Club and president of Wakefield Chess and Drafts Club. A busy man!  He was a long time member of Ossett Cricket Club and a regular on the bowling green.  He was a prominent Liberal and members of the Liberal Club presented him with a silver rose  bowl on his 80th birthday. </p>
<p align="justify">By his first marriage he had four sons:  </p>
<p align="justify">The Rev. Francis W.B. Frankland (1875-1952), a Cambridge Wrangler and Fellow of Clare College. At the time of his father's death he was Vicar of Wrawby, Lancashire. </p>
<p align="justify">The Rev. (Dr.) John Naylor Frankland (1877-1962).  When his father died, John Frankland was headmaster of Bablake Grammar School in Coventry.  </p>
<p align="justify">Third son, Claude Deane Frankland (1878-1927) was killed in a mountaineering accident at Great Gable in the Lake District on the 31st July, 1927. His wife was sister to Councillor Patterson (chairman of the O.G.S. School Governors).    </p>
<p align="justify">Youngest son, James Harwood Frankland (1880-1965) was a bank manager in Buxton.  </p>
<p align="justify">Michael Frankland's only daughter Mabel was born on the 30th April 1917 from his second marriage, in early 1917, to Edith Hills (1877-1951). Mabel was a pupil at Ossett Grammar School when her father died. </p>
<p align="justify">Michael Frankland passed away at his home, 6, Sunnydale Terrace, Ossett at the age of 84 in 1932. He was survived by his second wife 52 year-old Edith (n&eacute;e Hills), their daughter Mabel (born 1917) and three of his four sons. He was buried in a family grave at Oakwood Parish Church in Keighley.</p>

			  <strong>Ossett Grammar School War Memorial</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/OGS_War_Memorial.jpg" alt="OGS War Memorial" width="144" height="108"> </p>
<p>The<a href="ww2.html" target="_blank"> School War Memorial</a> was unveiled and dedicated on the  10th November, 1951, by the Lord Bishop of Wakefield. The memorial fund realised &pound;280. A  grand piano was purchased and two bronze tablets, on which were inscribed  the names of those members of the school who gave their lives in the two world  wars, were placed in the Assembly Hall.</p>
<p>The memorial plaques commemorates the 20 ex-Ossett Grammar School pupils who died serving their country during WW2.</p>
<p>The names on the plaque are as follows, with a little history on a selected few:</p>
<p>J. W. Bagley<br>
F. Bretton<br>
C. Broadbent<br>
A. G. Chapman
<p><em>Allan Garfield Chapman was the son of Ossett Grammar headmaster Dr. Harry Garfield Chapman. He was a 2nd Lieutenant in the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and he died aged 21 on the 22nd November 1941 after succumbing to a heart attack in the showers after a game of rugby union when playing for his regiment. 
</em>

One starboard engine failed and soon afterwards, the aircraft was shot down by flak and a night fighter. JB-862 crashed near Munchengladbach, killing all the crew except one Canadian, who became a PoW. Douglas Gartery was 23 and is buried in Rheinburg War Cemetery.
</em>
<p>
  A. V. Haigh<br>

Based at the  terminus of the railway at Thanbyuzayat in Burma, he was one of twelve prisoners of war killed by Allied bombing raids on the 1st June 1943, aged 23
  </em>
<p>W. Smith<br>
    C. Taylor<br>
    F. R. Vaile<br>
    A. N. Wilby
<p><em>26 year-old Arthur Nightingale Wilby was a telegraphist aboard the cruiser HMS Neptune when it sailed into an uncharted minefield off the coast of Tripoli, Libya on the night of the 19th December 1941. The Neptune sank with the loss of 764 officers and men. Only one man survived in the water for five days before being picked up by an Italian torpedo boat. This was one of the most extensive but least known naval disasters of WW2.</em>
<p>A. Worth </p>
<p><em>Arthur Worth from Horbury Bridge had just celebrated his 20th birthday in Algiers where he was stationed with the Royal Engineers. On the 16th of July 1943, Arthur was in Algiers Harbour with 1031 Docks Operating Company, helping to load the Norwegian freighter <a href="http://www.warsailors.com/singleships/bjorkhaug.html">&quot;Bjorkhaug&quot;</a>, which was one of a convoy of ammunition ships; it was just after the Allied invasion of Sicily so the pressure to load quickly was intense. <br>
    <br>
Arthur was supervising the loading 38 tons of German anti-tank mines by Arab dockers.   Due to a mistake in the rush to load the ship, the ignition mechanisms inside the mines had not been removed and they were live, despite the crew being assured they were safe. 32 tons had already been loaded when there were two huge explosions. <br>
<br>
It appears that a load of mines fell out of the cargo-nets into the hold, which triggered the first blast - this in turn setting off the second. The captain, Ole Sandvik, and 9 of his crew <br>
  were killed, as were between 300 and 1,000 dock-workers, including, sadly, Arthur Worth whose body was never found. <br>
  <br>
  The docks were such a mess that the exact number of dead will probably never be known.</em></p>
<p><strong>Christopher Cavania Sanders, RA, 1905-1991</strong></p>
<p>In 1916, whilst WW1 was raging in Europe, a pupil called Christopher Cavania Sanders, who had been born at Hall Green, near Wakefield on Christmas Day 1905, became a new pupil at Ossett Grammar School. </p>

<p><strong>Above:</strong> Christopher Cavania Sanders circa 1935.</p>
<p>Sanders went on to become a well-known artist and a member of the Royal Academy. One of his creations was the first Birds custard logo, which he designed just before WW2.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/bird1.jpg" width="140" height="176" alt="Birds Logo"></p>
<p><strong>Above: </strong>Birds logo created by Sanders.</p>
<p>Christopher was the son of Alfred and Sarah Sanders. Alfred was a horse trader and Sarah ran a small millinery shop, which changed into a general store in the late 1930s. Alfred had been born in Leeds, but Sarah came from Earlsheaton, Dewsbury. Her own parents were Francis and Frances Blakeley (nee Senior). For reasons not yet known, Christopher was brought up by the Blakeley's, his maternal grandparents, until 1917. This Blakeley family line can be traced back to 1585, around Flockton and Horbury, as well as Ossett.</p>
<p>By the time of his grandfather's death in 1917, he was already attending Ossett Grammar School and the family were living at 14, Church Street, Ossett (now demolished). It proved necessary for Christopher and his grandmother to then move to Hall Green to live with his parents, but he continued to attend the Grammar School, cycling there daily, a matter of six or seven miles each way.</p>
<p>Christopher always spoke with affection of his time at Ossett Grammar School and his school report for the Spring Term of 1920 shows that he thrived there. He enjoyed sport and his football shirt from circa 1920 still exists, as does a team photograph of that time with him possibly wearing the shirt. He also spoke of the sprinting of a classmate, Jackie Fossett, as always being just too good for him.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Upper Westgate, Wakefield.jpg" width="140" height="117" alt="Upper Westgate, Wakefield"></p>
<p><strong>Above:</strong><em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/artists/christopher-sanders/paintings/slideshow#/0" target="_new"> &quot;Upper Westgate&quot;</a></em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/artists/christopher-sanders/paintings/slideshow#/0"> in Wakefield</a> by C. Cavania Sanders, which is part of the Wakefield Museum Collection in the Hepworth Gallery and was donated by M. Crossland.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important aspects of his time at the Grammar School was the encouragement he received from an Art Master, perhaps the &quot;FNR&quot; who initialled his school report, to go on and develop his drawing and painting ability. Certainly, by the time he left Ossett Grammar School, Christopher was having private art lessons in Wakefield and this soon led to him attending Leeds Art College. From there he gained admission to the Royal College of Art in London, where he met Barbara Louise Stubbs, the daughter of a bank manager. They married in Heston, Middlesex in 1931.</p>
<p>Very strongly influenced by Impressionist painters such as Cezanne, Pizarro, Manet and Van Gogh, and even more by so by modern painters such as Christopher Wood, Christopher Sanders was very much a purist painter who disliked being involved in commercial art. Nevertheless, he was forced into this by the need to earn a living and in the 1930s, he illustrated books, drew railway posters and created fabric patterns for the the seating used on the London Underground system. He also created the first Birds Custard logo and after WW2, he drew illustrations for some of the Janet and John books for James Nesbitt, publishers. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/September_Flowers.jpg" width="140" height="143" alt="September Flowers"></p>
<p><strong>Above:</strong> <em>&quot;September Flowers&quot; </em>by C. Cavania Sanders, ARA, which was painted between 1953 and 1961.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, he started exhibiting at the Royal Academy under the name C. Cavania Sanders. He played for Hounslow Hockey Club and later developed into a scratch golfer at Home Park golf club near Kingston-upon-Thames.</p>
<p>At the start of WW2, Christopher was living in Firs Drive, Cranford, near Hounslow and was put into a reserved occupation as a draughtsman working in St. Albans. His paintings at the time reflected the war period, being of aerodromes and barbed wire. His link with St. Albans continued after the war as he started teaching at St. Albans School of Art. He also did commercial work for the agent J. Walter Thompson.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s, Christopher was being recognised as a serious painter and this led to him being elected as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1953. He won a Gold Medal at the Paris Salon in the mid-1950s and was elected as a Royal Academician in 1961.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/C_Cavania_Sanders.jpg" width="140" height="159" alt="Christopher Cavania Sanders RA circa 1955"></p>
<p><strong>Above:</strong> Christopher Cavania Sanders, RA, circa 1955</p>
<p>From the mid-1950s until 1967, when his wife died, Christopher made several painting trips to southern France and Italy, concentrating on landscapes. There were also trips to Suffolk, around Stoke-by-Nayland. As a member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, he was commissioned to paint Dr. W.N. Pickles, first President of the College of General Practitioners, David Patrick Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir and Francis Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed of Stapenhill, whose portrait sits in Balliol College, Oxford. </p>
<p>As with so many artists, Christopher's work reflected changes of interest. Mostly landscapes, with all initial work painted in the open air, he was interested in the play and reflections of light. He loved the searing light and blue skies of Provence and in the last years before he suffered from a series of strokes, there were visits to Dubrovnik and the painting of roofs.</p>
<p>In 1980, Christopher had a stroke, but was able to continue almost normally until another stroke almost disabled him a year later. After his second stroke, he was unable to use his right arm and hand, so he switched to using his left. He was no longer able to manage detail, but his paintings somehow became more spontaneous. As Sidney Hutchinson, then secretary to the Royal Academy put it in Christopher's obituary, &quot;these pictures lack the detail and subtlety of his earlier work but, to some modern tastes, are more appealing.&quot;</p>
<p>To some of his colleagues and indeed to any adversaries, he must have appeared intransigent, showing supposed Yorkshire &quot;bloody-mindedness&quot; on many occasions. He hated what he felt was cant or falseness and would resist it with verbal force. By contrast, many of his students appeared to appreciate his directness and guidance, some turning to him as a mentor as their careers developed. </p>
<p>He had many friends, amongst them Edward Pullee, for many years the Principal of the Leeds College of Art and comments made by them during his lifetime, as well as after his death, suggested that they appreciated his charm, humour and wit, as well as his generosity with both time and money. It was these qualities perhaps, allied to his strong principles, his ideas and his willingness to fight for them that made him an attractive person for many.</p>
<p>He was fortunate that by the time of his strokes that he had re-established a friendship with Joy Owen, whom he had known during his college days and she spent much time nursing him during his final years. He died of pneumonia on the 7th August 1991 and his ashes are in St Leonard's churchyard in Heston, together with those of his wife, Barbara.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Mabel_Ferrett.jpg" width="140" height="108" alt="Mabel Ferrett"></p>
<p><strong>Mabel Ferrett, nee Frankland</strong> was the youngest daughter of Ossett Grammar School headmaster Michael Frankland and was born in Ossett on the 30th April 1917, when her father was 69 years of age. </p>
<p>Her father died when she was 15. After attending Ossett Grammar School, she qualified as a teacher. She obtained a post at Armley national school, Leeds, which catered for boys up to the age of 14. She taught English during the second world war, accompanying her class to Lincoln, where they were evacuated.</p>
<p> Mabel Ferrett died on the 28th January 2011, at the age of 93, she was regarded as one of the most remarkable characters on the local literary scene. </p>
<p>Mabel Ferrett, of Heckmondwike, was renowned as a poet, Bront&euml; scholar and local historian.</p>
<p>In 1947 she married the solicitor Harold Ferrett and later lived in Ossett and Gomersal before making Heckmondwike her home. Mrs Ferrett was widowed early in 1977, but the couple had son John, who carried on with his father&rsquo;s profession. </p>
<p>During her career she worked as a schoolteacher and museum attendant, but it was her love of writing that had the most influence on her life. Her father Michael Frankland had been a writer of short stories and her creative urge bloomed early. At the age of four she penned her first words in the form of a four-line poem. The childish rhyme showed her instinctive feeling for the sound of words, which was to stay with her throughout her life.</p>
<p>Time working at the Red House Museum in Gomersal saw Mrs Ferrett explore her passion for the works and lives of the Bront&euml; sisters. The red-brick house was home to cloth merchants the Taylor family, whose daughter Mary was one of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s closest friends. Mrs Ferrett&rsquo;s fascination with the family led to her writing two books, entitled <em>&quot;The Brontes in the Spen Valley&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;The Taylors of the Red House.&quot; </em></p>
<p>Her interest in the area she lived in and its past led to her publishing a great deal as a local historian. Much of this was featured in The Spen Valley Historical Society Journal, the Spenborough Guardian and the Yorkshire Ridings Magazine. </p>
<p>Mrs Ferrett also wrote A History of Hartshead and based her novel, <em>&quot;The Angry Men&quot;</em>, on the activities of the local Chartists - the conflict between weavers and industrialists in the Spen Valley, which was serialised on Radio Four in the late 1960s. </p>
<p>When the Spen Valley Historical Society started in 1972, she was a founder member and eventually became life president. But it was for her work as a poet that Mrs Ferrett was primarily known. </p>
<p>Her first collection, <em>&quot;The Lynx-Eyed Strangers&quot;</em>, was published in 1956, and later collections included <em>&quot;The Tall Tower&quot;</em> (1970) and <em>&quot;The Years of the Right Hand&quot;</em> (1975). </p>
<p>Mabel was a founding member of the Pennine Poets group, one of the longest established writers' groups in England. Formed in Elland, West Yorkshire, in 1966, the group has held monthly creative workshops for more than 40 years, staged readings and festivals, and produced a journal, Pennine Platform. From 1973 until four years ago, Mabel hosted their workshops at her home in Heckmondwike. She edited Pennine Platform from 1973 to 1976 and was the editor of the literary journal Orbis from 1978 to 1980.</p>
<p>Her autobiography,<em> &quot;After Passchendaele&quot;</em>, came out in 2003. To celebrate the Pennine Poets' 40th anniversary in 2006, she wrote a fascinating account of the group, Spirit and Emotion.</p>

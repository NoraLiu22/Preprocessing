A wave of information continued to hit me square between the eyes, making my anxiety and fear palatable.

I thought I knew and understood this kind of love then, but I was only fooling myself. Years tell the tale of His faithfulness and tender love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe example of His continuing love is clear in Psalm 103. It is not passive, impersonal, or far away. It is active, intimate, and close at hand. Not only that, but it is not a matter of conjuring up feelings of love and affection. It is steadfast and true – a wholehearted love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe learn to love ourselves through seeing ourselves through God’s loving eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been commanded to love my husband of 49 years, I just do.

Because what is lovingly given to Him is returned in treasured measures of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe learn to honestly love others when we learn to love ourselves the way God does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis love allows us to see ourselves as He sees us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eTrue Love?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003e“phileo\u003c/em\u003e” or brotherly love. There is\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003e“eros”\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;or sexual/erotic love. These are common among us. They tend to be motivated by self-love, self-gratification, and self-protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-love is centered on self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“Agape”\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;love, on the other hand, is different.

I didn’t let the news get to me, I kept a distance as necessary, and washed my hands as never before. Not because the world forced me to, but because I found “agape”. It is patient and kind. It neither boasts nor envies. Furthermore, it is not proud, rude, self-seeking or easily angered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAgape\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;is quick to forgive, seek the good and the truth.

Do I need to fear it or deny it? My times are in His hands. As I read Psalm 103, I imagined the Lord God on His throne with all His creatures praising Him, and I wondered – Does God look forward to seeing me face-to-face as much as I do? As I look into His loving eyes, will I hear, “\u003cem\u003eHello there, my beloved. I’ve been waiting for you.

You are clothed with splendor and majesty, covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent. He lays the beams of His chambers on the waters; He makes the clouds His chariot; He rides on the wings of the wind; He makes His messengers winds, His ministers a flaming fire.\n\nHe set the earth on its foundations so that it should never be moved. You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder, they took to flight. The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place You appointed for them. You set a boundary that they may not pass so that they might not again cover the earth.\n\nYou make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills; they give drink to every beast of the field; and wild donkeys quench their thirst. Beside them, the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches. From your lofty abode, you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.\n\nYou cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man’s heart.\n\nThe trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted. In them, the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees. The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.\n\nHe made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows it’s time for setting. You make darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep about. The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God. When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down in their dens. Man goes out to work and to his labor until the evening.\n\nO LORD, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom have You made them all; the earth if full of Your creatures. Here is the sea, great and wide, which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great. There go the ships and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.\n\nThose all look to You, to give them their food in due season. When You give it to them, they gather it up; when You open Your hand, they are filled with good things. When you hide Your face, they are dismayed; when You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust. When you sent forth Your Spirit, they are created, and You renew the face of the ground.\n\nMay the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works, who looks on the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke! I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.\n\nMay my meditation be pleasing to Him, for I rejoice in the LORD.\n\nLet sinners be consumed from the earth and let the wicked be not more!\n\nBless the LORD, O my soul!

Jesus instructed His followers to be cautious about what thoughts they choose to entertain and regularly called out wrong thinking.

The apostle Paul straight-up commands followers of Jesus to think about things that are “pure, lovely, admirable, excellent and praiseworthy”. That command is followed by a promise of blessing for obedience (\u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Philippians+4%3A8-9\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003ePhilippians 4:8-9\u003c/a\u003e). Anytime God promises blessing for obedience we ought to pay special attention to that command.

Optimistic, benevolent and compassionate thoughts reveal a healthy spirit and hearts that are probably mostly focused on God, God’s Kingdom and the well-being of others. Conversely, paranoid, lustful, suspicious and distrustful thoughts are often an indicator of a much bigger and more worrisome spiritual problem. At best these types of thoughts reveal a lack of connection to the Holy Spirit, at worst they reveal systemic sins that require deep repentance.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur thoughts ultimately shape us-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo ancient Jewish people the “heart” was much more than an organ that pumped blood. The heart embodied all that a person was. The heart was a person’s thoughts and the feelings that were produced by what they thought about.

Jesus said that it is out of our heart that we speak and do evil. In other words, our thoughts have a shaping influence not just on our actions but on who and what we become (\u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Matthew+12%3A34\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003eMatthew 12:34\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Luke+6%3A45\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003eLuke 6:45\u003c/a\u003e) \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSatan can do a lot with just a little bit of wrong thinking-\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe psalmist begins \u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/passage?search=Psalm+73\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003ePsalm 73\u003c/a\u003e by acknowledging that God shows special favor towards those who are “pure in heart” or in the modern vernacular that means: “good on the inside as well as the outside”. His acknowledgment is swiftly followed by an awkward confession: the psalmist divulges he came dangerously close to losing his spiritual direction because he spent too much time thinking on the (seeming) success of the arrogant and wicked.  His observations regarding the apparent affluence of wicked people morphed into wrong thinking about God which nearly caused his “spirit to become embittered” towards God (\u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Psalm+73%3A21-22\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003ePsalm 73:21-22\u003c/a\u003e). The whole messy spiritual mess started with some thoughts that should have been reined in and prayed over before they had a chance to run wild and give birth to bitterness and hate (\u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Hebrews+12%3A15\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003eHebrews 12:15\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Ephesians+4%3A30-32\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003eEphesians 4:30-32\u003c/a\u003e). \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssuming the worst about others creates a spiral that ends in serious sin-\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChoosing to think the worst about others without rock-solid proof of wrongdoing is not discernment. It is a choice that gives the devil a foothold.

This is because anytime anyone allows fear and/or paranoia run wild they run the very real risk of losing touch with reality. Such was the fate of King Saul. He basically projected all of the evil of his own heart onto David. This caused him to think the worst of David, his wrong thinking initiated a spiritual death spiral that led to a bunch of murder attempts and ultimately Saul’s insanity. Anytime we find ourselves assuming ill-intent of others without rock-solid proof we run the risk of becoming a Saul. No wants to be a Saul. Saul was a hot mess.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe apostle Paul understood it is impossible to have a pure heart while thinking mean, lustful, anxious, paranoid or suspicious thoughts (\u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Psalm+24%3A3-5\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003ePsalm 24:3-5\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Matthew+5%3A8\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003eMatthew 5:8\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bibleportal.com/verse-topic?v=Matthew+6%3A25-34\u0026amp;version=NIV\"\u003eMatthew 6:25-34\u003c/a\u003e). Therefore, a critical spiritual discipline is learning how to take our thoughts captive to Christ (2\u003csup\u003end\u003c/sup\u003e Corinthians 10:5). We take thoughts captive through a process of analyzing what comes into our minds and asking ourselves some questions about those thoughts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this thought noble, pure admirable, kind or praiseworthy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAt the end of the day will this thought produce something wholesome and life-giving?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAm I assuming good intent?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAm I the worst motives in this situation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf this thought is permitted to run wild will it produce some sort of death in my life?

Those who joined the labor “at the eleventh hour” barely worked at all, but when the day was over, the landowner said to his foreman, \u0026#8220;Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.\u0026#8221; (Matthew 20:8) \u0026#8220;The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.\u0026#8221;(Matthew 20:9-10) As expected, complaints against the landowner followed. \u0026#8220;These men who were hired last worked only one hour,\u0026#8217; they said, \u0026#8216;and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.” (Matthew 20:12)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was happening in this vineyard? Why does God give us this bizarre story?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe is explaining to us the character of grace. The landowner bestowed grace and was merciful to those who did not work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA similar story is told in Genesis with Jacob and his son Joseph. Jacob clothed Joseph, the eleventh son, in a richly ornamented robe. (Genesis 37:3) The robe was provided for Joseph not because of Joseph’s good acts but because of his father’s mercy. When grace falls on us, instead of complaining or analyzing it, we should accept it by faith. Then God will justify us. This is very simple but in our arrogance and anxiety many of us reject this free gift of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultimate test of our spirituality is the measure of our amazement at the grace of God. Now the question is how much do we appreciate the grace of God?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e6 David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e7 “Blessed are those\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ewhose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e8 Blessed is the one\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ewhose sin the Lord will never count against them.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavid’s Story of Blessedness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow did David become a king of Israel? Was it because of his flesh? No, it was also because of his faith in God. When Saul the king of Israel and all the Israelites were terrified and fled in great fear of the Philistine giant Goliath, David courageously volunteered to fight against him. When Saul said that, \u0026#8220;You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth,\u0026#8221; David replied, “The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\u0026#8221; (1 Samuel 17:33; 17:37) When David approached Goliath with staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, and his sling in his hand, the Philistine despised the small boy. (1 Samuel 17:45) David said to the Philistine, \u0026#8220;You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty. All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD\u0026#8217;S, and he will give all of you into our hands.\u0026#8221; (1 Samuel 17:45; 17:47)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDavid triumphed over Goliath with a sling and a stone; without a sword–in other words, he struck down Goliath with his faith, trusting that the battle was not his but the Lord’s. With this kind of faith, David became the king of Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul quotes David’s Psalm 32:1-2. Works are deeds done by merit, but how blessed are those to whom God credits righteousness without any deeds or merit. Blessed are those who are forgiven, whose sins are covered, and who are not condemned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Debt of Sin Was Paid For By Christ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul wrote a letter to Philemon telling of a slave named Onesimus who ran away after stealing money from his master Philemon. Onesimus, however, was later saved by the gospel preached by Paul, and in an effort to return Onesimus to his original master, Paul urges Philemon: \u0026#8220;If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back\u0026#8211;not to mention that you owe me your very self.\u0026#8221; (Philemon 1:18-19) Philemon, charge whatever Onesimus owes to me, says Paul. When Paul carries his sin instead of him, Onesimus is not a thief anymore and freed from his debts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the same experience that all true believers have had. Jesus transferred all our debts to his account and liberated us from that burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransformed by the love of the Lord, Paul not only said beautiful word but he also lived the word. As Jesus Christ carried debts of his sin, Paul also carried the burden of Onesimus. The book of Philemon is the living proof of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e9 Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness. 10 Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. 12 And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbraham First Justified, Later Circumcised\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul again goes back to Abraham to speak about the matter of circumcision, which was a huge topic of interest to the Jews in the early church. Was Abraham blessed after he was circumcised, or before? “It was not after, but before!”says Paul. To the Jews, this must have been an earth-shaking declaration, because for them, a man who was not circumcised was quite literally not a Jew, no matter what his parentage was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Paul debunks this belief by showing that Abraham was called and set up as an ancestor of faith by the sheer grace of God. Only after then was he circumcised. God credited Abraham’s faith to him as righteousness in Genesis 15:6, and after fourteen years had passed, God gave the covenant of circumcision in Genesis 17:9-12.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFourteen years stands between Chapter 14 and 17 of Genesis. Now Paul points to two key moments of Abraham\u0026#8217;s life journey. Wasn\u0026#8217;t Abraham declared righteous here in Chapter 15 and only after then was he circumcised in Chapter 17? Abraham first became an ancestor and then he was circumcised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCircumcision was not the gateway to the right relationship with God; it was only the sign and the seal that a man had already entered into that relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the law? When did God first pronounce the law? The law did not even exist at the time of Abraham. The law was proclaimed through Moses in Exodus, not in Genesis. After 430 years following Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, did the law come into existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.” (Galatians 3:17-18)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow did Abraham who was born before Moses become an ancestor of faith? Was he declared righteous and become an ancestor because somehow he knew and kept the law that was yet to be given? While he was still uncircumcised and before the existence of the law, he was blessed because of his faith. Therefore, Abraham is not the father of the circumcised but he is the father of every man who in every age takes God at His word as he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e13 It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. 14 For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless, 15 because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression. 16 Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Promise Comes By Faith, Grace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe promise of God given to Abraham, as Paul saw it, was dependent on two things and two things only—the free grace of God and the perfect faith of Abraham. It is such a great hope to us as well. No matter how evil a father we may have, we too have received the promise to be heirs of God. And the way to be an heir has nothing to do with where we came from or what we did but it is only by grace and faith. The true people of God are ancestors of the faith of Abraham. As Paul affirms: “For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless” (4:14)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo Paul sets before the Romans the two ways. The one is a way in which a man seeks a right relationship with God through his own efforts. It is a way which is doomed to failure. The other is the way in which a man, in absolute faith, enters into a relationship with God–an opportunity given only by grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e17 As it is written: \u0026#8220;I have made you a father of many nations.\u0026#8221; He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were. 18 Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” 19 Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead— since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead. 20 Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 21 being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. 22 This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” 23 The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, 24 but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 25 He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRepublished with permission from Dr. Christy Tran, the author of \u0026#8220;The Epistle to the Romans: Paul’s Love Letter from God.\u0026#8221;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e[Romans Study 9-2] Grace And Faith\u0026nbsp; [Romans 3:27-4:25] 27 Where, then, is boasting?

Angels then, were created before the foundation of the world was laid, but the point is, they are created beings. They have intellect, will, and emotions. They are a higher order than humans.

Though they were in the form of men, Abraham knew they were not of this world. One of them was a pre-incarnate visitation of Jesus, of course. Sometimes an angel appears and they do not look like men but they do look like they are from glory.

While “cherubs” represent the second order of angels, putti are secular and present a non-religious passion. However, in the Baroque period of art, the putto came to represent the omnipresence of God. A putto representing a cupid is also called an amorino (plural amorini). During the Middle Ages, the putto disappeared and was revived during the 15th century.

It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith. 28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. 29 Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 30 since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. 31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustified By Faith Not By The Works Of The Law\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope that by this point you have an understanding that the righteousness of God is not something that is gained, but it is bestowed. In Romans 4, Paul once more contrasts these two kinds of righteousness: righteousness through the Law by works, which is not true righteousness at all, and righteousness by faith. In the Law, man is the producer of his own righteousness. In the world of faith, however, righteousness is based purely on receptivity, with man being the recipient of a divine gift. This man is one who is justified before God \u0026#8211; , the one who is righteous in the true sense of the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMan’s true existence is not independence but dependence upon God. Therefore all boasting by men, of men is excluded; so long as man is intent on his own glory he is still living in the sinful misunderstanding of himself.184\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Law Vs. The Gospel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut does it mean that faith can nullify the law? “Never!” says Paul. We remember the teaching of Jesus: \u0026#8220;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.\u0026#8221; (Matthew 5:17-18)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe law and the gospel are two different gifts from God intended to lead men towards salvation. Because we know the gospel now, does it mean the Ten Commandments can banished? Not at all. All of God’s law and the Ten Commandments are still valid and must be kept. The gospel is meant to fulfill the law rather than abolish it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul touches on this once again in the thirteenth Chapter of this Epistle: \u0026#8220;Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. The commandments, \u0026#8220;Do not commit adultery,\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;Do not murder,\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;Do not steal,\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;Do not covet,\u0026#8221; and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \u0026#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself.\u0026#8221; Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\u0026#8221; (Romans 13:8-10)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLove is the fulfillment of the law. If you love your neighbor, all the other commandments regarding the well being of your neighbor will be eventually kept and you will fulfill the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the law were a circle, the gospel would be a bigger circle surrounding the smaller one. The smaller circle is included in the bigger circle. The one great premise of all this is that this gospel is the fulfillment of the promise of God presented through His prophets and Word long ago. (Romans 1:2) Therefore, the law and the gospel are not contradictory but complementary to each other, perfecting each other. We ought to comprehend this point clearly before moving on to the next Chapter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does the fulfillment of the law mean? It does not mean that man will keep the law perfectly, but his motive has changed. Now a man must try to be good, and keep God’s law not because he fears punishment, but because he loves God. He works hard because he feels that somehow, with his last drop of energy, he must return as much of the amazing love of God as he can, though it is miniscule in comparison to what was given. He knows now that sin is not so much breaking God’s law as it is breaking God’s heart, which actually makes sin doubly terrible. Take a human analogy. Many a man is tempted to do a wrong thing, and does not do it. Why does he not do it? It is not so much that he fears the law. He would not greatly care if he were fined, or even imprisoned. What keeps him right is the simple fact that he could not meet the sorrow in the eyes of the one who loves him if he shipwrecked life.185\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the believer, it is no longer the law of fear but the law of love which keeps him right–this is the mark of the true believer. We are rid forever of the terror of God, but we use that freedom to follow God more closely, not to follow our sinful nature. . And the grip of true love is much stronger than that of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter? 2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. 3 What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbraham Justified by Faith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul then goes on to prove that the principle of justification by faith was even present in the times of the Jewish ancestors, including Abraham and David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?” (4:1); “David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works” (4:6)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbraham and David–the two most important figureheads for the Jews. Just as Matthew picked these two great men in the first verse of the first Chapter of his gospel to give the genealogical proof that Jesus was a direct descendant of Abraham and David, Paul pointed to these two men to give powerful examples of how the justification works. Paul knew the Old Testament and had profound Jewish historical understanding. The first one he chose was Abraham, who is an ancestor of faith. The Jews regarded Abraham as the great founder of the race, and the pattern of all that a man should be.186 They always found pride in being descendants of father Abraham. The second figure is David. King David marked the heyday of Israel\u0026#8217;s history. The Jews always hope to have another King just like David. He is the king of kings and foreshadows Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?” (4:1) As this verse is read in different translations: “What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?” (KJV); “What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?” (NASB), it may be read more precisely: “What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather ‘according to the flesh’, discovered in this matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Paul, Abraham’s righteousness was not something that he could boast about in the flesh. The flesh is a unique term that Paul often uses in his epistles, and is a broad term, covering the seen world and matters such as bloodline(pedigree), possessions, position, merits, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWas Abraham saved because a work done in the flesh? If he we examine Abraham’s family background, his father was Terah who worshiped \u0026#8220;other gods.\u0026#8221; (Joshua 24:2) Moreover, Terah manufactured idols for a living. Abraham was the son of an idol seller–a pedigree that certainly didn’t afford righteousness\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDid God call him and set him up as an ancestor of faith because of his flesh? No, says Paul. According to Genesis chapter 12, God summoned Abraham to leave his home, friends, kindred, and livelihood, and said to him, \u0026#8220;If you make this great venture of faith, you will become the father of a great nation and a great people.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did Abraham do when this Word of God fell on him? He did not hesitate and argue but completely and without question trusted God and took Him at His word. Then he set out a journey not knowing where he was going . “By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.” (Hebrews 11:8)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not the fact that Abraham had meticulously performed the demands of the law that put him into this special relationship with God; it was his complete trust in God, his complete acceptance of God’s command, and his complete willingness to abandon his life for God. That for Paul was faith, and it was that faith of Abraham that made God regard Abraham as a good man.187 Abraham was set up as an ancestor of faith not because of his flesh but because of his faith and faith only. “What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”” (4:3) Though he was unworthy according to the flesh, God, in His amazing love, considered Abraham’s faith as righteousness.

Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. 10 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; 11 there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. 12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.” 13 “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.” 14 “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.” 15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood; 16 ruin and misery mark their ways, 17 and the way of peace they do not know.” 18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Cross: The Cost of Grace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGod justifies the unrighteous and He grants to them His unconditional love. He receives sinners into His fellowship. He says to them you are righteous in my sight. On what basis? Purely in the form of a gift, on the basis of His grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDoes God therefore treat sin simply as if it were nothing, simply passing it over? Quite the contrary. This grace, which cost man nothing to receive, costs God His one and only Son to give. God allowed Jesus to die as a proof of his righteousness, so that forgiveness would not be misunderstood as a passing-over of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo men, unrighteous and evil, who were groaning under the bondage of sin, instead of punishing them, what alternative did God take instead? Grace! The priceless grace that cost His own Son. The heart-trembling grace that shed the precious blood of His only Son on the Cross. Grace is the only power that is big enough to take the field against sin. God knows there is nothing that can withstand the power of the reign of grace. We therefore ought to be the ones who are worthy to be reigned by the awesome grace of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat God Has Done For Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo what is the essence of all of this? We can understand the core of the gospel by contrasting God’s grace to the character of the law: a man concerned with obeying the law is concerned about what he can do for himself, whereas the way of grace is concerned about what God can do and has done for man. Paul insists that nothing we can ever do can win us the forgiveness of God. This can only come from God Himself as an act of mercy. Therefore, the way to a right relationship with God lies not in a frenzied, desperate, and doomed attempt to win acquittal by our performance, but in humble, penitent acceptance of the love and grace which God offers us in Jesus Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Come and listen, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.” (Psalm 66:16)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[Questions]\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e1. What do you think of this verse?; “There is no one righteous, not even one.” (3:10)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e2. Through the parable of the Pharisees and the tax collector, Jesus warns us of a fatal sin that can prevent us from receiving the love of God. Read the parable and share your thoughts on the character of the Pharisees and the tax collector based on today’s message and discuss how you can avoid the sin of the Pharisee: “To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: \u0026#8220;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: \u0026#8216;God, I thank you that I am not like other men\u0026#8211;robbers, evildoers, adulterers\u0026#8211;or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.\u0026#8217; \u0026#8220;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, \u0026#8216;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u0026#8217; \u0026#8220;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\u0026#8221; (Luke 18:9-14)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e3. “But now” in Romans 3:21 marks that a turning-point in the world’s history has come. Paul must have trembled with excitement when he uttered the phrase—“but now” on this Epistle. After doing this Bible study, what is your reaction towards this phrase?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e4. Based on today’s message, share your reflection on this statement: “Paul’s ministry exemplified the wonderful truth Jesus claimed when he said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). Until Jesus came, the law provided a strict measurement of God’s just and righteous character. With the coming of Christ, God’s mercy was also demonstrated. The law expressed the righteous requirements of God; Christ provided a way that we might be declared righteous.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e5. Based on today’s message, share your reflection on this Bible verse: “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: \u0026#8220;Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.\u0026#8221; (Galatians 3:13)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e6. Based on today’s message, share your reflection on this statement: “If we fail to realize that the gospel and all it professes is primarily an activity on the part of God, and not on the part of man, we have entirely failed to understand it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e7. The following statement is the summary of Paul’s argument in Romans 1:18-3:20: “You see how tremendous it is; how it spans the whole of time, takes within its ambit the whole story of man, deals with Jew and Gentile, the whole world, and establishes that the greatest and the best good news that has ever come into the world is the news that ‘the just by faith shall live’, because no one else shall live; because all others are under the wrath of God and are guilty before Him. Oh! It is not difficult when you look at it like this to see why Paul said, ‘I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ \u0026#8230;’ Emperors and kings, consuls and proconsuls, prelates, senators, military men and captains – the whole world is guilty before God. He has the only message that can save anybody. It is the message about the righteousness that God Himself provides in Jesus Christ, and which is offered to Jew and Gentile alike.” What is your reflection on this important section we have studied so far?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[Prayer]\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have learned that all men fall short of God’s glory and no matter how hard we try, we can never reach righteousness, but doomed to remain in darkness. But a most wonderful thing, a most amazing news has been given to us today: that we are saved by the love of God through Christ Jesus. The love of the Cross, the love of redemption–through the blood of Jesus we are justified and declared righteous. The Lord emptied Himself, and lowered Himself to the point of death. In this kind of love, the Lord came to Matthew and to the prodigal son, and to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour grace does not ask of our sin but accepts us. We have learned that receiving this love is faith. Faith is a passageway to receive grace. \u0026#8220;Receive this surprising love then you will be saved in His grace,” proclaims Paul. Lord, we have been liberated by your love and grace. May we never forget this love and grace and preach the message of Paul to the whole world.

Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. 10 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; 11 there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. 12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.” 13 “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.” 14 “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.” 15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood; 16 ruin and misery mark their ways, 17 and the way of peace they do not know.” 18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is Grace?; The Story of the Prodigal Son And Unconditional Love and Forgiveness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the law can be characterized as sin and punishment, then the Gospel can be seen as sin and forgiveness. Forgiveness is the highest form of love. When you truly love, then you can truly forgive. Unconditional love—it is the righteousness of God revealed to us by Jesus Christ. It was something very striking and shocking to the Jews, and to us as well. But Jesus came to tell us about this striking love of God. He told us about this love of God ever so clearly in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, recorded in Luke 15.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus continued: \u0026#8220;There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, \u0026#8216;Father, give me my share of the estate.\u0026#8217; So he divided his property between them. \u0026#8220;Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.” (Luke 15:11-13)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe story begins like this. Originally the father and the son were one but the son left the father. It is the story of how Adam fell as he left God. The gospel comes to us and makes us see that by living a life apart from God and apart from Christ we are going against the original position that God intended for us to be in. Man is meant to be a living soul in communion with God, and the gospel makes us see that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe prodigal son suffered much after losing the protection and loving care of his father. He squandered his wealth in wild living and tended pigs to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“\u0026#8221;When he came to his senses, he said, \u0026#8216;How many of my father\u0026#8217;s hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.\u0026#8217;” (Luke 15:17-19)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after experiencing extreme misery and destruction, did he finally realize his sin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut how does the father receive this sinful son of his?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So he got up and went to his father. \u0026#8220;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.” (Luke 15:20)\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough the son deserved to be punished, the loving father runs to his son from a long way off, throws his arms around him and kisses him. The father does not look at the sinner as a sinner. He does not repay his sin with punishment but covers his mistakes with his love. Knowing the guilt in the son, the father is filled with compassion, and runs to him and rejoices! This is the heart of God. This father is the God we serve. And this is the kind of father Jesus wanted to introduce us to: Father who calls the sinners before the “righteous” and who embraces their guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Was Driven by Grace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe same story is shared by Apostle Paul. The Lord came to him first even while he was persecuting Christians and the church of God. The Lord did not ask Paul of his sin but embraced him with surprising and unexpected love. In front of this love, Paul completely broke down. It was a righteousness that he never experienced or known of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis grace that made Paul a preacher is the same grace that drove him across seas and continents. It made him preach day and night with tears and prayer. It was the most vital force in Paul’s life. This was the thing that \u0026#8216;constrained\u0026#8217; him, and made him say, \u0026#8216;Woe is me if I preach not the gospel!’ He was driven by the riches of God\u0026#8217;s grace and the ignorance of men and women concerning them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e24 and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— 26 he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThree Metaphors About The Redemption Of Jesus Christ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow Paul tells us of “redemption,” a new way that has been open by Christ Jesus to all sinful men. To show what he means he uses three metaphors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Metaphor of a Court of Law\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, Paul uses a metaphor from a court of law. That is the metaphor we call justification. It means that God treats an utterly guilty man, convicted of sin, as if he were someone innocent and good man in His courts of mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis defies logic, which instead would say: \u0026#8220;God is just, and, therefore, condemns the sinner as a criminal.\u0026#8221; But here, somehow, in that incredible and miraculous grace that Jesus came to bring to me, He accepts the sinner, not as a criminal, but as a son whom He still loves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Metaphor of Sacrifice\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul also uses the metaphor of Jewish ritual sacrifice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeviticus 16 records the sin offering rituals that the Israelite community practiced. On the day of atonement, the Jews would impute their sin on a scapegoat and send it into the desert where ferocious wild animals await to devour it. The scapegoat would shed its blood for them and this way they could make atonement for themselves and their households.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Paul, such a ritual can be equated to the death of Jesus in both its form and effect. “And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.” (Hebrew 13:12) He took our iniquity and suffered outside the city gate shedding his precious blood, which atoned for the entirety of man’s sin, in the past and in the days to come. His death was the death of redemption. John the Baptist said of Jesus: \u0026#8220;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Jesus not only carried the atoning cross of sacrifice at Golgotha but during his entire life. Jesus lived the life of the scapegoat, carrying the world’s sin and redeeming them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary, Paul is saying: \u0026#8220;Jesus Christ, by His life of obedience and His death of love, made the one sacrifice to God that atones for sin once and for all.\u0026#8221; Paul insists that the event of the cross opened the door to the right relationship with God, a door which every other sacrifice was and is powerless to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe ought to remember: God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Metaphor of an Emancipated Slave\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul continues his discourse using a metaphor from the world of slavery, which was common in his time. He speaks of a deliverance brought about through the saving grace of Jesus Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Deliverance” was a commercial term. It is a term used when freeing a slave after paying ransom for his life. Paul says that Jesus became that ransom and shed His blood in order to free us who were slaves to sin. In Acts, Paul referred to the church of God as one that was \u0026#8220;bought with Jesus\u0026#8217; own blood.\u0026#8221; (Acts 20:28) Christians are those liberated by the price of Jesus\u0026#8217; blood and who have gained new life by his sacrifice. \u0026#8220;You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.\u0026#8221; (1 Corinthians 7:23)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAren\u0026#8217;t we, as God’ ransomed children, so precious then? I was bought at a price–the priceless blood of Jesus. Though he was rich, Jesus became poor so that we might become rich through his poverty. (2 Corinthians 8:9)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough the Cross of Jesus Christ, the way to righteousness has opened. When we believe in what the Cross of Christ has done for us, and receive the love manifested on the Cross, then we can receive this righteousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSalvation Eternal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” (John 1:12) Once we truly receive Jesus, we become the children of God, and this is a status that cannot be changed. As if wine cannot turn back to water once water has turned into wine, God’s calling is irrevocable. Once we have received salvation, it is salvation eternal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot go in and out of grace; you cannot be saved one day and not be saved the next, and go back and forth. You are either under the dominion of sin and Satan, or you are under the dominion of grace and of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen God declares: You are righteous in my sight, you are my beloved son in whom I am well pleased, then man believing this is no longer the same man as he was before, but he becomes a new creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRepublished with permission from Dr. Christy Tran, the author of \u0026#8220;The Epistle to the Romans: Paul’s Love Letter from God.\u0026#8221;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e[Romans Study 8-2] Justified Freely By His Grace Through The Redemption In Jesus Christ [Romans 3:9-26] 9 What shall we conclude then?

Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. 10 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; 11 there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. 12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.” 13 “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.” 14 “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.” 15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood; 16 ruin and misery mark their ways, 17 and the way of peace they do not know.” 18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo One Is Righteous\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCan you summarize human nature? Paul gives his answer to this question in this passage. When humans are separated from God, they are full of sin without exception. They are in one word, the lump of sin.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, God created humans in His own image. (Genesis 1:27; 5:1; James 3:9) They are precious to God and cannot be exchanged with anything else. But at the same time humans are sinful beings. The Bible tells us about the two contrasting sides very clearly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no one righteous, not even one.”(3:10) Paul pointed out the evil human nature ever so sharply. For him, however, the evil of human nature was not a reason to despair, but it was a challenge to have hope. Despite the greatness of man’s sins, Jesus Christ is a great Savior. He was confident that what Christ had done for him He could do for any man. Therefore, Paul was never cynical about human nature, but in the latter part of the Chapter three from verse 21, he introduces a way to overcome that nature:, a bright light in Christ Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaw Makes Man Aware Of Sin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. 20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTill now Paul has argued that humans, whether Jews or Gentiles, are sinners. How then, can we become righteous before God? The Jews said it could be done by keeping the law given by God, but Paul refutes this. Paul, a Pharisee of Pharisees who was completely dedicated to keeping the law now confessed that if anyone says that he has kept all the law, he is a hypocrite. His very experience tells him that it is impossible to stand perfectly flawless before God in keeping the law. It is his honest confession. Man has to carry his huge load of sin to carry but with the addition of the law added an extra burden. In Galatians 3:13, Paul even refers to the law as a curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat then is the use of the law? The use of the law is to make man aware of sin. It is only when man knows what he ought to do that he can realize he is not doing it. It is only when a man knows the law and tries to satisfy it that he realizes he can never satisfy it. The law is designed to show a man his own sinful nature, and that is its merit and the reason why God gave it to man. But the law has a fatal limit that it can never liberate man from his sin. It neither saves him, nor makes, him righteous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe New Law of Faith and of Love: The Gospel Of Grace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs there no way, then, for a man to stand before God? With man it is impossible. But with God, in His love and mercy, a man can be made righteous though he is a sinner. In this Epistle Paul tells us the way that we can be made righteous even though we are sinners. We gain salvation by grace through faith. By believing in God’s grace, we are saved! The way to God is not the way of law, but it is the way of grace. It is not the way of works, it is the way of faith. This is the new law; the law of faith and of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMan’s groaning in sin can be a depressing sight, but without understanding it, we could not fully appreciate the bright light of the good news, the gospel of grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is through this gospel that we can be liberated from our sin, and this is what Paul proclaims to us from verse 21. Romans 3:21-30 gives us the us essential teachings about the gospel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e21 But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22 This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRighteousness Through Faith\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“But now”– Paul begins this passage with this phrase, marking a critical turning point in his discourse, one of glad tidings, and a sign of mighty hope given to men. To all men hopelessly destined for the wrath of God a door to life has been opened, and the brightest of lights have appeared in the darkness. This is the righteousness of God; it is the gospel, the great gospel of grace!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe gospel was not something created by Paul or even something new from God but it was the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets that the Jews knew so much about. It had been part of God’s plan all along and it had finally been made known through Christ’s death and resurrection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn His mercy God came to us. He lowered Himself, endlessly loves us, and gives all He created for us. But men deserted this God. The first man, Adam, who was ungrateful for all that God had given, left God and the fall of man followed. The fall is abandoning the love of God that was given to man freely. Despite this wickedness, God does not leave sinful man alone and does not ask for their sin but accepts it and covers it with grace. This grace is not something conditional. Believing in this grace and accepting it is the faith that Paul wanted to testify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.” (Revelation 3:20) The Lord is knocking on the door of my heart, and all I need to do is open up that door and invite Him into my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn His Love\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent—the LORD detests them both.” (Proverbs 17:15); “Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent or honest person to death, for I will not acquit the guilty.” (Exodus 23:7) God’s word says very clearly that God does not justify the wicked but Paul says that that is precisely what God does. Here we see a God whose love is even greater than His justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut how can I know that God is like that? I can know because Jesus said so. Jesus came to tell us that God loves us, despite how bad we are. He came to tell us that although we are sinners, we are still dear to God. When we discover and believe that, it changes our whole relationship with God. We are conscious of our sin, but we are no longer in terror. We are no longer estranged, but instead penitent and broken hearted we come to God, like a sorry child coming to his mother, and when God receives us, we know that He is God who is Himself love. That is the meaning of justification by faith in Jesus Christ. It means that we are in a right relationship with God, because we believe with all our hearts that what Jesus told us about God is true. We are no longer strangers terrorized by an angry God. We are children, although erring children, but trusting in their Father’s love and forgiveness. We could never have known this if Jesus had not come to tell us so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRepublished with permission from Dr. Christy Tran, the author of \u0026#8220;The Epistle to the Romans: Paul’s Love Letter from God.\u0026#8221; \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e[Romans Study 8-1] Justified Freely By His Grace Through The Redemption In Jesus Christ [Romans 3:9-26] 9 What shall we conclude then?

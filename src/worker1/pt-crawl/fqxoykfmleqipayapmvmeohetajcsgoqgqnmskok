 Its general purposes are outlined in the first two items of the "Objects of the Charity" in its Deed of Declaration of Trust (updated 2021):
 <ol>
 <li> to promote, encourage and advance the study of, the research into and the dissemination of
 knowledge relating to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in all their aspects;
 <li> to commemorate, with no view to profit, the said James Clerk Maxwell:
 <ol type="a">
 <li> by publishing or contributing towards or promoting the publication of Maxwell-related
 scientific or educational books, films, papers, essays, monographs and/or lectures;
 <li> by supporting STEM related activities and the work of any other person or persons who may,
 in the opinion of the trustees, have contributed significantly to the advancement of STEM;
 </ol>
 </ol>
 
 <p>The foundation supports an annual set of charitable donations etc: 
 The Edinburgh Academy prize, The University of Edinburgh studentship, 
 McKinnon McNeil studentship, two Mathematics prizes, 
 Philosophical Magazine prize and it supports an Edinburgh International Science Festival lecture.

<button class="accordion">History of the Foundation</button>

 <div class="panel">
 <p>The charitable function of the Foundation was its only concern during the years 1977-93. 
 Grants were made to senior scientists (professors) to attend meetings abroad and to junior scientists 
 (graduates and undergraduates) to assist their studies or researches. 
 As the Foundation is a modest one, these grants were not large, 
 but even so were often essential for the purposes of the recipients. 
 With the <a href="../Acquisition_of_14_India_Street.pdf" target="_blank">1993 acquisition</a> 
 of the house in which Clerk Maxwell was born, in the New Town of Edinburgh, 
 the work of the Foundation entered a new phase in which its commemorative function predominated. 
 
 <p>A bronze plaque in the hallway of the house provides a brief history of the Foundation, it reads:
 <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-pale-grey">
<p class="w3-large w3-serif">
<P>Instituted to promote education in the physical sciences
 THE JAMES CLERK MAXWELL FOUNDATION
 Was created in 1977 by the initiative and generosity of
 SYDNEY ROSS, Ph.D.
 Professor of Chemistry at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y., U.S.A. 
 These premises were acquired by the foundation in 1993
 Owing largely to the efforts of its director of development
 DAVID S. RITCHIE, M.A., F.R.S.E.
 Who enlisted the help of many donors
 Both institutional and private
 To further the educational aims of the foundation
 AND TO HONOUR JAMES CLERK MAXWELL
 Premier Scottish Scientist
 </div>
 
 <p>Note: The James Clerk Maxwell Foundation was founded and initially 
 funded by Sydney Ross, a native of Scotland, who was a resident of the United States.

 <img   width="600" src="https://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/assets/images/autogen/Latin_1.jpg" border=0 alt="Latin_1" >
 <p>This Latin epigraph (displayed in our conference room) may be translated as: 
 <i>From this home of his birth, his name is now widespread across the entire terrestrial globe, and even to the stars.</i> 
 The latter phrase is to be taken almost literally; it is based on the fact that 
 Maxwell's name is attached not only to a crater on the Moon but also to the 
 highest region on the surface of the planet Venus, the <i>Maxwell Montes</i>. 
 This is a singular honour. Quoting from <i>The Magellan Venus Explorers' Guide</i> (NASA publication 1990): 
 "The International Astronomical Union, the governing body for planetary and satellite nomenclature, 
 adopted a theme in keeping with the age-old feminine mystique of Venus, features would be named for women, 
 both mythological and real . . . three previously adopted names were retained, <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Beta</i> 
 the first names applied to Venusian features . . . <i>Maxwell</i> was also retained. . . 
 James Clerk Maxwell is thus the only man honored with a feature name [on Venus]."
 <p>The epigraph contrasts the tiny world of the Maxwell home and the enormous 
 worlds of the globe and planets; it reflects the contrast between the baby whose 
 life started there and the great man he became. To those standing in the very 
 birthplace these words may well bring thoughts of the mysteries of birth, growth, and human genius.

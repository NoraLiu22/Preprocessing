<p class="one">The British water-colourist, oil-painter, and book-illustrator Charles 
Pears (9 September 1873-28 January 1958) was a distinguished member of the Royal 
Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and the RSMA 
(Royal Society of Marine Artists), and enjoyed an artistic career spanning seven decades. 
Born in Pontefract, Yorkshire, he studied nearby at East Hardwick and Pomfret College, 
during which period of training he acquired an appreciation for the marine paintings and 
cityscapes of Italian painter Canaletto. Entering the profession of artist at age 
seventeen, Pears was initially a book illustrator,  working for such periodicals such as
<span class="book">The Yellow Book</span>, 
<a href="../../../periodicals/punch/pva44.html"><span class="book">Punch</span></a>, and 
<a href="../../periodicals/graphic.html"><span class="book">The Graphic</span></a>; he 
illustrated  such volume works as <span class="book">Salt-Water Poems</span> and the 
<span class="book">Ballads of John Masefield</span>. However, Charles Pears is best 
remembered as a painter of marinescapes, on which he usually signed himself "Chas Pears." 
His works were exhibited from 1904 to 1939 in London , and he also wrote a number of 
books on small boat cruising. During that period between moving to London in 1904 and the 
outbreak of the First World War, he illustrated books. His most famous commission was the 
illustration of the Centenary Edition, 30 volumes of the works of Charles Dickens issued 
by Waverley, London, between 1912 and 1918. Charles Pears was a prolific poster artist 
for the London Underground, producing highly effective posters in a range of styles. He 
also created posters for the Empire Marketing Board and the Metropolitan Railway. </p>

<p>A commissioned officer in the Royal Marines during the First World War, Pears worked 
also worked as an official War Artist during both the First and Second World Wars. His 
Second World War poster entitled <span class="illustration">MV San Demetrio gets 
home</span>, issued by the Post Office Savings Bank, is now part of the collection of the 
National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. From 1913 to 1936, Pears was a prolific poster 
artist, working for London Underground, the Empire Marketing Board, the Metropolitan 
Railway, the Southern Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and British 
Railways. Pears moved to Saint Mawes, Cornwall, in semi-retirement, and died in Truro on 
28 January 1958. One may see his work on display  in the collections of such London 
galleries as the Transport Museum, National Maritime Museum, National Railway Museum, 
Imperial War Museum, and the Tate. His talent is still honoured in a prize at the Royal 
Society of Marine Artists, the Charles Pears Memorial Award.</p>

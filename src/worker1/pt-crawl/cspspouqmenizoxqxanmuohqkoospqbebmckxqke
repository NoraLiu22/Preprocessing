<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span lang="EN-GB">Roughly speaking, there are one
 billion Muslims in the whole world, living in more than fifty Muslim
 countries. A fifth of these Muslims are Arab. In the Muslim countries also
 live non-Muslim minorities. On the other side, in many non-Muslim countries,
 there are Muslim minorities. Muslims in Western Europe number between 15 and
 20 million. Exact figures are unknown because census takers in most European
 countries do not collect data on religious persuasion. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 purpose of my text is to show the difference between the Islamic and Western
 concept of law and the impact of this difference on non-Muslim minorities in
 the Muslim countries and on Muslim minorities in non-Muslim countries</span><a title href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[2]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>

 Chapter I. Concept of the law</span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">1)
 Islamic concept of the law</span></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span lang="EN-GB">There are three concepts of the
 law. The first one considers the law as emanating of God. The second considers
 it as emanating from the social contract through democracy; law in this case
 is the expression of the sovereignty of the people. The third considers it as
 a donation from the chief of the state as the sole sovereign; here the law is
 the result of dictatorship; nobody has the right to change it and those who
 disobey are beheaded. Generally speaking the first and the third concept of
 law are similar and have the same consequences. We have them among Jews and
 Muslims.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">For the
 Jewish believer, the Bible imposes itself as a legal code to follow at all
 times and in all places. One reads:</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; You must diligently observe everything that I command
 you; do not add to it or take anything from it (Deuteronomy 13:1).</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The revealed things belong to us and to our children
 forever, to observe all the words of this law (Deuteronomy 29:28).</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a statute forever throughout your generations in
 all your settlements (Leviticus 23:14).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Quoting
 these verses, Maimonides (died 1204) writes, âIt is clearly stated in the
 Torah that it contains the Law which stands for ever, that may not be changed,
 and nothing may be taken from it or added to itâ. According to Maimonides, if
 one pretends the opposite, âhe shall die by hangingâ</span><a title href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[3]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 This punishment is also foreseen for anyone who âuproots any of our verbal
 traditions or says that God had charged him to interpret the Law in such and
 such a way, he is a false prophet and is to be hanged even though he give a
 signâ</span><a title href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[4]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">One finds
 this same concept among Muslims for whom the Quran, - literal word of God -,
 and the Tradition of Muhammad (Sunnah) - gathered in different compilations -
 constitute the first two sources of all law. From these two sources, classic
 Muslim jurists developed a legal system called <i>shariâah</i> (literally: the
 way). All Muslims must submit. The Quran says in this respect:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Those who do not rule in accordance
 with Godâs revelations are disbelievers ... unjust, ... wicked (5:44, 45, 47).</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">No believing man or believing woman, if
 God and His messenger issue any command, has any choice regarding that
 command. Anyone who disobeys God and His messenger has gone far astray
 (33:36).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Muhammad
 Mitwalli Al-Shaârawi (died 1998), religious leader and Egyptian politician,
 explained that revelation is called upon to decide equivocal questions, thus
 freeing the mankind of the anguish of solving a difficult case by discussion,
 or by exhaustive repetition of experiences. The Muslim does not have to look
 outside Islam for solutions to any problem, since Islam offers absolute
 eternal and good solutions</span><a title href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[5]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 He adds:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">If I were the person responsible of
 this country or the person charged to apply Godâs law, I would give a delay of
 one year to anyone who rejects Islam, granting him the right to say that he is
 no longer a Muslim. Then I would dispense him of the application of Islamic
 law, condemning him to death as apostate</span><a title href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[6]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This
 thread is not rhetoric. As we will see in the last chapter, those who reject
 the Islamic law or try to present a liberal interpretation of its sources, are
 persecuted and some of them are killed. The obligation to apply Islamic law,
 with the fatal consequence in case of refusal, may cover unlimited fields,
 even those very controversial. To give an unexpected example, Jad-al-Haq, the
 Sheikh of Al-Azhar (died 1996) declared in a fatwa (religious decision) issued
 en 1994:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">If a region stops, of common agreement,
 to practice male and female circumcision, the chief of the state declares war
 against that region because circumcision is a part of the ritual of Islam and
 its specificities. This means that male and female circumcision are obligatory</span><a title href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[7]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This fatwa
 indicates clearly that even a group has no right to decide differently that
 what the Islamic law decides.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">To be a
 Muslim implies the acceptance of the application of the Islamic law. There is
 a link between religion and law. If you refuse the application of the Islamic
 law, you stop being Muslim. And the more norms you have in a religion, the
 less the individual and the group are free to choose their way of life. The
 Quran was aware of the difficulty it is creating by introducing new norms. We
 read in 5:101: </span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">O you who believe, do not ask about
 matters which, if revealed to you prematurely, would hurt you. If you ask
 about them in light of the Quran, they will become obvious to you. God has
 deliberately overlooked them. God is Forgiver, Clement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This
 concept of the law as a result of revelation is reflected in different Islamic
 declarations on human rights</span><a title href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[8]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 Thus, one promulgated in 1981, by the Islamic Council of Europe (whose seat is
 in London), affirmed repeatedly that human rights are founded on divine will.
 The first passage of the preamble states, âSince fourteen centuries, Islam
 defined, by divine law, human rights, in their entirety as well as in their
 implicationsâ. The preamble adds:</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">- &nbsp; Strong of our faith in the fact that God is the
 sovereign master of all things in this immediate life as in the ultimate
 life...</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">- &nbsp; Strong of our conviction that human intelligence is
 incapable to elaborate a better way in view to assure service of life without
 Godâs guidance and revelation:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">We, Muslims, ... we proclaim this
 Declaration of human rights made in the name of Islam, as one can understand
 them of the very noble Quran and the very pure prophetic Tradition (Sunnah).</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Therefore, these rights present
 themselves as eternal rights that cannot be suppressed or rectified, abrogated
 or invalidated. These rights have been defined by the Creator -to him the
 praise! - and no human creature has the right to either invalidate or attack
 them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 Judeo-Muslim concept could not resist time and modernization. Indeed, nearly
 all Constitutions of Arab countries affirm that Islam is the religion of the
 State and that Islamic law is a main source, or even the main source of the
 law. Nevertheless, Islamic law now concerns only family law and inheritance,
 and penal law in some countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. Laws imported
 mainly from the West, to start with the Constitution itself, the judicial
 system, the civil law, the commercial law and the penal law, govern other
 legal domains. In this regard, the Muslim world lives today in a situation of
 schizophrenia, between religious ideals and a desire to acquire an
 independence from divinity. This situation creates internal violent conflict
 between three main trends:</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those that extol a return to Islamic law
 as part of their faith, with some adaptation to the present situation through
 a circumstantial interpretation to save appearances.</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second trend is constituted by those who,
 guided by a sense of realities, prefer the status quo, considering Islamic law
 unable to manage a modern society.</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third trend would like to evacuate the
 remaining Islamic norms applied today, which are contrary to a modern
 perspective of human rights, notably with regard to womenâs and non-Muslimsâ
 rights.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">2)
 Western Concept of the law</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 Judea-Islamic concept of the law as emanating from God, supreme sovereign
 legislator, is different from the concept of the law in the Christianised
 Western countries, concept based on the idea of the peopleâs sovereignty that
 decides the laws that govern it, in the public interest (<i>res publica</i>).
 These laws are voted and amended by the people. People vote according to their
 material interest and their moral values, perhaps religious. But these
 interests and values can change and they have to submit to the verdict of the
 majority. This concept is the result of a fierce struggle to separate the
 church from the state. But it has also its seeds in Christâs attitude towards
 law. Contrary to the Ancient Testament and to the Quran, the Gospel remains
 mainly a moral book. Jesus was not a jurist; he never exercised a political
 function. He refused to deal with the law even when it is prescribed in the
 Torah. Two events illustrate this attitude:</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">- &nbsp; Someone in the crowd said to Jesus: âTeacher, tell my
 brother to divide the family inheritance with meâ. Jesus answered him:
 âFriend, who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?â And he said to
 them: âTake care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for oneâs life
 does not consist in the abundance of possessionsâ (Luke 12:13-15).</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">- &nbsp; The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had
 been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, they said to
 him: âTeacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.
 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?â
 Jesus said to them: âLet anyone among you who is without sin be the first to
 throw a stone at herâ. When they heard it, they went away, one by one,
 beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing
 before him. Jesus said to her: âWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned
 you?â She said: âNo one sirâ. And Jesus said: âNeither do I condemn you. Go
 your way, and from now on do not sin againâ (John 8:3-11).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">We can
 here compare the attitude of Jesus with that of Muhammad. Concerning
 inheritance, Jesus refused to give a decision, preferring moral to arithmetic.
 His attitude is completely different of that adopted by the Quran which goes
 in details fixing the quotas of every person in the family. Concerning
 adultery, Muhammad was confronted to a similar case. Jews brought to him a man
 and a woman who committed adultery. He asked them what the Bible provides for
 such an act. They said, âStoningâ (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22-24),
 adding that as they could not apply this norm against the rich, they changed
 it by blacking the faces of the sinners with coal and beating them. Muhammad
 refused the changing of the norm decided by the Jewish community and stoned
 the man and the woman as provided by the Bible. To justify his decision, he
 recited the Quranic verse: &quot;Those who do not rule in accordance with God's
 revelations are the wicked&quot; (5:47)</span><a title href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[9]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 Jesus in this case is a moralist, Muhammad is a zealot.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">As there
 are no legal norms in the Gospel, it was easy for the Christianised countries
 to create their own laws, first as a decision of a dictator, and later as a
 popular, democratic decision. It is interesting here to mention the definition
 of the law given in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century by the Roman Jurisconsult Gaius:
 &quot;Law is what people prescribes and establishes&quot; (<i>Lex est quod populus iubet
 atque constituit</i>)</span><a title href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[10]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 This definition sounds modern.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 Western concept of the law is now reflected in the international human rights
 instruments. If we take the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we notice
 that it is proclaimed by the General Assembly. No mention of God in it. He was
 intentionally excluded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">From what
 we exposed, we can conclude that, on the legal level, it is wrong to speak
 about âJudeo-Christian cultureâ. We have rather to say: âJudeo-Islamic
 cultureâ, as opposed to the âRomano-Christian cultureâ.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman">
 Chapter II. Islamic law and non-Muslim minorities</span></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12pt">Muslims consider that the law
 emanates from God, but God may have promulgated different laws for different
 groups in various periods.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">According
 to the Quranic perception, before Muhammad, God sent different prophets to
 transmit his law to humanity. Muhammad is the last of these prophets and his
 message constitutes the achievement of the previous messages. All the humanity
 must therefore rally to his message and must follow it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Muhammad
 endeavoured in his life to achieve this project. He entered into discussions
 with Jews and Christians so that they recognize him, invoking the fact that
 their sacred books foresee a saviourâs arrival. But these two groups refused,
 saying that their books do not mention the name of Muhammad. This one retorted
 then that they had falsified their books to make his name disappear</span><a title href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[11]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">
 and accused them to have been unfaithful to their prophets: the Jews believing
 in the Gibts and the Taghouts and adoring Moses, their high priests and Ozayr</span><a title href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[12]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">,
 and Christians adoring God, Jesus and Mary</span><a title href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[13]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 Muhammad had in the end to accept that his spiritual mission was not shared by
 the other faith communities, attributing their rejection to divine will:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Had God willed, He could have made you
 one community. But He thus puts you to the test through the revelations He has
 given each of you. You shall compete in righteousness. To God is your final
 destiny - all of you. Then He will inform you of everything you had disputed
 (5:48; to also see 2:145; 11:118; 16:93 and 42:8).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">He
 recommends to his Companions to adopt a correct attitude with the People of
 the Book, urging this group to reach a common understanding with the Muslims:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Do not argue with the people of the
 scripture (Jews, Christians, and Muslims) except in the nicest possible manner
 - unless they transgress - and say, âWe believe in what was revealed to us and
 in what was revealed to you, and our god and your god is one and the same; to
 Him we are submittersâ (29:46; also see 3:64; 16:125).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This
 theological debate determines non-Muslim legal status, mainly controlled by
 four verses:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">You shall fight back against those who
 do not believe in God, nor in the Last Day, nor do they prohibit what God and
 His messenger have prohibited, nor do they abide by the religion of
 truth-among those who received the scripture - until they pay the due tax,
 willingly or unwillingly (9:29).</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Surely, those who believe, those who
 are Jewish, the Christians, and the Sabians; anyone who believes in God, and
 believes in the Last Day, and leads a righteous life, will receive their
 recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.
 Covenant with Israel (2:62).</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Surely, those who believe, those who
 are Jewish, the Sabians, and the Christians; any of them who believe in God
 and believe in the Last Day, and lead a righteous life, have nothing to fear,
 nor will they grieve (5:69).</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Those who believe, those who are
 Jewish, the Sabians, the Christians, the Zoroastrians, and the idol
 worshipers, God is the One who will judge among them on the Day of
 Resurrection. God witnesses all things (22:17).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 classic jurists understood from these verses that the People of the Book
 (Jews, Christians, Sabians, and Zoroastrians, to whom one could add
 Samaritans) have the right to live within the Land of Islam in spite of
 theological divergences that separate them from Muslims. Certainly, the hope
 was to one day see them become Muslim, but the Quran rejects recourse to force
 to convert them: âThere shall be no compulsion in religionâ (2:256). The
 cohabitation between Muslims and People of the Book is not on equal terms, but
 of dominant to dominated. The People of the Book have to pay a tribute, in a
 state of humiliation (9:29), and to submit to discriminatory norms, notably
 concerning family law. So for example Muslims may take women of the People of
 the Book, but these are not allowed to take Muslim women (2:221; 5:5; 60:10).
 The People of the Book are called <i>dhimmis</i>, protected of Muslims, but
 these people should be closely observed because of their faith and regarded
 with constant distrust, even though they may have strong relationship ties:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">O you who believe, do not take Jews and
 Christians as allies; these are allies of one another. Those among you who
 ally themselves with these belong with them. God does not guide the
 transgressors (5:51; to also see 3:28, 9:8 and 23).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">One must
 not exclude reports based on justice, except for a case of hostility:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">God does not enjoin you from
 befriending those who do not fight you because of religion, and do not evict
 you from your homes. You may befriend them and be equitable toward them. God
 loves the equitable. God enjoins you only from befriending those who fight you
 because of religion, evict you from your homes, and band together with others
 to banish you. You shall not befriend them. Those who befriend them are the
 transgressors (60:8-9).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">To solve

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Whatever
 the relation between Muslims and other religious communities, numerous persons
 converted to Islam over time. Those that remained faithful to their faith
 could benefit by certain legislative and judicial autonomy, notably concerning
 family law. The Muslim State was then more a collector of tax than an
 administrator of society, with Jews and Christians involved in administration
 more than the less trained Bedouin who come to occupy their countries. This is
 why Muslim authorities retained both Christians and Jews as government
 officials during the course of their administration. The Quran states in this
 respect:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">We have sent down the Torah, containing
 guidance and light. Ruling in accordance with it were the Jewish prophets, as
 well as the rabbis and the priests, as dictated to them in Godâs scripture,
 and as witnessed by them. Therefore, do not reverence human beings; you shall
 reverence me instead. And do not trade away my revelations for a cheap price.
 Those who do not rule in accordance with Godâs revelations are the
 disbelievers â¦ Subsequent to them, we sent Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming
 the previous scripture, the Torah. We gave him the Gospel, containing guidance
 and light, and confirming the previous scriptures, the Torah, and augmenting
 its guidance and light, and to enlighten the righteous The People of the
 Gospel shall rule in accordance with Godâs revelations therein. Those who do
 not rule in accordance with Godâs revelations are the wicked (5:44 and 46).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This
 multi-confessional legal system persists up to today in some Arab countries
 with more or less no change, but on the whole, the approach tends to lead to
 unification. So in both Jordan and Syria, the non-Muslim religious communities
 apply their religious laws concerning family law, with the exception of
 inheritance, and have their own religious courts, whereas Egypt suppressed
 these religious courts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">We can
 then say that in the state as established by Muhammad, religion remains the
 principle criteria of division. There are the Muslims who form the <i>ummah</i>
 qualified by the Quran as âthe best community ever raised among the peoplesâ
 (3:110). Besides this main group, there are the groups who have revealed
 books: they can stay in the country, keep their belief, have their laws and
 jurisdictions, but have to accept restricted rights and to pay tribute. This
 tolerance did not apply to those among them that lived in Arabia. Muhammad, on
 his deathbed, called Omar (died 644), the future 2<sup>nd</sup> caliph, and
 told him, âTwo religions must not coexist in the Arabian Peninsulaâ</span><a title href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[16]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 Recalling this narrative, Mawerdi writes that non-Muslims were not admitted to
 stay in the Hijaz more than three days. Their same cadavers would not be
 buried there and, âif it took place, they will be exhumed and transferred
 elsewhere, because burial equalled staying for everâ</span><a title href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[17]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">

 invokes this norm to restrict the freedom of worship for non-Muslims.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">What about
 polytheists, those who do not have revealed books? It seems that Muhammad, in
 the beginning, wanted to make some concessions to them. One passage of the
 Quran, recorded by Al-Tabari, recognized three of their divinities: Al-Lat,
 Al-Uzzah and Manat. But, facing his Companions that saw in this concession a
 breach to monotheism, Muhammad denounced this passage as revealed by Satan
 (i.e.: the source of Salman Rushdieâs Satanic Verses). Although this passage
 disappeared from the Quran, traces remain that confirm a provocative polemic
 (53:19-23). Muhammad admitted the possibility of a pact with polytheists
 (9:3-4). But it was also denounced (9:7-11) and polytheists were summoned, in
 conformity with the verse of the sword (9:5), either to convert or undergo war
 until death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Muslims
 are convinced that one day all humanity will become Muslim, thus extending the
 realm of Islam to the entire world. Conversion to Islam is encouraged by
 different means. In the same time, conversion from Islam (apostasy) was
 prohibited. In this field we have contradictory norms in the Quran and the
 Sunnah. The Quran says, âThere shall be no compulsion in religionâ (2:256). It
 does not foresee a precise punishment against an apostate although it speaks
 repeatedly using the term <i>kufr</i> (disbelief)</span><a title href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[18]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">,

 Only punishments in the next life are foreseen, if one excepts verse 9:74,
 that speaks of âpainful retribution in this life and in the Hereafterâ,
 without making specifications. Narratives of Muhammad are more explicit:</span></p>

 defines as follows apostates:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">On the
 basis of Quranic verses and Narratives of Muhammad, classic jurists foresee
 the death penalty for an apostate, after having granted him a delay of
 reflection for three days. If apostasy concerns a woman, some jurists
 recommend putting her in jail until her death, or her return to Islam</span><a title href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[23]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 It is necessary to add measures of civil order: the marriage of the apostate
 is dissolved, his children are removed, his inheritance is opened and he is
 deprived of inheritance rights. Collective apostasy relates to war. The fate
 reserved for apostates is thus worse than that reserved for an enemy, no truce
 being permitted for apostates.</span></p>

 The goal of this war is to spread the Land of Islam and to convert the entire
 population to Islam. According to the traditionalists, Muhammad wrote messages
 to the different chiefs of his time demanding that they become Muslim. If they
 were monotheist and wanted to remain in their religion, they had to submit
 themselves to the political authority of Muslims and pay a tribute. If they
 refused both solutions, they had to prepare for war. If they were

 Companions, left Mecca, his native city, in September of 622, and went to
 Yathrib, his motherâs home city, later named Medina. That event marks the
 beginning of the Islamic era, the era of Hegira, era of migration. Those who
 left for Medina were called <i>muhajirin</i> (the immigrants). Those who gave
 them good reception were called <i>ansar</i> (the supporters).</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Some
 Muslims, however, remained in Mecca and practiced their faith in secret.
 Constrained to participate in the fight against the troops of Muhammad, some
 were killed. Referring to this tragic episode, the following verses urged the
 Muslims in Mecca to emigrate and join the Community of believers:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">Those whose lives are terminated by the

 âWhat was the matter with you?â They will answer, âWe were oppressed on

 emigrate therein?â For these, the final abode is Hell, and a miserable
 destiny. Exempted are the weak men, women, and children who do not possess the
 strength, nor the means to find a way out (4:97-98; see also 100; 9:20).</span></p>

 Muslim jurists thought migration toward the Land of Islam would continue as

 Ibn-Qudamah (died 1223) writes that even though a Muslim can accomplish his

 country, which is dominated by the illicit (<i>haram</i>), where they are in

 Messenger of God, but of Satan or of some Jew called Muhammad. If they are
 forced to go to Church at the time of Islamic prayer: they will be dispensed
 from doing the later, and their worship in Church will be considered as the
 Quranic prescription of prayer toward Mecca. If they are prevented from doing
 their prayers during the day: they should do them at night. The ritual
 ablution could also be replaced according to the circumstances: they can
 plunge in the sea, or rub the body with a clean substance, soil or wood. If
 they are obliged to drink wine or to eat pork: they may, but knowing it is an
 impure act and observe a mental reserve. If they are forced to renounce their

 Land of Disbelief is contrary to the words of Muhammad, âThe Muslim should not

 sojourn exposes the Muslim to perversion in matters of religion. In addition,
 by staying among infidels, the descendants and women of Muslims risk being
 diverted from their religion by non-Muslims through marriage and by adopting

 says that any state adopting this model is âpart of the Muslim world, and its
 Muslim people are an integral part of the Muslim nationâ (article 2). It adds,
 âIt is the duty of the state to strive by all possible means to seek unity and
 solidarity with the Muslim nationâ (article 72).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Muhammad
 sent some of his Companions to Abyssinia to protect them from the persecutions
 of the inhabitants of Mecca. He gave them a message for the king of Abyssinia
 asking him to welcome them and to become a Muslim. To call the unbeliever to
 Islam remains a constant concern of all Muslims. The 1983 Constitutional model
 of the Islamic Council of Europe says, âThe State and society are based on the
 following principles: [...] obligation to engage in Islamic mission (<i>daâwah
 islamiyyah</i>)â (article 3). The 1952 Constitutional model of the Liberation

 The freedom to change oneâs religion is, however, uni-directional: conversion
 of Muslims to another religion is forbidden. In addition, <i>jihad</i> is not
 excluded as a means of extending the authority of Islam. The Constitutional
 model of the Liberation Party says, â<i>Jihad</i> is a duty for Muslimsâ (Art.
 90). The commentary specifies that one should begin by calling the infidels to
 the Islamic faith. If they refuse to convert, then they can be fought. This
 Constitutional model forbids treaties of absolute neutrality because they
 reduce the authority of Muslims, as well as treaties of permanent delimitation
 of frontiers because such delimitation means the non-transmission of the
 Islamic faith and the end of <i>jihad</i></span><a title href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[50]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Some
 countries give their citizenship only to Muslims (for example Saudi Arabia and

 the acquisition of its citizenship (for example in Egypt)</span><a title href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[51]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 On the other hand, today too, the Arab countries continue to apply Islamic
 family law to any Muslim whatever is his country of origin. A French man who
 converts to Islam is submitted to the Islamic law in Egypt. He can contract a
 polygamous marriage and repudiate his wife; after his death, his daughter
 receives as inheritance half of what is received by a son</span><a title href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[52]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 classic Islamic concept played an important role in the creation of new
 Islamic States following Soviet downfall, as well as in the emergence of
 impulses of independence or autonomy demonstrated by Muslim minorities in the
 Balkans. This is the result of classic Islamic norms, which forbid Muslims
 from submitting to a non-Muslim judicial, legislative and/or executive power.
 Whenever Muslims reach a significant percentage of the population in countries
 such as England, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Holland or the United
 States, they put themselves into a similar problem as the Balkans. Note here
 that Muslims in England formed their own parliament in 1992</span><a title href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[53]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 Already in 1982, they founded an <i>Islamic Shariâah Council</i> in London,
 accepting that an Islamic court could make decisions concerning Muslim family
 law. Such a court dissolves Islamic marriages, but with regard to civil
 aspects of the contract the couple must address British courts. One who gets a
 divorce by this Council can get remarried</span><a title href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[54]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">
 Colonization of Islamic countries by European States raised the same problems
 as the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Should the Muslim countries
 occupied by foreign forces be considered as Land of Disbelief? If such is the
 case, should Muslims emigrate from these countries and proceed to a Muslim
 country? Al-Wazani (died 1923), Mufti of Fes (Morocco), mentions a fatwa
 issued by judge Mawlay Abd-al-Hadi forbidding a Muslim from staying under the
 protection of infidels whenever he may go to a Muslim country.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">According
 to this fatwa, a Muslim who frequents the homes of the infidels loses his
 faith and his life in this world and disobeys his master Muhammad because the
 Malikite School unanimously forbids conclusion of peace with the infidels,
 except under duress. Such a Muslim cannot preside over prayer and his
 testimony is rejected because Islam is superior and nothing should be superior
 to Islam. More serious is the situation of someone who trades with the
 infidels. Even more to be condemned is someone who trades with them and gives
 them information against Muslims: he must be considered a spy and sentenced to
 death. The most culpable is the person who goes to the enemy and indicates a
 way to occupy Muslims, âTo love the infidel, and to wish his domination over
 Muslims is a sign of infidelity; it constitutes an apostasyâ</span><a title href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[57]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Al-Wazani
 affirms, as reported by classic Muslim jurists, that emigration from the Land
 of Disbelief to the Land of Islam is maintained until the day of resurrection.
 It is also the case from a country dominated by evil and wrong. If a Muslim
 does not find a just country, he must choose the country which is less bad.
 Nobody can be dispensed from his obligation to emigrate from his country
 occupied by the infidels, unless there is impossibility to do it due to
 sickness or extreme weakness; in these cases, he must keep in mind to leave
 his country whenever it is possible</span><a title href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[58]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
 early years of colonialism, Muslim jurists and leaders tried to apply the rule
 of emigration. A considerable number of Muslims emigrated from North Africa to
 Turkey. In 1920, when India was declared a Land of Disbelief, a great wave of
 emigrants went to Afghanistan. That migration was catastrophic for them; they
 eventually returned to India, impoverished and frustrated. Hundreds died on
 the way</span><a title href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[59]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 majority of Muslims, however, were obliged to stay together with their leaders
 and religious teachers, to fit the new reality, particularly because colonial
 regimes were, generally and in their own interest, tolerant concerning
 religious questions. They permitted Muslims not only to practice their
 religion freely in the western concept of religion, but also to maintain their
 own laws with their own courts and judges for many social, civil and economic
 questions</span><a title href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[60]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">After the
 creation of Pakistan, Muslim Indians had to choose between staying in India or
 emigration to Pakistan. Mawlana Abul-Kalam Azad declared in 1942 to the Indian
 National Congress, âI am proud to be Indian. I am an integral part of this
 united and indivisible nation... I most never renounce this rightâ. After
 independence, he became Minister of National Education of the Indian
 government. Addressing Muslim university students, he said that if they dreamt
 of living in âMedinaâ, it would be better to join Pakistan, but if they chose
 to live in India they should accept the situation of Mecca, which meant to be
 a minority community</span><a title href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[61]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Today,
 with the end of colonization, we have the opposite problem, the emigration of
 Muslims toward non-Muslim countries that previously had colonized them. Some
 of these Muslims even acquired the citizenship of these Western countries.
 There is also the problem of non-Muslim country citizens that converted to
 Islam and the one of autochthonous Muslim minorities that live in countries
 with a non-Muslim majority as in the Balkans, Israel and the United States. Is
 it necessary to ask all Muslims to leave non-Muslim countries (the Land of
 Disbelief) and to immigrate to Muslim countries (the Land of Islam)? To what
 extend must classic Islamic norms be maintained in a world where religious
 borders are no longer national borders?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">We saw
 already that Muslim minorities in countries having a non-Muslim majority
 obtained political independence, and others hope to obtain such independence
 in the near future. While waiting for this day, one notes tendencies among
 different Muslim authors to refer to classic Islamic teachings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Muslim
 extremist groups consider their own countries as Land of Disbelief as long as
 these countries do not apply fully Islamic law. They ask their followers to
 emigrate and to go in the mountains to prepare the conquest of their countries
 as Muhammad did with Mecca. The Egyptian police call these groups: <i>Al-takfir
 wal-hijrah</i> (anathema and migration). Their real name is however <i>Al-jamaâah
 al-islamiyyah</i> (the Muslim community), which implies that they consider
 themselves the only Muslims. This group at the present time is responsible for
 many attacks in Egypt. Its ideologist was Sayyid Qutb, hung by President Jamal
 Abdel-Nasser, in 1966. He specified in his commentary of verse 8:72 that the
 emigration was required of Muslims until the day Mecca was conquered. When all
 Arabia had been submitted to Islam, a Muslim no longer had the obligation to
 immigrate, as he found himself henceforth in the country of Islam. Today,
 however, the world has reversed to the <i>jahiliyyah</i> (period of ignorance
 before Islam) and the authority is no longer that of God but of the Taghout
 (the tyrant, the devil). It is a new situation for Muslims which implies a
 re-assertion of the division Land of Islam / Land of Migration (<i>Dar al-islam</i>
 / <i>Dar al-hijrah</i>). This situation will continue until Islam expands anew
 and then there will be no need for migration</span><a title href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[62]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Muslim

<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">The Land of Islam (<i>Dar al-islam</i>)
 is one. It is a homeland for every Muslim, whose movement within (its domain)
 cannot be restricted by any geographical impediments nor political boundaries.
 Every Muslim country must receive any Muslim who emigrates there to, or who
 enters it, as a brother welcomes his brother, âThose who entered the city and
 the faith before them love those who flee unto them for refuge, and find in
 their breasts no need for that which had been given them, but prefer the
 fugitives above themselves though poverty become their lot. Whoever is saved
 from his own avarice - such are they who are successfulâ (59:9).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">One modern
 author and professor at the Universities of Jordan, Tripoli (Libya) and
 Riyadh, considers the question of the occupation of Muslim countries by the
 colonial infidel who applies his laws. Those who are occupied are in a
 particular situation, which obliges them, under constraint, to ally with the
 infidel to avoid his evil by virtue of the principle of dissimulation (<i>taqiyyah</i>)
 instituted by the Quran (3:28). Dissimulation must remain exterior, and the
 Muslim must never trust the enemy. It is however not obligatory: a Muslim can
 always abandon it and say the truth even when he risks his life</span><a title href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[65]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 On the other side, dissimulation is not permitted when confronted with an
 unjust authority</span><a title href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[66]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 Evoking verses 4:97-98, this author adds that if the Muslim fears that his
 faith will weaken, he must leave this land, even his country and his home. He
 must leave the Land of Disbelief and go to the Land of Islam where he can
 follow the norms of Islam. The obligation of immigration is maintained until
 the day of resurrection and it is an obligation for each Muslim who fears for
 his religion, regardless of where he stays. Nothing should prevent him from
 accomplishing this norm: his goods, his interests, his parents, his friends,
 the suffering he risks to encounter in immigrating, as long as there exists a
 land where his religion can be safe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This
 professor, however, forbids an immigrant whose goal is to escape holy war (<i>jihad</i>).
 Islam requires jihad to transform a country governed by infidelity into a
 country governed by Islam. If a Muslim can rely on the help of his
 coreligionists living in his country or on Islamic forces living in proximity
 to his country, he is obliged to stay because the Quran requires him to fight
 the neighbouring enemy (9:123). In this case, he who remains has merit over
 one who immigrates. Muhammad said, âO Fadik: Do prayer, give the obligatory
 alms, emigrate from evil and live in your country wherever you like... and you
 will be considered as an immigrantâ</span><a title href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[67]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 The author refers to two distinct situations: the non-application of Islamic
 law by Muslim countries and the occupation of Palestine by Israel. In the face
 of these two situations, one should make recourse sometimes to dissimulation,
 sometimes to emigration and sometimes to jihad</span><a title href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[68]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Concerning
 the problem created by the occupation of Palestine by Jews, the great Mufti of
 Jordan, Abd-Allah Al-Qalqili, issued a fatwa forbidding Muslims to leave their
 country because this will be a defeat worse than occupation itself. These
 Muslims must stay even if they must suffer. He quotes the Quran, âO you who
 believe, you shall be steadfast, you shall persevere, you shall be united, you
 shall observe God, that you may succeedâ (3:200).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Speaking
 about the Quranic obligation to immigrate, Al-Qalqili says that this duty was
 prescribed for two reasons:</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims could not maintain their faith in Mecca before
 its conquest.</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims needed men who could participate in the war
 effort against enemies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 immigration to a Muslim community remains an obligation for a Muslim when
 these two conditions are realized. Thus:</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an obligation for a Muslim who goes to America or
 another country where laws opposed to his religion are applied and where he
 cannot practice his religion, and is exposed to perversion, risks having
 children ignorant of their religion and, after his death, does not find
 somebody to pray on him. Such a Muslim engenders children who abandon their
 religion and sometimes fight against their nation and against the religion of
 their fathers.</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an obligation for a Muslim whose country needs
 him to participate in battle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">In these
 two cases, a Muslim has no right to leave his country, and if he is already
 outside his country, he must emigrate from there into a Muslim country. Al-Qalqili
 adds that if somebody is constrained to leave his country, he should do it for
 a country where a Muslim community exists and whose members help each other to
 maintain Islamic identity. Those who emigrate from their country and go to
 countries where they lose faith and engender infidel children commit a great
 sin; they prefer the life in this world to the next</span><a title href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[69]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The <i>
 Guide for the Muslim in Foreign Countries</i>, edited by a Shiite Lebanese
 publisher in 1990, recalls the prohibition of going to the Land of Disbelief.
 It quotes the Quranic verses relating to this subject and a saying of Imam Al-Sadiq,
 âThere are seven deadly sins: voluntary homicide, false accusation of
 adultery, desertion in battle, return to nomadism after emigration, eating
 unjustly an orphanâs goods, acceptation of usury and all what is punished with
 hell by Allahâ</span><a title href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[70]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 The return to nomadism refers to Bedouins converted to Islam in the time of
 Muhammad who went back to the desert, dissolving their links with the Islamic
 community and refusing to participate in its wars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This book
 claims that the Muslim must always feel a barrier between himself and the
 impure Land of Disbelief. It quotes the Quranic verse, âThe polytheists only
 are uncleanâ (9:28). This barrier must prevent the Muslim from integrating
 himself into this society. He must have the feeling that he is in an unjust
 society and that his presence in this Land of Disbelief is an exceptional
 presence dictated by the necessity that he must flee as much as possible,
 âIndeed, what is for a Muslim worse than to loose his eternal life for a
 temporary pleasure or a brief interest?â</span><a title href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[71]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>

 accuses parents who send their children to foreign countries, especially their
 girls without relatives. It explains that foreign countries attract these
 Muslim children with scholarships or by granting them political asylum or even
 citizenship through marriage with one of their citizens. This is intended to
 separate them from their Muslim milieu according to the missionariesâ plan
 which failed to convert them to Christianity, and which now tries to distort
 their personality. After the failure of military and economic colonialism

 the book denies that it is in favour of cutting Muslims off from the world;
 its purpose is only to vaccinate them against the defects of the Land of

 his beard, shaking hands with a foreign woman, abandoning prayer and fasting,

 study except in case of extreme necessity and on condition that the student is
 lucid and prudent... Muhammad says, âGod does not admit the acts of a Muslim
 if he frequents the polytheistsâ... He says also, âI consider myself rid of
 any Muslim who sojourns among the polytheistsâ. Many other sayings of Muhammad
 have the same sense. Thus, the Muslim must avoid travel in the Land of

 Ibn Abd-al-Muhsin Al-Turki, of the University of Imam Muhammad Ibn-Saâud,

 emigration is due to the fault of both: Muslim societies and Muslim
 scientists. If Muslim societies had not ceased to follow the teachings of
 Islam, they would not have suffered from this problem. Concerning Muslim
 scientists, if they had steadfast zeal and a feeling of their Islamic national
 duty, they would have remained in their places to fulfil the needs of their
 societies even if they had to suffer some difficulties and to sacrifice some
 of their interests.</span></p>

 âto recall to our Muslim scientist brothers who emigrated and refused to
 return to the Land of Islam that it is not allowed for a Muslim, according to
 the Islamic law, to live in a Land of Disbelief and take it as his homeland
 and domicileâ. He points out that, besides the underdevelopment in Muslim
 countries, the emigration of the brains has consequences on the children of
 these scientists who risk abandoning Islam. These scientists should think,

<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">The non-Muslim States, who pretend to
 be the most civilized, do not reserve for Muslim citizens any particular
 treatment in matters of family law considered by them as public order applied

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Another
 Egyptian professor wishes the creation of a Muslim family code applicable to
 Muslims living in the non-Muslim countries who opt for such a code. This code
 should be inspired entirely by Islamic law in a contemporary interpretation,
 which would be the most compatible with universal values. The purpose is âto
 allow the coexistence between the members of the Muslim community and other

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 application of such a code, according to this professor, could be limited to
 Muslims established in Europe and whose links with their country of origin are
 interrupted. But it will not be applicable either to European Muslims or to
 Muslims not established in Europe, whose links with their country of origin
 remain strong. This unified code could avoid, theoretically, the principal
 discriminations attributed to the Islamic law, i.e. discrimination on the
 basis of sex or religion. It should:</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">

 this author indicates that it is not possible to apply Islamic norms that
 impose migration toward the Land of Islam and forbid naturalization to Muslim
 minorities. Indeed Muslim minorities do not live voluntarily under non-Muslim
 domination, but are forced there and acquire citizenship in spite of them
 according to the right of blood or the right of soil. Therefore, they are not
 sinful, nor guilty of wrongdoing. Further, these Muslims can be considered
 obliged, according to Islamic law, to accept citizenship of a non-Muslim
 country, since this citizenship confers benefits and rights from the State.
 But this author adds that such Muslims must keep in mind the idea that they
 are forced to acquire this citizenship, without which they would not be able
 to have a worthwhile life. Meanwhile, they must use all means at their
 disposal to spread Islam, and be ready when a Muslim State will come about, to
 answer the call and immigrate</span><a title href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[91]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>

 acquired faith, and become fully content with disbelief, have incurred wrath
 from God. The only ones to be excused are those who are forced to profess
 disbelief, while their hearts are full of faithâ (16:106). He concludes that
 if the Muslim must disavow faith out of necessity, for stronger reason he may
 acquire foreign citizenship to protect his faith, his life, his possessions
 and his family. He also mentions a narrative of Muhammad that affirms, âAll
 countries are Godâs countries, and all believers are Godâs servants. Remain

 army to learn to handle weapons. Most who took part in the Yugoslav army ran
 away, not to participate in the war against fellow Muslims.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">It is
 important here to say a word concerning the politics of migration adopted by
 Maghreb countries. These countries conceived of emigration as having three
 purposes: to have fewer unemployed persons, to obtain more currency to finance
 development, and to enable the emigrants to acquire a professional training in
 Europe which would help their respective countryâs development after their
 return. This was considered advantageous for the receiving countries as well
 as for the exporting countries</span><a title href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[94]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 They conceived of this migration as provisional. The National Algerian Charter
 promulgated in 1976 (Title VI, V, 5) indicates the return of immigrants as one
 of âthe major objectives of the socialist revolutionâ. It adds, âFrom their
 side, the emigrants will make their return to the country... one of their
 fundamental aspirationsâ. The return is encouraged by administrative
 simplifications and tax facilities, priority for housing or acquisition of
 land for building</span><a title href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[95]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">These
 countries did not envisage losing their children for the benefit of the
 receiving countries. Because of that, they were hostile to the idea of
 Dual-nationality. Even when they support it, it remains for them a stopgap
 measure. Thus, according to article 30 of the Tunisian decree 63-6 of February
 28<sup>th</sup> 1963, the voluntary acquisition of foreign citizenship has as
 consequence the automatic and irrevocable loss of Tunisian citizenship. The
 law 75-79 of 14 November 1975 has modified this article: the loss of Tunisian
 citizenship is henceforth facultative and occurs by decree of the Tunisian
 government. This reform was aimed principally, according to the Tunisian
 press, at satisfying the complaints of Tunisians working in foreign countries.
 They wanted to âobtain for a timeâ the citizenship of the receiving country in
 order to âlay claims to the social advantages reserved for nationals of these
 countriesâ and âto avoid all forms of discriminationâ</span><a title href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[96]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This
 desire of the country of origin to keep their children is evident in the
 agreements signed by Algeria and Tunisia with France on military service. The
 Franco-Algerian agreement of 1983, as well as the Franco-Tunisian convention
 of 1982, replaced the expression âDual-nationalsâ, with âyoung peopleâ. The
 agreement with Algeria, contrary to usual agreements that link the service of
 Dual-nationals with the criteria of residence, leaves the choice open. Often,
 concerning Algerians at least, young people choose, usually under pressure
 from their parents, or sometimes their parents themselves choose for them, to
 perform Algerian military service. Once the choice is made, it is irrevocable
 according to the above agreement</span><a title href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[97]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Concerning
 Algeria, the French Commission on Citizenship indicates that this country has
 for long time been reluctant to permit the acquisition of French citizenship
 by its citizens established in France. It accepted unwillingly that children
 born in France after January 1<sup>st</sup> 1963, to an Algerian father be
 considered French by virtue of the double <i>jus soli</i> (child born in
 France to a father born before independence in Algeria); such children are
 Algerians according to Algerian law. It seems, however, that the attitude of
 the Algerian authorities is changing and that they envisage limiting their
 influence to the maintenance of cultural links</span><a title href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[98]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This new
 conciliatory attitude by Algeria can be explained by its economic
 difficulties. In the first years after independence, the official policy was
 to permanently claim the countryâs descendents, to remind them that their
 sojourn in France was only provisional, that their destiny was with their
 homeland. To stay in France was considered a desertion, to acquire French
 citizenship a betrayal, to marry a French a shame. When the Algerian
 government, confronted by its very high demographic rate, understood the
 importance of emigration for the stability of the country, it stopped its
 blackmail of Algerians living in France, âIf you take French citizenship, you
 loose forever your Algerian citizenshipâ. The Algerian authorities accepted
 with realism the departure of hundreds of thousands of persons that it could
 no longer nourish and to whom it could no longer offer a job</span><a title href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[99]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>

 Moroccan children born in France become French only at eighteen years old; and
 as familial reunification was introduced later for the Moroccan immigration,
 the question of military service has not been raised, therefore there is no

 the receiving country acted alone and thus confronted the sending countries
 with a series of faits accomplis. This attitude is reflected in many decisions

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">In spite
 of opposition from Muslim doctrine, emigration is an ineluctable phenomenon
 that Muslim countries cannot prevent, except by assuring their nationals

 but rather not to lose them completely, notably through naturalization.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">One book
 on naturalization was published in Arabic in Paris, in 1988, and reprinted in
 1993. The title of this book simply reported, âChange of citizenship is
 apostasy and treasonâ. Its author, very probably Algerian, believes that a
 Muslim who opts for the citizenship of a non-Muslim country is an apostate
 because he commits a forbidden act according to the Quran and the Tradition of
 Muhammad. This Muslim must thus give up this citizenship so God may forgive
 this sin.

 that takes the citizenship of a non-Muslim country such as the U.S., France,
 England, Germany or any other unbelieving and atheistic country, this Muslim
 becomes an apostate to which one proposes repentance for three days and three
 nights. If he refuses to returns to his Islamic citizenship, he is liable of
 the death penalty. The author mentions the narrative of Muhammad in this
 respect, âOne that changes his religion, kill himâ; âLetting anyoneâs blood is
 only permitted in three cases: the married man who commits adultery, the death
 sentence in application of the law of retaliation, and for one who abandons
 religion quitting the communityâ. Therefore, the Muslim that acquires
 non-Muslim citizenship must be considered as having abandoned his religion and
 treated as an apostate: his wife will be repudiated, his possessions will be
 confiscated to benefit the public treasury, and after his death no one will
 pray for him nor will any one bury him in the Muslim cemetery, according to
 the verse, âYou shall not observe the funeral prayer for any of them when he

 adds that to treat as apostates millions of Muslims living in countries of
 disbelief does not solve their problems but complicates them, as long as it is

<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; In time of peace, the national and civic adhesion to a
 non-Muslim State is legitimate for a Muslim because it constitutes for him a
 fulfilment of his rights and of his participative socio-economic and cultural
 life to the nation he adheres to. However, each modern Muslim author nuances
 this position somewhat, the essential being to avoid a âdilutionâ of the
 Muslim identity by the process of acculturation.</span></p>
<p class="Citation" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; TEXT-INDENT: -9.45pt">
<span lang="EN-GB">-&nbsp;&nbsp; This citizenship must always assume completely and
 fairly, with conscience and responsibility, its options, even in case of

 hesitate to see an invasion in the present Muslim migratory flux. The program
 of the National Front of 1985 uses this term; it was repeated by Giscard

 their high birth rate; the rise of unemployment in France; the progress of
 Islamic fundamentalism; the attacks attributed to Middle-Eastern groups; the
 differences between their values and those of Europeans, in particular their
 family behaviour and status of women</span><a title href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[128]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 alternative solution is to integrate them, a solution whose feasibility is
 doubted by some. According to Barreau, it is difficult for Muslims to live in
 a society where they are a minority; Islamic law only recognizes one kind of
 situation: that in which the Muslim is naturally the master of the city and
 where he applies his Islamic law. The submission to an infidel authority is
 not envisaged</span><a title href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[132]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Those who
 are more optimistic reply that integration is an ineluctable fact. Most young
 second generation Arabs are culturally French, and speak Arabic or Berber
 poorly. They are no longer able to appropriate this âheritageâ, which was
 never really transmitted to them. Once the first generation of immigrant North
 Africans (illiterate, and whose language is Arabic or Berber) disappears, the
 second will loose its anchorage in the Arab-Islamic civilization. For these
 reasons, integration and assimilation of the Beurs (Arabs born in France) are
 âas sure as the movement of life and deathâ</span><a title href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[133]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 According to this opinion, no culture from the Third World can resist more
 than one generation against the lamination of the European post-industrial
 culture. The women of Muslim origin gradually adjust their fecundity to
 conform to that of the French. The Beurettes (Arab girls born in France) begin
 emancipating themselves from the familial system. The number of mixed
 marriages increases and the children of these marriages will no longer have
 any unique or separate ethnic origin. These long-term factors reveal that the
 resistance to integration is largely a myth</span><a title href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[134]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">However,
 one cannot be very optimistic when considering Christian and Muslim
 communities in the Balkans who, after having cohabited for centuries, remain
 separate. As noted above, this situation could repeat itself in other Western
 countries if the number of Muslims reaches a critical mass, large enough to
 permit self-affirmation and assertion of its values on the wider Western
 society. All Western country policy makers must manage the situation better by
 integrating their Muslim populations. Western leaders must re-examine and
 fully understand the Islamic system and worldview. But are Muslims themselves
 ready to address these issues?</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">
</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Will non-Muslims lead them in this direction?
 Nothing is less certain right now. Claims by Muslims to have exclusive
 cemeteries or burial plots, and acceptance of this claim by certain Western
 countries, is proof among many other such examples that Muslim integration is
 really not viable. Frictions between Muslim norms and Western laws may cover
 many unexpected fields. Under the cover of the religious freedom and the
 principle of tolerance, Muslims are presenting more and more claims. I went
 through these frictions and claims in my book Muslims in the West caught
 between rights and duties. It is sufficient here to affirm that the Islamic
 concept of the law remains vivid in the West among Muslims. Here are three
 quotations from three religious responsible of the Muslim community in
 Switzerland, the country where I live.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">In an
 article titled âIslam proposes to the West a dialogue without compromiseâ,
 Hani Ramadan, Imam and Director of the Islamic Centre of Geneva, thinks that
 the system constructed on democracy and human rights creates emptiness, and
 this emptiness must be filled by religion. However, he pursues, âthe return
 (of the West) to Christianity would be a solution. But the Christian faith, by
 giving back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, disengaged itself completely
 from history. The State has put aside the Church, marginalized it and
 compromised its authority. As for Judaism, it remains attached to an obsolete
 idea of an elect race, that considerably reduces the extent of its messageâ.
 Islam alone remains able to propose faith, morals and âa system of lawsâ¦ a
 government that does not reject the democratic principle of elections, but
 which considers divine law alone as sovereign. It is effectively a
 comprehensive system which questions the principles of secularismâ</span><a title href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[135]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 opinion of Hafid Ouardiri, spokesman of the Islamic Cultural Foundation of
 Geneva, is hardly different from that of Hani Ramadan. He explains:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">The foreign Muslim must be content to
 live a temporary Islam, that is an Islam without claims. An Islam that adjusts
 willy-nilly to laws in force, even though these often reduce him. This
 foreigner, whether a worker, an intellectual or a scientific, has no choice.</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">
</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">In clear language, if he is not happy, he can
 return home. If we know what waits him at home (the worse) we understand,
 without condemning him, why should he resign.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The
 situation differs for a Muslim who becomes a citizen. Hafid Ouardiri explains:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">The European Muslim is something else.
 He is a citizen, therefore equal to othersâ¦. He must respect laws and must
 serve his homeland in accordance with requirements of citizenship... But here
 is the problem. For the faithful Muslim citizen, above citizenship there is
 his faith, with its laws, its practice, its principles and its values... He is
 therefore confronted with a dilemma. The law that governs citizenship is
 sometimes in contradiction with the one of his faith. Is Islam incompatible
 with the European citizenship or the reverse? For the Muslim, the obstacle
 comes from the narrowness of secular laws and not the opposite. Facing this
 situation, a Muslim citizen must either expose himself to a refusal on behalf
 of the authority and, in the name of secularism, to live a reduced and
 incomplete Islam in relation to divine prescriptions; or to claim the right to
 greater openness and understanding on behalf of the political authority. He
 will claim from this authority a larger political, legal and cultural field in
 order to express legally and live indispensable Islamic values</span><a title href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[136]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Certainly,
 Swiss laws have been elaborated in the absence of Muslims. But now Muslims are
 there; what can they do? Must they simply accept these laws, or impose their
 own laws? In his dialogue with Tariq Ramadan, Jacques Neirynck expresses a
 fear:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">If a Muslim community is a minority in
 a country which is a State based on law, a tolerant State - not a State that
 persecutes the faith â as in the case of most Western Europe countries, the

 margins that exist inside this law, to come as close as possible to Islamic
 concepts.</span></p>

 Ramadan answers, âPreciselyâ. And Jacques Neirynck adds:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">But without violating local law! This
 position is very important. It is a message that Western discerns in a wrong
 way. Hostility toward Muslims comes from the idea that once they will be
 sufficiently numerous, they are not going to obey the common law any more and
 one is going to find again two communities, living next to each other, with
 their own laws, with their own courts. The situation is going to become first

 other Islamic norms regarding social affaires: marriage, divorces, contracts,
 trade, and so forth. âIn this respect, every issue must be studied in light of
 both the Islamic and the legal environment so as to find a way to remain

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">There are
 different attempts to remedy the problems created by the Islamic concept of
 law. Some Muslim thinkers try to divide between the two sources of the Islamic
 law: the Quran and the Sunnah. They consider only the Quran as the word of
 God, and therefore they reject the Sunnah, reducing by this way the quantity
 of the norms covered by the label âIslamic lawâ. This is the theory of Muammar
 Kadhafi, his compatriot Judge Mustafa Kamal Al-Mahdawi and Rachad Khalifa. Al-Mahdawi
 was dragged before courts numerous years because his book entitled <i>Proof by
 the Quran</i> questioned the Sunnah of Muhammad and some Islamic norms. The
 Court of Appeals in Benghazi acquitted him June 27<sup>th</sup>, 1999,
 probably for political reasons, but prohibited the distribution or the reprint
 of his book</span><a title href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[140]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Muhammad

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Professor

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Husayn
 Fawzi (died 1988), Egyptian freethinker, adopts a similar speech. In the
 Egyptian intellectual meeting with Kadhafi, April 6<sup>th</sup>, 1972, he
 said that modern societies couldnât be directed by religion. âThat personal
 conviction intervenes in the domain of human relations, it does not create a
 problem. But we should not consider that any religion directs modern society.
 Each keeps for himself his relation with his own God and His Apostles. But it
 cannot mean that any people that progresses toward civilization is obliged by
 principles or norms of conduct established in one time or another. I cannot
 admit what my reason rejects, whatever pressures the government exercises
 against me. My reason is the leader and the masterâ</span><a title href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[151]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.
 In fact, this philosopher rejects all revelation. At the time of my meeting
 with him, September 8<sup>th</sup>, 1977, he told me that God had created the
 world in six days and that he had taken a rest the 7<sup>th</sup> day, and
 continuously henceforth he is still resting. Therefore, God couldnât send all
 prophets who came after the 6<sup>th</sup> day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">We find
 such position at the famous philosopher and physician, Mohammad Ibn Zakariyya
 Al-Razi (in Latin: Rhazes; d. 935). He expressed distrust of revelation, âGod
 has provided what we need to know, not in the arbitrary and divisive gift of
 special revelation, which only foments bloodshed and contention, but in
 reason, which belongs equally to all. Prophets are impostors, at best misled
 by the demonic shades of restless and envious spirits. But ordinary men are
 fully capable of thinking for themselves and need no guidance from anotherâ.
 Asked if a philosopher can follow a prophetically revealed religion, Al-Razi
 openly retorts, âHow can anyone think philosophically while committed to those
 old wivesâ tales, founded on contradiction, obdurate ignorance and dogmatism</span><a title href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[152]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">?â</span></p>

<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman">2)
 Answer inside the Western countries </span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Western
 thinkers are not aware of the ideological debate around the Islamic concept of
 the law for two reasons. First, the West has forgotten the dramatic episodes,
 which preceded the present secularisation. They enjoy the results paid
 expensively by the past generations, which struggled to separate the church
 from the state. We have here to notice that although very fierce, that
 struggle is probably less tragic than the struggle the Islamic society has to
 afford before obtaining the separation not between the state and the church
 (which does not exist in Islamic society) but between the state and the
 religious laws. And here is the second reason of the unawareness of the
 Western thinkers. They have never experienced such a situation. They donât
 know the difference between the two fundamental sources of Islamic law (the
 Quran and the Sunnah) and the Gospel. The Quran and the Sunnah are legal text.
 Maybe they should remember the axiom of the Islamist groups: The Quran is our
 constitution. Islamic law, according to the great majority of the Arabo-Islamic
 constitutions is <i>a</i> source, or even <i>the</i> source of law. To
 separate between the state and the religious laws means in fact to abandon
 Islam. It means apostasy, with its fatal consequences. It means atheism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This is a
 tremendous dilemma, which necessitates huge efforts of rationalization and
 freedom of expression. These two conditions are lacking in the Arabo-Islamic
 society. And here the Western contribution is valuable. The West has freedom
 of expression (although not complete) and has reached a high level of
 rationalization. Western thinkers should analyse accurately the concept of
 revelation and help Muslim thinkers to engage in such an analysis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">As a first
 steps, I suggest that the West should begin to teach in its theology schools
 that revelation as definitive and forever enclosed text is a false and
 dangerous concept for humanity, that every human has a mission to fill on this
 earth, and that the Spirit never stops to blow. The Prophet Joel said in this
 respect:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.
 Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams,
 and your young men shall see visions. Even on the male and female slaves, in
 those days, I will pour out my Spirit (Joel 3:1-2).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This idea
 is confirmed by Paul who writes to the Corinthians, âYou can all prophesy one
 by one, so that all may learn and all be encouragedâ (I Corinthians 14:31). To
 consult the Bible, the Gospel and the Quran means to have a look in the
 inheritance of humanity. But this must serve to watch better ahead, in our
 time. It is not possible to live the present exclusively with norms of the
 past. This attitude would condemn humans to immobility, and therefore
 stagnation. Imam Mahmud Shaltut (died 1964) wrote:</span></p>
<p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-GB">One who immobilizes himself on opinions
 of predecessors and is satisfied of their knowledge, and their system of
 research and investigation, commits a crime against the human nature and
 deprives the man of the grant of the reason, which characterizes him</span><a title href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[153]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">If this
 idea is taught in the West, it can make its path progressively thereafter
 among Muslims and Jews alike. Without it, the 21<sup>st</sup> century will be
 ravaged by religious wars, stirred by hallucinated and radical Jews,
 Christians or Muslims, all pretending to obey Godâs orders, given long ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">My
 suggestion aims to create the pre-condition for the birth of a <i>SiÃ¨cle des
 LumiÃ¨res</i> in the Arabo-Islamic society as well as in the Jewish Society.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Although
 this aim is primordial, it may take a lot of time and energyâ¦ and perhaps many
 sacrificed lives. In the meantime, Western societies have to protect
 themselves from the catastrophic consequences of the Islamic concept of law on
 their democratic systems and their territorial integrity. Preventives measures
 have to be adopted on the legal level. They must impose the respect of their
 laws by Muslims who live inside their borders and be very careful in front of
 any claim of this community, which infringes the secularity of the law. They
 should not give their nationality to those who consider their religious norms
 as superior to the stateâs norms. Certainly, one should not require a Muslim
 to eat pork or drink wine to obtain naturalization. But isnât right to ask him
 to respect fundamental principles such as freedom of religion and norms that
 ensue? For example, a Muslim that refuses that his son has freedom to change
 religion at the age of sixteen, or refuses that his daughter marry a Christian
 should not be naturalized. An imam who would marry the couple before the civil
 marriage must not only excluded from naturalization, but also forbidden to
 live Western countries. It would be necessary to determine the foreignersâ
 norms, which enter into conflict with Western norms, and see which the
 foreigners must ultimately respect.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This rigor
 must be observed also with regard to claimants of political asylum. Article 2
 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees states, âEvery refugee
 has duties to the country in which he finds himself, which require in
 particular that he conform to its laws and regulations as well as to measures
 taken for the maintenance of public orderâ. I have here to insist on the
 question of cemeteries. Western countries are more and more inclined to give
 cemeteries exclusively reserved to Muslims. Cemeteries are the mirror of what
 should be the relation during living persons. Muslims refuse to be buried with
 misbelievers as a consequence of their religious ideology, which separates
 between believers and unbelievers. These cemeteries are just one part of many
 claims that will soon come on the table. Therefore, I propose that all
 religious cemeteries be abolished, including the Jewish cemeteries. Any
 request for a religious cemetery should be considered as an infringement to
 the law against racism and discrimination. We have here to notice that,
 unfortunately and naively, the Churches are generally in favour of the Islamic
 cemeteries</span><a title href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9pt">[154]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The second
 point on which the West has to insist is mixed marriages. I am not opposed to
 mixed marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims. But we have to be aware that
 the present situation is discriminatory. Muslim men marry non-Muslim women but
 they refuse that Muslim women be married to non-Muslim men. These men are in
 fact obliged to convert to Islam if they like to marry a Muslim woman. On the
 other side, children resulting from these mixed marriages are always Muslim,
 and they have no choice to change their religion. Therefore, I propose that
 the state imposes a contract of marriage in which both partners engage to
 respect the law of the country where they live. Any coercion to convert a
 person for marriage must be harshly punished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">I must
 here guard against inter-faith dialogue if it is not founded on frankness and
 the respect of human rights. Christian Churches do a dis-service to their
 followers and Muslims while adopting flattering speech and sustaining Muslim
 demands, not accounting for ulterior motives and consequences. Very often this
 dialogue only serves to travel and eat well. It is sufficient to note that
 decades of inter-faith dialogues between Church leaders and Muslims have not
 even successfully put an end to abuses of Muslims who get married with
 non-Muslim women, but forbid the marriage of a non-Muslim man with a Muslim
 woman.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">If the
 Western countries have to take all possible precaution in front of the Muslims
 to avoid the implosion of their democratic systems and the disintegration of
 their territories, they have also to adopt a position of justice in their
 international relations. Unfortunately, the Western partiality has damaging
 consequences on the relations not only between Muslim minorities and Western
 countries, but also between non-Muslim minorities and the Muslim states. Let
 me remember you that the creation of Israel by the West provoked a regression
 of the liberal thinking inside the Arabo-Islamic countries. The more the
 unjust situation of the Middle-East is perpetuated, the less a solution can be
 found for the Islamic religious dilemma. âPeace will be the fruit of justiceâ
 (Isaiah 32: 17), and barbarism is the fruit of injustice. Nobody can have
 peace and injustice in the same time. The World is more and more exposed to
 fanaticism and terrorism, but these social sicknesses need justice to be
 healed. Each of us must examine his conscience in this field and recognize his
 errors. It is time for repentance before it is too late. And we have all to
 repent and to repair. Bin Laden, whether killed or not in the mountains of
 Afghanistan, is still alive inside of each of us, even inside Mr. Bush and Mr.
 Blair. The more we forget this reality, the less we can put an end to the
 troubles we are suffering.</span></p>

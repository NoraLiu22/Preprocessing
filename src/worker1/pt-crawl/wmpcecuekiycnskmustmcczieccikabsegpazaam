The only strongly magnetic   mineral collectors are likely to come across is, of course, magnetite.&nbsp;   Some other minerals that may exhibit weak magnetism are pyrrhotite, ilmenite   and franklinite.   <P>A couple of other electrical properties found in minerals are <i>   piezoelectricity</i> and <i>pyroelectricity</i>, though they are not common. They are   also rather difficult to test for&nbsp; and won’t be covered here. Anyone interested in them can find information in most texts on mineralogy.<P> <strong><a name="Acid"></a>Acid Reactions:</strong> Reaction to acids is a    property that can be used to help identify some&nbsp;carbonate minerals and    zeolites. Dilute hydrochloric acid will react with carbonates such as    calcite to give off appreciable bubbles of carbon dioxide in a relatively    short period of time. Minerals such as dolomite have to be powdered    (increasing surface area)&nbsp;to give an observable reaction. The zeolites    will be attacked by acids, especially those zeolites that contain less    silica. These minerals will become frosted in 5-10 minutes and will either    dissolve or create a silica gel when grains are left in the acid for 24    hours.&nbsp;<P><b>ACIDS ARE DANGEROUS!</b>&nbsp; Even weak acids can harm  soft tissue, such as eyes and lungs. As with dealing with any hazardous substance, be sure to read,    understand, and follow&nbsp;the labels and Material Safety Data Sheets for    the proper methods for storing, using, disposing and appropriate emergency    procedures for these materials. Always wear full-coverage splash proof lab  goggles to protect your eyes when working with acids. Also have adequate  ventilation when working with hydrochloric acid, especially the commonly  available commercial strength solutions.  <P>&nbsp;  <HR width="100%">  <P><FONT size=-2>&#91; <a href="mineral_id_keyi1.htm#TOC"><B>Table   of Contents</B></a> &#93; &#91; <a href="mineral_id_keyi1.htm"><B>Introduction</B></a>   &#93; &#91; <a href="mineral_id_keyi2.htm"><B>Identification   Kit</B></a> &#93; &#91; <a href="mineral_id_keyi3.htm"><B>Mineral   Properties</B></a> &#93; &#91; <a href="mineral_id_keyi12.htm"><B>Environments   &amp; Associations</B></a> &#93; &#91; <a href="mineral_id_keyi13.htm"><B>In   Conclusion</B></a> &#93; &#91; <a href="mineral_id_keyq1.htm"><B>The   Mineral ID Key</B></a> &#93; </FONT>  <HR width="100%">  <p align="center">&#91;<a href="mineral_id_keyi10.htm">Previous</a>&#93; &#91;<a href="mineral_id_keyi12.htm">Next</a>&#93;</p></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</body></html> contentType 9 text/html url 73 http://www.minsocam.org:80/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm responseCode 3 200

<p class="comment">Leech's illustration reveals to Scrooge what he will become after
death, a mere spectre, unable to intervene for good in the lives of people less fortunate
than himself. A woman, whom he would have ignored prior to this night of ghostly 
visitations, attempts to find shelter in a building opposite. The ghosts of the departed 
usurers are agitated because their insubstantial condition prohibits them from 
alleviating the poor woman's suffering; hence, Leech includes area-railings between the
spirits and the pauper to draw the line between the visible and the "invisible" world.</p>

<h3>Passage Illustrated</h3>

<p class="lq">The apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the 
window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open. It 
beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.  When they were within two paces of each 
other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge 
stopped.</p>

<p class="lq">Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of 
the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of 
lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The 
spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon 
the bleak, dark night.</p>

<p class="lq">Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked 
out.</p>

<p class="lq">The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless 
haste, and moaning as they went.  Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some 
few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free.  Many had 
been personally known to Scrooge in their lives.  He had been quite familiar with one old 
ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried 
piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, 
upon a door-step.  The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, 
for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.</p>

<p class="lq">Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could 
not tell.  But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it 
had been when he walked home.</p>

<p class="lq">Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had 
entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were 
undisturbed. He tried to say "Humbug!" but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from 
the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible 
World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need 
of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.

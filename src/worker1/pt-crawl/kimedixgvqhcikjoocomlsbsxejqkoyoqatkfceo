It translates through our training into competitions and has shown itself in the performances we\u0026rsquo;ve had.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg style=\"max-width: 900px; width: 100%; display: block;\" src=\"https://assets.aws.worldathletics.org/638f68d99045c9953bccd3d4.jpg\" alt=\"Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone\" /\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"font-size: 0.9em; color: #b2b2b2; text-align: right; margin: -15px 0 0px;\"\u003eSydney McLaughlin-Levrone (\u0026copy; Philippe Fitte)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has also benefitted from having Jackie Joyner-Kersee as a mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Bobby compares me to Jackie all the time,\u0026rdquo; McLaughlin-Levrone says of the heptathlon world record-holder and multiple world and Olympic champion. \u0026ldquo;She has truly spoken into my life over the past two years while I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with Bobby. The influence she has had on me, and the encouragement and lessons she has taught me, I\u0026rsquo;m truly so grateful for what she has done in the sport and for being a mentor.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the similarities between McLaughlin-Levrone and Joyner-Kersee is their all-round ability. Not only does McLaughlin-Levrone excel in hurdling events, but she is highly competitive in flat sprints too. In 2018, at the age of 18, she set PBs of 50.07 for 400m, 22.39 for 200m and clocked a wind-assisted 11.08 for 100m. During the indoor season that year, she also ran 22.68 for 200m and 50.36 for 400m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also happens to be one of the best relay runners in the world. At the World Championships earlier this year, she clocked a 47.91 split to anchor the USA to gold in the 4x400m. Even factoring in the usual 0.7-1.0 benefit for a rolling start, McLaughlin-Levrone\u0026rsquo;s flat speed suggests she could contend for major titles in the 400m flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s something she is considering, but not yet committed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Both the 400m flat and 400m hurdles are amazing options,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s still so much to be done in the 400m hurdles, but I also haven\u0026rsquo;t run the 400m truly competitively since college, so there\u0026rsquo;s room for improvement there. I think a lot of it comes down to my coach and his decision, and he\u0026rsquo;s still figuring out what to do. I think we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the schedule and what makes sense and what this year\u0026rsquo;s goals are. When we come to a decision, we\u0026rsquo;ll go for it all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if she sticks to her specialist event, she won\u0026rsquo;t be lacking in motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s always more that can be done,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;I look at that race (where she ran 50.68) and as wonderful as it was, there are still about three or four mistakes that I made. Bobby has told me multiple times that I could have done better. So there\u0026rsquo;s room to grow in all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just really never satisfied,\u0026rdquo; adds McLaughlin-Levrone, who will soon start training alongside Athing Mu as the world and Olympic 800m champion will be joining Kersee\u0026rsquo;s group. \u0026ldquo;As this generation of athletes is showing, there\u0026rsquo;s so much more we can do, and it\u0026rsquo;s really cool to be a part of that. I want to continue contributing to that for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I just want to be healthy and happy and leave whatever I have on the track. As long as I do that, I\u0026rsquo;ll be grateful.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFrom Rising Star to Athlete of the Year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with fellow Athlete of the Year winner Mondo Duplantis, McLaughlin-Levrone won the Rising Star accolade at the 2018 World Athletics Awards. In fact, their careers have followed a similar path in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both struck gold at the 2015 World U18 Championships in Cali, set world U18 bests and world U20 records, competed at senior major championships while still teenagers, earned silver at the 2019 World Championships before going on to win Olympic gold in 2021 and world gold in 2022, and have set numerous world records in their respective disciplines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother similarity between the two is their strong support system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s easy as an athlete to be very critical of yourself and reach a point where you\u0026rsquo;re not very confident,\u0026rdquo; says McLaughlin-Levrone. \u0026ldquo;But that\u0026rsquo;s why the community and support of a team is so important because sometimes you need those reminders. You\u0026rsquo;re not going to have a great race every day or a great practice every day, but it\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s being spoken over you that helps you get your frame of mind back to where it needs to be to move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg style=\"max-width: 900px; width: 100%; display: block;\" src=\"https://assets.aws.worldathletics.org/572a74a4-dcbe-45b2-a8a4-82f3f5d22881.jpg\" alt=\"Sydney McLaughlin winning the girls' 400m hurdles title at the IAAF World Youth Championships, Cali 2015\" /\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"font-size: 0.9em; color: #b2b2b2; text-align: right; margin: -15px 0 0px;\"\u003eSydney McLaughlin winning the girls' 400m hurdles title at the IAAF World Youth Championships, Cali 2015 (\u0026copy; Getty Images)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You have to trust your timeline and your process. It\u0026rsquo;s not always easy to figure out which situations are best for you, whether that\u0026rsquo;s coaching or training style or whatever else. It\u0026rsquo;s not always a straight line. In 2019 I fell short and that was really rough for me but it\u0026rsquo;s part of the process. You can look at other people\u0026rsquo;s journeys and try to replicate it, but it\u0026rsquo;s going to be special to you. You have to figure out what works for you. Once I did that, it helped me reach where I am now.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKey to McLaughlin-Levrone\u0026rsquo;s success is her ability to separate her professional career and her private life. When she\u0026rsquo;s not training or competing, she tries to detach herself and her thoughts from athletics as much as she can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In my free time when I\u0026rsquo;m not running, I love writing poetry,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t write about track at all. If I\u0026rsquo;m not at the track, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about track at all. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to be able to separate the two. So my poetry is mostly about my personal life and stuff.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also reveals that she is trying to improve her cooking skills. \u0026ldquo;I never used to cook; I was an Uber Eats girl all the way,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;ve started cooking more and I recently did Thanksgiving dinner, so I\u0026rsquo;m getting better.

It\u0026rsquo;s an amazing thing that Allyson (Felix) and Shelly-Ann (Fraser-Pryce) and other women have been able to do. It teaches your child the resiliency of continuing to pursue what it is you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for now, McLaughlin-Levrone is focused on her more immediate goals in the 2023 season, which includes defending her title at the World Athletics Championships Budapest 23.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, less than 24 hours after receiving her award at the Prince\u0026rsquo;s Palace of Monaco, McLaughlin-Levrone was on a flight back home where she will resume training in the anonymity she enjoys in LA.

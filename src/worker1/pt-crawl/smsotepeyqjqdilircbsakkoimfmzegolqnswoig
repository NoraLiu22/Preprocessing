<P>During the sixteenth century corruption became even more widespread when the 
religious enthusiasm that religious orders were found upon had been lost.&nbsp; 
When Teresa tried to reform convents to bring the "original idea" of the church 
back into life, many people opposed, making it harder for her to establish 
them.&nbsp; Not only did she face opposition for reforming convents, but&nbsp; 
she also endured her own personal hardships as well.&nbsp; One factor that took 
a toll in Saint Teresa's life was her health.&nbsp; At a young age, she suddenly 
became seriously ill and failed to respond to medical treatment.&nbsp; After a 
close encounter with death, she finally revived after her four day coma, but she 
remained paralyzed in her legs for three years.&nbsp; The experiences she 
endured would become essential in shaping the reasons that would help her to 
become a leader in the Catholic Church.</P>
<P>Known as one of the most charismatic of the Church's counter-reformation 
saints, Teresa Sanchez Cepeda Davila y Ahumada was born the daughter of a 
saintly father and pious mother in Avila, Spain on March 28, 1515.&nbsp; After 
her mother's death, Teresa was sent to be educated with Augustinian nuns, but 
after she became ill she moved back home with her father.&nbsp; She was then 
acquainted with the Letters of Saint Jerome from her uncle, which led her to 
pursue a religious life.&nbsp; She was so inspired that at the age of twenty, 
Teresa joined the Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation at Avila.</P>
<P>Although she was dedicated and devout at first, she became discouraged when 
she started suffering from personal issues.&nbsp; These personal issues included 
her illness and the death of her father.&nbsp; However, she led herself to 
reform again through intense prayer, and began to have religious experiences 
which she, and the priests she consulted, thought were delusions.&nbsp; Two 
Jesuit confessors, on the other hand, thought the delusions were genuine graces, 
and advised her to lay a firm spiritual foundation through private prayer and 
the practice of virtue.&nbsp; During this time, she had even more spiritual 
experiences.&nbsp; Her confessors ordered her to write her spiritual experiences 
down for the practice of prayer.&nbsp; This led to her writings <I>Way of 
Perfection</I>, <I>Foundations</I>, and <I>The Interior Castle</I> as a guide 
for all.&nbsp; Her writings are intensely personal and spiritual autobiographies 
that are based on her own experiences and insights.&nbsp; They especially focus 
on giving people spiritual strength and learning how to experience the 
discussion of prayer.&nbsp; It was principally for these writings that she was 
declared a Doctor of the Church four centuries later.</P>
<P>Aside from her writings, she also established convents.&nbsp; She undertook 
the project of establishing a reformed convent that would be restored to the 
devotion it had in earlier times.&nbsp; For this project, she faced strong 
opposition from several groups of people.&nbsp; However, she overcame people's 
opinions, and in 1562, she received approval for a new foundation, the Discalced 
Carmelite Nuns of the Primitive Rule of Saint Joseph, at Avila.&nbsp; She 
continued restoring several convents even though difficulties and opposition to 
the newly established reformed Discalced Carmelite foundations 
persisted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Although opposition persisted, Teresa never gave up.&nbsp; Throughout her 
life she established seventeen foundations of the Discalced Carmelites, her last 
at Burgos in July, 1582.&nbsp; Instead of returning to Avila from Burgos, she 
headed for Alba de Tormes.&nbsp; What made the trip even more difficult was her 
health problems.&nbsp; Three days after reaching Alba, she died on October 4, 
1582, and was interred there.&nbsp; Paul V declared her blessed on April 24, 
1614, and in 1617 the Spanish parliament proclaimed her the Patroness of 
Spain.&nbsp; Her persistence and determination to bring the restoration of the 
Catholic church back into life was one of her greatest accomplishments.&nbsp; In 
1622, Gregory XV canonized her, making her Saint Teresa of Avila.&nbsp; This 
achievement was so invigorating that in 1969, she became one of the first woman 
ever named Doctor of the Church.&nbsp; The remembrance of Saint Teresa occurs 
every year on her feast day which is October 15th.</P>

<H2 align=center><B>Annotated Bibliography</B></H2>
<P align=left><B>Auclair, Marcelle.&nbsp; <I>Saint Teresa of Avila.</I>&nbsp; 
St. Bebe's Publications, 1988.<br>
</B>Throughout Marcelle Auclair's life, she studied the writings of 
Teresa of Avila.&nbsp; She was interested in Teresa because she admired the idea 
that she was a modern woman.&nbsp; Yet, as modern as she was, her genius ideas 
permitted her to break through the restrictions of her time.&nbsp; Auclair 
decided to retranslate the saint’s writings and to write her life.&nbsp; This 
book is especially personable because Auclair obtained authentic background 
material from the actual Carmelite cloisters in Spain for her book.&nbsp; She 
dedicated two years of life to research for this book, and in the end it 
produced great results.&nbsp; This book is highly recommended for anyone who 
wants to be fascinated with the most vivid biography of Saint Teresa of 
Avila.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><B>Dubay, Thomas.&nbsp; <I>Fire Within: St. Teresa of Avila, St. 
John of the Cross, and the Gospel-On Prayer.</I></B><I>&nbsp;</I><B> Ignatius 
Press, 1989.<br>
</B>Dubay focuses on the teachings on prayer of the two great doctors 
of the Church on prayer, St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila.&nbsp; 
This book is well-documented in scriptural and historical references.&nbsp; 
Dubay exceeds the expectations of even those who have enjoyed his other 
writings.&nbsp; He balances the book out because he draws from both aspects on 
the spirituality of two great Carmelites.&nbsp; These two Carmelites are 
different in approach, but both brilliant, and he represents this idea well in 
an easy to understand language.&nbsp; This is probably the best overall 
introduction to Carmelite spirituality available in English.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><B>Medwick, Cathleen.&nbsp; <I>Teresa of Avila: The Progress 
of a Soul.</I>&nbsp; Image, 2001.<br>
</B>The book effectively describes Teresa's progress in establishing 
convents and monasteries against political oppositions.&nbsp; It does not, 
however, go into detail about her "spiritual experiences."&nbsp;&nbsp; Teresa 
was a woman of extraordinary and intelligence and wit, yet this book seems more 
concerned with naming every last person she came into contact with.&nbsp; The 
author did a tremendous amount of research to find out about people in Spain 
during Teresa's time, but then fails to go into detail about the people or what 
they did to help shape Teresa's life.&nbsp; I highly recommend this book to 
anyone wishing to better understand what life was like for a spiritual woman in 
16th century Europe whose ultimate goal was to be as close to God as possible.</P>

</B>This website strongly illuminates the life of Saint Teresa.&nbsp; Not only 
does it contain a significant amount of information, but it also contains first 
hand accounts of what Saint Teresa actually said.&nbsp; The quotes that are 
provided illustrate a greater picture of how charismatic Saint Teresa really 
was.&nbsp; This site is highly recommended to anyone who is interested in 
finding primary sources as well as learning about the fabulous and desirous life 
of Saint Teresa of Avila.</P>
<P align=left><B>Saint Teresa, and Otilio Rodriguez.&nbsp; <I>The Collected 
Works of St. Teresa of Avila</I>.&nbsp; Ics Pubns, 1976.<br>
</B>Because Teresa was not an ordinary woman, this is no ordinary 
autobiography.&nbsp; Despite her extraordinariness, the book is written in a 
conversational tone, which makes her ideas easy to understand and 
remember.&nbsp; This book sets the vibe as if she is talking to the reader 
personally.&nbsp; She also puts forth ideas and struggles that ordinary people 
confront, such as not being sure if she has a calling for the religious life, 
wondering what God's plan for her is, and experiencing spiritual dryness.&nbsp; 
This is inspirational for any reader because it shows them how she finds 
solutions to her questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a recommended book for anyone 
who is interested in learning what was going on inside the mind of Teresa.&nbsp; 
It especially is recommended for people who need help in their spirituality 
because she outlines the different stages of prayer that exist.</P>

<P align=left><B>Saint Teresa of Avila, E. Allison Peers Tr.&nbsp; <I>Interior 
Castle.&nbsp;</I> New York: Image, 1972.<br>
</B>Interior Castle is an insightful book because it enables the 
reader to gain a better understanding and perspective of the levels of faith 
toward union with God.&nbsp; It was written over four centuries ago by Teresa of 
Avila, but reprinted again in 1972. This book is recommended for anyone who is 
interested in learning about the perspective of Saint Teresa's 
spirituality.&nbsp; In the book, she describes the soul as a castle with 
interior mansions and in each of the mansions, there are many rooms.&nbsp; The 
journey of the soul is toward the inner most chamber of the castle where God 
resides. For anyone interested in learning about their own spirituality as well, 
Saint Teresa describes the features and characteristics in each of these 
mansions.&nbsp;</P>

</B>This is a marvelous website that displays how remarkable Saint Teresa 
was.&nbsp; It has a wide variety of information containing the life of Saint 
Teresa.&nbsp; It also has information on who the Carmelites were and how she 
played a major role for the Carmelites.&nbsp; It goes into explicit detail, even 
so far as to talking about an incident that occurred with her nephew.&nbsp; The 
site concludes beautifully at the bottom with an Epilogue that was taken from 
Saint Teresa's own work, <I>Interior Castle.</I></P>
<P align=left><B>Teresa of Avila. <I>The Way of Perfection</I>.&nbsp; Image, 
1991.<br>
</B>Written over four centuries ago as a guide for the daughters and 
sisters belonging to the Carmelite Order, this instructional-type book discusses 
the attributes of a prayerful life.&nbsp; The book is addressed to the nuns of 
whom she is prioress.&nbsp; It is mainly intended for their use, but it also 
contains information for people who want a prayer-filled relationship with 
God.&nbsp; It is undoubtedly a work deeply rooted in Catholicism.&nbsp; However, 
Teresa's own intimate relationship with God is one to be acknowledged by all 
Christians.&nbsp; She begins her work by laying out the requirements to begin a 
prayerful life, she then follows with a discussion on the vocal and mental 
prayer.&nbsp; Throughout this book she provides guidance to all who endure the 
reading.</P>
<P align=left><B>Teresa of Avila, J.M. Cohen Tr.&nbsp; <I>The Life of Saint 
Teresa of Avila by Herself</I>.&nbsp; London: Penguin Classics, 1988.<br>
</B>Rather than a history of her works and the events that determine 
her life, this book is more of a spiritual autobiography.&nbsp; In this book, 
she recounts her childhood desires and the passion at a young age to be with 
God.&nbsp; She talks of her illnesses and how she came closer to God through 
them with different levels of prayer.&nbsp; She described how God began to speak 
to her more directly when she was having visions. She also talk about the 
opposition she faced in establishing the convents.&nbsp; Throughout this book, 
she wanders from her main point to give her understanding of several spiritual 
matters.</P>

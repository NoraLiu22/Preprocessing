<p>The shield combines the arms of two great native Princes of Wales. The three eagles are those of Owain Gwynedd, and the four lions are those of Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf (Llywelyn the Last). The three eagles were also supposedly emblazoned on the banners borne by the men of Caernarvonshire at the Battle of Agincourt.<br>
The crest shows a castle, for the three largest castles in the county, Conway, Criccieth and Caernarvon. Rising from the castle were the "Prince of Wales's feathers".<br>
The sea-dragons, Welsh red dragons terminating in a fishtail, were intended to signify the maritime situation and associations of the County. The base or compartment of rocks, symbolises the coast and mountains of Caernarvonshire.<br>
The motto is a quotation from the Mabinogion, a collection of medieval Welsh manuscripts.</p>

<p>The chevrons are from the arms of the De Clare family, Lords of Glamorgan 1217-1317. They also refer to Iestyn ap Gwrgan, last native King of Glamorgan, who lived circa 1030-80, to whom are attributed the arms "<i>Gules three Chevrons Argent</i>". The Tudor roses are symbolic of the creation of the shire by King Henry VIII in 1586. The arms thus represent the historical sequence of Welsh kingdom, Norman county, and Tudor shire.<br>
The Welsh dragon rising from flames stands for the revival of Glamorgan after a long period of depression. The clarion on the banner is from the arms of the De Granvilles who held sway in the Neath district.<br>
The supporters indicate coal and steel, the two main industries of the county, and the motto is that of Iestyn ap Gwrgan.</p>

The silver salmon represents fisheries, the gold wheatsheaf agriculture, and the oak tree forestry. The wavy blue and white wavy fesse has reference to water supplies and the beacon stands for the Brecknock or Brecon Beacons.<br> 
The Celtic cross represents the many cross slabs, ruins and other ancient monuments in the area. The red dragon is for Wales and the quill pen, tinctured silver or white, which it holds, denotes an association with Henry Vaughan (1622-1695), "Silurist" poet and physician, often called the "Swan of the Usk".</p>

<p>The eight alternate white and blue wavy horizontal bands with a blue triangle pointing downward from the top, represent the peninsula surrounded by sea. The both the gold rampant lion and the three gold cross crosslets appear in the arms of the ancient Lords of Gower, the de Breos family and the Earls of Warwick. The crosses represent the Earls of Warwick, and the crosses and lion the de Breos family.<br>
The golden coronet, with four ears of corn and four acorns symbolises the importance of agriculture and woodland, and to remind us that Gower is designated an area of outstanding natural beauty. The "mount of heath", is a pun on the name of Mrs Winifred Heath, who donated the Grant of Arms to the Council. The gold portcullis is an emblem of the Dukes of Beaufort, the most recent Lords of Gower. The white lion is an emblem both of the Mowbray and Herbert families, both Lords of
Gower, and the Maltese cross reminds us of the link with the Knights Hospitallers who held the manors of Berry and Millwood in Gower.</p>

<p>The three clarions are taken from the arms of Neath Abbey, which were in turn taken from the arms of Sir Richard de Glanville, the Lord of Neath, who was instrumental in founding the abbey. The four alternate green and white wavy lines symbolise the white rivers and green valleys of the district. The gold field to the left is the the colour of ripe corn, representing agriculture. The seven drops of oil, symbolising the importance of the oil industry, and also reflecting the colours of BP Llandarcy which sponsored the Grant of Arms. The black field represents coal-mining with seven golden droplets, representing the smelting industries. Together the fourteen droplets represent the fourteen parishes which made up the Rural District.<br>
The wreath and mantling are in the two principal colours of the shield. The red band with three gold scallop shells echoes the collars worn by the supporters of the Earl of Jersey's arms. The lamb is the emblem of both the Williams family of Aberpergwm and the Llewellyn family of Ynysygerwn, later Penllergaer. The lamb wears a black collar with three gold roundels, derived from the arms of the Tennant family of Cadoxton, and the black hunting-horn is the symbol of the
Vaughan family of Rheola. Finally the banner shows the arms of Iestyn ap Gwrgan, the warlike ancestor of both the
Llewellyn and Williams families.</p>

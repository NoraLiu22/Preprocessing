<a name="Heading11"></a><b><i>I	INTRODUCTION</i></b></h2>
<p>In comparative law, there are many situations where the same legal term has
different meanings, or where different legal terms have
same legal effect. This
can often cause confusion to both lawyers and their clients. This confusion most
often occurs when civil
lawyers have to deal with common law, or <i>vice
versa,</i> when common law lawyers deal with civil law issues. While there are
many issues which are dealt with in the same way by the civil
law and common law
systems, there remain also significant differences between these two legal
systems related to legal structure,
classification, fundamental concepts,
terminology, etc.</p>
<p>This paper will not deal with theoretical examination of differences between
the common law and the civil law, but will focus rather
on various distinctive
features of civil law and common law, with several illustrations of resulting
differences in both substantive
law and procedural law. There is a great number
of these differences and all of them, of course, can not be dealt with in a
short
study of limited scope as this one. Even the books on comparative law
which have extensively examined the differences between the
civil law and the
common law could not cover all those
differences.<a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a><b> </b>Any attempt<b> </b>to make
a selection of differences between the civil law and the common law on the basis
of their importance would be difficult. Hence,
this paper will review only
several typical examples of differences between the civil law and the common
law, both in substantive
law and civil procedure. These differences will not be
examined in detail as they should serve only as illustration of those
differences.
</p>
<p>The scope of this paper will be mainly focused on the civil law issues and
will not deal with other areas of law.<b> </b>In order to emphasize distinctive
features of common law system and civil law system, some important differences
which exist within
these two "families" (eg differences between American and
English law, or differences between French and German law) will not be
examined
and it will be assumed that all common law systems are alike in essential
respects, and that all civil law systems are also
alike in essential
respects.<a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[2]</a> The paper will not enter into
polemic as to which legal system is better and what are the advantages of common
law or of civil law.
The purpose of this short study is simply to highlight some
of the main conceptual differences between common law and civil law systems,
and
to explore the possibilities of reconciling of some of those differences.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading17"></a><b><i>II	CIVIL LAW AND COMMON LAW COMPARED </i></b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading18"></a><b><i>A	Notion of Civil Law</i></b></h3>
<p>Civil law has its origin in Roman law, as codified in the Corpus Iuris
Civilis of Justinian.<b> </b>Under this influence, in the ensuing period the
civil law has been developed in Continental Europe and in many other parts of
the
world. The main feature of civil law is that it is contained in civil
codes,<a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[3]</a> which are described as a "systematic,
authoritative, and guiding statute of broad coverage, breathing the spirit of
reform and marking
a new start in the legal life of an entire
nation."<a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a> Most civil codes were adopted in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries: French Code Civil, 1804, Austrian
Burgerliches Gesetzbuch,
1811, German Burgerliches Gesetzbuch, 1896, Japanese
Minpo, 1896, Swiss Zivilgesetzbuch, 1907, Italian Codice Civile, 1942. Between
these codes there are some important differences, and they are often grouped in
the Romanic and the Germanic families. Even though
the civil codes of different
countries are not homogenous, there are certain features of all civil codes
which bind them together
and "sets them apart from those who practice under
different systems".<a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></p>
<p>Civil law is largely classified and structured and contains a great number of
general rules and principles, often lacking details.
One of the basic
characteristics of the civil law is that the courts main task is to apply and
interpret the law contained in a code,
or a statute to case facts. The
assumption is that the code regulates all cases that could occur in practice,
and when certain cases
are not regulated by the code, the courts should apply
some of the general principles used to fill the
gaps.<a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a> </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading25"></a><b><i>B	Notion of Common Law</i></b></h3>
<p>Common law evolved in England since around the 11th century and was later
adopted in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other
countries of the
British Commonwealth. The most obvious distinction between civil law and common
law systems is a that civil law
system is a codified system, whereas the common
law is not created by means of legislation but is based mainly on case law. The
principle
is that earlier judicial decisions, usually of the higher courts, made
in a similar case, should be followed in the subsequent cases,
i.e. that
precedents should be respected. This principle is known as stare<i>
</i>decisis<i> </i>and has never been legislated but is regarded as binding by
the courts, which can even decide to modify
it.<a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a> </p>
<p>The claim that common law is created by the case law is only partly true, as
the common law is based in large part on statutes, which
the judges are supposed
to apply and interpret in much the same way as the judges in civil law (eg the
Sale of Goods Act 1979, the
Uniform Commercial Code). </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading29"></a><b><i>C	Comparison between Civil Law and Common
Law</i></b></h3>
<p>The common law and civil law systems are the products of two fundamentally
different approaches to the legal process. In civil law,
the main principles and
rules are contained in codes and statutes, which are applied by the courts
codes. Hence, codes and statutes
prevail, while case law constitutes only a
secondary source of law. On the other hand, in the common law system, the law
has been
dominantly created by judicial decisions, while a conceptual structure
is often lacking. This difference is the result of different
role of legislator
in civil law and common law. The civil law is based on the theory of separation
of powers, whereby the role of
legislator is to legislate, while the courts
should apply the law. On the other hand, in common law the courts are given the
main
task in creating the law.</p>
<p>The civil law is based on codes which contain logically connected concepts
and rules, starting with general principles and moving
on to specific rules. A
civil lawyer usually starts from a legal norm contained in a legislation, and by
means of deduction makes
conclusions regarding the actual case. On the other
hand, a lawyer in common law starts with the actual case and compares it with
the same or similar legal issues that have been dealt with by courts in
previously decided cases, and from these relevant precedents
the binding legal
rule is determined by means of induction. A consequence of this fundamental
difference between the two systems
is that lawyers from the civil law countries
tend to be more conceptual, while lawyers from the common law countries are
considered
to be more pragmatic.</p>
<p>One of the main differences between the civil law and common law systems is
the binding force of precedents. While the courts in the
civil law system have
as their main task deciding particular cases by applying and interpreting legal
norms, in the common law the
courts are supposed not only to decide disputes
between particular parties but also to provide guidance as to how similar
disputes
should be settled in the future.<b> </b>The interpretation of a
legislation given by a court in specific case is binding on lower courts, so
that under common law the court
decisions still make the basis for
interpretation of legislation. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in contrast to common law, the case law in civil law
systems does not have binding force. The doctrine of stare
decisis<i> </i>does
not apply to civil law courts, so that court decisions are not binding on lower
courts in subsequent cases, nor are they binding
on the same courts, and it is
not uncommon for courts to reach opposite conclusions in similar cases. In civil
law the courts have
the task to interpret the law as contained in a legislation,
without being bound by the interpretation of the same legislation given
by
higher courts; this means that under civil law, the courts do not create the
law, but only apply and interpret it. In practice,
however, the higher court
decisions certainly have a certain influence on lower courts, since judges of
lower courts will usually
take into account the risk that their decisions would
probably be reversed by the higher court if they contradict the higher court
decisions. Judges normally try to avoid the reversal of their decisions by
higher courts as if too many of their decisions are reversed
their promotion may
be adversely affected. Hence, even though in civil law systems the case law
formally has no binding force, it
is generally recognized that courts should
take into account prior decisions, especially when the settled case law shows
that a line
of cases has developed.<a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a> </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading35"></a><b><i>III	SUBSTANTIVE LAW</i></b></h2>
<p>As it is stated in the introduction, there is a great number of differences
between the civil law and the common law and any attempt<b> </b>to make a
selection of those differences on the basis of their importance would be
difficult, especially in a short study as this
one. Hence, this paper will
review only several typical examples of differences between the civil law and
the common law, without
examining them in detail, as they should serve only as
illustration of the diversity of legal concepts characterising these two legal
systems.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading37"></a><b><i>A	Consideration and Causa</i></b></h3>
<p>In common law, a contract has no binding effect unless supported by
consideration. The doctrine of consideration essentially means
that a contract
must be supported by something of value, such as the promise of a party to
provide goods or services, or a promise
to pay for goods or services.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in civil law a contract cannot exist without a lawful
cause (<i>causa</i>).<a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a> Cause is the reason
why a party enters a contract and undertakes to perform contractual obligations.
Cause is different from consideration
as the reason why a party binds himself
need not be to obtain something in return.<a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a>
For example, a party may enter a gratuitous contract which may bind him to
perform an obligation for the benefit of the other party
without obtaining any
benefit in return. One of the major practical consequences of the difference
between consideration and cause
is that common law does not recognize the
contracts in the favor of third party beneficiary as only a person who has given
consideration
may enforce a contract.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading42"></a><b><i>B	Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties and
the Doctrine of Privity of Contract</i></b></h3>
<p>In civil law, the parties to a contract may agree that contractual rights can
be transferred to a third party (<i>stipulatio alteri).</i> For example, article
328 of the German Civil Code provides that "a contract may stipulate performance
for the benefit of a third
party, so that the third party acquires the right
directly to demand performance."<a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a> The right,
of course, cannot be forced upon the third party; if the third party rejects the
right acquired under the contract, the
right is deemed not to have been
acquired.<a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></p>
<p>Common law does not recognize contracts for the benefit of third parties.
Instead, the doctrine of privity of contract applies, which
effectively prevents
stipulations in favor of third parties. According to this doctrine, a contract
can not impose obligations on,
or give rights to, anyone other than contracting
parties: "only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on
it."<a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a> </p>
<p>The doctrine of privity of contract was developed by the common law because
common law focuses more on the issue who is entitled to
sue for damages, rather
than who derives rights under the contract. In the last several decades this
doctrine has caused numerous
problems and has proved inconvenient to commercial
practice. As result, legislation accepting contracts for the benefit of third
parties has been adopted in several common law
countries.<a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a> On 11 November 1999, the
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act received the Royal Assent thereby
removing the doctrine of the privity.<a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a> This
legislation is aimed at introducing contracts in favour of third parties into
English law. The Act sets out the circumstances
in which a third party on whom
benefits are conferred may enforce his rights against the party conferring the
benefit.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading51"></a><b><i>C	Revocation of the Offer</i></b></h3>
<p>In comparative law there are differences concerning the possibility to revoke
an offer. In the common law, an offer may always be
revoked or varied, in
principle, until the moment when it was accepted. This applies even to firm
offers which expressly state that
they are irrevocable. This is because before
acceptance no consideration is given for these
undertakings.<a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></p>
<p>In Civil law, in principle, an offer has binding character and can't be
revoked after being given (sect. 145 of the German Civil Code,
article 1328 of
the Italian Civil Code, article 3 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, article 521
of the Japanese Civil Code). Depending
on the offer's content, the offeree is
bound by the offer for the period specified therein, or if this period is not
specified, then
for a reasonable period. The offer will be considered as revoked
if it was not accepted, or it was not accepted within specified
period.</p>
<p>In practice, the differences between the civil law and the common law are not
so great as they may seem. In civil law an offer may
be revoked until it reaches
the offeree, while in common law an offer can not be revoked after being
accepted by the offeree. This
means that in the common law the offeree bears the
risk of revocation only for the period between the arrival of the offer and the
despatch of the acceptance, the period during which he is considering whether to
accept or not (which period is usually very
short).<a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a> Several international instruments
aimed at unification and harmonization of international commercial law have
attempted to bridge
these differences by a compromise
solution.<a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a> </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading58"></a><b><i>D	Force Majeure and Frustration of
Contract</i></b></h3>
<p><i>Force majeure</i> has origins in Roman law (<i>vis major</i>) and is later
adopted in civil law system. <i>Force majeure</i> means unforeseen and
unexpected event outside the control of the parties which makes impossible
performance of the contract. The
consequence of <i>force majeure</i> is
exclusion of liability of a party for non performance of the contract. </p>
<p>Common law originally did not recognise the principle that impossibility
excused performance of a contract, as it was based on strict
liability: if a
supervening event occurred during performance of the contract, in order to
invoke it, the parties had to provide
expressly in the contract exemption of
liability in such case. Only later in 19th century common law has developed
concepts of impossibility
of performance and frustration, which operate in a way
similar to <i>force majeure</i>. Under the doctrine of impossibility, a party to
a contract is relieved of the duty to perform when performance has become
impossible
or totally impracticable without his or her fault. The effect of
frustration is that the contract is considered terminated at the
time of
frustrating event and no party is liable for damages. Differently from the
courts in most civil law countries, under the
common law the courts have not the
power to adjust or adapt the contract to changing circumstances. </p>
<p>Differently from civil law, in the common law <i>force majeure</i> does not
have a precisely defined meaning. The parties have to specify in the contract
events of <i>force majeure</i> that will exclude their liability for
nonperformance. That is why the <i>force majeure </i>clauses in common law are
often very long and comprehensive trying to cover as many <i>force majeure</i>
events as possible. </p>
<p>On the other hand, civil law concept of <i>force majeure</i> does not
recognize commercial difficulties as exemption. In that respect, <i>force
majeure</i> differs from frustration. <i>Force majeure </i>applies to situations
where the performance of contract is substantially impossible, not merely
something different from what was
originally contemplated by the parties. In the
case of substantially changed economic conditions the doctrine of changed
circumstances
applies (<i>clausula rebus sic stantibus)</i>. </p>
<p>In civil law systems, <i>force majeure</i> operates independently of party
agreement, which means that it will protect an obligee even if the contract does
not contain a <i>force majeure</i> clause. Since in civil law the liability is
based on fault, the party will not be liable in case of <i>force majeure. </i>On
the other hand, in common law <i>force majeure </i>leads to the termination of
the contract and not to exoneration of a party from liability<i>.</i> In other
words, in civil law <i>force majeure </i>is related to the obligation of one
party, whereas in common law it affects the whole
contract.<a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a> </p>
<p>Within the European Union there were several attempts at harmonising the
rules on force majeure. The European Commission has expressed
the view that
"<i>force majeure </i>is not limited to absolute impossibility but must be
understood in the sense of unusual circumstances, outside the control of the
trader, the consequences of which, in spite of exercise of all due care could
not have been avoided except at the cost of excessive
sacrifice."<a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a> However, the Commission makes
clear that the concept of <i>force majeure</i> in European law may not be the
same as that in the national laws of the member states.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading67"></a><b><i>E	Breach of Contract and Fault </i></b></h3>
<p>The general principles on liability for breach of contract are based on
similar principles in both common law and civil law, but there
are some
important differences related to damages. A fundamental difference between the
common law and civil law concepts related
to the recovery of damages for breach
of contract is the requirement of fault in the civil law, whereas this
requirement is absent
in the common law. </p>
<p>In common law, fault is not a requirement for breach of contract, and damages
can be awarded without fault. Contract law is "a law
of strict liability, and
the accompanying system of remedies operates without regard to
fault".<a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a> For example, under article 260 (2)
of the Restatement 2d, "when performance of a duty under a contract is due, any
non-performance
is breach". Strict liability for performance of the contract in
common law has been softened by the exemption of liability in the
events of
impossibility, and changed circumstances.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in civil law countries, existence of fault is the basis
for awarding damages to the innocent party; the recovery
of damages can be
awarded only if the breach of contract is caused at least by
negligence.<a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a> For example, section 276 of the
German Civil Code provides that "the debtor is responsible for deliberate acts
and negligence" and
under sect. 285 "the debtor is not in default as long as the
performance does not take place because of a circumstance for which
he is not
responsible." Hence, the debtor is responsible for damages he caused
intentionally or negligently, but he will not be responsible
for damages that
are purely accidental or are caused by <i>force majeure</i>
.<a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a> Under French law, the concept of
contractual liability based on fault is found in article 1147 of the Civil
Code.</p>
<p>This general principle is subject to some important exceptions which provide
for strict liability regardless of fault. Strict liability
is introduced by the
concepts of contracts that emphasize the manner of performance (French
<i>obligations de moyens)</i>, and contracts that specify a given result (French
<i>obligations de resultat)</i>.<a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a>
<i>Obligations de moyens</i> impose a duty to perform certain act without
guaranteeing a promised result; essentially, <i>obligations de moyens</i>
correspond to the common law concepts of "due diligence" and "best
efforts".<a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a> On the other hand, <i>obligations
de resultat</i> impose a duty to achieve a promised result. While in case of
<i>obligations de moyens </i>a party claiming damages for breach must prove the
fault of the obligee, in case of <i>obligations de resultat </i>it is sufficient
to prove that the promise made was not performed. It can be concluded that the
civil law structure of liability is
opposite of that of common law: it starts
from a general principle of liability based on fault, but this is subject to
important
exceptions resulting in strict liability.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading77"></a><b><i>F	Liquidated Damages and Penalties</i></b></h3>
<p>The common law distinction between liquidated damages and penalties often
causes confusion and creates problems of interpretation.
Liquidated damages and
penalty clauses in advance specify the amount of damages for breach so that an
innocent party which suffered
damage need not prove its loss in the case of a
breach, and will recover the specified amount of compensation regardless of the
amount
of actual damages. While liquidated damages represent a genuine
pre-estimate of damage, penalties provide for extravagant and exorbitant
amount
in comparison with the greatest loss which could be caused by the
breach.<a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a> As result liquidated damages are
normally enforced by the courts, while penalties are not. </p>
<p>The common law terms "liquidated damages" and "penalties" may cause confusion
in civil law, especially in French law, because the
French term <i>"clause
penale" </i>and the English term "penalty clause" seem to be similar, but they
have very different meanings.<a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a> <i>Clause
penale</i> specifies the sum of money which is recoverable by the creditor if
the debtor fails to perform his obligations. The amount specified
by <i>clause
penale </i>should correspond to the estimated loss suffered by the innocent
party. Hence, the correct English translation of <i>clause penale</i> is
"liquidated damages clause" and not "penalty
clause".<a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a> While under common law the courts
do not enforce penalty clauses which provide for excessive amount of damages,
under civil law the
courts may reduce the agreed amount of damages if that
amount is found to be excessive because it contravenes the principle of good
faith, or even increase them, if the amount of liquidated damages is considered
to be too low.<a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a> </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading84"></a><b><i>G	Notice of Default</i></b></h3>
<p>In civil law systems, the general principle is that in case of delayed
performance of a contract the creditor must put the debtor
in default by a
notice of default (German <i>Mahnung, </i>French <i>mise en demeure</i>). For
example, article 284 of the German Civil Code provides that "if after his
obligation is due, the debtor does not perform after
a warning from the
creditor, he is in default because of the warning..." The purpose of this notice
is to warn the debtor that he
is in delay. The notice may also specify a
reasonable time within which the debtor is required to perform his obligation
(grace period).
The notice usually contains a statement of the claimant that he
will not accept performance upon expire of the designated period.
If the debtor
fails to undertake action despite the notice, this will assist the creditor to
prove the debtor's fault and recover
damages.<a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></p>
<p>In common law systems, there is no requirement of notice of default and the
general rule is that performance is due without
notice.<a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a> Instead, the debtor is bound to
perform his obligation within reasonable time. For example, Sale of Goods Act
1979 section 29 (3)
provides that "where under the contract of sale the seller
is bound to send the goods to the buyer, but no time for sending them
is fixed,
the seller is bound to send them within a reasonable time."</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading89"></a><b><i>H	Transfer of Property</i></b></h3>
<p>The rules regulating the transfer of property are different in various
national laws. For example, English, French and German laws
treat the transfer
of property of specific goods in different
ways.<a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a> </p>
<p>In English law, property in goods is transferred when the parties to the
contract intend it to be transferred (Sale of Goods Act section
17).<a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[33]</a> It is the intention of the parties,
predominantly of the seller, which controls when and under what conditions the
property can pass.
</p>
<p>In French law, property in goods passes from the seller to the buyer at the
moment when they have agreed about the goods and price
(<i>solo consensu</i>),
even though the goods are not delivered nor the price paid (Civil Code article
1583). Differently from English law, under French
law the transfer of property
is an immediate result of the agreement between the parties and the intention of
the parties is irrelevant
after that moment.</p>
<p>In German law, there are two conditions for the transfer of property: the
agreement of the parties and the delivery of the goods (article
929 of the Civil
Code). This system is based on Roman law, according to which property could be
transferred if two conditions were
fulfilled: the legal ground <i>(iustus
titulus)</i> and the method of acquiring the thing <i>(modus acquirendi).</i>
The legal ground is the contract of sale and the way of acquiring is delivery of
the goods. For example, a subsequent buyer of goods
may exercise against a
seller all contractual rights which belonged to the original buyer. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading96"></a><b><i>I	Trust</i></b></h3>
<p>Trust is a fiduciary relationship with respect to property, subjecting the
person by whom the title to the property is held to equitable
duties to deal
with the property for the benefit of designated
beneficiaries.<a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[34]</a>  In principle, the trustee
has the legal right and the beneficiary the equitable right. The trustee is the
holder of the legal title
to property and he may exercise all the powers with
respect to property that a legal owner has, but without right to enjoy the
benefits
of ownership. On the other hand, the beneficiary has no legal title to
property, but he is entitled to enjoy the assets belonging
to the trust. The
trust is not a contract but it is created through a unilateral declaration of
will made by the owner of property
(settlor). The concept of trust is used in
the company law, in the law of succession, in family law etc.</p>
<p>The trust, as it is understood under the common law, does not exist in civil
law.<a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[35]</a> Instead civil law uses various legal
institutions (<i>fiducia, fondation, Treuhand</i>) which can serve some of the
functions the trust has in common law. However, all these institutions of civil
law can never achieve
all functions of the common law trust without profound
changes of the civil law concepts related to property. In civil law, there
are
serious difficulties for a potential trustee demanding conveyance of trust
property to himself, or to register himself as the
owner of the property, as he
may not be regarded as the owner of the property under civil law.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading101"></a><b><i>J	Mortgage and Hypotheque</i></b></h3>
<p>The civil law hypotheque differs from the common law mortgage, particularly
that it confers on the hypothecary creditor no immediate
right to possession of
the property, but only a right against the proceeds of sale of the property
after enforcement of the right
in judicial proceedings. The common law mortgage,
on the other hand, gives and immediate right of property to the mortgagee, who
can take possession of the property by a simple notice, without the necessity of
taking suit, as well as a right of foreclosure at
law. </p>
<p>Under common law, when foreclosure process is completed and the mortgagor
failed to pay his debt to the mortgagee, from that moment
the mortgagor has lost
his property right and the mortgagee obtains the absolute control of the
property. As a consequence, the mortgagor's
right to recover his property is
extinguished and the mortgagee can exercise all property rights. On the other
hand, under civil
law the mortgagor remains the owner of the property until the
purchaser obtains ownership, and the mortgagee acquires property only
of the
money paid by the purchaser in the amount of his claim plus interest.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading104"></a><b><i>K	Bills of Exchange</i></b></h3>
<p>There are two main legal systems which regulate the law of bills of exchange.
First group covers the countries which adopted the Geneva
Uniform Law on Bills
of Exchange and Promissory Notes 1930, which is mainly based on French and
German law. This system is adopted
in most civil law countries. Second system
applies in common law countries and is based on the English Bills of Exchange
Act 1882,
and the American Uniform Negotiable <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ia1896182/" class="autolink_findacts">Instruments Act 1896</a>, which was
later replaced by section 3 of the UCC. Between these two systems there are some
important differences. Here are some
illustrations.</p>
<p>As compared to the civil law system, in the common law system the bill of
exchange is not subject to such strict rules regarding its
form and content. For
example, while under article 1 of the Geneva Uniform Law on Bills of Exchange
1930 the term "bill of exchange"
has to be inserted in the document, no such
requirement exists in common law system.</p>
<p>In common law there is a special kind of bill of exchange called "promissory
note". A promissory note contains an unconditional promise
whereby the maker
undertakes to pay a definite sum of money to the payee or to his order. The
promissory note can be distinguished
from the bill of exchange mainly because it
contains a direct promise of payment by the person who signs it, instead of an
order
directing a drawee to pay. So, in case of promissory notes, there is no
drawee involved. </p>
<p>In civil law, the bill of exchange is strictly an abstract document, which
means that the obligations arising from the document are
unconditional and
cannot be connected with obligations from other documents. So, under article 26
of the Geneva Uniform Law, the
acceptance of a bill of exchange is
unconditional. Under common law, the obligation from a bill of exchange can be
made subject to
performance of another
obligation.<a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[36]</a> </p>
<p>Under Geneva Uniform Law a bill of exchange can be issued on order only,
while under common law a bill of exchange can be issued on
bearer.<a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[37]</a> </p>
<p>Under article 30 of the Geneva Uniform Law payment of a bill of exchange may
be guaranteed by a special kind of guarantee instrument
called "<i>aval</i>". An
<i>aval</i> is given by a signature of the giver of this guarantee on the bill
of exchange. The <i>aval</i> should also specify for whose account it is given.
The giver of an <i>aval</i> is bound in the same manner as the person for whom
he guarantees. In the common law system, there is no this kind of special kind
of guarantee, but the guarantee relating to bills of exchange is governed by the
general principles of suretyship.<a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[38]</a></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading114"></a><b><i>IV	CIVIL PROCEDURE</i></b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading115"></a><b><i>A	Comparison of Procedural law</i></b></h3>
<p>Differences in procedural law between the civil law and common law are even
more obvious than those in substantive law. Common law
procedure is usually
called "adversarial", which means that the judge acts as neutral arbiter between
the parties in dispute as they
each put forward their case. The parties in a
dispute lead the proceedings, while the position of judge is rather passive as
he or
she does not undertake any independent investigation into the subject
matter of the dispute. The role of judge is not to find the
ultimate truth. The
judge's main task is to oversee the proceedings and to ensure that all aspects
of the procedure are respected.
The judge does not himself interrogate the
witnesses, but his task is to ensure that the questions the parties put to the
witnesses
are relevant to the case. At the end, the judge should decide the case
according to the more convincing of the competing presentations.</p>
<p>Civil law procedure is usually called "inquisitorial", because the judge
examines the witnesses, and the parties in dispute practically
have no right of
cross-examination. Compared to common law, the judge in civil law plays a more
active role in the proceedings, eg
by questioning witnesses and formulating
issues. This is because the court has the task to clarify the issues and help
the parties
to make their arguments. The judge plays the main role in
establishing the material truth on the basis of available evidence. The
judge
does not have to wait for the counsels to present evidence, but he or she can
actively initiate introducing of relevant evidence
and may order one of the
parties to disclose evidence in its possession. The judge has a task not merely
to decide the case according
to the stronger of the competing presentations, but
to ascertain the definite truth and then to make a just decision. </p>
<p>With respect to the resolution of legal issues, the civil law system is based
on the principle "<i>jura novit curia</i>" ("the Court is supposed to know the
law"), which means that there is no need for parties to plead the law. On the
other hand, in
common law the law has to be pleaded, the precedents for or
against have to be submitted and distinguished.</p>
<p>The use of the terms "adversarial" and "inquisitorial" is misleading and can
not help much in identifying the actual differences between
the common law and
civil law procedures, as these two terms could be used for both
procedures.<a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[39]</a> In order to find out those
differences the more appropriate way is to compare certain aspects of common law
and civil law procedures,
such as the way of determination of facts, service of
documents, rules on admission and weight of evidence,<i> </i>witness statements,
position of court experts,<i> </i>standard of proof in civil and criminal cases.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading121"></a><b><i>B	Determination of Facts </i></b></h3>
<p>While in common law system the parties and the court first investigate the
facts in order to establish the truth, in civil law system
the court is mainly
concerned with the claims of the parties as they are expressed in the pleadings.
In common law a complaint is
merely a formality which starts a procedure of
investigation aimed at establishing the truth. On the other hand, in civil law
the
complaint actually determines the parameters of the case. Consequently, the
judges in civil law countries will concentrate on the
facts which are submitted
by the parties and if the facts as presented by the parties differ, the judge
will make a decision on the
basis of the available evidence as presented by the
parties.</p>
<p>The parties, of course, are also active in a civil law trial. The parties are
entitled to introduce evidence and propose motions.
The parties are allowed to
introduce evidence after providing the other side with an opportunity to
inspect. While the judge makes
the initial interrogation of witnesses, the
counsels have the right to make additional questions.</p>
<p>Also, there are important differences between civil law and common law in the
way a trial is conducted. A civil law trial is consisted
of a number of
hearings, and written communications between the parties, their attorneys and
the judge during which an eventual dispute
on court's jurisdiction is resolved,
evidence is presented, and motions are made. Compared to the common law system,
there is less
emphasis on oral arguments and examination. Instead, written
communication is prevailing, and if during the trial a new point is
raised by
one of the attorneys, the other may ask the court for a certain period of time
to answer that issue in writing. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading125"></a><b><i>C	Service of Documents and Discovery</i></b></h3>
<p>Another important difference between common law and civil law exists in the
methods of gathering evidence in the pre-trial stage.</p>
<p>In common law, the pre-trial search for evidence is dominated by the process
of discovery. The parties are obliged to produce for
inspection by the other
party all documents or information which are relevant to the matters in dispute
and which are in their possession
without the intervention of the court, whether
or not the documents favor their claim or defense. Through discovery of
documents,
the parties to a dispute can obtain access to facts and information
the adverse party intends to rely on at trial. Thus, discovery
enables the
parties to obtain facts and information about the case from the other party,
which assists them in preparing for trial.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, in civil law civil there is no pre-trial discovery. The
main purpose of evidence presented by a party is to prove
his or her legal or
factual arguments. Consequently, a party is obliged to produce only those
documents which are referred to in
its pleadings. Under civil law, the parties
are not obliged to produce documents voluntarily to the other party during the
course
of civil litigation. While in the common law system the parties should
collect and introduce evidence, in the civil law system the
judge plays the main
role in collecting evidence.<a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[40]</a> If one party
wishes to obtain access to documents held by another party, it will have to ask
the court to order the other party to
disclose the document in question. So,
while the common law process of discovery is, generally speaking, a private
matter, performed
by lawyers in accordance with prescribed procedure, the civil
law process of collecting evidence is a public function conducted by
the court.
This is in accordance with the general principle in the civil law system that
the court rather than the parties is in
the charge of the process of the
development of evidence.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading130"></a><b><i>D	Rules on Admission and Weight of
Evidence</i></b></h3>
<p>The common law contains several rules which restrict admission of evidence.
The main barriers to the production of documentary evidence
are: authencity, the
hearsay rule, and the best evidence rule. The requirement of authencity as a
condition precedent to admissibility
of evidence is satisfied by evidence
sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its
proponent claims.<a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[41]</a> The authencity of a
document may be proven in any way, such as handwriting verification, or oral
testimony of a person who saw the
document executed. The admission of the
authencity of a document is no evidence that the content of the document is
accurate, nor
does it deprive a party of an opportunity to object to its
admissibility in evidence.<i> </i>Under the "hearsay" rule, a witness may not
testify about fact of which he or she has no direct knowledge, eg about
conversation of
other people a witness heard. Under the "best evidence" rule,
the evidence must constitute the best available evidence. In the case
of written
documents, the original document must be presented.</p>
<p>The civil procedure rules in the civil law system contains the rules on
evidence which determine what may be introduced as evidence
and sets conditions
of admissibility and weight of evidence. However, in the civil law, while there
are some restrictions, there
are not rules corresponding to the common law rules
on admissibility such as " hearsay" and "best evidence" rules. In principle,
any
evidence is admissible, but the court will evaluate how much weight is to be
accorded to an evidence. Evidence admitted is subject
to appeals for factual
error.<a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[42]</a></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading135"></a><b><i>E	Witness Statements</i></b></h3>
<p>There are significant differences between common law and civil law in
relation to witness evidence. One of the basic principles of
common law is the
cross-examination of witnesses, which allows a thorough examination of the case.
Oral evidence is given considerable
weight and will usually prevail over written
evidence. At a common law trial witnesses are examined and cross-examined in the
presence
of the judge and jury. Motions and objections are often made orally by
counsel, and the judge rules on orally on them. </p>
<p>In the civil law, on the contrary, written evidence prevails over oral
evidence. If a claim is supported by a document, the judge
will usually not go
further. If a document is contradicted by oral statement of a witness the
document will normally prevail. In
commercial cases, the use of witness evidence
is very unusual. In some civil law countries, the court may even exclude the
evidence
given by a party witness in his or her own case. In criminal cases,
most civil law countries recognize testimonial privilege for
potential witnesses
drawn from the family. </p>
<p>Cross-examination of witnesses is virtually unknown in civil law. However, in
some civil law countries counsel is allowed to question
the witness directly,
while in some other civil law countries counsel can only formulate questions and
ask the judge to put them
to the witness.<a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[43]</a>
The judge has a discretionary right to decide whether to ask the proposed
questions or not. The judge also has the power to ask further
questions beyond
those proposed by the parties, if that is necessary for establishing the truth.
The usual practice in most civil
law countries is that witness testimony in not
recorded verbatim, but the judge dictates a summary of the testimony into the
dossier
in the judge's own words. In common law, this practice would be
considered as a denial of basic procedural fairness. </p>
<p>Another important difference between common law and civil law, in relation to
the witness evidence, is so-called "preparation of witnesses".
In common law,
counsel would normally "prepare" their witnesses for the hearing in order to
avoid surprises during the trial and
to make sure that the witness statements
are accurate. </p>
<p>In civil law, the preparation of witnesses is strictly forbidden. The
attorneys are normally not allowed to discuss the issues related
to trial with
witnesses out of court and may face disciplinary sanctions if they breach this
rule. If the judge is informed that
a witness was questioned by the attorney
before the trial, the witness' testimony may not be given full
credibility.<a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[44]</a></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading143"></a><b><i>E	Court Experts and Expert Witnesses</i></b></h3>
<p>The courts often invite experts in certain fields to give testimony on the
facts which require highly technical knowledge, such as
engineers, physicians,
accountants, handwriting experts, etc. They are considered as witnesses whose
task is to provide the court
with information related to a specialized area.
</p>
<p>In common law, the experts are appointed and paid by the parties. Therefore,
the experts are usually partial and their task is to
support the position of the
party who appointed them. Like other witnesses, they are examined and
cross-examined by attorneys. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the experts in a civil law trial are not considered as
witnesses and they are usually called "court's experts".
The court experts are
appointed by the court, not by the parties, and they are expected to be
impartial. The courts often rely on
expert opinion, and many cases are decided
mainly on the basis of expert evidence. The expert is usually instructed by the
court
to prepare a written opinion, which is then circulated to the attorneys.
The attorneys may interrogate the expert at a hearing. If
one of the parties
objects to the expert opinion, or the court finds the expert's report
unsatisfactory, the court may appoint another
expert. A party may propose a
particular expert but the court may reject this proposal and select another
expert.<a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[45]</a></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading148"></a><b><i>F	Effect of a Criminal Judgment on Subsequent
Civil Proceedings</i></b></h3>
<p>When one wrongful act serves as basis for both civil and criminal liability,
among common law and civil law systems there are some
important difference
related to the effect of a criminal judgment on subsequent civil
proceedings.</p>
<p>In common law, the rule is that in a civil action facts in issue cannot be
proved by reference to previous criminal
proceedings.<a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[46]</a> In civil proceedings, the
criminal judgment is not admitted as evidence of the facts established by it,
even against the person who
is a party in both proceedings. Hence, the civil
court is free to decide differently from the criminal court even if the facts of
the case are the same. It is important to note that in common law, there is a
difference of standard of proof in civil and criminal
cases. In civil cases the
plaintiff is required to prove a "balance of probabilities" or "preponderance of
evidence", which means
to prove that what is sought to be proved is more likely
true than not. In criminal cases the standard of evidence is "beyond reasonable
doubt" which is much stricter. </p>
<p>In many civil law jurisdictions a criminal judgment has the force of a
conclusive evidence and binds the whole
world.<a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[47]</a> Criminal jurisdiction is regarded as
superior to civil jurisdiction (<i>le criminel emporte sur le civil</i>), and
civil courts are bound by the decisions of criminal courts. Actually, there is
often a direct link between the criminal fault
and the civil tort liability: the
conviction in a criminal case may serve as a basis for the award of damages in a
civil tort case.
</p>
<p>Differently from common law, in civil law the standard of proof is the same
for both criminal and civil cases. Also, under civil law,
there is no
distinction between criminal and civil negligence, so if the criminal court has
acquitted a person of negligence, the
civil court will be bound by this
judgment. However, there are some exceptions and limits to this principle. For
example, if the
criminal court has acquitted a person of liability in a criminal
case, the civil court is free to hold that person civilly liable
under the rule
of strict liability. Also, in some civil cases (eg cases related to traffic
accidents), the civil court is not bound
by the views of the criminal court
related to the extent of the damage suffered by a plaintiff. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading155"></a><b><i>G	Attachment and Saisie
Conservatoire</i></b></h3>
<p>Under American law, the plaintiff can rely on attachment for securing its
claim against defendant before the court renders the
judgment.<a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[48]</a>  Attachment is the legal process
of seizing the defendant's property in accordance with a writ or judicial order
for the purpose
of securing satisfaction of the judgment in the event the suit
succeeds. While under English law there is no attachment, the Mareva
injunction,
introduced into English law in 1975, has similar
effect.<a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[49]</a> Mareva injunction prohibits the
defendant, before or during a suit, from removing assets from the jurisdiction
or from dealing with
them when it appears to the court that without such an
order the plaintiff's recovery on his claim will be imperiled. It is merely
a
court order freezing assets and it does not relate to the merits of the case.
</p>
<p>Under French law, <i>saisie conservatoire </i>permits any property of the
debtor to be seized and detained by the court pending judgment. The judgment in
favor of claimant can
be enforced against the attached property. Similarly to
attachment in American law, but differently from Mareva injunction, <i>saisie
conservatoire</i> places the defendant's assets under the court's authority so
as to permit their judicial sale in order to enforce the judgment allowing
the
claim.</p>
<p>Maritime law offers an interesting comparison of effects of the civil law and
common law versions of attachment. In maritime law there
are two types of
action: <i>in personam</i> and in<i> rem</i>. While action<i> in personam </i>is
common to any jurisdiction or branch of law, action in<i> rem </i>is virtually
unknown outside maritime law. An action<i> in rem</i> literally means "against
the thing". This suit is filled against the vessel itself and can be brought
even though the owner has no
personal liability, eg supplies ordered by a
charterer, or collision or marine pollution caused by the master or crew
employed by
the bareboat charterer. Thus, the liability of ship is personalized
and may exist independently of the liability of shipowner. </p>
<p>In civil law, the arrest of a ship is a kind of pre-trial attachment; a ship
may be arrested either to enforce a maritime lien or
a personal claim against
the owner. In both cases the action is directed against the owner personally and
never against a ship. Differently
from the attachment under common law,
<i>saisie conservatoire </i>can be applied to property other than ships and
ships can be arrested for most civil claims, not only maritime.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading162"></a><b><i>V	 RAPPROCHEMENT OF COMMON LAW AND CIVIL
LAW</i></b></h2>
<p>During the period of national codification many divergent legal systems were
established, which proved to be an obstacle to the world
economic integration.
Since the end of 19th and the beginning of 20th century started the process of
unification and harmonization
of law, especially in the fields of international
private and public law. The growing globalisation of the world economy, based on
closer integration and cooperation among states, imposed a need for legal
certainty and unification of law, so that an eventual dispute
could be solved in
the same way regardless of what court decides it and what law applies to it.
This process involved reducing differences
between various legal systems and an
approaching between common law and civil law legal
systems.<a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[50]</a> As an illustration of this
rapprochement, English law has introduced contracts for benefit of third parties
by adopting the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, while the Japanese
Code Civil Procedural provides for possibility of direct examination and
cross-examination
of witnesses.</p>
<p>The binding force of precedents, as one of the main distinctive features of
common law, is not so unique to the common law as it may
seem, because of the
actual influence the case law has on the courts in all legal
systems.<a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[51]</a> In some civil law countries the
decisions of supreme courts have been made binding by statute. Even in the
countries where the decisions
of higher courts are not formally binding, they
are likely to be followed by lower courts. On the other hand, the rigidity of
the
<i>stare decisis </i>doctrine has been softened by a number of changes in
the common law countries, including the famous Practice Statement by the House
of Lords, which declared that it considered itself no longer formally bound by
its own precedents.<a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[52]</a> Whether courts are
bound or not by precedents, judges in all legal systems are aware that the need
of reasonable certainty and predictability
requires that like cases be treated
alike. Hence, in contemporary civil law the role of judges in the creation of
law is increasingly
important, while the difference between civil law and common
law courts shows a tendency of disappearing, or at least looking less
significant. The presence or absence of a formal doctrine of <i>stare decisis
</i>does not have crucial importance and it may be expected that differences
between the common law and civil law systems in this area
will diminish over
time.<a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[53]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, large sections of common law have been regulated by
statutes and even codes (eg the UCC). This proliferation of
statute law in the
common law system has narrowed the court's power of interpretation. Modern
common law courts also tend to give
greater weight to the problem of
individualised justice in the particular case instead of trying to provide
guidance for the future.<a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[54]</a> This tendency
makes the role of common law courts similar to that played by the civil law
courts.</p>
<p>An important step towards bringing together the civil law and the common law
has been made through adopting international treaties,
conventions and uniform
rules containing elements of both the civil law and the common law. Such an
example is the 1980 Vienna Sales
Convention, which was adopted by both the civil
law and the common law countries.<a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[55]</a> The
UNIDROIT Principles for International Commercial Contracts represent another
attempt at bridging differences between the civil
law and the common
law.<a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[56]</a> Differently from the Vienna
Convention, the UNIDROIT Principles are not intended to become binding law, but
they are aimed to serve
as a model to national legislators and to provide
guidance to courts and arbitrators when interpreting existing uniform law and
deciding
disputes relating to international commercial contracts. As result of
the attempts to reconcile differences between the civil law
and the common law,
the Vienna Convention and UNIDROIT Principles contain some identical
provisions.<a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[57]</a> The 2000 INCOTERMS provides an
additional set of rules which uniformly regulates the transfer of risk and costs
in contracts of sale,
thus avoiding inconveniences which may arise from
differences between the civil law and the common law. There are similar examples
in other fields of law, like international carriage of goods, international
payments, international commercial arbitration. </p>
<p>The creation of European Union (EU) law has greatly contributed to the
process of rapprochement between common law and civil
law.<a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[58]</a> The EU has brought together different
legal systems under a single legislature, especially after 1973, when the UK and
Ireland joined
the EU. The membership of these common law countries, in addition
to all other civil law countries opened the way for convergence
within the EU of
common law and civil law elements and creation of a common legal framework.
Hence, the EU legal system represents
a mixed system which contains elements of
both civil law and common law systems. </p>
<p>The EU has been very active in adopting a great number of regulations and
directives which have precedence over national laws. These
legislation of EU
often incorporate elements specific for either civil law or common law. There
are several examples of common law
elements incorporated in the EU law, like the
concept of true and fair view in accounting
law.<a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[59]</a> The European Parliament has adopted
several resolutions calling for unification of private law, especially in the
areas relevant
to the development of common
market.<a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[60]</a> Also, the Commission on European
Contract Law (the Lando Commission) has prepared the Principles of European
Contract Law, which
attempt to reconcile the differences between the civil law
and the common law.<a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[61]</a> These Principles
presently have the status of 'soft law', but they may be the forerunner of a
European Civil Code which would greatly
contribute to the further convergence of
civil law and common law.<a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[62]</a></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading183"></a><b><i>VI	CONCLUSION</i></b></h2>
<p>The examination of common law and civil law reveals that there are more
similarities than differences between these two legal systems.
Despite very
different legal cultures, processes, and institutions, common law and civil law
have displayed a remarkable convergence
in their treatment of most legal issues.
</p>
<p>Under the contemporary pressure of globalisation, modern civil law and common
law systems show several signs of convergence. Many
of the differences that used
to exist between the civil law and common law systems are now much less visible
due to the changes which
have occurred both in common law and civil law. In the
common law, regulatory law has achieved a greater importance leaving less
room
for the courts, while in the civil law the role of the courts in the creation of
law has greatly increased. As a result of these
processes going to opposite
directions, many of the differences between common law and civil law look now
more like nuances rather
than major differences. </p>
<p>The differences which exist between civil law and common law should not be
exaggerated. It is also important to note that differences
on many issues exist
both among civil law and among common law countries. The differences between
civil law and common law systems
are more in styles of argumentation and
methodology than in the content of legal norms. By using different means, both
civil law
and common law are aimed at the same goal and similar results are
often obtained by different reasoning. The fact that common law
and civil law,
despite the use of different means arrive at the same or similar solutions is
not surprising, as the subject-matter
of the legal regulation and the basic
values in both legal systems are more or less the same.</p>
<p>While a certain rapprochement between civil law and common law systems is
evident and this tendency will continue, there are still
important differences
which will continue to exist for an indefinite period. This paper has given
several examples of these differences
between the common law and civil law
systems. An awareness of these differences is necessary for any lawyer dealing
in international
law. The differences in some areas are substantial and the
parties contemplating starting proceedings in another legal system are
advised
to check those differences before taking action. </p>
<p>The aim of this paper was not to judge which legal system is better: civil
law or common law. The task of lawyers should not be to
defend their legal
systems, but to improve them. Each legal system may have some advantages and
deficiencies. If a foreign legal
system has some advantages, why not incorporate
them in the domestic legal system? In that way the resulting convergence of the
two
legal systems can only contribute to their common goal of creating a fair
and just legal system which can provide legal certainty
and protection to all
citizens and legal persons.</p>

<p>Si les probl&egrave;mes de droit sont parfois r&eacute;gl&eacute;s de la
m&ecirc;me mani&egrave;re dans la tradition civiliste et
la common law, les
diff&eacute;rences sont n&eacute;anmoins plus marqu&eacute;es larsqu'il siagira
notamment de comparer l'organisation
judiciaire que r&eacute;gissent les deux
syst&egrave;mes, la m&eacute;thode de classification et la terminologie retenue
ou encore
leus principes fondamentaux en vigueur dans chaque syst&egrave;me.</p>
<p>Cet article ne prend pas en compte l'approche th&eacute;orique des
diff&eacute;rences qui peuvent exister entre le droit civil et

mais s'int&eacute;resse surtout &agrave; ce qui fait l'originalit&eacute; de
chaque syst&egrave;me tant dans le droit
substantiel que proc&eacute;dural. 
L'article ne tente pas de d&eacute;terminer lequel de ces deux syst&egrave;mes
est le plus &eacute;labor&eacute;
ou est le mieux adapt&eacute; &agrave;
apporter une solution juste et &eacute;quitable &agrave; un probl&egrave;me de
droit donn&eacute;,
il s'agit avant tout de mettre en exergue les
diff&eacute;rences qui existent et de consid&eacute;rer les &eacute;ventuelles
possibilit&eacute;s

s'opposent.</p>

<p><a name="fn4" href="#fnB4">[3]</a> 	The term "civil law" has two meanings: in
its narrow meaning it designates the law related to the areas covered by the
civil codes,
while broader meaning of civil law relates to the legal systems
based on codes as contrasted to the common law system. In this paper
the broader
meaning of civil law shall be used.</p>

<p><a name="fn7" href="#fnB7">[6]</a> 	Eg Italian Civil Code art 12 para 2
provides that "if a controversy cannot be decided by a precise provision,
consideration is given
to provisions that regulate similar cases or analogous
matters; if the case still remains in doubt, it is decided according to the
general principles of the legal order of the State." Similar provision is
contained in article 4 of the French Code Civil. </p>
<p><a name="fn8" href="#fnB8">[7]</a> 	There is a distinction in the way the
stare decisis<i> </i>doctrine is applied by American and English courts. In the
United States, under this doctrine a lower court is required to follow
the
decision of a higher court in the same jurisdiction. In England, the previous
rule under which courts were bound by their own
prior decisions was reversed by
the House of Lords (Practice Statement) which declared that it considered itself
no longer formally
bound by its own precedents and announced its intention "to
depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so." [1966]

<p><a name="fn40" href="#fnB40">[39]</a> 	The use of the adjective
"inquisitorial" has a negative connotation, referring to the notorious Spanish
Inquisition, known for its
use of torture in obtaining confessions. The term
"adversarial" applied to the common law procedures would be more appropriate, as
the core of the both civil law and common law proceedings is the opposition of
contending parties, while the judge acts as an independent
arbitrator. A more
active role of the judge in civil law proceedings does not justify the use of
term "inquisitorial". </p>

system,

<p>Peter Schrag, &quot;The Forgotten American,&quot; <em>Harper's</em>, August 1969, pp. 27-34. 
<p>[Journalist Peter Schrag wrote this article to explain the backlash against LBJ's liberalism, the turn away from the New Deal coalition, and the rise of political conservatism.] 
<hr>
<p align="left">There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics. Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank. The man under whose hat lies the great American desert. Who watches the tube, plays the horses, and keeps the niggers out of his union and his neighborhood. Who might vote for Wallace (but didn't). Who cheers when the cops beat up on demonstrators. Who is free, white, and twenty-one, has a job, a home, a family, and is up to his eyeballs in credit. In the guise of the working class - or the American yeoman or John Smith - he was once the hero of the civics books, the man Andrew Jackson called "the bone and sinew of the country." Now he is the "forgotten man," perhaps the most alienated person in America. . . . </p>
<p>Nothing quite fits, except perhaps omission and semi-invisibility. America is supposed to be divided between affluence and poverty, between slums and suburbs. John Kenneth Galbraith begins the foreword to <em>The Affluent Society</em> with the phrase, &quot;Since I sailed for Switzerland in the early summer of 1955 to begin work on this book....&quot; But <em>between</em> slums and suburbs, between Scarsdale and Harlem, between Wellesley and Roxbury, between Shaker Heights and Hough, there are some eighty million people (depending on how you count them) who didn't sail for Switzerland in the summer of 1955, or at any other time, and who never expect to go. Between slums and suburbs: South Boston and South San Francisco, Bell and Parma, Astoria and Bay Ridge, Newark, Cicero, Downey, Daly City, Charlestown, Flatbush. Union halls, American Legion posts, neighborhood bars, and bowling leagues, the Ukranian Club and the Holy Name. Main Street. To try to describe all this is like trying to describe America itself. If you look for it, you find it everywhere: the rows of frame houses overlooking the belching steel mills in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; two-family brick houses in Canarsie (where the most common slogan, even in the middle of a political campaign, is &quot;curb your dog&quot;); the Fords and Chevies with a decal American flag on the rear window (usually a cut-out from the <em>Reader's Digest</em>, and displayed in counter-protest against peaceniks and &quot;those bastards who carry Vietcong flags in demonstration&quot;); the bunting on the porch rail with the inscription, &quot;Welcome home, Pete.&quot; The gold star in the window.</p>
<p>When he was Under Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Robert C. Wood tried a definition. It is not good, but it's the best we have:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>He is a white employed male...earning between $5,000 and $10,000. He works regularly, steadily, dependably, wearing a blue collar or white collar. Yet the frontiers of his career expectations have been fixed since he reached the age of thirty-five, when he found that he had too many obligations, too much family, and too few skills to match opportunities with aspirations.</p>
  <p>This definition of the &quot;working American&quot; involves almost 23 million American families.</p>
  <p>The working American lives in the gray area fringes of a central city or a close-in or very far-out cheaper suburban subdivision of a large metropolitan area. He is likely to own a home and a car, especially as his income begins to rise. Of those earning between $6,000 and $7,500, 70 percent own their own homes and 94 percent drive their own cars.</p>
  <p>94 percent have no education beyond high school and 43 percent have only completed the eighth grade. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He does all the right things, obeys the law, goes to church and insists - usually - that his kids get a better education than he had. But the right things don't seem to be paying off. While he is making more than he ever made - perhaps more than he'd ever dreamed - he's still struggling while a lot of others - "them" (on welfare, in demonstrations, in the ghettos) are getting most of the attention. "I'm working my ass off," a guy tells you on a stoop in South Boston. "My kids don't have a place to swim, my parks are full of glass, and I'm supposed to bleed for a bunch of people on relief." In New York a man who drives a Post Office trailer truck at night (4:00 P.M. to midnight) and a cab during the day (7:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M.), and who hustles radios for his Post Office buddies on the side, is ready, as he says, to &quot;knock somebody's ass.&quot; &quot;The colored guys work when they feel like it. Sometimes they show up and sometimes they don't. One guy tore up all the time cards. I'd like to see a white guy do that and get away with it.&quot;... </p>
<p>WHAT COUNTS</p>
<p>The reaction is directed at almost every visible target: at integration and welfare, taxes and sex education, at the rich and the poor, the foundations and students, at the &quot;smart people in the suburbs.&quot; In New York State the legislature cuts the welfare budget; in Los Angeles, the voters reelect Yorty after a whispered racial campaign against the Negro favorite. In Minneapolis a police detective named Charles Stenvig, promising &quot;to take the handcuffs off the police,&quot; wins by a margin stunning even to his supporters: in Massachusetts the voters mail tea bags to their representatives in protests against new taxes, and in state after state legislatures are passing bills to punish student demonstrators. (&quot;We keep talking about permissiveness in training kids,&quot; said a Los Angeles labor official, &quot;but we forget that these are our kids.&quot;) </p>
<p>And yet all  these things are side manifestations of a malaise that lacks a language. Whatever law and order means, for example, to a man who feels his wife is unsafe on the street after dark or in the park at any time, or whose kids get shaken down in the school yard, it also means something like normality - the demand that everybody play it by the book, that cultural and social standards be returned to their civics-book simplicity, that things shouldn't be as they are but as they were supposed to be. If there is a revolution in this country - a revolt in manners, in standards of dress and obscenity, and, more importantly, in our official sense of what America is - there is also a counter-revolt. Sometimes it is inarticulate, and sometimes (perhaps most of the time) people are either too confused or apathetic - or simply too polite and too decent - to declare themselves. . . .In Astoria, Queens, a white working-class district of New York, people who make $7,000 or $8,000 a year (sometimes in two jobs) call themselves affluent, even though the Bureau of Labor Statistics regards an income of less than $9,500 in New York inadequate to a moderate standard of living. And in a similar neighborhood in Brooklyn a truck driver who earns $151 a week tells you he's doing well, living in a two-story frame house separated by a narrow driveway from similar houses, thousands of them in block after block. This year, for the first time, he will go on a cruise--he and his wife and two other couples--two weeks in the Caribbean. He went to work after World War II ($57 a week) and he has lived in the same house for twenty years, accumulating two television sets, wall-to-wall carpeting in a small living room, and a basement that he recently remodeled into a recreation room with the help of two moonlighting firemen. &quot;We get fairly good salaries, and this is a good neighborhood, one of the few good ones left. We have no smoked Irishmen around.&quot;</p>
<p>Stability is what counts, stability in job and home and neighborhood, stability in the church and in friends. At night you watch television and sometimes on a weekend you go to a nice place--maybe a downtown hotel--for dinner with another couple. (Or maybe your sister, or maybe bowling, or maybe, if you're defeated, a night at the track.) The wife has the necessary appliances, often still being paid off, and the money you save goes for your daughter's orthodontist, and later for her wedding. The smoked Irishmen--the colored (no one says black; few even say Negro)--represent change and instability, kids who cause trouble in school, who get treatment that your kids never got, that you never got....The black kids mean a change in the rules, a double standard in grades and discipline, and--vaguely--a challenge to all you believed right. Law and order is the stability and predictability of established ways. Law and order is equal treatment--in school, in jobs, in the courts--even if you're cheating a little yourself. The Forgotten Man is Jackson's man. He is the vestigial American democrat of 1840: &quot;They all know that their success depends upon their own industry and economy and that they must not expect to become suddenly rich by the fruits of their toil.&quot; He is also Franklin Roosevelt's man--the man whose vote (or whose father's vote) sustained the New Deal....</p>
<p>AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL</p>
<p>American culture? Wealth is invisible, and so, now is poverty. Both have becoming intimidating cliches. But the rest? A vast, complex, and disregarded world that was once--in belief, and in fact--the American middle: Greyhound and Trailways bus terminals in little cities at midnight, each of them with its neon lights and its cardboard hamburgers; acres of tar-paper beach bungalows in places like Revere and Rockaway; the hair curlers in the supermarket on Saturday, and the little girls in the communion dresses the next morning; pinball machines and the <em>Daily News</em>, the <em>Reader's Digest</em> and Ed Sullivan; houses with tiny front lawns (or even large ones) adorned with statues of the Virgin or of Sambo welcomin' de folks home; Clint Eastwood or Julie Andrews at the Palace; the trotting tracks and the dog tracks--Aurora Downs, Connaught Park, Roosevelt, Yonkers, Rockingham, and forty others--where grey men come not for sport and beauty, but to read numbers, to study and dope. (If you win you have figured something, have in a small way controlled your world, have surmounted your impotence. If you lose, bad luck, shit. &quot;I'll break his goddamned head.&quot;) Baseball is not the national pastime; racing is. For every man who goes to a major-league baseball game there are four who go to the track and probably four more who go to the candy store or the barbershop to make their bets. (Total track attendance in 1965: 62 million plus another 10 million who went to the dogs.)</p>
<p>There are places, and styles, and attitudes. If there are neighborhoods of aspiration, suburban enclaves for the mobile young executive and the aspiring workers, there are also places of limited expectation and dead-end districts where mobility is finished. But even there you can often find, however vestigial, a sense of place, the roots of old ethnic loyalties, and a passionate, if often futile, battle against intrusion and change. "Everybody around here," you are told, "pays his own way." In this world the problems are not the ABM or air pollution . . . or the international population crisis; the problem is to get your street cleaned, your garbage collected, to get your husband home from Vietnam alive; to negotiate installment payments and keep the schools orderly. . . . Somewhere in his gut the man in these communities knows that mobility and choice in this society are limited. He cannot imagine any major change for the better; but he can imagine change for the worse. And yet for a decade he is the one who has been asked to carry the burden of social reform, to integrate his schools and his neighborhood, has been asked by comfortable people to pay the social debts due to the poor and the black. . . . </p>
<p>The ambiguities and changes in American life that occupy discussions in university seminars and policy debates in Washington, and that form the backbone of contemporary popular sociology, become increasingly the conditions of trauma and frustration in the middle. Although the New Frontier and Great Society contained some programs for those not already on the rolls of social pathology--federal aid for higher education, for example--the public priorities and the rhetoric contained little. The emphasis, properly, was on the poor, on the inner cities (e.g., Negroes) and the unemployed. But in Chicago a widow with three children who earns $7,000 a year can't get them college loans because she makes too much; the money is reserved for people on relief. New schools are built in the ghetto but not in the white working-class neighborhoods where they are just as dilapidated. In Newark the head of a white vigilante group (now a city councilman) runs, among other things, on a platform opposing pro-Negro discrimination. &quot;When pools are being built in the Central Ward--don't they think white kids have got frustration? The white can't get a job; we have to hire Negroes first.&quot; The middle class, said Congressman Pucinski of Illinois, who represents a lot of it, &quot;is in revolt. Everyone has been generous in supporting anti-poverty. Now the middle-class American is disqualified from most of the programs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;SOMEBODY HAS TO SAY NO...&quot;</p>
<p>The frustrated middle. The liberal wisdom about welfare, ghettos, student revolt, and Vietnam has only a marginal place, if any, for the values and the life of the working man. It flies in the face of most of what he was taught to cherish and respect: hard work, order, authority, self-reliance. He fought, either alone or through labor organizations, to establish the precincts he now considers his own. Union seniority, the civil-service bureaucracy, and the petty professionalism established by the merit system in the public schools become sinecures of particular ethnic groups or of those who have learned to negotiate and master the system. A man who worked all his life to accumulate the points and grades and paraphernalia to become an assistant school principal (no matter how silly the requirements) is not likely to relinquish his position with equanimity. Nor is a dock worker whose only estate is his longshoreman's card. The job, the points, the credits become property:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some men leave their sons money [wrote a union member to the <em>New York Times</em>], some large investments, some business connections, and some a profession. I have only one worthwhile thing to give: my trade. I hope to follow a centuries-old tradition and sponsor my sons for an apprenticeship. For this simple father's wish it is said that I discriminate against Negroes. Don't all of us discriminate? Which of us...will not choose a son over all others? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suddenly the rules are changing - all the rules. If you protect your job for your own you may be called a bigot. At the same time it's perfectly acceptable to shout black power and to endorse it. What does it take to be a good American? <em>Give the black man a position because he is black, not because he necessarily works harder or does the job better</em>. What does it take to be a good American? Dress nicely, hold a job, be clean-cut, don't judge a man by the color of his skin or the country of his origin. What about the demands of Negroes, the long hair of the students, the dirty movies, the people who burn draft cards and American flags. Do you have to go out in the street with picket signs, do you have to burn the place down to get what you want? What does it take to be a good American? <em>This is a sick society, a racist society, we are fighting an immoral war</em>. (&quot;I'm against the Vietnam war, too,&quot; says the truck driver in Brooklyn. &quot;I see a good kid come home with half an arm and a leg in a brace up to here, and what's it all for? I was glad to see <em>my kid</em> flunk the Army physical. Still, somebody has to say no to these demonstrators and enforce the law.&quot;) What does it take to be a good American? </p>
<p>The conditions of trauma and frustration in the middle. What does it take to be a good American? Suddenly there are demands for Italian power and Polish power and Ukrainian power. In Cleveland the Poles demand a seat on the school board, and get it, and in Pittsburg John Pankuch, the seventy-three-year-old president of the National Slovak Society, demands &quot;action, plenty of it to make up for lost time.&quot; Black power is supposed to be nothing but emulation of the ways in which other ethnic groups made it. But have they made it?...Some of the poorest people in America are white, native, and have lived all of their lives in the same place as their fathers and grandfathers. The problems that were presumably solved in some distant past, in that prehistoric era before the textbooks were written--problems of assimilation, of upward mobility--now turn out to be very much unsolved. The melting pot and all: millions made it, millions moved to the affluent suburbs; several million--no one knows why--did not. The median income in Irish South Boston is $5100 a year but the community-action workers have a hard time convincing the local citizens that any white man who is not stupid or irresponsible can be poor. Pride still keeps them from applying for income supplements or Medicaid, but it does not keep them from resenting those who do. In Pittsburgh, where the members of Polish-American organizations earn an estimated $5,000 to $6,000 (and some fall below the poverty line), the Poverty Programs are nonetheless directed primarily to Negroes, and almost everywhere the thing called urban backlash associates itself in some fashion with ethnic groups whose members have themselves only a precarious hold on the security of affluence. Almost everywhere in the old cities, tribal neighborhoods and their styles are under assault by masscult. The Italian grocery gives way to the supermarket, the ma-and-pa store and the walk-up are attacked by urban renewal. And almost everywhere, that assault tends to depersonalize and to alienate. It has always been this way, but with time the brave new world that replaces the old patterns becomes increasingly bureaucratized, distant, and hard to control. </p>
<p>Yet beyond the problems of ethnic identity, beyond the problems of Poles and Irishmen left behind, there are others more pervasive and more dangerous. For every Greek or Hungarian there are a dozen American Americans who are past ethnic consciousness and who are as alienated, as confused, and as angry as the rest. The obvious manifestations are the same everywhere--race, taxes, welfare, students--but the threat seems invariably more cultural and psychological than economic or social. What upset the police at the Chicago convention most was not so much the politics of the demonstrators as their manners and their hair....The affront comes from middle-class people--and their children--who had been cast in the role of social exemplars (and from those cast as unfortunates worthy of public charity) who offend all the things on which working class identity is built: &quot;hippies [said a San Francisco longshoreman] who fart around the streets and don't work&quot;; welfare recipients who strike and march for better treatment; &quot;all those [said a California labor official] who challenge the precepts that these people live on.&quot; If ethnic groups are beginning to organize to get theirs, so are others: police and firemen (&quot;The cop is the new nigger&quot;); schoolteachers; lower-middle-class housewives fighting sex education and bussing; small property owners who have no ethnic communion but a passionate interest in lower taxes, more policemen, and stiffer penalties for criminals. In San Francisco the Teamsters, who had never been known for such interests before, recently demonstrates in support of the police and law enforcement and, on another occasion, joined a group called Mothers Support Neighborhood Schools at a school-board meeting to oppose--with their presence and later, apparently, with their fists--a proposal to integrate the schools through bussing. (&quot;These people,&quot; someone said at the meeting, &quot;do not look like mothers.&quot;)... </p>
<p>CAN THE COMMON MAN COME BACK?</p>
<p>Beneath it all there is a more fundamental ambivalence, not only about the young, but about institutions--the schools, the churches, the Establishment--and about the future itself. In the major cities of the East (though perhaps not in the West) there is a sense that time is against you, that one is living &quot;in one of the few decent neighborhoods left,&quot; that &quot;if I can get $125 a week upstate (or downstate) I'll move.&quot; The institutions that were supposed to mediate social change and which, more than ever, are becoming priesthoods of information and conglomerates of social engineers, are increasingly suspect....</p>
<p>Perhaps, in some measure, it has always been this way. Perhaps none of this is new. And perhaps it is also true that the American lower middle has never had it so good. And yet surely there is a difference, and that is that the common man has lost his visibility and, somehow, his claim on public attention....</p>
<p>There are recent indications that the white lower middle class is coming back on the roster of public priorities. Pucinski tells you that liberals in Congress are privately discussing the pressure from the middle class. There are proposals now to increase personal income-tax exemptions from $600 to $1,000 (or $1,200) for each dependent, to protect all expenses, and to put a floor under all incomes. Yet these things by themselves are insufficient. Nothing is sufficient without a national sense of restoration. What Pucinski means by the middle class has, in some measure, has always been represented. A physician earning $75,000 a year is also a working man but he is hardly a victim of the welfare system. Nor, by and large, are the stockholders of the Standard Oil Company or U.S. Steel. The fact that American ideals have often been corrupted in the cause of self-aggrandizement does not make them any less important for the cause of social reform and justice....</p>
<p>The issue, finally, is not <em>the program</em> but the vision, the angle of view. A huge constituency may be coming up for grabs, and there is considerable evidence that its political mobility is more sensitive than anyone can imagine, that all the sociological determinants are not as significant as the simple facts of concern and leadership. When Robert Kennedy was killed last year, thousands of working-class people who had expected to vote for him--if not hundreds of thousands--shifted their loyalties to Wallace. A man who can change from a progressive democrat into a bigot overnight deserves attention. </p>

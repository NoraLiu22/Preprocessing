<H2>Stellar Structure in Outline:</H2>

<P><OL>
<LI>The Pressure-Temperature Thermostat
<UL><LI>Pressure from energy generation in the core balances the
        gravitational weight of the layers of the star above it.
    <LI>When the core is undergoing thermonuclear fusion,
	the pressure from the energy generation balances gravity.
    <LI>Because the rate of nuclear reactions depends very sensitively
	on the temperature, a slight increase in temperature will 
	cause and increase in the energy generation rate, thus increasing
	the pressure of the core, thus expanding the core against gravity,
	thus reducing the temperature (with the decrease in density), thus
	reducing the energy produced, and the pressure, and radius, and
	the system comes back to equilibrium.
    <LI>This is an example of <i>negative feedback</i> in an astrophysical
	system.  A postive change in one of the parameters causes changes
	in the system that feed back into a negative change in the original
	parameter, bringing the system back into an equilibrium.  This
	is like a "cruise control" for the nuclear reactions in the star.
    <LI>If the core is not generating thermonuclear energy, like in the
	original collapse of a protostar, then the gravitational energy of
	contraction generates heat, and thus pressure against gravity.  There
	is still a negative feedback against temperature increases, though
	the core will slowly contract to generate the heat to maintain the
	pressure against the weight of the star.
    <LI>Pressure-temperature regulation is only part of the story of
	stellar structure.  We now consider the other factors that
	go into a stellar model.
    </UL>
<LI>Stellar Structure
<UL><LI>There are 4 global physical quantities of a star: L=luminosity,
	T=temperature, M=mass, and R=radius.
    <LI>A star can be modeled as a spherically symmetric gas that is
	in equilibrium, that is it doesn't change with time (at least
	on timescales short compared to the energy generation timescale).
    <LI>We can build a star by calculating the physical properties as
	a function of radius r within the star.
    <LI>There are 2 quantities that depend upon the shells below directly: 
	L(r) the luminosity at any
	shell generated by the shells below it, and M(r) the mass within
	the radius r.
    <LI>The temperature T(r) is a <b>local</b> quantity, the temperature
	of the gas in the shell at radius r.
    <LI>To help us calculate, we also use 3 other local quantities:
	the gas mass density rho(r) in kg/m^3 at radius r, the gas
	pressure p(r), and the energy (luminosity) generation rate E(r).
    <LI>We calculate the star model by adding shells consecutively
	from the center of the star (r=0) to the surface of the
	star (r=R).  At the surface M(R),T(R),L(R) are just the physical
	quantities we can observer for the star.
    <LI>We use four laws to tell us how to make a change
	in the quantities when we add a shell:
        <OL>
        <LI>Mass - add the mass in the shell to the total
	<LI>Luminosity - add the luminosity generated in the shell to the
		total
	<LI>Pressure - adjust the pressure to balance the weight of the new
	    shell (reduce the pressure, since the shell contributes to the
	    pressure of lower layers only)
	<LI>Temperature - heat is transported from the hot innner layers
	    to cooler outer layers by convection, radiation or conduction.
	</OL>
    <LI>This prescription is carried out through four equations that
	give the changes in each quantity with radius.
    <LI>This purely mathematical model describes the structure of the star.
	Furthermore, you can take into account the changes with the star's
	energy production with time, and thus calculate the evolution of
	the star's structure.

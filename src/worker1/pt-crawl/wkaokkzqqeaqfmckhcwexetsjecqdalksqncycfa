<H2>The End of the Affair (1999)</H2>

<P>D: Neil Jordan<BR>
S: Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea</P>

<P>Powerful, thought-provoking adaptation of Graham Greene's intensely personal
novel from writer/director Neil Jordan. Beautifully judged performances
from the three leads, subtle, intelligent scripting (which makes excellent
use of the novel but is not constrained by the demands of verbal narrative),
unobtrusive but stylish direction, and an overall coherence and sense of
purpose erases the stain of <I><A HREF="ind.htm">In Dreams</A></I> and makes
this among the best films of the director's career. The story concerns an
adulterous affair between a deliberately amoral writer (Ralph Fiennes) and
the wife (Julianne Moore) of a civil servant neighbour whose obedience to
routine and sense of habit has blinded him to her needs (Stephen Rea). As
the Second World War rages around them, the lovers reach a crisis which
has more to do with fate and circumstance than human emotion. This provokes
a powerful confrontation with notions of religious faith which exceed mere
morality, and plunges the central character into writing &quot;a diary of
hate&quot; which rationalises his conflicts with God.</P>

<P>The film opens in 1946, some years after the story of the affair begins
(and ends). Jordan uses a flash-back/flash-forward structure to allow a
sense of the different perspectives of the two principal characters to emerge.
Anchored around a crucial moment which signals 'the end of the affair' (the
explosion of a bomb near the lovers' bedroom), the film spins off on two
narrative bearings which eventually merge to provide it with a difficult
and emotionally wrenching final movement where Fiennes begins to realise
just how powerful the forces ranked against him really are and just how
impotent he is in the face of them. The film is summed up by the final lines
written by the nominally atheistic character to the God that he realises
he hates, beginning &quot;You used my hatred to gain my acknowledgement.&quot;
This encapsulates many of the complex, paradoxical ideas Greene and Jordan
explore. It is as much concerned with the presence and effects of religion
in people's lives as any conventional notions of impropriety or morality,
and the film brilliantly uses the bitter ironies of Greene's dialogue to
expose and undercut the hypocrisies of the stiff-upper lip characters and
the forms in which they are usually represented. It is as much an assault
upon the world of restrained romance as it is a story of characters at odds
with society (and with God), and despite the trappings of romantic drama,
it is a bitter, hard-edged (almost savage) testament to the English (and
human) capacity for self-delusion (the explicitness of the sex scenes should
also provide a jolt to the box-of-hankies-and-warm-mug-of-tea brigade).</P>

<P>In contrast to the Oscar-laden romantic epic<A HREF="eng.htm"><I>The
English Patient</I> </A>(which also starred Fiennes and had a similar adulterous
triangle at its centre), this film interweaves its text and sub-texts with
delicate ease. Viewers are drawn both into the mechanics of the affair (which
Jordan conceives of in terms of fragmentary moments and memories evoked
in context rather than a simple &quot;once upon a time&quot; reminiscences),
and find the darker themes gradually beginning to emerge. On the surface,
the dialogue seems as stilted and clich&eacute;d as the most hackneyed Mills
&amp; Boon, but, with well-judged cutting and intricate performances which
match Greene's prose, Jordan and his cast constantly remind audiences of
the density and depth of feeling and the hidden meanings which words sometimes
mask (or betray). The narrative key to understanding this approach is in
the <I>Mr. Arkadin</I>-like plot device which has Fiennes hire a private
detective (James Bolam, who sends Ian Hart on the case) to investigate himself,
following the potential renewal of affections between himself and Moore
after the opening encounter between Fiennes and Rea where Rea explains he
suspects Moore of having an affair (don't worry, it all makes sense on screen).
The story also takes many unexpected directions, pre-empting expectation
by having characters face their feelings more quickly than narrative convention
usually allows, and then forcing them to deal with the results. Jordan flourishes
with this kind of pace, and for once he has found a way to match form to
content and given the story just enough time to develop before presenting
the next piece of the thematic puzzle.</P>

<P><I>The End of the Affair</I> is a beautifully crafted film, photographed
with almost expressionistic intensity by Roger Pratt (the rain-soaked streets
of post-war London seem like something out of a Ridley or Tony Scott film
at times), edited with respect for the actors' interpretation of dialogue
by Tony Lawson, nicely decked-out by production designer Anthony Pratt and
costume designer Sandy Powell, and scored by Michael Nyman. Jordan clearly
emerges as a controlling presence however, as the film wends an inevitable
path to thematic resolution with a clarity, coherence, and directness so
sorely absent in <I><A HREF="ind.htm">In Dreams</A></I>. Fiennes, Moore,
and Rea are all excellent, backed by a lovely turn from Ian Hart as the
unassuming gumshoe assigned to follow their exploits. Fiennes captures the
anger and arrogance of his character very well. He makes a suitably complex
leading man, evoking contradictory emotions and levels of empathy from the
audience as the plot unfolds. The viewer makes the journey with him, and
though a great deal of the narrative turns on Moore, it is Fiennes' central
struggle with the power of God which fuels the all-consuming vitriol. Moore,
for her part, is much more than the usual fickle leading lady such films
often offer. Though she becomes something of a cypher for the damage inflicted
on the human spirit by a crisis of faith, she registers a sympathetic portrait
of desperation, fear, and inner conflict. Rea struggles with his English
accent, but his face betrays the pain of masculine torment, a passive, internalised
reaction to the kind of ferocious amorality demonstrated by Fiennes' character.</P>

<P>This is Jordan's most successful exploration of the theme of religion
which has been a feature of so many of his films in one form or another.
Using the lynchpin of Greene's own tortured relationship with his faith,
Jordan has found an effective platform from which to examine the true meaning
of belief beyond considerations of dogma. Though a priest played by Jason
Isaacs features prominently in the story, the film is less an indictment
of the particulars of Catholicism (a feature of so many end of millennium
films including <I>Dogma</I>, <I>The End of Days</I>, and <I>Stigmata</I>)
than the kind of socio-psychological superstructure established by a strong
ordering system which is accepted or endorsed by a person in the face of
either their own feelings or their sense of rationality. Though the outburst
of irrationality is here nominally centred on the female character, it is
how the narrator eventually arrives at his own conclusions which provides
the film with its heartwrenching resolution (where the character, having
acknowledged the existence of God, demands to be left alone). In this religion
is dealt with both as a theme in and of itself and used, like any of Jordan's
ordering systems, to demonstrate the sense of entrapment which frustrates
his characters' ability to negotiate their own moral, social, physical,
and psychological space.</P>

<P>Though a difficult and demanding film, <I>The End of the Affair</I> is
a very rewarding variant on familiar material. It is certainly a far better
film than <I><A HREF="eng.htm">The English Patient</A></I>, though perhaps
its intellectual complexity might made it too rarefied for casual viewers.
It is certainly well worth seeing, and after the disappointments of <A HREF="agb.htm"><I>Agnes Browne</I> </A>and <A HREF="odc.htm"><I>Ordinary
Decent Criminal</I>,</A> should come as a relief to Irish audiences. Highly
recommended.</P>

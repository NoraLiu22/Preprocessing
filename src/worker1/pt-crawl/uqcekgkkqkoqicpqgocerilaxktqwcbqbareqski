<p>Born in 1819, Victoria was an only child of Edward, the Duke of Kent. In 1837, she
ascended to the throne and became Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. She was only 18 at
this time, and the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, served as her educator in political
decision-making. However, Victoria soon displayed her iron will, which allowed her to
effectively rule by her own power. It was in June of 1840 that the Queen married Prince
Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. They happily raised nine children, who were to become
important figures in the major monarchial states of the 20th Century. Still, the
Queen's
loss of the Prince Consort in December of 1861 drove her into prolonged mourning and
depression. Her policy-making seemed to change substantially from the time prior to
Albert's death. However, this prolonged mourning kept her occupied for the rest
of her life and played an important role in the evolution of what would become
the Victorian mentality. Eventually Victoria became one of Great Britain's most popular and prominent monarchs. She was named Empress of India in 1876,
which was an event that showed the interest of the Queen and Great Britain in world
colonization, throughout the 19th Century. Victoria's long reign witnessed an
evolution in English politics and the expansion of the British Empire, as well
as political and social reform on the continent.&nbsp; Queen Victoria died of natural causes in
January of 1901.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="CENTER"><b>Annotated Bibliography</b></h2>

<p><b>Adams, Charles Francis. <i>Studies Military and Diplomatic: 1775-1865.</i> New York:
MacMillan, 1911.<br>
</b>This book contains a lengthy chapter dealing with Queen Victoria's actions towards the
American Civil War. The author notes that the Queen was terribly sullen and uninterested
in the concerns of foreign affairs, since her husband died in December 1861, and the key
years of the American Civil War occurred during this time of her mourning. Basically, the
author mentions that the Queen was kept from most discussions concerning this matter,
since her sanity was unstable at the time. Therefore, accounts are given of the ways that
the Queen's officers handled Great Britain's policy towards the United States during this
time.</p>

<p><b>Bailey, John. <i>Some Political Ideas and Persons.</i> New York: E.P. Dutton,
1922</b>.<br>
This book contains a rather lengthy chapter dealing with the life and times of Queen
Victoria. Although the author notes that the Queen was not personally responsible for the
societal changes occurring during her rein, he does imply that Victoria made a significant
impact upon everyday life throughout the Victorian Era. Furthermore, the author uses her
two most prominent roles as, as Queen and as a woman, in order to show how each played
upon the other to create one of the greatest monarchs in Britain.</p>

<p><b>Benson, Arthur Christopher and Viscount Esher eds. <i>The Letters of Queen Victoria: A
Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861 (Vols.
I-III)</i><u>.</u>
New York: Longman's, Green, and Company, 1907.</b><br>
These three volumes are of great interest to anyone who seeks a serious study of Queen
Victoria's domestic, political, foreign relations, and personal policies. The three
volumes, which consist of nearly 2000 pages, only cover Victoria's Reign from 1837 through
1861. It seems that the editors chose to research this time period because they wanted to
concentrate on Victoria's policies made before the death of her husband in December 1861.
However, much scholarly excellence has gone into the compilation of these three volumes,
which are filled with a surplus of primary source material.</p>

<p><b>Benson, E.F. <i>Queen Victoria's Daughters.</i> New York: D. Appleton-Century, 1938.<br>
</b>The author of this book gives a brief account of Victoria's ascendance to the throne,
and the pressures placed upon her from various relatives who wanted to chose her marriage
partner. Also, this book provides excellent commentary on the Queen's relationship with
her daughters. Her influence in their choice of marriage partners is an important part of
the book. Also, the author uses primary and secondary sources dealing with Queen
Victoria's daughters and their children.</p>

<p><b>Bolitho, Hector ed. <i>Letters of Queen Victoria: From the Archives of the House of
Brandenburg-Prussia.</i> New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1938</b>.<br>
Queen Victoria's personal letters to family and friends are compiled in this book. The
letters included range between the years of 1841 through 1889. Anyone who seriously seeks
knowledge about the Queen's relations with her family could learn a great deal from
reading this book. The author uses actual excerpts from the Queen's letters, and
highlights their importance by also providing brief summaries of these letters.</p>

<p><b>Cecil, Algernon. <i>Queen Victoria and Her Prime Ministers.</i> New York: Oxford
University Press, 1953.<br>
</b>This book offers an exhaustive account of the dealings between Queen Victoria and her
ten Prime Ministers. It is the author's intention to show the affects that these Prime
Ministers had on the Queen. Also, the book shows the ways in which the decisions made by
the Queen and her Prime Ministers affected the intellectual, political, and social
institutions throughout her reign. Overall, this book gives an excellent account of minute
details that are important in understanding the Queen's relationship and policy-making
with her Prime Ministers.</p>

<p><b>Cecil, David. <i>Melbourne.</i> New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1954.</b><br>
The author of this book cites the ways in which Lord Melbourne worked with Queen
Victoria early in her ascendance to the throne. The book notes Victoria's strength of
character, even though she was only 18 years old when she became Queen. However, the main
point of the author is to show that Lord Melbourne sought to become one of
Victoria's
closest friends, so that better relations between the monarchy and government could occur
under Victoria. Therefore, this book gives an excellent account of Victoria's education in
political matters, which she received from Lord Melbourne.</p>

<p><b>Charlot, Monica. <i>Victoria: The Young Queen.</i> Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1991.<br>
</b>The author presents an excellent scholarly work accurately depicting the life and times of Queen Victoria.
This book
goes into detail on each important segment and issue that arises during Queen
Victoria's
life. Charlot uses an abundance of accurate and varied sources to present and support
her material.</p>

<p><b>Chesterton, G.K. <i>Varied Types.</i> New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company, 1909.</b><br>
The account of Queen Victoria in this book seems to praise every aspect of the
Queen's
life. However, it also realistically cites many of her positive attributes, such as her
political unselfishness, invention of the democratic monarchy, and an ability to be seen
as an authority figure, who was above the social limitations of the government and the
monarchy. This book serves as a good source because it lists personal accounts of a person
who was greatly troubled by the Queen's death.</p>

<p><b>Connell, Brian. <i>Regina vs. Palmerston: The Correspondence Between Queen Victoria and
Her Foreign and Prime Minister 1837-1865</i>. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1961.<br>
</b>The author of this book uses excerpts from the Palmerston Archives, and gives an
personal account of events that transpired between Lord Palmerston and Queen Victoria.
This book focuses on the years that Palmerston served as Great Britain's Foreign and Prime
Minister during Victoria's Reign. Also, the book goes in depth in order to cover
Victoria's plans for action in the Crimean War, Indian Mutiny, and the United
States'
Civil War. A major topic discussed in the book is the difference of opinions and beliefs
expressed by Palmerston and Victoria.</p>

<p><b>Cullen, Tom. <i>The Empress Brown: The True Story of a Victorian Scandal.</i> Boston:
Houghton Mifflin, 1969.<br>
</b>This book gives an in-depth account of Queen Victoria and John Brown's relations. While
the topic of Brown and the Queen has intrigued many with scandals, the author strives to
give an accurate and impartial account of the relationship between these two. This book
covers the life of Queen Victoria from her ascent to the throne in 1837, until John
Brown's death in March of 1883. Furthermore, the author makes professional use of
excellent primary sources such as Sir Henry Ponsonby's letters about the Queen, which were
addressed to his wife, and the papers of Victoria's Prime Minister Derby.</p>

<p><b>Duff, David. <u>Victoria and Albert.</u> New York: Taplinger Publishing,
1972</b>.<br>
This book tells the story of Queen Victoria's early life with Prince Albert. The
underlying theme shows that Victoria was totally devoted to her husband. Topics that are
covered in great detail include; the courtship of Albert and Victoria, their wedding on
February 10, 1840, the birth of their first daughter, and the Queen's reaction to the
Prince Consort's untimely death. Also, this book makes good use of primary sources. An
example of this primary material is shown in the picture section of the book, between
pages 64 and 65. In this section, the author provides a copy of an article from the <u>London
Gazette</u> from November 23, 1839. This article offers an account of Victoria's
announcement of her wedding plans.</p>

<p><b>Erickson, Carolly. <i>Her Little Majesty: The Life of Queen Victoria.</i> New York:
Simon and Schuster, 1997.<br>
</b>This book certainly takes a scholarly approach in giving a narrative of the complete
life of Queen Victoria. The author seems to make the character of Queen Victoria come to
life, while maintaining an historically account of her life. The numerous, relevant, and
well-varied use of sources helps to substantiate the author's excellence in compiling this
book.</p>

<p><b>Farwell, Byron. <i>Queen Victoria's Little Wars.</i> New York: Harper and Row,
197</b>2.<br>
This book gives a detailed account of the battles and wars conducted by Great Britain,
during Queen Victoria's Reign from 1837 to 1901. Victoria's stance on each encounter is
broadly described by the author. Also, the author tries to show the humanity portrayed by
Victoria, in regard to her soldiers. Still, the author tends to focus a bit more on the
details of each battle than the details of the Queen's intricate policies. However, it is
still an excellent account of Queen Victoria and her role in war decisions.</p>

<p><b>Fulford, Roger ed. <i>Dearest Child: Letters Between Queen Victoria and the Princess
Royal. (1858-1861).</i> New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1964</b>.<br>
Dearest Child is a book written to display the personal correspondence between Queen
Victoria and the Princess Royal. It is the author's intent to only cover the years of 1858
through 1861, at which point the book ends with Prince Albert's death. The author chose to
avoid the much publicized events that may have been spoken about in these letters, so that
the reader might focus on Victoria's accounts of her everyday life. Lastly, the author
makes good use of primary source material through the incorporation of Queen
Victoria's
letters to the Empress Frederick and the Empress' replies.</p>

<p><b>Fulford, Roger ed. <i>Dearest Mama: Letters Between Queen Victoria and the Crown
Princess of Prussia (1861-1864).</i> New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1968.<br>
</b>First of all, this book gives an accurate and insightful account of Queen
Victoria's
influence on her descendants, who would later become the leading monarchs of foreign
nations such as Germany, Russia, and many others. These letters reveal much personal
information about the Queen and her interaction and correspondence with close family
members. Also, the letters reveal the masked difference in the Queen's behavior after the
loss of her husband in December of 1861. One of the most notable topics that her letters
reveal is the Queen's manipulative influence upon her children, especially in their
choices of marriage partners.</p>

<p><b>Hough, Richard ed. <i>Advice to my Grand-daughter: Letters from Queen Victoria of
Hesse.</i> New York: Simon and Schuster, 1975.</b><br>
The numerous letters contained in this book tend to highlight detailed information
passed between the Queen and her granddaughter throughout their correspondence during 1870
and 1900. The Queen discusses plans for the marriage of the Princess. These plans show the
Queen's deep emotional ties with her granddaughter, Princess Victoria.</p>

<p><b>Longford, Elizabeth. <i>Queen Victoria: Born to Succeed.</i> New York: Harper and Row,
1964.</b><br>
This book is an excellent reworking of the material displayed by Lytton Stachey, who
wrote a biography of Queen Victoria in 1921. Also, this book goes into detail on the
Queen's life as wife to Prince Albert, mother of nine children, and ruler of a powerful
Great Britain. Furthermore, the author's use of the Royal Archives has greatly aided her
in compiling accurate and relevant information for this book.</p>

<p><b>McCarthy, Justin. <i>A History of Our Own Times: From the Accession of Queen Victoria
to the General Election of 1880 (Vols. I-III)</i>. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1897-1905.<br>
</b>The 1600+ pages that complete this work by Justin McCarthy basically cover Queen
Victoria's life from her accession to the throne in 1837 through the General Election of
1880. Although this seems to intricately cover the life of the Queen in this period, the
author does not list any sources for the information that he dispenses throughout the
three volumes. However, one interesting chapter in Volume II deals with the
Queen's
attitude toward the confederacy during the US Civil War of 1861-1865.<p/></p>

<p><b>Meacham, Jon and Daniel Pedersen. &quot;Was Queen Victoria a Bastard?&quot;
<i>Newsweek</i>
24 July 1995, 56.<br>
</b>This article gives a commentary about the book entitled Queen Victoria's Gene, which
was published in 1995. This book proposes the argument that Queen Victoria was an
illegitimate child. They mention problems that could arise in the current
monarchs' claim
to the crown if the theory about Victoria's illegitimacy were true. However, the authors
are only summing-up what the writers of the book have claimed. Therefore, one should read
the book that they mention, in order to get a better understanding of this journal
article.</p>

<p><b>Mitchell, Donald G. <i>English Lands, Letters, and Kings: The Later Georges to
Victoria.</i> New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1907.</b><br>
This book contains a brief chapter commenting on the life of Queen Victoria. It can be
considered a primary source, since the author writes about one of the Queen's addresses to
Parliament in 1897. Although this is only a brief part of Mitchell's book, the author
describes the main relationships of the Queen with her family and Lord Melbourne.</p>

<p><b>Packard, Jerrold M. <i>Farewell in Splendor: The Passing of Queen Victoria and Her Age.</i>
New York: Dutton, 1995.</b><br>
This sizable story of Queen Victoria focuses solely on the last week of her life, and
the week following her death. Much information and great details concerning the
Queen's
last actions in her final week of a glorious 63-year reign are displayed in this book. The
author includes an excellent genealogy of Queen Victoria's descendants. Interestingly,
this account of Queen Victoria includes excellent details on the funeral ceremonies of the
Queen, which are generally overlooked in other books dealing with Queen Victoria.</p>

<p><b>Ponsonby, Frederick. <i>Recollections of Three Reigns</i>. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1952.<br>
</b>There are seven chapters in this book that deal with Sir Frederick Ponsonby's personal
accounts of Queen Victoria. Serving as the Queen's Private Secretary, Ponsonby gives an
accurate appraisal of the Queen's Reign throughout the last decade of her life. His
accounts include the Queen's role in the Diamond Jubilee, her interaction with Minister
Kitchener, and her involvement with the South African War. Many less important accounts
also help to inform the reader about Victoria's normal, everyday life.</p>

<p><b>Ponsonby, Frederick. <i>Side Lights on Queen Victoria.</i> New York: Sears, 1930.<br>
</b>This book uses many different letters compiled by the author's father, and stored in
the archives at Windsor, that deal with Queen Victoria's personal memories, and memories
of her from her family and friends. Therefore, the book is rich in primary source
material. Furthermore, this material is compiled to show the Queen's role and stance on
important policies and events, such as the Shah of Persia's visit to England in 1873, the
Irish University Bill of 1873, the Franchise Bill of 1874, etc...</p>

<p><b>Sitwell, Edith. <i>Victoria of England.</i> London: Faber and Faber, 1947.</b><br>
The author chose to include an in-depth portrayal of the entire life of Queen Victoria.
Each segment of her life is greatly displayed in the chapters used in the compilation of
the text. However, the author chose to exclude the Queen's position towards all political
policies and attitudes that arose throughout her reign. Therefore, the domestic role of
Queen Victoria is the main focus of this book.</p>

<p><b>Strachey, Lytton. <i>Queen Victoria.</i> New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1921.</b><br>
Although this book contains certain dated material, it offers an accurate account of
the entire life of Queen Victoria. It is important to note that the author incorporated
many passages from the Greville Memoirs, held in the British Museum, which contain
excellent sources of primary information dealing with the Queen. The chapter dealing with
the Crimean War is interesting because it notes the Queen's personal accounts and
involvement with this war.</p>

<p><b>Thompson, Dorothy. <i>Queen Victoria: The Woman, the Monarchy, and the People.</i> New
York: Pantheon Books, 1990.<br>
</b>The author of this book seeks to offer a life story of Queen Victoria, based upon her
actions as a legitimate woman leader of a major country during a time of excess female
suppression and restriction from politics and power. Also, the author cites that the
Queen's authority and willingness to maintain her role as wife and mother, both acted,
although in much different ways, to strengthen the movement for women's rights.
Furthermore, the book shows Victoria acting as a stabilizing factor of the British
Monarchy. Finally, it is worthy to mention that the author based nearly all of her
research on the research findings of others. Consequently, her material is mostly
accurate, even though it was not directly compiled from the use of primary sources.</p>

<p><b>Tucker, Nicholas. &quot;Swiss Cottage, Osborne House, Isle of Wight.&quot;
<i>History
Today</i> 19 September 1990, 62-63.</b><br>
This brief journal article offers a commentary on the recreational activities that
Queen Victoria pursued with her family at the Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight. The
author uses parts of the Queen's personal letters to describe the Queen's feelings toward
vacationing at this place. Also, the passage tells how Queen Victoria interacted with her
husband and children at the Osborne House.</p>

<p><b>Weintraub, Stanley. <i>Victoria: An Intimate Biography.</i> New York: Truman Talley
Books/E.P. Dutton, 1987.</b><br>
Weintraub's 600+ page account of Queen Victoria's life is truly an exemplary model and
work of scholarly excellence. Throughout the book, the author seeks to add new and
truthful incite and accounts of the life of the Queen. Weintraub carefully selects
relevant details and discards old ones that tend to be the product of previous
authors'
misconceptions or misconstrued facts about the Queen. The author also uses new medical
knowledge and the Queen's own album consolatium, as just two examples of the new insights
which he incorporates into the biography of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p><b>Woodham-Smith, Cecil. <i>Queen Victoria: From Her Birth to the Death of the Prince
Consort.</i> New York: Alfred A Knopf, 1972.</b><br>
This book was compiled with the use of excellent primary resources. Private family
papers were obtained from the Royal Family Archives at Windsor. Furthermore, the author
gives an excellent account of the early life of Queen Victoria to the death of the Prince
Consort. Sections of her life that are greatly detailed include her coronation and
reaction to her husband's death in December of 1861.</p>

            <div id="origins">
                <h2>Origins and history</h2>
                <p>The <i>Stoa Consortium for Electronic Publication in the Humanities</i> was created in 1997 by
                    <a href="https://blog.stoa.org/archives/786">Ross Scaife</a>, Professor of Classics at the University of Kentucky. Scaife
                    edited the Stoa until his death in 2008. He created the Stoa to serve several purposes:
                    dissemination of news and announcements, mainly via <a href="https://blog.stoa.org">the gateway
                    blog</a>; discussion of best practices via discussion groups and white papers; and publication of
                    experimental on-line projects, many of them subject to scholarly peer review. <a
                    href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm">Open Access</a> to networked scholarship was
                    a bedrock principle for the Stoa and the projects it hosted.
                </p>
                <p>Projects at the Stoa were often linked closely to materials and tools available from <a
                href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">the Perseus Digital Library</a> based at Tufts University, and some
                of them were created in XML and SGML and published using a copy of <a
                href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/perseus-hopper/files/perseus-hopper/">the Perseus "Hopper"
                software package</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Funding for operations at the Stoa came from a variety of sources over the years, including an
                initial FIPSE grant from the U.S. Department of Education, shares of NEH and NSF grants, funds from the
                Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, DC, and local support at the University of Kentucky from the
                Center for Computational Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences. To all these benefactors, and to
                the many friends who have lent their expertise on an ad hoc basis, we are most grateful.</p>

                <h2>Preserving the legacy: 2008-</h2>
                <p>Following Scaife's death in 2008, <a href="https://linguistics.as.uky.edu/users/mrlaue2">Mark
                Lauersdorf</a> and <a href="https://www.as.uky.edu/users/jsmilb0">Jonathan Milby</a> at the University
                of Kentucky's <a href="http://www.rch.uky.edu/">Collaboratory for Research in Computing for
                Humanities</a> maintained the Stoa server for over a decade in order to ensure the continued
                availability to scholars and students of its content, as well as a home for projects still in progress.
                In 2019, when this arrangement became untenable, a group of friends of the Stoa (both extramural and at
                UKY) banded together to ensure the long-term availability of its content. The following changes were put
                in place at that time.</p>
                <div id="blog">
                    <h3>A new home for the Stoa blog</h3>
                    <p>Well prior to 2008, Scaife had expanded the mission of the Stoa blog to include service as the
                    official blog of the <a href="http://www.digitalclassicist.org/">Digital Classicist</a>, a site
                    based originally at Kingâ€™s College London and edited principally by <a
                    href="https://research.sas.ac.uk/institute-icls/staff/880/dr-gabriel-bodard/">Gabriel Bodard</a>.
                    Since 2008, the blog continued to be active, jointly maintained by a consortium of scholars in
                    Classics and Digital Humanities. In the summer of 2019, Bodard arranged for its rehosting on a
                    server operated by the <a href="https://icls.sas.ac.uk/">Institute of Classical Studies</a> at the
                    University of London. A new URI (<a href="https://blog.stoa.org">https://blog.stoa.org</a>) was
                    created for this purpose, and HTTP redirects were put in place to bring users to the rehosted copies
                    of individual posts.</p>

                <div id="archiving">
                    <h3>Archiving and rehosting</h3>
                    <p>At Duke University's <a href="https://library.duke.edu/dukeforward/technology/dc3">Digital
                    Classics Collaboratory (DC3)</a>, <a href="https://ryanfb.github.io/">Ryan Baumann</a> undertook to
                    ensure that at least one snapshot of every page on the Stoa had been submitted to the Internet
                    Archive's Wayback Machine for long-term preservation. This archival copy may be browsed starting at
                    <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.stoa.org/">https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.stoa.org/</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to keep as many Stoa URIs from going stale as possible, <a
                    href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/staff/tom-elliott/">Tom Elliott</a> (Institute for the Study of the
                    Ancient World, NYU), undertook to establish a new, primary server for the domain and to work with
                    original project authors and others to rehost static versions of the Stoa content. This is an
                    on-going effort, and the status of individual projects is provided on <a href="/">the new home
                    page</a>.</p>

<H2>Drinking Crude (1996)</H2>

<P>D: Owen McPolin<BR>
S: Andrew Scott, James Quarton, Eva Birthistle</P>

<P>A teenager frustrated with life in boring, conservative Ireland (Andrew
Scott) decides to emigrate to London and seek his fortune. He bumps into
a shifty but helpful Scotsman (James Quarton) who agrees to help the lad
out. He then finds himself cleaning out oil tankers and learns what the
world really has to offer him. But to his horror, his travels on the job
take him back to Ireland, and on arriving in his home town he must reassess
his goals and options.</P>

<P>Potentially boring material emerges as a wonderful semi-comic parable
thanks to a tight and funny script and swift, unpretentious direction. Using
the road movie structure of <A HREF="iwd.htm"><I>I Went Down</I> </A>and
familiar Irish motifs of emigration and teenage frustration (<I>Clash of
the Ash</I>, <I><A HREF="gits.htm">Gold in the Streets</A></I>, <I><A HREF="sal.htm">Snakes and Ladders</A>)</I>, McPolin delivers a hugely disarming
poke in the eye for the navel gazing coming-of-age yarn even though its
rhythms and resolutions remain much the same as those which preceded it.</P>

<P>Scott (also seen in Cathal Black's <I>Korea</I>) is very entertaining
in the role of the hapless innocent, blundering about like Stan Laurel with
a look of blank incomprehension which eventually gives way to various primal
teenage emotions. He is beautifully set against Quarton's broadly comic
mentor-cum-father figure, and the film rests largely upon the interplay
between the two personae and the two performances (just like <I><A HREF="iwd.htm">I Went Down</A></I>). But there is a wonderful lack of pretension
about this, and even when it does descend into the melodramatics required
of the genre, you tend to let it go without serious question because the
ride has been fun up to then. The script assumes the logic of the classical
drama and it unfolds just as you not only would expect, but demand that
it should. This is no bad thing, and like the later <A HREF="cheat.htm"><I>How
To Cheat In The Leaving Certificate</I>,</A> it is not ashamed to surrender
vauge notions of changing the world to the demands of narrative.</P>

<P>It's unlikely to offer anything substantially new to filmgoers with an
ounce of experience on the festival circuit, but the unusual setting may
rejuvenate the scenario for foreign audiences willing to take on the bizarre
mixture of accents. But this is entertainment in a long respected tradition
of meaningful stories, and it is fresh and funny enough as an Irish film
to provide suitable justification for viewing it.</P>

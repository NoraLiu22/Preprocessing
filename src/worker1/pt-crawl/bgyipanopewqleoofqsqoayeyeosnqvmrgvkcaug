To this place, and the kindness (Farewell Address, 1861) of these people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. (Farewell Address, 1861) I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington.(Farewell Address, 1861) Without the assistance of the Divine Being who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail. (Farewell Address, 1861) Trusting in Him who can go with me, and remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.";

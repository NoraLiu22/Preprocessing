      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Why is the cafe so historically important
      and why is it such a scandal that so many are being allowed to
      die off unlamented?</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The years after WW2 heralded a new spirit
      of optimism and national confidence in Britain. Consumer culture
      became king and as a symbol of this progress and prosperity a
      new <A HREF="contemp.htm">Contemporary</A> style dominated architecture
      and design through the 50s and into the 60s</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This was a fresh style moving on from the
      minimalist rigours of the <A HREF="http://library.thinkquest.org/11114/index.htm">Modernist</A>
      movement. It represented a new vibrancy with materials like Formica,
      leatherette chrome and plastic coming to the fore. The 'streamlining'
      cult was especially evident in kitchen interiors and the functional
      spaces of cafes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The positivity of an age created new tastes
      and trends, with the cafe's Italian styling a ubiquitous cheery
      symbol of national regeneration and outward lookingness. But
      today you have to look harder than ever to find decent, intact
      cafes with classic Formica tables, lino floors, proper seats
      and small cabinets of biscuits and crusty rolls.</FONT> <FONT
       FACE="Arial">Cafe family owners are nearing retirement age and
      the children don't want to take over the business. Also many
      leases are coming to an end for the central London cafes and
      the resale value of cafe buildings in the property boom is too
      vast to ignore.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Too many have been replaced and refitted
      with ghastly plastic moulded interiors devoid of atmosphere.
      But those that are left are national treasures.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dating from 1802, the term caf&eacute;
      comes from the French 'caf&eacute;' (meaning 'coffee' or 'coffeehouse')
      and the Italian 'caffe' (also meaning 'coffee'.) In 1839 'caf&eacute;teria'
      had been coined in American English from Mexican Spanish to indicate
      a coffee-store. But the caf&eacute; has been reinvented many
      times over the centuries. Here's a brief timeline excerpted from
      the history section of the forthcoming <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/190103383X/qid%3D1059316507/sr%3D1-1/ref%3Dsr_1_0_1/026-5958974-5075639">Classic

        original coffee houses were the monasteries and inns that had
        offered hospitality to travellers since the twelfth century.
        Expansion of urban populations during the fifteenth century led
        to a profusion of 'cook shops' - notably around London's Bread
        Street and East Cheap - where meal prices were controlled and
        the public could bring their own pies.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">T</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">he
        &quot;first coffee house in Christendom&quot; was established
        in Oxford in 1650 by a Jew called Jacob at the Angel in the parish
        of St Peter in the East. Two years later, a Greek servant named
        Pasqua Rosee (see illustration above) began running a coffee
        shop in St Michael's Alley, Cornhill in the City of London. </FONT><FONT
         FACE="Arial">Coffee houses became such popular forums for discussion
        they were dubbed &quot;penny universities&quot;.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">By 1670 the coffee house movement had
        overtaken - and become a key element of - Restoration London.
        By the 18th century, London was teeming with the liquid said
        to resemble 'syrup of soot or essence of old shoes' and places
        to drink it in.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">From 1675, a thousand or so coffee houses
        flowered during the reigns of Charles II, Queen Anne and George
        I.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">By the 19th century however, coffee houses
        had become exclusive clubs as a prolific press and an efficient
        post and transport system undermined the function of the coffee
        houses as centres of communication.</FONT>

        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">England abandoned coffee as the demands
        of the East India Company to exchange its preferred stimulants
        pushed the domestic market into tea consumption. But due to the
        success of the Dutch navy in the Pacific, tea became fashionable
        in the Dutch capital.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">As the craze for all things oriental swept
        Europe, tea became part of the national way of life and Dutch
        inns provided the first restaurant tea service as guests were
        furnished with portable tea sets complete with heating unit.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The first tea samples reached England
        between 1652 and 1654 and proved popular enough to replace ale
        as the national drink. Tea mania swept across England as it had
        earlier spread throughout France and Holland.</FONT>

        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Beginning in the late 1880's in both America
        and England, fine hotels began to offer tea service in tea rooms
        and tea courts. By 1910 hotels began to host afternoon tea dances
        as dance craze after dance craze swept the United States and
        England.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Through this time, the English working
        classes largely kept to the pub but the 19C coffee house hadn't
        entirely died out. A few clung on as 'workers' caf&eacute;s',
        described by one contemporary as: 'dull and humble; they have
        sallow holland blinds, drawn deep down behind sallow window-sashes...'</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">But in the 1880s the temperance movement
        tried to revive the coffee house scene in an attempt to divert
        the working man from the perils of drink. Modeled on the mahogany-trimmed
        taverns promoted by the beer industry, 'Coffee taverns,' one
        pamphlet stated, 'must show there are beverages as comforting
        as beer, that there are beverages to be bought as cheap as beer.'</FONT>

        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The coffee taverns were largely overtaken
        in the 19th century by small establishments run mainly by Arabs,
        Turks, Greeks and Sicilians which had become the haunts of 'foreigners'
        as well as stray 'Bohemians'.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Soho built on its traditional French,
        Italian and Spanish immigrant-centre origins as a new generations
        of outsiders move into London. After WW2 an influx of Italian
        families building on their long established catering expertise
        settled in Clerkenwell (Little Italy), spread West to Soho and
        eventually expanded all over the capital and the country.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Gradually, as Britain pulled through the
        travails of the post-war economy London rejuvenated. The Festival
        of Britain in 1951 signals an unequivocal move forward. Somehow,
        this feat of mass cultural re-engineering would impel the arts
        in Britain for the following decade and a half.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A greater informality of eating had begun
        as the first sandwich bar, Sandy's, opened in Oxendon St in 1933.
        Soon snack bars spread throughout the capital as the culture
        of fast-food was established.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1935 the first milk bar is set up in
        Fleet St by an Australian, Hugh D. McIntosh. Within a year there
        are 420 throughout Britain. As a further twist on the theme,
        coffee bars with a reputation for low-life and fast times emerged
        to mainstream popularity in the 1950's.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1945 Gaggia altered the espresso machine
        to create a high pressure extraction that produced a thick layer
        of crema. By 1946 cappuccino had been christened for its resemblance
        to the colour of the robes of the Capuchin monks. The unique
        selling point of the classic caf&eacute; had arrived</FONT>

        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">By 1953 coffee bars sprang up all over
        Soho. The first was The Moka espresso bar at 29 Frith St. Opened
        by Gina Lollabrigida, it became the model for many classic Formica
        cafes to come.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The coffee bars rapidly spread to other
        metropolitan areas: The Arabica, Brompton Road (G.R.Cole FRSA);
        Bamboo, Old Brompton Road (John Bainbridge); The Coffee House,
        Haymarket (Antoine Acket with E.E.Barlow ARIBA); Mocamba, Brompton
        Road (Douglas Fisher)...</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The cafes attracted CND activists, jazzers,
        noveau existentialists, nascent rock n' rollers, beatnik baby
        boomers, Piccadilly exquisites and a whole new post-war set of
        UK On The Roaders who, like Gelina in Mark McShane's novel 'The
        Passing of Evil', wilfully inhabit: 'the seedy-garish world of
        back-street London... restless rootless... beautiful, amoral,
        modern siren(s) of doom in a jungle of dance halls, caffs and
        pubs'</FONT>

        were under 25. The scene was set for a British creative renaissance

        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">In the 1970s, severe bust lead to a halving
        of the UK's manufacturing employment base. Large companies began
        leaving the capital en masse. Increasingly, British industry
        (for so long dependent on the spoils of Empire) fell behind the
        leaner economies of the US, Germany, Japan and Eastern Europe.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Unemployment, virtually unknown in Britain
        in the 1950s, began a long spiral upwards, the subsequent recession
        accompanied by high inflation and a collapse in living standards.
        As proprietors found more profit in selling food, so the coffee
        bars gradually all turned into general cafes or cheap restaurants.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Only a couple of die-hard cafe chains
        managed to last out the 1960s and hang on into the 1970s: the
        Lyons' Wimpy Bars (established in 1954) and the Golden Eggs (set
        up by Philip and Reggie Kaye in the early 1960s). The Wimpys
        avoided gimmickry, maintaining simple duo-tone minimal interiors
        but the Golden Egg was: &quot;The most controversial use of colour
        in British restaurantswhere riotous colour schemes and brilliant
        opaline lights have brought a jazzy mood to eating in low-price
        popular restaurants.&quot;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Despite their once epochal freshness,
        by the 1980s cafes were well and truly off the menu. A revitalised

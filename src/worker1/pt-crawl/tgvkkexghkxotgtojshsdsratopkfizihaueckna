<h3>The Victorian Web and Context32</h3>

<p class="one"> <img src="../alphabets/t2.gif" class="floatleft" alt="T"/>
he Victorian Web is the WWW translation of Brown University's <span class="website">Context 61,</span> which served as a resource for courses  in Victorian literature [follow for <a href ="61sylbs.html">syllabus</a> of one such course.] These materials ultimately derive from <span class="website">Context 32</span>, the  <span class="website">Intermedia</span> web that provided contextual information for English 32, "Survey of English literature from 1700 to the Present."  <span class="website">Context 32</span> was begun in Spring 1987 as part of Brown University Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship (IRIS)  Intermedia project, which IBM, Apple Computers, the Annenberg/CPB Project, and other sources funded.</p>
          
<p>For this predecessor of the current site, George P. Landow designed and edited the entire web, made many of the links, and was responsible for most of the materials on the individual authors and works as well as those on Biblical typology.  He authored multiple lexias throughout the web and selected both the external criticism cited and most of the visual images.  All captions for images are his. Under his direction <a href ="dc.html"> David Cody</a>  wrote many of the general materials and chose many of the original digitized images, and <a href ="ge.html">Glenn Everett</a>   wrote some of the basic materials on Romantic and Victorian poets including timelines.  The following year <a href ="kbs.html"> Kathryn Stockton</a>  created some documents on feminism and literary theory.  </p>

<p><a href ="asw.html"> Anthony S. Wohl,</a> then-Professor of History at Vassar College, generously contributed much of the material on Victorian public health,  race and class issues, and anti-Catholic prejudice in  Victorian England. He was pioneering first non-Brown contributor; there have since been hundreds. His work draws upon both his published and unpublished writings.</p>


<h3><a name="ssp">Transferring</a> the Intermedia Materials to Eastgate Systems Storyspace</h3>

<p class="one">In 1992 Robert Arellano '90 transferred most of the documents from the Intermedia system (which ceased operating in 1992) into Storyspace and relinked them. </p>

<p> <span class="website">The Victorian Web</span> also draws upon several other hypertext webs developed under  Landow's direction.  In particular, most of the Dickens materials come originally from the Intermedia <span class="website">Dickens Web</span>, which Julie Launhardt, Paul Kahn, and he assembled. (It won the 1990 EDUCOM/NCRIPTAL award for best software in the humanities and has been published in Storyspace by Eastgate Systems); similarly, most of the Tennyson materials are taken from the <span class="website">In Memoriam Web</span>, developed by him and Jon Lanestedt,  University of Oslo, Norway (also published by Eastgate Systems).</p>

<p>In 1993 David Stevenson '96 rearranged this wealth of materials approximately into the form in which you now encounter them.  He reorganized many of the materials on authors, imported and wrote some biographical materials, built and linked all works' overviews (sitemaps), and developed several of the contextual overviews.  He was responsible for importing a significant amount of the web's materials.  In one month's work over the summer of 1993 at IRIS, the web grew from one to three megabytes, gained over a thousand links, and acquired the structure and form that you see it in now. </p>

<h3><a name="html">Transferring</a> the Storyspace Web into HTML</h3>

<p class="one">In 1994 students in Landow's Victorian literature course (formerly English 61, now 73) created more than a hundred new lexias (or documents) for the web. After Landow edited them, they were added to the Storyspace version of the web by Mary-Kim Arnold '95 and Marc Zbyszynski'95, creator of the  now-defunct Storyspace Cluster. Zbyszynski began the laborious process of manually recreating in HTML all the link menus that Storyspace automatically generates on the fly. In May and June 1995 Landow then created the icons, designed the layout, and using <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/">Storyspace 1.3w8</a> and Robert C. Best's <span class="website">HTML Web Weaver 2.5.</span> created the HTML version of the Web. Since then Landow has chiefly used BBedit when working on Macs and  Allaire's Homesite when working in a Windows environment between 2000 and 2002. </p>

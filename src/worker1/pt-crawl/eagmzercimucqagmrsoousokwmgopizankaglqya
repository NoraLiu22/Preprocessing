<P><h1><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Metaphysical</FONT></CENTER></h1>
<P>Derived from the Greek <I>meta ta physika</I> (&quot;after
the things of nature&quot;); referring to an idea, doctrine, or
posited reality outside of human sense perception. In modern philosophical
terminology, metaphysics refers to the studies of what cannot
be reached through objective studies of material reality. Areas
of metaphysical studies include <!g><A HREF="../gengloss/ontol-body.html">ontology</a>, <!g><A HREF="../physgloss/cosml-body.html">cosmology</a>, and often,
<!g><A HREF="../gengloss/epist-body.html">epistemology</a>.</P>

<P>Metaphysical - Longer definition: Metaphysics is a type of
philosophy or study that uses broad concepts to help define reality
and our understanding of it. Metaphysical studies generally seek
to explain inherent or universal elements of reality which are
not easily discovered or experienced in our everyday life. As
such, it is concerned with explaining the features of reality
that exist beyond the physical world and our immediate senses.
Metaphysics, therefore, uses logic based on the meaning of human
terms, rather than on a logic tied to human sense perception of
the objective world. Metaphysics might include the study of the
nature of the human mind, the definition and meaning of existence,
or the nature of space, time, and/or causality.</P>

<P>The origin of philosophy, beginning with the Pre-Socratics,
was metaphysical in nature. For example, the philosopher Plotinus
held that the reason in the world and in the rational human mind
is only a reflection of a more universal and perfect reality beyond
our limited human reason. He termed this ordering power in the
universe &quot;God.&quot;</P>

<P>Metaphysical ideas, because they are not based on direct experience
with material reality, are often in conflict with the modern sciences.
Beginning with the <!g><A HREF="../gengloss/enlight-body.html">Enlightenment</a> and the <!g><A HREF="../gengloss/revolution-body.html">Scientific Revolution</a>,
experiments with, and observations of, the world became the yardsticks
for measuring truth and reality. Therefore, our contemporary valuation
of scientific knowledge over other forms of knowledge helps explain
the controversy and skepticism concerning metaphysical claims,
which are considered unverifiable by modern science.</P>

<P>In matters of religion, the problem of validating metaphysical
claims is most readily seen in all of the &quot;proofs&quot; for
the existence of God. Like trying to prove the existence of a
&quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; in the human, attempts
to scientifically prove the existence of God and other nonobjective,
nonhuman realities is seemingly impossible. The difficulty arises
out of the attempt to scientifically study and objectify something
which, by its very nature, cannot become an object of our scientific
studies. This reigning belief that everything can be explained
scientifically in terms of natural causes - referred to as naturalism
- compels many to think that only what is seen or sensed, only
what can be hypothesized and tested can be true, and therefore,
meaningful to us as humans.</P>

<P>Recently, however, even as metaphysics has come under attack
for its apparent lack of access to real knowledge, so has science
begun to have its own difficulties in claiming absolute knowledge.
Continual developments in our understanding of the human thought
process reveals that science cannot solely be relied upon to explain
reality, for the human mind cannot be seen as simply a mirror
of the natural world. For example, since the act of scientific
observation itself tends to produce the reality it hopes to explain,
the so-called &quot;truths&quot; of science cannot be considered
as final or objective. This fact manifests itself over and over
again, as scientific truths and laws continue to break down or
yield to new and better explanations of reality. What becomes
apparent, therefore, is that the process of human interpretation
in the sciences, as elsewhere, is both variable and relative to
the observer's viewpoint.</P>

<P>Under the skeptical analyses of the philosophical movements
known as <!g><A HREF="../gengloss/postm-body.html">postmodernism</a> and <!g><A HREF="../gengloss/decon-body.html">deconstructionism</a>, all of these facts
have resulted in a modern repudiation of both metaphysics and
science. Their criticisms are based on the cultural and historical
relativity of all knowledge. These two philosophical &quot;schools&quot;
deny any existence at all of an objective or universal knowledge.
Thus, metaphysical claims stand today between the absolutist claims
of science (<!g><A HREF="../gengloss/sciism-body.html">scientism</a>) and the complete relativism of postmodernism
and deconstructionism.</P>

      <p> <b><a name="acct_class"></a>Account classification:</b> The way in which suppliers of electricity, natural gas, or fuel oil classify and bill their customers. Commonly used account classifications are "Residential," "Commercial," "Industrial," and "Other." Suppliers' definitions of these terms vary from supplier to supplier. In addition, the same customer may be classified differently by each of its energy suppliers.
      <p> <b><a name="acct_of_others"></a>Account of others (natural gas): </b> Natural gas deliveries for the account of others are deliveries to customers by transporters that do not own the natural gas but deliver it for others for a fee. Included are quantities covered by long-term contracts and quantities involved in short-term or spot market sales.
      <p> <b><a name="acct_syst"></a>Accounting system:</b> A method of recording accounting data for a utility or company or a method of supplying accounting information for controlling, evaluating, planning and decisionmaking.
      <p> <b><a name="acid_mine_drain"></a>Acid mine drainage:</b> This refers to water pollution that results when sulfur-bearing minerals associated with coal are exposed to air and water and form sulfuric acid and ferrous sulfate. The ferrous sulfate can further react to form ferric hydroxide, or yellowboy, a yellow-orange iron precipitate found in streams and rivers polluted by acid mine drainage.
      <p> <b><a name="acid_rain"></a>Acid rain:</b> Also called acid precipitation or acid deposition, acid rain is precipitation containing harmful amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids formed primarily by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. It can be wet precipitation (rain, snow, or fog) or dry precipitation (absorbed gaseous and particulate matter, aerosol particles or dust). Acid rain has a pH below 5.6. Normal rain has a pH of about 5.6, which is slightly acidic. The term pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity and ranges from 0 to 14. A pH measurement of 7 is regarded as neutral. Measurements below 7 indicate increased acidity, while those above indicate increased alkalinity. 
      <p> <b><a name="acquis_crude"></a>Acquisition (foreign crude oil):</b> All transfers of ownership of foreign crude oil to a firm, irrespective of the terms of that transfer. Acquisitions thus include all purchases and exchange receipts as well as any and all foreign crude acquired under reciprocal buy-sell agreements or acquired as a result of a buy-back or other preferential agreement with a host government.
      <p> <b><a name="acquis_mineral"></a>Acquisition (minerals):</b> The procurement of the legal right to explore for and produce discovered minerals, if any, within a specific area; that legal right may be obtained by mineral lease, concession, or purchase of land and mineral rights or of mineral rights alone.
      <p> <b><a name="acquis_cost"></a>Acquisition costs, mineral rights:</b> Direct and indirect costs incurred to acquire legal rights to extract natural resources. Direct costs include costs incurred to obtain options to lease or purchase mineral rights and costs incurred for the actual leasing (e.g., lease bonuses) or purchasing of the rights. Indirect costs include such costs as brokers' commissions and expenses; abstract and recording fees; filing and patenting fees; and costs for legal examination of title and documents.
      <p> <b><a name="acre_foot"></a>Acre-foot:</b> The volume of water that will cover an area of 1 acre to a depth of 1 foot.
      <p> <b><a name="acreage"></a>Acreage:</b> An area, measured in acres, that is subject to ownership or control by those holding total or fractional shares of working interests. Acreage is considered developed when development has been completed. A distinction may be made between "gross" acreage and "net" acreage: 
     
    <ul>
        <li>Gross - All acreage covered by any working interest, regardless of the percentage of ownership in the interest. 
         
     <li>Net - Gross acreage adjusted to reflect the percentage of ownership in the working interest in the acreage.
         </ul>
      <p><a name="active_power"></a><strong>Active power:</strong> The component of electric power that performs work, <EM><I><FONT face="Times New Roman"><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: normal">typically</SPAN></FONT></I></EM>&nbsp;measured in kilowatts (kW) or megawatts (MW). Also known as "real power."&nbsp; The terms "active" or "real" are used to modify the base term "power" to differentiate it from Reactive Power.<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> &nbsp;</SPAN></B>See<B> <a href="glossaryp.html#power" target="_blank">Power</a>, <a href="glossaryr.html#reactive_power" target="_blank">Reactive Power</a>, <a href="glossarya.html#apparent_power" target="_blank">Apparent Power</a></B></p>
      <p> <b><a name="active_solar"></a>Active solar:</b> As an energy source, energy from the sun collected and stored using mechanical pumps or fans to circulate heat-laden fluids or air between solar collectors and a building.
      <p> <b><a name="actual_peak"></a>Actual peak reduction:</b> The actual reduction in annual peak load (measured in kilowatts) achieved by customers that participate in a utility demand-side management (DSM) program. It reflects the changes in the demand for electricity resulting from a utility DSM program that is in effect at the same time the utility experiences its annual peak load, as opposed to the installed peak load reduction capability (i.e., potential peak reduction). It should account for the regular cycling of energy efficient units during the period of annual peak load. 
      <p> <b><a name="adj_speed_drives"></a>Adjustable speed drives:</b> Drives that save energy by ensuring the motor's speed is properly matched to the load placed on the motor. Terms used to describe this category include polyphase motors, motor oversizing, and motor rewinding.
      <p> <b><a name="adj_elec"></a>Adjusted electricity:</b> A measurement of electricity that includes the approximate amount of energy used to generate electricity. To approximate the adjusted amount of electricity, the site-value of the electricity is multiplied by a factor of 3. This conversion factor of 3 is a rough approximation of the Btu value of raw fuels used to generate electricity in a steam-generation power plant.
      <p> <b><a name="adj_bid"></a>Adjustment bid:</b> A bid auction conducted by the independent system operator or power exchange to redirect supply or demand of electricity when congestion is anticipated.
      <p> <b><a name="admin_exp"></a>Administrative and general expenses:</b> Expenses of an electric utility relating to the overall directions of its corporate offices and administrative affairs, as contrasted with expenses incurred for specialized functions. Examples include office salaries, office supplies, advertising, and other general expenses.
      <p> <b><a name="adv_royalty"></a>Advance royalty:</b> A royalty required to be paid in advanceof production from a mineral property that may or may not be recoverable from future production.
      <p> <b><a name="adv_from_mun"></a>Advances <u>from</u> municipality:</b> The amount of loans and advances made by the municipality or its other departments to the utility department when such loans and advances are subject to repayment but not subject to current settlement.
      <p> <b><a name="adv_to_mun"></a>Advances <u>to</u> municipality:</b> The amount of loans and advances made by the utility department to the municipality or its other departments when such loans or advances are subject to current settlement.
      <p> <b><a name="adverse_water_cond"></a>Adverse water conditions:</b> Reduced streamflow, lack of rain in the drainage basin, or low water supply behind a pondage or reservoir dam resulting in a reduced gross head that limits the production of hydroelectric power or forces restrictions to be placed on multipurpose reservoirs or other water uses.
      <p> <b><a name="affil"></a>Affiliate:</b> An entity which is directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by another entity. See <b>firm</b>.
      <p> <b><a name="affor"></a>Afforestation:</b> Planting of new forests on lands that have not been recently forested.
      <p> <b><a name="after_market_conv_veh"></a>Aftermarket converted vehicle:</b> A standard conventionally fueled, factory-produced vehicle to which equipment has been added that enables the vehicle to operate on alternative fuel.

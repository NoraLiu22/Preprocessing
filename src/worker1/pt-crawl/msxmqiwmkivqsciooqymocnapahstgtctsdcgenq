Winning the World Series typically comes down to whichever team is the hottest at the time, which is why you see so many Wild Card teams make runs. They sneak into the playoffs and keep playing good baseball. The Braves did win a few years ago so it isn’t like they have missed out on a ton of opportunities. Overall, this team is probably the most balanced of any in the league. The hitting is disgustingly good with both a high average and a ton of dingers. It has to be a luxury to have seven or eight guys that can put the ball over the fence with regularity. The pitching hasn’t been quite as sharp as you need it to be, but they have enough arms (and offensive support) that it doesn’t really matter. Tonight, they are putting a veteran, Charline Morton, on the hill in hopes of slowing down the other great offense in this gaem. Morton has been strong this season with a 3.60 ERA over 30 innings and sporting a 1.13 WHIP. He has only thrown to road starts, but one was a disaster as he allowed six earned runs over 5.2 innings to the Marlins – the Braves still won the game 9-7. He is coming off of his best start of the year with seven scoreless innings against the Guardians, the Braves lost in extra innings. Go figure. Dodgers hitters, especially Freddie Freeman, have been good against Morton. They’ve got a .272 batting average and about 25% of their hits have gone for extra bases. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}},{content_type:o,content:{copyright:a,spark_id:"4010731a-7474-522e-b1f6-0ececd24397f",external_url:a,alt:a,caption:"Apr 13, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Gavin Stone (71) throws against the San Diego Padres during the second inning at Dodger Stadium.

They also are likely to win over 100 games, but I can’t say I’d count on them to do much in the postseason. Why? They don’t have the pitching at the moment. Things can always change, and they’ve shown they are willing to get arms when needed (now that everything has been proven otherwise, why not bring back Trevor Bauer?). They will get back Walker Buehler soon, but I’m not sure that is enough. In this game, they are putting Gavin Stone on the hill. He’s been fine for the Dodgers with a 4.68 ERA and a 1.44 WHIP, but again, not someone you want to rely on in the playoffs. He has put up quality starts in two of his last three games, so maybe he is figuring something out.

I think the franchise has underperformed and I personally am frustrated by it (they haven’t really cost me money or anything) because I like when teams actually try to put a winning product on the field. For whatever reason, this hasn’t worked out for the Padres. They are just average despite having some of the better names in their lineup. It looked like they were trying to field a team of shortstops, which really isn’t a bad strategy. They’ve done well with pitching, finding reasonable salaried guys, and even getting the most out of others. For whatever reason it has resulted in them being competitive, but not competitive enough. I certainly understand not being able to overthrow the Dodgers, but they should be finishing in second each year. This just hasn’t been the case. One of their additions they made this season to try and get on the winning side was to add Dylan Cease via trade. Cease has come over and looked more like the Cy Young candidate he was. He’s had six starts this season and has allowed just 11 runs in 35.2 innings. Five of those runs came in his last start, so he’s been even better than you might think. His last start interrupted a run of four consecutive quality starts where he allowed two or fewer runs in each game. Diamondback hitters are just 7-for-33 against Cease with only one extra-base hit. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}},{content_type:o,content:{copyright:a,spark_id:"f2d3de85-dff1-5094-b6ca-de4981574cfa",external_url:a,alt:a,caption:"Apr 21, 2024; San Francisco, California, USA;  Arizona Diamondbacks starting pitcher Slade Cecconi (43) throws against the San Francisco Giants during the first inning at Oracle Park.

They know they have two stud pitchers and a few other younger guys that can throw. They know that Corbin Carroll is a stud and the team can hit for average and power. Perhaps this is just a blip, but the Diamondbacks aren’t looking like the well-crafted team from last season. It is still early, and a lot can happen, but their numbers are pretty similar to the Padres and that likely won’t result in anything other than an average finish. Tonight, they send out Slade Cecconi in hopes of stopping the Padres. Cecconi is making his third start of the season. In the first two, he allowed just three earned runs total over 12 innings. What I like the most is he has allowed a total of five hits and one walk, while striking out 11 hitters. He’s done all of this on the road, this will be his first home start.

Obviously, that throws of the statistics, but being outscored 28-16 in five games isn't ideal for any team. Collectively the team is fairly average with hitting, but they do find ways to manufacture runs. For example, their team batting average is a point lower than the Mets, but they have scored 21 more runs than today's opponent on the season. So far, the club has dealt with some injuries so they should be rather happy with the 18-12 record that they have. One guy that has done more than carry his weight is Shota Imanaga. The Cubs are 5-0 in his starts and he has a solid 4-0 record with a 0.98 ERA and a superb 0.80 WHIP. He doesn't qualify for the league leader category in either of these because he's only thrown 27.2 total innings over five starts, but there was only one outing where he threw fewer than five innings. The Cubs look like they are limiting him to around 90 pitches per game, but that was enough to get back-to-back quality starts.

Last season a .500 record would be a disappointment. This season, it almost seems like the Mets are overperforming. The clump has a .239 batting average and only 128 runs scored this season. They are getting most of their damage by home runs instead of stringing together hits, which explains a lot about the team. Relying on the home run is a tough way to go through the season. I don't think they can rely on the long ball today against Imanaga, though he has allowed a homer in both of his past two starts. The Mets send out Jose Butto to the hill today. He is making his fifth start of the season. In his first two games he allowed just one earned run on five hits over 12 innings. In his next two starts, he allowed six earned runs over 10 innings. It is possible that the walks are what does Butto in.

Both of these numbers are among the best in the league. Their pitching staff has been underrated this season with how dominant they've been. Collectively, the team is sporting a 3.02 ERA and a 1.20 WHIP. The staff is also limiting opposing hitters to just a .218 batting average, so they are keeping the base paths clean. Today, they send out Nestor Cortes to navigate through this Orioles lineup. Cortes might have found his groove lately as he has put back-to-back quality starts. He also is chewing up a lot of innings for the Yankees as he has covered at least seven innings in three of his six starts. In his other three starts, he has thrown either four or five innings.

As a team they are hitting well at .254 and even have more home runs than the Yankees team that has names like Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, and Giancarlo Stanton in the lineup. The way they are built, they find ways to manufacture runs both through stringing together hits and power. It is a nice mix (and to the Yankees' credit, they are doing the same this season), and I expect it to continue for the entire season. The pitching staff could still use some improvement as they are sitting at a 3.74 ERA as a team which isn't bad, but still leaves some to be desired. Today, they are sending out Dean Kremer to the mound. Kremer has been fine this season, and about what you should expect him to be. Kremer has completed over five innings just once this year - a seven-inning five-hit outing against the Pirates. He has allowed at least two earned runs in every other game and only going five innings in three of the four other starts. He has struggled a bit against the Yankees in his career with 18 hits allowed over 69 at-bats.

They are one of only two teams that don't have at least 200 hits. There is some reason for optimism about the hitting, as Paul Goldschmidt is one of the best hitters in the league, and he is currently hitting .208. Maybe it is a down year for the former MVP, or maybe he turns it around. The pitching has improved for the Cardinals this season. Collectively, the team has a 3.86 ERA. This was a big concern for them last season, and it looks like the team addressed the problem. One of their additions, Kyle Gibson, takes the ball today for the Cardinals, and he has been at the very least an innings eater, and potentially is finding his stride. Gibson has gone at least six innings in all five starts this year and he has three quality starts. His worst start was against the Marlins (of all teams) and he allowed almost half of his fifteen earned runs on the season in that game. He has posted back-to-back six inning, one earned run starts and looks to continue here. Gibson has allowed 14 hits in their 57 at-bats against him.

Now the question will be if the team just had a hot start or if they truly are a solid team. Like the Cardinals, there are some concerns on the offensive side of the diamond. They aren't hitting much better than St. Louis. They have only 11 more hits, and a .223 average this season. They have scored 13 more runs than the Cardinals, but it still is just under four runs per game. The Tigers could benefit from taking some walks, but with a guy like Javier Baez in the lineup, walks aren't a realistic expectation. Also like the Cardinals, the Tigers are led by the pitching staff. The Tigers are at a 3.14 ERA, and holding opponents to a .211 batting average. If they keep this up for the whole season, the hitting might not matter all that much. Today they send out a former Cardinals pitcher, Jack Flaherty. His ERA looks rough at almost five, but he has three quality starts in five outings this season. Like Gibson, ten of Flaherty's 16 earned runs allowed came in two games. One concern is that he's allowed a home run in every game this season and has allowed 30 hits over 29.1 innings. He has been able to keep his walks down which is a big benefit for him. Having played on the same team as the Cardinals, most don't have too much experience against him, but the team is 13-for-39 against him. Willson Contreras is 6-for-22 against him. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}},{content_type:j,content:{alignment:k,format:l,text:"\u003Cp\u003EI don't see official lineups for the first game of this double-header, but I think that the Cardinals have the better pitcher on the mound for this game.

I'll take the obvious play here and play the under 8.5 runs for the game. I don't think either starter will give up more than 2 runs, and both struggle offensively. Back the under in this first game of the doubleheader. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}},{content_type:j,content:{alignment:k,format:l,text:X}}],component_type:Y,social_image:{uuidv5:cm,content_type:o,content:{alt:a,caption:cn,wp__origin:{blog_id:d,environment:e,post_type:p,site:f,source:g,post_id:co},url:aO},url:aO},pill:a},{original_post:{original_post_id:a,original_post_share:a,original_external_post_type:a,original_post_uuidv5:a},full_span_image:a,fn__image:{uuidv5:cw,content_type:o,content:{alt:a,caption:cx,wp__origin:{blog_id:d,environment:e,post_type:p,site:f,source:g,post_id:cy},url:aR},url:aR},stock_tickers:a,short_title:ae,origination_modified_date:bf,fn__fbia_title:ae,storycard_title:ae,urls:{original_publisher:a,category:{slug:m,spark_id:a},original_publish_date:a,original_url:a,url:dx,slug:cz},fn__site_search:c,wp__tags:[{path:aI,external_uri:a,spark_id:aJ,tag_type:h,isa_value:J,external_id:a,title:aK,type:i,slug:J},{path:aL,external_uri:a,spark_id:aM,tag_type:h,isa_value:K,external_id:a,title:aN,type:i,slug:K}],canonical_url:dx,shared_category:[],livefyre__:{storify:b},origination_station:r,spark_shows:[],wp__category:{path:u,uuidv5:v,title:z,slug:m,isa_value:m},branding:{fn__disclaimer:a,fn__sponsor_name:a,fn__campaign_id:a,advertorial:b,fn__indicator:a,fn__sponsor_logo:a},fn__legacy_type:w,vanity_slugs:[],meta_title:a,fn__additional_authors:[],show_advertisements:b,share:[],storycard_image:a,fn__story_type:x,post_status:q,fn__apple_news_title:ae,foxid:{enabled:b},fn__section_title:ae,post_version:M,social_description:a,fn__section_description:a,export_headline:a,meta_description:a,sync_image:b,spotim:{event_code:a,id:a},original_post_canonical_url:a,dek:"Let's take a look at how to play the opener as the Yankees take on the Orioles.",slug:cz,shared_tags:[],articleId:a,spark_persons:[],wp__origin:{site:f,environment:e,blog_id:d,post_id:732693,post_type:N,source:g,post_status:q},third_party_canonical_url:a,publication_date:bf,published:c,presentation_type:w,starts_with_dropcap:b,fn__breaking_news:b,dateline:a,storycard_tag:[],social_title:ae,fn__type:t,original_shared_post:[],spark_id:dy,thumbnail:{uuidv5:cw,content_type:o,content:{alt:a,caption:cx,wp__origin:{blog_id:d,environment:e,post_type:p,site:f,source:g,post_id:cy},url:aR},url:aR},fn__external_feeds_title:ae,last_modified_date:bf,fn__contributors:[{page_url:s,role:C,prefix:a,short_bio:a,last_name:F,middle_initial:a,personality_name:n,canonical_url:s,title:n,name_id:B,fn__type:y,uuidv5:A,full_name:n,company_name:a,blog_urls:[],full_bio_url:a,first_name:D,job_title:a,person_id:E}],sync_description:b,vanity_urls:[],comments:{enabled:b},wp__shared_tags:[],storycard_description:a,short_urls:[a],fn__featured:b,fn__syndication_info:[],fn__tags:[{path:aI,external_uri:a,spark_id:aJ,tag_type:h,isa_value:J,external_id:a,title:aK,type:i,slug:J},{path:aL,external_uri:a,spark_id:aM,tag_type:h,isa_value:K,external_id:a,title:aN,type:i,slug:K}],prevent_gating:b,local_tags:[],last_published_date:bf,fn__sources:[{fn__type:O,uuidv5:P,wp__origin:{site:f,environment:e,blog_id:d,post_type:Q,source:g,post_id:R},label:H,canonical_url:S,slug:T,url:U}],title:ae,fn__stock_ticker_symbols:a,meta:{chartbeat:{section:m,viewID:"\u002Fbetting\u002Fal-east-battle-will-be-as-close-to-playoffs-as-we-can-get-in-april",title:ae,authors:[n]},segment:{title:ae,page_content_type:t,page_content_type_of_story:x}},created_date:"2024-04-29T11:18:24-04:00",standfirst:dt,fn__distribution_platforms:{android:{enabled:c},apple_news:{notification_dates:[],enabled:c,enabled_date:"2024-04-29T19:18:23Z"},distribution_smart_news:{enabled:c},distribution_flipboard:{enabled:c},ios:{enabled:c},distribution_msn:{enabled:c},google_news:{amp:c,standout:c,live_coverage:c},facebook_news:{suppress:b,opinion:b},distribution_true_anthem:{enabled:b},wire_override:b,facebook_instant_articles:{enabled:b},web:{enabled:c},distribution_newsbreak:{enabled:c},distribution_yahoo:{enabled:c},distribution_snapchat:{enabled:c},automated_alerts:{enabled:b},search_engines:{enabled:c}},fox_bet:b,wp__shared_category:a,network:r,shared_shows:[],fn__app_title:ae,storycard_image_format:a,content_type:V,article_slug:cz,id:dy,tags:[{path:aI,external_uri:a,spark_id:aJ,tag_type:h,isa_value:J,external_id:a,title:aK,type:i,slug:J},{path:aL,external_uri:a,spark_id:aM,tag_type:h,isa_value:K,external_id:a,title:aN,type:i,slug:K}],fn__sections:[{path:u,uuidv5:v,isa_value:m}],stocks:[],distribution_site_search:c,fn__footer:a,fn__shows:[],components:[{content_type:j,content:{alignment:k,format:l,text:du}},{content_type:j,content:{alignment:k,format:l,text:"\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost May, so saying that this is a big series is a bit ridiculous, but the reality of the situation is that this is the AL East and there are very talented teams.

Now as an adult, I love that a team does that. We have a bunch of clubs that refuse to spend money. It makes no sense considering how much teams generate when they make a playoff run, but this is a completely different story. In any case, the Yankees got Juan Soto and he has been great for them with a .318 average and seven home runs already this season. He's leading the team in homers, RBIs, walks, average, hits, runs, and even doubles. So… yeah, that was a good trade for them. He's going to make a boatload of money in the offseason. Like Ohtani money if he wants it. Today, the Yankees have Clarke Schmidt taking on the Orioles. Schmidt has been solid this season, but not pitching overly deep into games. He has accumulated 25.1 innings over five starts and allowed just 10 earned runs on the year. I am not sure if the Yankees are just taking him out before things get too bad for him or if the pitch count is too high, but it feels like the Yankees could leave him in longer. Either way, it is working because they are 5-0 in his starts this season. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}},{content_type:o,content:{copyright:a,spark_id:"8fb9f60d-6a19-5547-9abf-cce75088894f",external_url:a,alt:a,caption:"Mar 30, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA;  Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Grayson Rodriguez (30) throws a first inning pitch against the Los Angeles Angels at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

If you want to take a bit of solace in the losses, two of their past three losses came by just one run. If you zoom out a bit you see that the losses came at the hands of the Athletics. Oakland isn't quite as bad as they were projected, but they aren't in the same conversation as the Orioles. The team is hitting rather well this season and has four guys batting .300 or better and another two who are within 15 points of the mark. Baltimore still relies on their pitching staff to do a lot of the damage and tries to get the ball to the bullpen as quickly as possible. Grayson Rodriguez is taking the ball for the Orioles and he had pitched rather well for the team before this most recent start against the Angels. In his first four starts he went 24 innings and allowed seven earned runs. Then in his most recent start against the Angels, he allowed seven earned runs in 4.1 innings. Rodriguez has been good against the Yankees in his career with just two hits allowed to them in 20 at-bats.

Right now, they've won four of their past five games and have been amazing both on the road and at home. Their 19-7 record is among the best in the MLB and there are no reasons to think they would slow down any time soon. Their offense was incredibly dominant last season, and I thought it might regress a bit this year. So far, it is essentially the same. Their pitching staff has some great arms, including today's starter Max Fried. He hasn't looked great overall this season with 14 earned runs allowed in five starts. However, he is coming off his best start of the season when he threw a complete game shutout. There have only been two quality starts from Fried this season.

I like the Marines to be honest, but they seem to fluctuate between winning streaks and losing streaks without gaining much ground, or losing too much. The team is capable of getting hot and reeling off wins - that's why they were in the playoff race last season. Currently, the Mariners have won three of their past five games. None of those games have gone over seven runs combined from the two teams. Most of that is due to a very strong pitching staff from the Mariners, and obviously just enough hitting. Tonight, they send out Bryce Miller to the hill to combat Fried. Miller has been very good this year with three quality starts and not allowing more than two earned runs in any of his past four outings. In fact, on the season he has only allowed seven earned runs over 28.1 innings. The biggest issue with Miller is that he does allow home runs and we know the Braves are capable of hitting dingers.

I also very rarely like a team going from the east to the west with no rest. The Braves body clock will be almost 10 PM when this game starts. They could probably roll out of bed and hit, but this is a good chance for a Mariners win and the under. I'll play just the under, but I do think the Mariners are live dogs here. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}},{content_type:j,content:{alignment:k,format:l,text:X}}],component_type:Y,social_image:{uuidv5:cA,content_type:o,content:{alt:a,caption:cB,wp__origin:{blog_id:d,environment:e,post_type:p,site:f,source:g,post_id:cC},url:aS},url:aS},pill:a},{original_post:{original_post_id:a,original_post_share:a,original_external_post_type:a,original_post_uuidv5:a},full_span_image:a,fn__image:{uuidv5:cH,content_type:o,content:{alt:cI,caption:cJ,wp__origin:{blog_id:d,environment:e,post_type:p,site:f,source:g,post_id:cK},url:aU},url:aU},stock_tickers:a,short_title:ag,origination_modified_date:bh,fn__fbia_title:ag,storycard_title:ag,urls:{original_publisher:a,category:{slug:m,spark_id:a},original_publish_date:a,original_url:a,url:dB,slug:cL},fn__site_search:c,wp__tags:[{path:cM,external_uri:a,spark_id:cN,tag_type:h,isa_value:aV,external_id:a,title:cO,type:i,slug:aV},{path:aA,external_uri:a,spark_id:aB,tag_type:h,isa_value:I,external_id:a,title:aC,type:i,slug:I}],canonical_url:dB,shared_category:[],livefyre__:{storify:b},origination_station:r,spark_shows:[],wp__category:{path:u,uuidv5:v,title:z,slug:m,isa_value:m},branding:{fn__disclaimer:a,fn__sponsor_name:a,fn__campaign_id:a,advertorial:b,fn__indicator:a,fn__sponsor_logo:a},fn__legacy_type:w,vanity_slugs:[],meta_title:a,fn__additional_authors:[],show_advertisements:b,share:[],storycard_image:a,fn__story_type:x,post_status:q,fn__apple_news_title:ag,foxid:{enabled:b},fn__section_title:ag,post_version:M,social_description:a,fn__section_description:a,export_headline:a,meta_description:a,sync_image:b,spotim:{event_code:a,id:a},original_post_canonical_url:a,dek:"Tonight, the Cubs take on the Red Sox from the illustrious Fenway Park.",slug:cL,shared_tags:[],articleId:a,spark_persons:[],wp__origin:{site:f,environment:e,blog_id:d,post_id:732403,post_type:N,source:g,post_status:q},third_party_canonical_url:a,publication_date:bh,published:c,presentation_type:w,starts_with_dropcap:b,fn__breaking_news:b,dateline:a,storycard_tag:[],social_title:ag,fn__type:t,original_shared_post:[],spark_id:dC,thumbnail:{uuidv5:cH,content_type:o,content:{alt:cI,caption:cJ,wp__origin:{blog_id:d,environment:e,post_type:p,site:f,source:g,post_id:cK},url:aU},url:aU},fn__external_feeds_title:ag,last_modified_date:bh,fn__contributors:[{page_url:s,role:C,prefix:a,short_bio:a,last_name:F,middle_initial:a,personality_name:n,canonical_url:s,title:n,name_id:B,fn__type:y,uuidv5:A,full_name:n,company_name:a,blog_urls:[],full_bio_url:a,first_name:D,job_title:a,person_id:E}],sync_description:b,vanity_urls:[],comments:{enabled:b},wp__shared_tags:[],storycard_description:a,short_urls:[a],fn__featured:b,fn__syndication_info:[],fn__tags:[{path:cM,external_uri:a,spark_id:cN,tag_type:h,isa_value:aV,external_id:a,title:cO,type:i,slug:aV},{path:aA,external_uri:a,spark_id:aB,tag_type:h,isa_value:I,external_id:a,title:aC,type:i,slug:I}],prevent_gating:b,local_tags:[],last_published_date:bh,fn__sources:[{fn__type:O,uuidv5:P,wp__origin:{site:f,environment:e,blog_id:d,post_type:Q,source:g,post_id:R},label:H,canonical_url:S,slug:T,url:U}],title:ag,fn__stock_ticker_symbols:a,meta:{chartbeat:{section:m,viewID:"\u002Fbetting\u002Fback-boston-in-sunday-night-baseball-battle",title:ag,authors:[n]},segment:{title:ag,page_content_type:t,page_content_type_of_story:x}},created_date:"2024-04-28T10:00:39-04:00",standfirst:"Cubs vs. Red Sox, 7:00 ET",fn__distribution_platforms:{android:{enabled:c},apple_news:{notification_dates:[],enabled:c,enabled_date:"2024-04-28T18:00:37Z"},distribution_smart_news:{enabled:c},distribution_flipboard:{enabled:c},ios:{enabled:c},distribution_msn:{enabled:c},google_news:{amp:c,standout:c,live_coverage:c},facebook_news:{suppress:b,opinion:b},distribution_true_anthem:{enabled:b},wire_override:b,facebook_instant_articles:{enabled:b},web:{enabled:c},distribution_newsbreak:{enabled:c},distribution_yahoo:{enabled:c},distribution_snapchat:{enabled:c},automated_alerts:{enabled:b},search_engines:{enabled:c}},fox_bet:b,wp__shared_category:a,network:r,shared_shows:[],fn__app_title:ag,storycard_image_format:a,content_type:V,article_slug:cL,id:dC,tags:[{path:cM,external_uri:a,spark_id:cN,tag_type:h,isa_value:aV,external_id:a,title:cO,type:i,slug:aV},{path:aA,external_uri:a,spark_id:aB,tag_type:h,isa_value:I,external_id:a,title:aC,type:i,slug:I}],fn__sections:[{path:u,uuidv5:v,isa_value:m}],stocks:[],distribution_site_search:c,fn__footer:a,fn__shows:[],components:[{content_type:j,content:{alignment:k,format:l,text:"\u003Cp\u003ECubs vs. Red Sox, 7:00 ET\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"}},{content_type:j,content:{alignment:k,format:l,text:"\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost like something out of a movie.

He is coming off of a quality start in his last outing against the Astros as he went six innings and allowed just two earned runs. He has allowed at least two earned runs in all of his outings this season.

For the fans, this allows them to root for a team that isn’t bottoming out, but one that has also shown a penchant for spending money when the team is close.

He has three games in which he hasn’t allowed a run and only one game where he looked bad. Against the Angels, he allowed 12 hits over 5.2 innings, aside from that he’s been great.

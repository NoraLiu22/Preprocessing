<p>It will have appeared from this account that
Eusebius had a truly noble conception of the work which he was taking in hand.
It was nothing less than the history of a society which stood in an intimate
relation to the Divine Logos Himself, a society whose roots struck down into
the remotest past and whose destinies soared into the eternal future. He felt
moreover that he himself lived at the great crisis in its history. Now at
length it had conquered, or at least seemed to have conquered, the powers of
this world. No such moment in its development had ever occurred before ; and
it was difficult to see how any such could occur again. This was the very time
therefore to place on record the incidents of its past career. Moreover, he
had great opportunities, such as were not likely to fall to another. In his own
episcopal city, perhaps in his own official residence, was the largest
Christian library which had hitherto been got together&mdash;the books collected by
his friend Pamphilus. Not far off, at
Jerusalem, was another valuable library, collected in the earlier part of the
preceding century by the bishop Alexander, and especially rich in the
correspondence of men of letters and rulers in the church, "from which
library," writes Eusebius, "we too have been able to collect together the
materials for this undertaking which we have in hand" <i>(H. E. </i>vi. 20).
Moreover, he himself had been trained in a highly
efficient school of literary industry under Pamphilus, while his passion for
learning has rarely been equalled, perhaps never surpassed.</p>

<p>It must be confessed however that the execution of his work
falls far short of the conception. The faults indeed are patent and tend to
obscure the merits, so that an unjust depreciation of the work has too commonly
been the consequence. Yet, with all allowance made for these, it is a noble
monument of literary labour. He himself, as we have seen, pleads for
indulgence, as one who is setting foot upon new ground, "nullius ante trita
solo." As he had no predecessor, so also he had no successor. Rufinus,
Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, all commenced their work where he had ended.
None ventured to go over the same ground again, but left him sole possessor of
the field which he held by right of discovery and of conquest. The most bitter
of his theological adversaries were forced to confess their obligations to him,
and to speak of his work with respect. It is only necessary to reflect for a
moment what a blank would be left in our knowledge of this most important
chapter in all human history, if the narrative of Eusebius were blotted out,
and we shall appreciate the enormous debt of gratitude which we owe to him.
The little light which glimmered over the earliest history of Christianity in
medieval times came ultimately from Eusebius alone, coloured and distorted in
its passage through various media.</p>

<p>The two points which require consideration are
(1) the range and adequacy of his materials (2)
the use made of these materials.</p>

<p>1. The range of
materials is astonishing when we consider that Eusebius was a pioneer breaking
new ground. Some hundred works, in several cases very lengthy works, are either
directly cited or referred to as read. When we remember that in many instances
he would read an entire treatise through for the sake of one or two historical
notices, while in many others he must have done the same without finding any
thing which would serve his purpose, we are able to form some conception of the
enormous labour involved in the work. This then is his strongest point. Yet
even here deficiencies may be noted. He very rarely quotes the works of
heresiarchs themselves, being content to give their opinions through the medium
of their opponents' refutations. A still greater defect is his ignorance of
Latin literature and of Latin Christendom generally. Thus he knows nothing of
Tertullian's works, except the <i>Apologeticum</i>, which he quotes (ii. 2, 25, iii.
20, 33, v. 5) from a bad Greek translation (e. g. ii. 25, where the translator,
being ignorant of the Latin idiom <i> cum maxime</i>, makes shipwreck of the sense).
Of Tertullian himself he gives no account, but calls him a "Roman." Pliny's
letter he only knows through Tertullian (iii. 33), and is unacquainted with the
name of the province which Pliny governed. Of Hippolytus again he has very
little information to comniunicate, and cannot even tell the name of his see
(vi. 20, 22). His account of Cyprian too is meagre in the extreme (vi. 43, vii.
3), though Cyprian was for some years the most conspicuous figure in western
Christendom, and died (AD. 258) not very long before his own birth. He betrays
the same ignorance also with regard to the bishops of Rome. His dates here,
strangely enough, are widest of the mark in the latter half of the 3rd century,
close upon his own time. Thus he assigns to Xystus II. (d. AD. 258) eleven years
(vii. 27) instead of eleven months ; to Eutychianus (d. AD. 283) ten months
(vii. 32) instead of nearly nine years; to Gaius, whom he calls his own
contemporary, and who died long-after he had arrived at manhood (AD. 296),
"about fifteen years" (vii. 32) instead of twelve. He seems to have had a
corrupt list, and he did not possess the knowledge necessary to correct it.  With
the Latin language indeed he appears to have had no thorough acquaintance,
though he sometimes ventured to translate Latin documents (iv. 8, 9; comp.
viii. 17). But he must not be held responsible for the blunders in the versions
of others, e.g. of Tertullian's Apoloqeticum. Whether the translations of
state documents in the later books are his own or not does not appear. But as Constantine
was in the habit of employing persons to translate his state papers, speeches,
&amp;c., from Latin into Greek (<i>V.C</i>.
iv. 32), we may suppose that Eusebius generally availed himself of such
official or semiofficial versions. See on this subject Heinichen's note on <i> H.E</i>. iv. 8.</p>

<p>2. Under the second
head the most vital question is the sincerity of Eusebius. Did he tamper with
his materials or not ? The sarcasm of Gibbon (<i>Decline and Fall</i>, c. xvi) is
well known: "The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians, Eusebius himself,
indirectly confesses that he has related whatever might redound to the glory,
and that he has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace of religion.
Such an acknowledgment will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has
so openly violated one of the fundamental laws of history, has not paid a very
strict regard to the observance of the other." The passages to which he refers
(<i>H. E</i>. viii. 2; <i>Mart. Pal. </i>12) do not bear out this imputation. There is no
indirectness about them, but on the contrary they deplore, in the most emphatic
terms, the evils which disgraced the church, and they represent the persecution
under Diocletian as a just retribution for these wrongdoings. The ambitions,
the intriguing for office, the factious quarrels, the cowardly denials and
shipwrecks of the faith,&mdash;"evil piled upon evil" (<i><font face="SPIonic">kaka_
kakoi~j e0piteixi/zontej</font></i>)&mdash;are denounced
in no measured language. But the writer contents himself with condemning these
sins and shortcomings of Christians in general terms, without entering into
details, and declares his intention of confining himself to such topics as may
be profitable (<i><font face="SPIonic">pro_j w)felei/aj</font></i>) to
his own and future generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p> This treatment may be regarded as too great a sacrifice to
edification. It may discredit his conception of history; but it leaves no
imputation on his honesty. Nor again can the <i>special </i>charges against his honour as a
narrator be sustained.
There is no ground whatever for the surmise that Eusebius forged or interpolated
the passage from Josephus relating to our Lord quoted in <i>H. E. </i>i<b> </b>11, though
Heinichen (iii. p. 623 sq., Melet. ii.) is disposed to entertain the charge.
Inasmuch as this passage is contained in all our extant MSS, and there is
sufficient evidence that other interpolations (though not this) were
introduced into the text of Josephus long before his time (see Orig. <i>c. Cels. </i>i. 47, Delarue's note), no suspicion
can justly . attach to Eusebius himself. Another interpolation in the Jewish
historian, which he quotes elsewhere (ii. 23), was certainly known to Origen (<i>l.
c.</i>)<i>. </i>Doubtless also the omission of
the owl in the account of Herod Agrippa's death <i>(H. E. </i>ii. 10) was already in some texts of Josephus
(<i>Ant. </i>xix. 8, 2). The manner in which
Eusebius deals with his very numerous quotations elsewhere, where we can test
his honesty, is a sufficient vindication against this unjust charge.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Moreover, Eusebius is generally careful not
only to collect the best evidence accessible, but also to distinguish between
different kinds of evidence. "Almost every page witnesses to the zeal with
which he collected testimonies from writers who lived at the time of the events
which he describes. For the sixth and seventh books he evidently rejoices to
be able to use for the foundation of his narrative the contemporary letters of
Dionysius; 'Dionysius, our great bishop of Alexandria,' he writes, 'will again
help me by his own words in the composition of my seventh book of the history,
since he relates in order the events of his own time in the letters which he
has left' (vii. praef.) . . . In
accordance with this instinctive desire for original testimony, Eusebius
scrupulously distinguishes facts which rest on documentary from those which
rest on oral evidence. Some things he relates on the authority of a 'general'
(iii. 11, 36) or 'old report' (iii. 19, 20) or from tradition (i. 7, . 9, vi.
2, &amp;c.). In the lists of successions he is careful to notice where written
records failed him. 'I could not,' he says, <i>'
</i>by any means find the chronology of the bishops of Jerusalem preserved in
writing; thus much only I received from written sources, that there were
fifteen bishops in succession up to the date of the siege under Hadrian,
&amp;c.' (iv. 5)." [W.]&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing like hearing the actual words" of the
writer, he says again and again (i. 23, iii. 32, vii. 23; comp. iv. 23), when
introducing a quotation.</p>

<p>The general sincerity and good faith of the historian
seem therefore to be assured. But his intellectual qualifications for his task
were in many respects defective. His credulity indeed has frequently been much
exaggerated. "Undoubtedly he relates many incidents which may seemto us
incredible, but, when he does so, he gives the evidence on which they are
recommended
to him. At one time it is the express testimony of some well-known writer, at
another a general belief, at another an old tradition, at another his own
observation (v. 7, vi. 9, vii. 17, 18)" [W.]. The most remarkable passage
bearing
on the question is one in which he recounts his own experience during the last
persecution in Palestine <i>(Mart. Pal. </i>9).
"There can be no doubt about the occurrence which Eusebius here describes, and
it does not appear that he can be reproached for adding the interpretation
which his countrymen placed upon it. What he vouches for we can accept as truth
; what he records as a popular comment leaves his historical veracity and
judgment unimpaired." Gibbon (c. xvi) describes the character of Eusebius as
"less tinctured with credulity, and more practised in the arts of courts, than
that of almost any of his contemporaries."</p>

<p>A far more serious drawback to his value as a
historian is the loose and uncritical spirit in which he sometimes deals with
his materials. This shews itself in diverse ways. (a) He is not always to be
trusted in his discrimination of genuine and spurious documents. ...</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; It is not the <i>substitution </i>of an angel for an owl, as the case is not uncommonly
stated. The result is produced mainly by the <i>omission </i>of some words in the text of Josephus, which runs thus:
<i><font face="SPIonic">'Anaku&amp;yaj d'oun met'&nbsp; o0li/gou </font></i>[<i><font face="SPIonic">to_n
boubw~na</font></i>]<i><font face="SPIonic"> th~j e9autou~ kefalh~j
u9perkaqezo&amp;menon ei]den </font></i>[<i><font face="SPIonic">e\pi\ sxoini/ou
tino&amp;j</font></i>],<font face="SPIonic"><i> a2ggelo&amp;n </i></font>[<font face="SPIonic"><i>te</i></font>]<font face="SPIonic"><i>
tou~ton eu0qu_j e0no&amp;hse kakw~n ei]nai</i></font>,<i><font face="SPIonic">
to_n kai/ pote tw~n a0gaqw~n geno&amp;menon</font></i>.&nbsp; The words
bracketted are omitted and <font face="SPIonic">ai2tion</font> is added after <font face="SPIonic">ei]nai</font>,
so that the sentence runs,<i> <font face="SPIonic">ei]den a2ggelou tou~ton
eu0qu_j e0no&amp;hse kakw~n ei]nai ai2tion k. t. l.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> This
being so, I do not feel at all sure that the change (by whomsoever made) was
dictated by any disingenuous motive.&nbsp; A scribe, unacquainted with Latin,
would stumble over <font face="SPIonic"><i>to_n boubw~na</i></font> which had a
wholly different meaning and seems never to be used of an owl in Greek; and he
would alter the text in order to extract some sense out of it.&nbsp; In the
previous mention of the bird (<i>Ant.</i> xviii. 6. 7), Josephus or his
translator gives it as a Latin name, <i><font face="SPIonic">boubw~na de_ oi9
9Rwmai~oi to_n o2rnin tou~ton kalou~si</font></i>.&nbsp; M&ouml;ller (quoted by
Bright, p. xlv) calls this&nbsp; "the one case" in which, so far as he
recollects, "a
sinceritatis via paululum deflexit noster"; and even here the indictment cannot
be made good. The severe strictures therefore against Eusebius made, <i>e.g</i>. by Alford
on Acts xii. 21, are altogether unjustifiable.</p>

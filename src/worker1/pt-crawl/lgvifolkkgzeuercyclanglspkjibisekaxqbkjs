<h3>Passage Illustrated</h3>

<p class="lq">In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and 
made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one 
vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and loveable. In came 
the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women 
employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the 
cook, with her brother's particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the 
way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself 
behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her 
Mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, 
some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away 
they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down 
the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old 
top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as 
soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them. When 
this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried 
out, "Well done!" and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially 
provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began 
again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, 
exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or 
perish.</p>

<p class="lq">There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there 
was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a 
great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great 
effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, 
mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) 
struck up "Sir Roger de Coverley." Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. 
Fezziwig. Top couple too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four 
and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who
<em>would</em> dance, and had no notion of walking.</p>

<p class="lq">But if they had been twice as many — ah, four times — old 
Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs Fezziwig. As to her, she was 
worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me 
higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They s
hone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given 
time, what would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs Fezziwig had 
gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and 
curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig "cut" — 
cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again 
without a stagger. ["Stave Two: The First of the Spirits," pp. 59-62]</p>

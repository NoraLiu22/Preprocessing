/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

          <br />
        </li><li>In its January 1882 issue, a magazine called <i>The Herefordian</i> 
          (Hereford, England) regretted to &quot;announce the death, early in 
          the last year, of a distinguished Old Herefordian, Alfred R. Wallace, 
          F.L.S., the naturalist . . . The Queen has granted a pension of 200 
          pounds a year to his widow.&quot; Where they got this idea is unclear, 
          but it brings to mind the famous quote by Mark Twain: &quot;Rumors of 
          my death have been exaggerated . . .&quot;<br />
          <br />
        </li><li>Jim Mallet at University College London has put up a page titled <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/leicester/leicesterbateswallace.html" target="_top">&quot;A 
          Walk Through Bates' and Wallace's Leicester&quot;</a> that gives some 
          idea of what the Leicester School might have looked like when Wallace 
          taught there in 1844-1845.<br />
          <br />

        </li><li>A correspondent came across a copy of a book a few years ago that 
          had a rather strange cover: see if you recognize anything wrong with 
          <a href="darwal.htm">this picture</a>. Apparently somebody goofed; when 
          the publisher discovered their error, the early copies of the book were 
          recalled.<br />
          <br />
        </li><li>According to S. Kanto, a Japanese writer, the character Stapleton 
          in the Sherlock Holmes story <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> is 
          modelled on Wallace and his friend Bates, both of whom are also mentioned 
          in Conan Doyle's <i>The Lost World</i>.<br />

        <li><font size="-1">Apart from all the species of animals and plants
            that have been named after him, Wallace has also been honored by
            having his name attached to some other things. To begin with there
            is, of course, 'Wallace's Line' (discussed elsewhere on this site),
            plus the derivative term 'Wallacea' (which names the transitional
            zone between the Australian and Oriental zoogeographical regions).
            'Wallace's realms' are the world's six basic zoogeographical regions.
            The 'Wallace Effect' (see Mayr 1959, Grant 1966, and Sawyer &amp; Hartl
            1981 in the &quot;Writings
          on Wallace&quot; section) 
          concerns the relation of reproductive isolation to the production of
           sterile hybrids (and ultimately to the speciation process). More recently
           there has been the <a href="http://www.opwall.com/" target="_top">'Operation
            Wallacea,'</a> established in 2000 &quot;to support activities that could
             directly contribute towards the conservation of biodiversity in
            the  Wallacea region of eastern Indonesia&quot;.   In a paper published in 2005,
        it was suggested that the main macroevolutionary patterns associated
        with venemous snake mimicry be referred to as the 'Savage-Wallace Effects'
        (see Greene &amp; McDiarmid 2005 in the &quot;Writings on Wallace&quot; 
          section here). In 2009 the Dairy Farm Nature Park opened in Singapore;
          it contains the 'Wallace Trail' and the Wallace Education Centre, both
          named after ARW. A recently commonly-heard term is the 'Wallacean shortfall,' concerning incomplete knowledge of species distributions. <br />
        <br />
        The Darwin-Wallace Medal of the Linnean Society is a famous award that
        has been given out in 1908, 1958, and most recently in 2008 to prominent
        researchers in the field of evolutionary biology. Since 2004/05 the Royal
        Entomological Society has given out an 'Alfred Russel Wallace Award'
        annually to researchers who have done outstanding research in the field
        of entomology. In early 2005 the first 'Alfred Russel Wallace Award'
        was given out by the International Biogeography Society (IBS) at its
        second biennial meeting; the award is given every two years for individual
        lifetime achievement in the field of biogeography.<br />
        <br />
In addition I am aware of the following: (1) the 26 km meteor crater 
            on the Moon named 'Wallace' in 1935 is found in the Mare Imbrium
lava  plain (there is also a 159 km Martian crater 'Wallace,' named in 1973)
 (2) the 'Wallace Aviary' is an open-air facility at the Bristol Zoo 
            Gardens in Clifton, Bristol, U.K. (3) the 'Wallace Lecture Theatre'
 can be found in the Department of Earth Sciences at Cardiff University 
            in Wales (4) the 'Wallace Garden,' dedicated to genetics and evolution
 education, is a feature of the National Botanic Garden of Wales, located 
            near Carmarthen in southwest Wales (5) the 'Alfred Russel Wallace
 Award' is a biological honor society award given at Kansas Wesleyan 
            University in Salina (where Wallace gave a lecture in 1887) 
(6) the pen name 'Russ Wallace' (i.e., the cartoonist Scott Henson) is derived
 from Wallace's name (7) the 'A. R. Wallace Prize' is a Dept. of Biological
 Sciences award given at Monash University in Australia (8) the 'Wallace 
            Prize' is awarded annually by the Board of Undergraduate Studies
at  the National University of Singapore to assist the recipient in the 
            purchase of books (9) reputedly, the 'Wallace Trench' is the name
 of an oceanic trench in the Indonesia area (an alternate name for 
            the Java Trench?) (10) 'Mt. Wallace' (13,377 ft.), named by Theodore
 S. Solomons in 1895, is one of the 'Evolution Group' peaks of the 
            Sierra Nevada in California (11) the 'Alfred Russel Wallace Award
 in Resource Ecology' is given out for the year's best M.Sc. thesis 
            at Wageningen University in The Netherlands (12) the 'Wallace-Weismann
 hypothesis' is a name sometimes given to the idea that death in individual 
            organisms is programmed, representing an adaptive strategy (13) there is an 
'Alfred Russel Wallace Building' at Glamorgan University, Wales. 
          <p>Dr. George Beccaloni of the Natural History Museum in London sent
             me (2/1/01) a list of some further items: (1) a medical center in
             Broadstone, Dorset, is named 'Wallace House'; (2) the road leading
             to the former site of Wallace's house 'Old Orchard' in Broadstone
             is called 'Wallace Road'; (3) the lower block of apartments built
             on the former site of 'Old Orchard' is known as 'Wallace Court';
            (4)  the Richard Hale School (formerly the Hertford Grammar School)
            in  Hertford has had a house or division called 'Wallace House' since
             1928; (5) Bournemouth University in Bournemouth has a 'Wallace Lecture
             Theatre'; (6) the Bournemouth Natural Sciences Society (of which
            Wallace  may have been President at one time) has a 'Wallace Room';
            (7) 'Project  Wallace' was organized in 1985 by the Royal Entomological
            Society  of London and the Indonesian Department of Science to undertake
            a  year-long study of the Dumoga-Bone area of northern Sulawesi in
            Indonesia;  and (8) a house at 11 St. Andrew's Street in Hertford
            in which Wallace  may have lived for a time is now called the 'Wallace
            House.' There  is a circular concrete plaque over its door which
            reads: &quot;In this 
              house lived Alfred Russel Wallace OM. LLD. DCL. FRS. FLS. Born
            1823--Died  1913. Naturalist, Author, Scientist. Educated at Hertford
            Grammar  School.&quot;</p>
          </font> 
        </li><li><font size="-1">According to Gardiner (2000), the house Wallace built 
          at Grays (&quot;The Dell&quot;) in 1871-72 was made on his request largely 
          of concrete, one of the first such structures built in the U. K.<br />
          <br />
          </font> 
        </li><li><font size="-1">In 1846 Wallace and his brother John designed and 
          built a two-story stone structure in Neath, Wales, that for many years 
          served as the Mechanic's Institute there. The building was eventually 
          converted for use as a library and despite experiencing a severe fire 
          in 1903 still stands (complete with memorial plaque to its creator).<br />
          <br />
          </font> 
        </li><li><font size="-1">In 1996 Wallace became the seventh person whose name 
          is enshrined at the Monument to Human Spiritual Rights at the Red Rock 
          Consecrated Sanctuary in Nevada. Earlier enshrinees were Mohandas Gandhi, 
          Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Kahlil Gibran, Nikola Tesla, Gustaf Stromberg, 
          and Carl Jung; since that time the names of Thomas Jefferson, Martin 
          Luther King Jr., and Ralph Waldo Emerson have been added.<br />
          <br />
          </font> 
        </li><li><font size="-1">Considering how Wallace has for many years been known 
          mainly as &quot;the other man&quot; in the development of the theory of natural 
          selection, it should come as little surprise that he shares the date 
          of his birthday, 8 January, with none other than Elvis Presley . . .<br />
          <br />
          </font> 
        </li><li><font size="-1">And speaking of birthdays . . . Until he noticed the 
          error rather late in life, Wallace had always thought that the date 
          of his birth was 8 January 1822 (instead of the actual date, 8 January 
          1823). Some early biographical sources in fact cite the older date.<br />
          <br />
          </font> 
        </li><li><font size="-1">Apart from gardening (which he and his wife indulged 
          in practically daily), Wallace's favorite recreations were playing chess 
          and, of course, reading.<br />
          <br />
          </font> 
        </li><li><font size="-1">A correspondent has mentioned that Sir Arthur Conan 
          Doyle (who lived until 1930), a strong believer in and supporter of 
          Spiritualism, claimed that &quot;an invisible and friendly presence&quot; often 
          provided him with wise advice. Doyle apparently felt that this &quot;presence&quot; 
          was the ghost of Wallace, a man he had much admired. Wallace was an 
          avid reader of novels--perhaps his spirit helped Doyle out with some 
          plot lines late in the creator of Sherlock Holmes' life . . .<br />

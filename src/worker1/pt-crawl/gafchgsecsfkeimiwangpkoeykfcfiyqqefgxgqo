<A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.1">1</A> Accordingly, after refreshing his forces here, he set out and marched for seven days through Carmania in a revelling rout. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.2">2</A> He himself was conveyed slowly along by eight horses, while he feasted day and night continuously with his companions on a dais built upon a lofty and conspicuous scaffolding of oblong shape; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.3">3</A> and waggons without number followed, some with purple and embroidered canopies, others protected from the sun by boughs of trees which were kept fresh and green, conveying the rest of his friends and commanders, who were all garlanded and drinking. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.4">4</A> Not a shield was to be seen, not a helmet, not a spear, but along the whole march with cups and <SPAN CLASS="whole">drinking-horns</SPAN> and flagons the soldiers kept dipping wine from huge casks and <SPAN CLASS="whole">mixing-bowls</SPAN> and pledging one another, some as they marched along, others lying down; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.5">5</A> while pipes and flutes, stringed instruments and song, with revelling cries of women, filled every place with abundant music. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.6">6</A> Then, upon this disordered and straggling procession there followed also the sports of bacchanalian license, as though Bacchus himself were present and conducting the revel.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref106" HREF="

In a word, restlessness and a desire for change spread everywhere. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.4">4</A> For even against Antipater, Olympias and Cleopatra had raised a faction, Olympias taking Epirus, and Cleopatra Macedonia. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.5">5</A> When he heard of this, Alexander said that his mother had made the better choice; for the Macedonians would not submit to be reigned over by a woman.

It ran thus: "O man, whosoever thou art and whencesoever thou comest, for I know that thou wilt come, I am Cyrus, and I won for the Persians their empire. Do not, therefore, begrudge me this little earth which covers my body." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.5">5</A> These words, then, deeply affected Alexander, who was reminded of the uncertainty and mutability of life.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref109" HREF="

At this feast, we are told, nine thousand guests reclined at supper, to each of whom a golden cup for the libations was given. All the other appointments too, were amazingly splendid, and the host paid himself the debts which his guests owed, the whole outlay amounting to nine thousand

In front of Maecenê, on one side, lies the desert of the Arabians; and on another side lie the marshes opposite the Chaldaeans, which are formed by diversions of water from the Euphrates; and another side lies the Persian Sea. The country has foul air, is misty, and is subject both to rains and to scorching heat; but still its products are excellent. The vine grows in the marshes, as

All these cities are ruled by monarchs and are prosperous, being beautifully adorned with both temples and royal palaces. And the houses are like those of the Aegyptians in respect to the manner in which the timbers are joined together. The four jurisdictions cover more territory than the Aegyptian Delta; and no son of a king succeeds to the throne of his father, but the son of some notable man who is born first after the appointment of the king; for at the same time that some one is appointed to the throne, they register the pregnant wives of their notable men and place guards over them; and by law the wife's son who is born first is adopted and reared in a royal manner as future successor to the throne.

Then to another city, Arsinoê. Then to springs of hot water, salty and bitter, which flow down a high rock and empty into the sea. Near by, in a plain, is a mountain that is red as ruddle. Then one comes to Myus Harbour, which is also called Aphrodite's Harbour; it is a large harbour with a winding entrance, off which lie three islands; two of these are densely shaded with olive trees, while

Topaz is a transparent stone that sparkles with a golden lustre — so dimly in the day-time, however, that one cannot easily see it (for it is outshone by the rays of the sun), but those who collect it see it at night, place a vessel over it as a sign and dig it up in the day-time. There was an organisation of people who were appointed by the kings of Aegypt to keep guard over this stone and the collecting of it; and this organisation was supplied by them with provisions.

After saying all this about the Troglodytes and the neighbouring Aethiopians, Artemidorus returns to the Arabians; and first, beginning at Poseidium, he describes Arabians who border on the Arabian Gulf and live opposite the Troglodytes. <A NAME="4.18.2"></A>He says that Poseidium lies farther in than the Aelanites Gulf; and that contiguous to Poseidium there is a grove of palm trees, which is well supplied with water and is highly valued because all the country around is hot and waterless and shadeless; and that here the fertility of the palms is wonderful; and that a man and a woman have charge of the grove, being appointed to that charge through hereditary right. <A NAME="4.18.3"></A>They wear skins, and live on dates from the palm trees; but on account of the number of wild beasts they build huts in trees and sleep there. <A NAME="4.18.4"></A>Then, next, one comes to the Island of Phocae,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref201" HREF="

<A ID="p343"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p343 </SPAN></A>to the Palaestine country, whither Minaeans and Gerrhaeans and all the neighbouring peoples convey their loads of aromatics. <A NAME="4.18.6"></A>Then one comes to another coast, which was formerly called the coast of the Maranitae, some of whom were farmers and others tent-dwellers, but is now called the coast of the Garindaeans, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T777a">777</A> who destroyed the Maranitae by treachery; for the Garindaeans attacked them while they were celebrating some quadrennial festival, and not only destroyed all the people at the festival but also overran and exterminated the rest of the tribe. <A NAME="4.18.7"></A>Then to the Aelanites Gulf, and to Nabataea, a country with a large population and well supplied with pasturage. <A NAME="4.18.8"></A>They also dwell on islands situated off the coast near by; and these Nabataeans formerly lived a peaceful life, but later, by means of rafts, went to plundering the vessels of people sailing from Aegypt. <A NAME="4.18.9"></A>But they paid the penalty when a fleet went over and sacked their country. <A NAME="4.18.10"></A>One comes next to a plain which is well supplied with trees and water and is full of all kinds of domestic animals — mules among others; and it has a multitude of wild camels, deer, and gazelles, as also numerous lions, leopards, and wolves.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref202" HREF="

<A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T780a">780</A> Many of the special characteristics of Arabia have been disclosed by the recent expedition of the Romans against the Arabians, which was made in my own time under Aelius Gallus as commander. <A NAME="4.22.2"></A>He was sent by Augustus Caesar to explore the tribes and the places, not only in Arabia, but also in Aethiopia, since Caesar saw that the Troglodyte country which adjoins Aegypt neighbours upon Arabia, and also that the Arabian Gulf, which


<A ID="p355"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p355 </SPAN></A>separates the Arabians from the Troglodytes, is extremely narrow. <A NAME="4.22.3"></A>Accordingly he conceived the purpose of winning the Arabians over to himself or of subjugating them. <A NAME="4.22.4"></A>Another consideration was the report, which had prevailed from all time, that they were very wealthy, and that they sold aromatics and the most valuable stones for gold and silver, but never expended with outsiders any part of what they received in exchange; for he expected either to deal with wealthy friends or to master wealthy enemies. <A NAME="4.22.5"></A>He was encouraged also by the expectation of assistance from the Nabataeans, since they were friendly and promised to co-operate with him in every way.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.23">23</A>
Upon these considerations, therefore, Gallus set out on the expedition; but he was deceived by the Nabataean Administrator, Syllaeus, who, although he had promised to be guide on the march and to supply all needs and to co-operate with him, acted treacherously in all things, and pointed out neither a safe voyage along the coast nor a safe journey by land, misguiding him through places that had no roads and by circuitous routes and through regions destitute of everything, or along rocky shores that had no harbours or through waters that were shallow or full of submarine rocks; and particularly in places of that kind the flood-tides, as also the ebb-tides, caused very great distress. <A NAME="4.23.2"></A>Now this was the first mistake of Gallus, to build long boats, since there was no naval war at hand, or even to be expected; for the Arabians are not very good warriors even on land, rather being hucksters and merchants, to say nothing of fighting at sea. <A NAME="4.23.3"></A>But Gallus built not less than eighty boats, biremes and


<A ID="p357"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p357 </SPAN></A>triremes and light boats, at Cleopatris,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref208" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

	<P CLASS="justify">

This came to pass because Obodas, the king, did not care much about public affairs, and particularly military affairs (this is a trait common to all the Arabian kings), and because he put everything in the power of Syllaeus; and because Syllaeus treacherously out-generalled Gallus in every way, and sought, as I think, to spy out the country and, along with the Romans, to destroy some of its cities and tribes, and then to establish himself lord of all, after the Romans were wiped out by hunger and fatigue and diseases and any other evils which he had treacherously contrived for them. <A NAME="4.24.2"></A>However, Gallus put in at Leucê Comê, his army now being


<A ID="p359"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p359 </SPAN></A>sorely tried both with scurvy and with lameness in the leg, which are native ailments, the former disclosing a kind of paralysis round the mouth and the latter around the legs, both being the result of the native water and herbs. <A NAME="4.24.3"></A>At all events, he was forced to spend both the summer and the winter there, waiting for the sick to recover. <A NAME="4.24.4"></A>Now the loads of aromatics are conveyed from Leucê Comê to Petra, and thence to Rhinocolura, which is in Phoenicia near Aegypt, and thence to the other peoples; but at the present time they are for the most part transported by the Nile to Alexandria; and they are landed from Arabia and India at Myus Harbour; and then they are conveyed by camels over to Coptus in Thebaïs, which is situated on a canal of the Nile, and then to Alexandria. <A NAME="4.24.5"></A>Again Gallus moved his army from Leucê Comê and marched through regions of such a kind that water had to be carried by camels, because of the baseness of the guides; and therefore it took many days to arrive at the land of Aretas, a kinsman of Obodas. <A NAME="4.24.6"></A>Now Aretas received him in a friendly way and offered him gifts, but the treason of Syllaeus made difficult the journey through that country too; at any rate, it took thirty days to traverse the country, which afforded only zeia,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref211" HREF="

<A ID="p363"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p363 </SPAN></A>for on the ninth day he arrived at Negrana, where the battle had taken place, and thence on the eleventh day at Hepta Phreata, as the place is called, from the fact that it has seven wells; and thence, at last, marching through a peaceable country, he arrived at a village called Chaalla, and again at another village called Malotha, which is situated near a river; and then through a desert country, which had only a few watering-places, as far as a village called Egra. <A NAME="4.24.12"></A>The village is in the territory of Obodas; and it is situated on the sea. <A NAME="4.24.13"></A>On his return he accomplished the whole journey within sixty days, although he had used up six months in his first journey. <A NAME="4.24.14"></A>Thence he carried his army across the Myus Harbour within eleven days, and marched by land over to Coptus, and, with all who had been fortunate enough to survive, landed at Alexandria. <A NAME="4.24.15"></A>The rest he had lost, not in wars, but from sickness and fatigue and hunger and bad roads; for only seven men perished in war. <A NAME="4.24.6"></A>For these reasons, also this expedition did not profit us to a great extent in our knowledge of those regions, but still it made a slight contribution. <A NAME="4.24.17"></A>But the man who was responsible for this failure, I mean Syllaeus, paid the penalty at Rome, since, although he pretend friendship, he was convicted, in addition to his rascality in this matter, of other offences too, and was beheaded.

<A ID="p369"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p369 </SPAN></A>each time using a different golden cup. <A NAME="4.26.5"></A>The king is so democratic that, in addition to serving himself, he sometimes even serves the rest himself in his turn. <A NAME="4.26.6"></A>He often renders an account of his kingship in the popular assembly; and sometimes his mode of life is examined. <A NAME="4.26.7"></A>Their homes, through the use of stone, are costly; but, on account of peace, the cities are not walled. <A NAME="4.26.8"></A>Most of the country is well supplied with fruits except the olive; they use sesame-oil instead. <A NAME="4.26.9"></A>The sheep are white-fleeced and the oxen are large, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T784a">784</A> but the country produces no horses. <A NAME="4.26.10"></A>Camels afford the service they require instead of horses. <A NAME="4.26.11"></A>They go out without tunics, with girdles about their loins, and with slippers on their feet — even the kings, though in their case the colour is purple. <A NAME="4.26.12"></A>Some things are imported wholly from other countries, but others not altogether so, especially in the case of those that are native products, as, for example, gold and silver and most of the aromatics, whereas brass and iron, as also purple garb, styrax, crocus, costaria, embossed works, paintings, and moulded works are not produced in their country. <A NAME="4.26.13"></A>They have the same regard for the dead as for dung, as Heracleitus says: "Dead bodies more fit to be cast out than dung"; and therefore they bury even their kings beside dung-heaps. <A NAME="4.26.14"></A>They worship the sun, building an altar on the top of the house, and pouring libations on it daily and burning frankincense.

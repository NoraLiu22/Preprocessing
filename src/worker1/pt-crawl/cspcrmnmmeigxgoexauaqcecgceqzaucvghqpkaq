ARLINGTON, Texas -- In front of a sold-out crowd of 6,251 at UT Arlington's College Park Center, 2024 No. 1 WNBA pick         Caitlin Clark made her unofficial professional debut Friday evening, scoring 21 points in the         Fever's narrow         79-76 defeat at the hands of the         Dallas Wings.

The NCAA's all-time leading scorer scored 11 of Indiana's first 19 points before finishing with 16 in the first half, highlighted by a stepback 3-pointer against veteran         Natasha Howard. She went scoreless in the third quarter and sat on the bench for much of the frame after picking up her third and fourth fouls in quick succession.

Upon re-entering the game in the fourth, Clark hit another 3-pointer, her fifth of the night and found Aliyah Boston for an assist on the pick-and-roll. A &quot;welcome to the WNBA&quot; moment came with the game tied and less than 30 seconds to play when Howard blocked Clark's layup attempt with the shot clock dwindling.

ORLANDO, Fla. -- The         Orlando Magic huddled up four minutes into the third quarter of Game 6 against the         Cleveland Cavaliers.

Coach Jamahl Mosley called a timeout amid a 13-4 Cavaliers run that propelled Cleveland from down four at halftime to up seven. His message to his young team was simple: &quot;Stay the course. This is a long game. We have to understand it's a game of runs.&quot;

It was still a five-point game heading into the fourth quarter, but the Magic took the lead within the first two minutes.&nbsp;         Paolo Banchero scored 10 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter as the Magic overcame a 50-point performance from&nbsp;         Donovan Mitchell&nbsp;to hold off the Cavs 103-96 and force a Game 7 on Sunday in Cleveland.


Franz Wagner finished with 26 points while&nbsp;         Jalen Suggs had 22 points and six 3-pointers.&nbsp;

PITTSBURGH --         Ryan McMahon homered into the Allegheny River,         Cal Quantrill pitched into the eighth inning and the         Colorado Rockies finally held onto a lead during a 3-2 win over the struggling         Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night.

Colorado trailed in each of its first 31 games this season, a modern-era record. But not this time.

&quot;I'll sleep a little better because I haven't been sleeping well at all,&quot; Rockies manager Bud Black said with a laugh after he was reminded that the streak was over. &quot;Really, it's been awful.&quot;

McMahon put the Rockies in front when he opened the sixth inning with a drive over the right-field stands against         Mart&iacute;n P&eacute;rez for his fifth homer. The ball splashed into the Allegheny 445 feet from home plate, the 71st time a home run has reached the water since PNC Park opened in 2001.

The 21-year-old All-Star forward scored 10 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter Friday night, helping one of the NBA's youngest teams overcome         Donovan Mitchell's 50 points and hold off the         Cleveland Cavaliers 103-96 to force a decisive Game 7 in their first-round playoff series.

Three nights after scoring a career postseason-best 39 on 14-of-24 shooting in a one-point road loss that left the Magic on the brink of elimination, Banchero put his team on his back and carried them to their biggest win in years.

Franz Wagner had 26 points and         Jalen Suggs made six 3-pointers and finished with 22 for the Magic, who pulled away in the closing minutes, with Banchero hitting a 3-pointer that put Orlando ahead for good at 92-89.

Kris Kim, a 16-year-old English amateur playing on a sponsor exemption at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, became the youngest player in 11 years to make the cut in a PGA Tour event.

Kim finished his second round Friday with a birdie for a 4-under 67. At 7-under 135, he was among 66 players who made the cut, which was 6 under.         Jake Knapp was the leader at 14-under 128.

Guan Tianlang was 14 when he made the cut at both the Masters and Zurich Classic of New Orleans in 2013, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.

At 16 years, 7 months old, Kim is the fifth-youngest player ever to make a PGA Tour cut, according to the Tour. His feat also comes just two weeks after Miles Russell, 15, became the youngest to make the cut in the 35-year history of the Korn Ferry Tour.

The         San Diego Padres are nearing a deal to acquire second baseman         Luis Arraez from the         Miami Marlins for reliever Woo-Suk Go and prospects Dillon Head, Jakob Marsee, and Nathan Martorella, a source told ESPN's Jeff Passan on Friday night.

The trade is pending medical review but is expected to be finalized soon.

The transaction represents the first significant move for the Marlins since Peter Bendix took over as the team's president of baseball operations in November after Kim Ng departed. It marks the beginning of the Marlins' teardown of an underachieving roster that has produced the third-worst record in the majors at 9-25 with a minus-61 run differential after reaching the postseason in 2023.


On the other side, it's another aggressive deal for A.J. Preller, the leader of the Padres' front office since 2014.

Artur Beterbiev suffered a ruptured meniscus and his undisputed light heavyweight championship fight vs. Dmitry Bivol on June 1 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has been postponed, it was announced Friday.

Turki Alalshikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, told ESPN a replacement opponent is being sought for Bivol on the June 1 card.

Beterbiev (20-0, 20 KOs) will undergo knee surgery and is expected to be sidelined until at least September, sources said. The hope is for Beterbiev-Bivol to be rescheduled later this year.


Alalshikh announced that the stacked undercard that features five boxers promoted by Matchroom vs. five Queensberry fighters will proceed June 1 as planned.

The series of fights is highlighted by a bout between former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder vs. Zhilei Zhang. Both boxers are coming off losses to Joseph Parker.

The NBA sent invites to 78 players -- including projected lottery picks Zaccharie Risacher, Alex Sarr and         Donovan Clingan, as well as USC's         Bronny James -- to the 2024 NBA draft combine, which will be held May 12-19 at Wintrust Arena in Chicago.

For the first time, all invited players will be required to attend and participate in the event or will be ineligible to be drafted, as part of an agreement the National Basketball Players Association reached with the league in the most recent collective bargaining agreement.

Participation will include medical examinations, sharing of medical history, biomechanical and functional movement testing, as well as strength and agility testing, performance testing and anthropometric measurements.

The         LA Clippers are planning to pursue a contract extension with coach Tyronn Lue that will allow him to avoid entering the final year of his deal in 2025-26, sources told ESPN on Friday.

Lue is expected to be a target in the         Los Angeles Lakers' coaching search and perhaps other looming vacancies.

The Clippers' season ended Friday night with a Game 6 loss to the&nbsp;         Mavericks&nbsp;in Dallas in the teams' Western Conference first-round playoff series. However, that outcome has no bearing on the Clippers' desire to keep Lue as the franchise's long-term coach, sources said. LA was 51-31 and the fourth seed in the Western Conference this season.


The Clippers were without All-NBA forward         Kawhi Leonard for most of the series because of right knee inflammation, but the organization's goal remains to re-sign free agents         Paul George and         James Harden alongside Leonard, sources said.

MILWAUKEE -- Despite trying to push himself to be available to the         Bucks for the playoffs,         Giannis Antetokounmpo acknowledged he was &quot;not close&quot; to returning from his strained left calf, adding he only could run at about 30-40%.

&quot;I tried my best to come back to help my teammates,&quot; Antetokounmpo said Friday, a day after the Bucks dropped their first-round series to the         Indiana Pacers. &quot;It's kind of hard to see them being out there and not being able to help them, but I just couldn't.


&quot;I did all the tests I had to do, these like protocols you have to follow and have to check the boxes. I wasn't even close at checking the boxes.&quot;

Antetokounmpo last played April 9. He ended up missing three weeks with his left calf strain, sitting out the final three regular-season games and the Bucks' six-game postseason.

LOS ANGELES -- The         Los Angeles Lakers fired coach Darvin Ham on Friday after two seasons, and the team now will open a job search in hopes of finding the right person to maximize what figures to be the final chapter of         LeBron James' storied career while returning to championship contention.

Ham, who had two years remaining on his contract, went 90-74 (.549) during the regular season and 9-12 (.429) in the postseason -- which does not include his two play-in tournament wins -- since being hired to replace Frank Vogel in 2022. He also guided the Lakers to the inaugural in-season tournament title in Las Vegas in December.

The decision came just days after the Lakers were eliminated by the         Denver Nuggets for the second straight season, this time in five games in the first round after being swept by Denver in the conference finals a year ago.

Quarterback         Aaron Rodgers will be ready to go when the         New York Jets begin OTA practices on May 20.

The four-time MVP, eight months removed from surgery to repair a torn left Achilles, will have &quot;no restrictions,&quot; according to coach Robert Saleh.

&quot;Once phase three hits, we're not anticipating any restrictions from what we can and can't do with him,&quot; Saleh said Friday at the start of a two-day rookie minicamp.

Phase three, which lasts four weeks and covers 10 practices, is when teams are allowed to do noncontact, 11-on-11 work. That Rodgers will participate shouldn't come as a surprise; he was practicing on a limited basis over the final month of last season. Still, it's noteworthy, considering the severity of his injury.

&quot;The guy can still sling it,&quot; Saleh said. &quot;Obviously, he's still working through his rehab, but there are no issues on the trajectory on which he's going.&quot;

In the aftermath of the Jontay Porter betting scandal, the NBA and its partner sportsbooks are discussing changes to betting menus to combat similar occurrences in the future, sources familiar with the talks confirmed to ESPN.

Among the changes that have been discussed is prohibiting betting on players on two-way contracts between the G League and the NBA, sources said. More extreme measures such as not allowing bets on the &quot;under&quot; on a player prop have been considered, sources said, but there are concerns that restricting wager types could push bettors into the unregulated betting market.

The NBA has commercial contracts with sportsbooks such as BetMGM, DraftKings and FanDuel that give the league some influence on what types of wagers are offered.

MIAMI -- The         Dolphins&nbsp;have agreed to terms on a contract with wide receiver         Odell Beckham Jr., a source confirmed to ESPN, adding a veteran presence to a position group looking for a third option.

The source said it's a one-year deal worth $3 million, with incentives that can push its max value to $8.25 million.

Beckham visited with the Dolphins in March, but the sides were unable to reach an agreement then. General manager Chris Grier said before the NFL draft that there was &quot;nothing imminent&quot; on a deal with the three-time Pro Bowler; despite taking two wide receivers in the draft, Grier didn't downplay the possibility of signing Beckham after its conclusion.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- The         Bills continued to add to their wide receiver room after the draft, signing         Chase Claypool to a one-year deal, the team announced Friday morning.

The 6-foot-4, 238-pound receiver brings veteran depth to a receiver room that is being reconstructed after         Stefon Diggs was traded,         Gabe Davis left in free agency, and         Keon Coleman was drafted 33rd overall. Claypool ran a 4.42 40-yard dash at the NFL combine in 2020.

Claypool, 25, has been with three teams over the past two years, most recently with the         Miami Dolphins after the         Chicago Bears traded him in October. Early in the 2023 season, Claypool expressed frustration with how he was being used in the Bears' offense, and he was then inactive for multiple games before being traded to Miami, where he caught four passes in nine games.

He was acquired by the Bears in a trade from the         Pittsburgh Steelers the previous year.

Beverley declined to answer a question about it while speaking to reporters after the game. But he         replied to an X post that showed the video by saying, &quot;Not Fair at all. Exchanged between a fan and our ball club all night. We warned and asked for help all night. Not fair.&quot;

De La Hoya jabbed Alvarez by referencing his positive test for the banned substance clenbuterol ahead of his 2018 rematch with Golovkin.

LOS ANGELES -- The         Chargers agreed to terms with wide receiver         DJ Chark Jr. on Thursday, a source confirmed to ESPN.

NFL Network was first to report the news.

Chark, who has played six seasons in the NFL, brings experience to an unproven Chargers receiving room. Prior to the agreement, the Chargers had no receiver with more than three years in the NFL or a season with over 800 yards.

Chark, at 6-foot-4, 200 pounds, played for the         Carolina Panthers last season, where he had 35 catches for 525 yards and five touchdowns.


Chark's best season came when he played for the         Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019, when he had 73 receptions for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns, all career highs that earned him his first and only Pro Bowl selection.

The Chargers will hope that Chark can regain that form in Los Angeles after they traded wide receiver         Keenan Allen, released wide receiver&nbsp;         Mike Williams&nbsp;and let tight end         Gerald Everett and running...</div><div class="ContentRoll__Date ContentRoll__Date--tabletPlus">May 03</div></div></div></section><section class="ContentRoll__Item"><div class="ContentRoll__TimeStamp"><div class="TimeStamp__Date">May 03</div></div><div class="ContentRoll__Headline"><h2><a class="AnchorLink" tabindex="0" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/charges-cowboys-prescott-alleged-2017-assault/story?id=109899827">No charges for Cowboys&#x27; Prescott for alleged 2017 assault</a></h2><div><div class="ContentRoll__Desc">

Ledecky is a seven-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, taking home at least one gold in each of the past three Olympics. And she will compete at the Paris Olympics this summer.


Her&nbsp;16 individual gold medals at the world championships are the most by any swimmer, man or woman.

Thorpe, who died in 1953, is among a list of recipients that pays special homage to firsts in their field. Thorpe&nbsp;became the first Native American to earn an Olympic gold medal in 1912 when he won the decathlon and pentathlon.

INDIANAPOLIS -- After spending the hours leading up to Game 6 getting around-the-clock treatment on his injured right Achilles,         Milwaukee Bucks star         Damian Lillard said he decided he wouldn't be able to enter the summer without knowing he did all he could to be on the floor.

Lillard returned after missing Games 4 and 5 of the series, but the short-handed Bucks did not have enough against the         Indiana Pacers, dropping Thursday's game         120-98&nbsp;and         losing the series in six games.

&quot;I don't think I would've went into the summer feeling good about much if I felt like I let the team go out there and me not at least try,&quot; said Lillard, who finished with 28 points.

The Bucks could not overcome the loss of         Giannis Antetokounmpo, who missed the entire playoff series because of a left calf strain. He didn't appear in another game after sustaining the injury April 9.

Montgomery was asked if the Bruins needed more from their top skaters to avoid elimination come Saturday in Boston, and he identified Pastrnak in particular as needing to provide more to the group.

&quot;Your best players need to be your best players this time of year,&quot; Montgomery said. &quot;I think the effort is tremendous. They need to come through with some big-time plays in big-time moments. [         Brad] Marchand has done this throughout the series. [Pastrnak] needs to step up.&quot;

Pastrnak has two goals and four points this postseason for a Boston team that once held a 3-1 lead in the series.&nbsp;

LAS VEGAS -- Oscar De La Hoya issued a cease-and-desist letter Thursday to Canelo Alvarez over what he says are &quot;defamatory allegations&quot; that the Golden Boy Promotions founder stole money from former champion Gennadiy Golovkin, among other fighters.

The legal letter, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN, demands that Alvarez issue a retraction and refrain from making further defamatory comments.

The action comes one day after tensions erupted between Alvarez and his former longtime promoter at a news conference ahead of Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championship defense vs. Jaime Munguia on Saturday.


De La Hoya jabbed Alvarez by referencing his positive test for the banned substance clenbuterol ahead of his 2018 rematch with Golovkin. Alvarez countered by warning fighters to &quot;contact your lawyers because he is surely stealing from you. It's the only thing he comes to do in boxing. ...

INDIANAPOLIS --         T.J. McConnell and         Obi Toppin complemented one another's play perfectly Thursday night.

They were still trading fist bumps long after the         Indiana Pacers celebrated a rare series-clinching victory.

Toppin scored 21 points, McConnell added 20 points and nine assists and they led the Pacers to a         120-98 rout over the         Milwaukee Bucks in Game 6, sending them to their first Eastern Conference semifinal in a decade.

&quot;It means a lot,&quot; McConnell said. &quot;Not getting into the playoffs since the bubble, not being able to advance since 2014, we take great pride in being able to advance and extend our season. Milwaukee has a great team and, if I can be honest with you, I think our bench has taken a couple steps back competitive wise and I think tonight all of us went out there with the mentality we're going to take it to another level.&quot;

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The         Chiefs declined Thursday to exercise the fifth-year option for the 2025 season on the contract of wide receiver         Kadarius Toney, a source told ESPN, giving him one more season remaining on the deal he signed with the         New York Giants as a first-round draft pick in 2021.

Toney was traded to the Chiefs the next year.

Both general manager Brett Veach and coach Andy Reid recently indicated Toney was in the Chiefs' plans this season.


&quot;I don't think we ever stopped believing in him,'' Veach said shortly before the draft. &quot;I think people around the building like him. It's the injury bug. Hopefully, he gets some luck on his side and can stay healthy and can be the player that he was at Florida and the player that we've seen in spurts here. I'm just hoping he has a good offseason and has a little luck on his side and can stay healthy.''

Milwaukee Bucks&nbsp;star guard&nbsp;         Damian Lillard&nbsp;is available and will play in Thursday's must-win Game 6 vs. the         Indiana Pacers, while         Giannis Antetokounmpo&nbsp;has been ruled out.

Lillard, who was doing his pregame warmups, earlier had been upgraded from doubtful to questionable as the Eastern Conference first-round series continues in Indianapolis.

Bucks coach Doc Rivers said both players had &quot;great workouts&quot; on Thursday afternoon, prior to Antetokounmpo, the two-time MVP, being ruled out on the official injury report.


Antetokounmpo had previously been listed as doubtful because of the calf injury that has kept him out of the series and off the court since April 9.

Lillard has sat out the past two games with a right Achilles injury. The eight-time All-Star averaged 32.3 points in the first three games of the series for the Bucks, who trail 3-2 in the best-of-seven series.

PITTSBURGH -- The         Steelers are declining the fifth-year option for the 2025 season for running back         Najee Harris&nbsp;on Thursday, a source told ESPN, making him a free agent after the 2024 season.

And as expected, the team also formally declined quarterback         Justin Fields' fifth-year option, sources told ESPN.

The Steelers are not ruling out agreeing to a deal with Harris after this season, however, sources told ESPN.&nbsp;With the new offense being installed, the feeling is the organization wants to see how Harris and the other running backs function in Arthur Smith's offense before making a longer-term commitment to him.

Harris and Fields are the latest Steelers to have their fifth-year options declined by the team. The team also declined options for Jarvis Jones,         Artie Burns,         Terrell Edmunds and         Devin Bush.


T.J. Watt, selected in the 2017 draft, was the last Steelers draft pick to have his fifth-year option picked up by the team.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. --&nbsp;         Inter Miami CF defender Marcelo&nbsp;&quot;Chelo&quot; Weigandt said he expects a difficult match against the         New York Red Bulls on Saturday at Chase Stadium, adding that when         Lionel Messi is on your team, opponents treat each match like it's a final.

&quot;We expect them to play the same intense way. When we have Leo, every team plays against us like it were a final,&quot; Weigandt said. &quot;And we have to play every game like it's a final to try if we want to achieve what we aspire to.

Former         Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher         Julio Urias pleaded no contest Wednesday to a misdemeanor domestic battery charge tied to his September arrest on suspicion of domestic violence.

Urias was placed on 36 months of summary probation and ordered to complete 30 days of community labor as well as a 52-week domestic violence counseling course, a spokesperson for the L.A. City Attorney's Office said. In addition, Urias, 27, must pay a domestic violence fund fee, not possess any weapons, not use any force or violence, pay restitution to the victim and abide by a protective order.

The four         other misdemeanor charges against Urias -- an additional count of domestic battery involving a dating relationship, as well as one count each of spousal battery, false imprisonment and assault -- were dismissed.

Urias was originally         arrested Sept. 3 on suspicion of felony domestic violence for an incident that occurred in the parking lot of BMO Stadium after an LAFC...</div><div class="ContentRoll__Date ContentRoll__Date--tabletPlus">May 02</div></div></div></section><section class="ContentRoll__Item"><div class="ContentRoll__TimeStamp"><div class="TimeStamp__Date">May 02</div></div><div class="ContentRoll__Headline"><h2><a class="AnchorLink" tabindex="0" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/tiger-woods-accepts-special-exemption-play-us-open/story?id=109877561">Tiger Woods accepts special exemption to play in U.S. Open</a></h2><div><div class="ContentRoll__Desc">

Fifteen-time major champion         Tiger Woods has accepted a special exemption to play in next month's U.S. Open at Pinehurst Resort &amp; Country Club in North Carolina, the United States Golf Association announced Thursday.

Woods, a three-time U.S. Open winner, last won the event in 2008. While he has lifetime exemptions into the Masters and PGA Championship and can play in The Open until he's 60 as a former winner of those tournaments, Woods' exemption into the U.S. Open ran out in 2023.

It's the first time Woods hasn't qualified for a major championship since the 1996 PGA Championship, when he was still an amateur.


The 124th U.S. Open will be played on Pinehurst's Course No. 2 on June 13-16.

&quot;The U.S. Open, our national championship, is a truly special event for our game and one that has helped define my career,&quot; Woods said in a statement. &quot;I'm honored to receive this exemption and could not be more excited for the opportunity to compete in this year's U.S. Open, especially at...</div><div class="ContentRoll__Date ContentRoll__Date--tabletPlus">May 02</div></div></div></section><section class="ContentRoll__Item"><div class="ContentRoll__TimeStamp"><div class="TimeStamp__Date">May 02</div></div><div class="ContentRoll__Headline"><h2><a class="AnchorLink" tabindex="0" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/accomplished-player-cbs-golf-analyst-peter-oosterhuis-dies/story?id=109877373">Accomplished player, CBS golf analyst Peter Oosterhuis dies at 75</a></h2><div><div class="ContentRoll__Desc">

Peter Oosterhuis, a six-time Ryder Cup participant who later brought his distinguished British voice to CBS golf telecasts as an analyst, died Thursday, one day shy of his 76th birthday.

&quot;Peter was an integral part of our golf coverage and an incredible teammate for nearly two decades,&quot; CBS Sports said in a statement. &quot;... Peter brought a unique style and distinct perspective to our broadcasts which made him one of the most respected analysts in the sport. Our deepest condolences go out to his wife Ruth Ann and his entire family.&quot;

As a player, Oosterhuis was a force in Ryder Cup play, going 6-2-1 in singles -- twice beating         Arnold Palmer and once         Johnny Miller. His six wins remain tied for the all-time lead in singles.

He also was a two-time runner-up at the Open Championship and a two-time winner of the European Tour money title. He was ranked No. 1 in Europe for four years during a prolific rise to prominence that eventually brought him to the PGA Tour.

The availability of         Milwaukee Bucks stars         Damian Lillard and         Giannis Antetokounmpo for a must-win Game 6 against the         Indiana Pacers will be a game-time decision, coach Doc Rivers said Thursday afternoon.

Lillard, who was doing his pregame warmups, was upgraded from doubtful to questionable earlier Thursday as the Eastern Conference first-round series continues tonight in Indianapolis.

&quot;Giannis is more doubtful than Damian, but both had great workouts today,&quot; Rivers said.


Antetokounmpo, a two-time NBA MVP, was listed as doubtful on the NBA injury report as he deals with the calf injury that has kept him out of the series and off the court since April 9.

Lillard has sat out the past two games with a right Achilles injury. The eight-time All-Star averaged 32.3 points in the first three games of the series for the Bucks, who trail 3-2 in the best-of-seven series.

On Tuesday, Rivers described Lillard and&nbsp;Antetokounmpo as &quot;very, very, very close&quot; to...</div><div class="ContentRoll__Date ContentRoll__Date--tabletPlus">May 02</div></div></div></section><section class="ContentRoll__Item"><div class="ContentRoll__TimeStamp"><div class="TimeStamp__Date">May 02</div></div><div class="ContentRoll__Headline"><h2><a class="AnchorLink" tabindex="0" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/maple-leafs-rule-auston-matthews-game-6-bruins/story?id=109876054">Maple Leafs rule out Auston Matthews for Game 6 vs. Bruins</a></h2><div><div class="ContentRoll__Desc">

TORONTO --         Maple Leafs forward         Auston Matthews has been ruled out for Game 6 of the first-round Stanley Cup playoff series against the         Bruins on Thursday.

The Leafs trail the Bruins 3-2 in the best-of-seven series and face elimination with another loss.

Matthews missed the third period of Game 4 and all of Game 5 with what the Leafs have deemed a &quot;lingering&quot; illness.


Toronto's top center has skated on his own the past three days -- including for nearly 30 minutes prior to the Leafs' morning skate Thursday -- but coach Sheldon Keefe said it would be the team's doctors ultimately making a call on whether Matthews made it into the lineup.

Toronto already extended its series once without Matthews available when they topped Boston 2-1 in overtime of Game 5. The Leafs planned to use a similar blueprint in Game 6 to grind the Bruins down and even the series one last time.

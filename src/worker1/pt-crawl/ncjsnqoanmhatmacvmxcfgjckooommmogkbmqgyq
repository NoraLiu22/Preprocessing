For, as we have stated, she had designs on the kings, in pursuance of which she now induced Antony to entrust the war against the Arabs to Herod, hoping, if he were successful, to become mistress of Arabia, if unsuccessful, of Judaea, and by means of one of the two potentates to overthrow the other. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="366">[366]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.366"> G</A> &nbsp; Her scheme, however, turned to Herod's advantage. For, beginning with raids upon the enemy's territory, he mustered a large body of cavalry, flung them at the foe in the neighbourhood of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dium_(Coele-Syria)">Diospolis</A> and, though he met with a stubborn resistance, defeated them. This defeat occasioned a great commotion among the Arabs, who assembled in vast numbers at Canatha in <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coele-Syria">Coele-Syria</A> and there awaited the Jews. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="367">[367]</A> Herod, arriving with his troops, endeavoured to conduct operations with due caution and ordered the camp to be fortified. His orders, however, were defied by the rank and file, who, flushed with their recent victory, rushed upon the Arabs. With their first charge they routed them and followed at their heels ; but during the pursuit a snare was laid for Herod by Athenion, one of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleopatra.html#7">Cleopatra's</A> generals, who had always been hostile to him, and now let loose upon him the natives of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qanawat">Canatha.</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="368">[368]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.368"> G</A> &nbsp; Encouraged by their allies' attack, the Arabs faced about and, after uniting their forces on rocky and difficult ground, routed Herod's troops with immense slaughter. Those who escaped from the battle took refuge in Ormiza, where, however, the Arabs surrounded and captured their camp with all its defenders. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="369">[369]</A> Shortly after this disaster <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> arrived with reinforcements, too late to be of use. This calamity was brought upon him by the insubordination of the divisional officers ; for, had they not precipitated an engagement, Athenion would have found no opportunity for a ruse. However, Herod subsequently avenged himself on the Arabs by constantly raiding their territory, so that they had frequent occasion to rue their single victory. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="370">[370]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.370"> G</A> &nbsp; But while he was punishing his foes, he was visited by another calamity - an act of God which occurred in the seventh year of his reign, when the war of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium">Actium</A> was at its height. In the early spring an earthquake destroyed innumerable cattle and thirty thousand souls; but the army, being quartered in the open, escaped injury. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="371">[371]</A> At the same moment the confidence of the Arabs rose, stimulated by rumour which always exaggerates the horrors of a tragedy. Imagining that the whole of Judaea was in ruins and that they had only to take possession of an abandoned country, they hastened to invade it, after massacring the envoys whom the Jews had sent to them. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="372">[372]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.372"> G</A> &nbsp; So dismayed were the people at this invasion, and so demoralised by the magnitude of these successive disasters, that Herod called them together and endeavoured to rouse them  to resistance by the following speech. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="373">[373]</A> "This alarm which has now laid hold of you seems to me most unreasonable. To be disheartened by the visitations of heaven was natural ; but to be similarly despondent at the attack of a human foe is unmanly, for my part, far from being intimidated by the enemy's invasion following the earthquake, I regard that catastrophe as a snare which God has laid to decoy the Arabs and deliver them up to our vengeance. It is not because they have confidence in their weapons or their might that they are here, but because they count on our accidental calamities ; but hopes are fallacious which are dependent not on one's own strength, but on the misadventures of another. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="374">[374]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.374"> G</A> &nbsp; Moreover, with mankind fortune is never permanently either adverse or favourable ; one sees her veering from one mood to the other. Of this you might find an illustration in your own experiences : conquerors in the first battle you were then conquered by our enemies, who in all probability, expecting a victory, will now be defeated. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="375">[375]</A> For excessive confidence throws men off their guard, whereas fear teaches precaution ; so that your very timidity is to me reassuring. When you displayed uncalled for temerity and, disdaining my advice, dashed out upon the foe, Athenion had his opportunity for a ruse ; but now your hesitation and apparent despondency are to me a sure pledge of victory. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="376">[376]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.376"> G</A> &nbsp; Appropriate, however, as are such feelings before an impending battle, when once in action your spirits must be roused and you must teach these scoundrels that no disaster, whether inflicted by God or man, will ever reduce the valour of Jews, so long as they have breath in their bodies, and that not one of them will consent to see his property pass into the hands of an Arab, who has often so narrowly escaped becoming his prisoner. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="377">[377]</A> "Do not let the convulsions of inanimate nature disturb you or imagine that the earthquake is a portent of a further disaster. These accidents to which the elements are subject have physical causes, and beyond the immediate injury inflicted bring no further consequences to mankind. A pestilence, a famine, subterranean commotions may possibly be preceded by some slighter premonition, but these catastrophes themselves are limited by their very magnitude to their instant effects. I ask you, can war, even if we are defeated, do us more harm than the earthquake ? 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="378">[378]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.378"> G</A> &nbsp; "Our adversaries, on the other hand, have one grave portent of impending disaster in a recent incident, due neither to natural causes nor to the action of others. Contrary to the universal law of mankind they have brutally murdered our ambassadors ; such are the garlanded victims which they have offered to God to obtain success ! But they will not escape his mighty eye, his invincible right hand ; and to us they will soon answer for their crimes if, with some vestige of the spirit of our fathers, we now arise to avenge this violation of treaties. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="379">[379]</A> Let us each go into action not to defend wife or children or country at stake, but to avenge our envoys. They will conduct the campaign better than we who are alive. I myself will bear the brunt of the battle, if I have you obedient at my back ; for, be assured, your courage is irresistible, if you do not by some reckless action bring injury upon yourselves." 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="380">[380]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.380"> G</A> &nbsp; Having by this speech reanimated his army, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod,</A> observing their ardour, offered sacrifice to God, and then proceeded to cross the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jordan.html#1">Jordan</A> with his troops. Encamping in the neighbourhood of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman">Philadelphia,</A> close to the enemy, and anxious to force on an engagement, he began skirmishing with them for the possession of a fort which lay between the opposing lines. The enemy on their side had sent forward a detachment to occupy this post ; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="381">[381]</A> the party sent by the king promptly beat them off and secured the hill. Daily Herod marched out his troops, formed them in battle array, and challenged the Arabs to combat. But when none came out to oppose him - for a dire consternation had seized them and, even more than the rank and file, their general Elthemus was paralysed with fright - the king advanced and proceeded to tear up their palisades. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="382">[382]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.382"> G</A> &nbsp; Thereupon, impelled by necessity, the enemy at length emerged for action, in disorder, infantry and cavalry intermingled. Superior in numbers to the Jews, they had less stomach for a fight, though despair of success rendered even them reckless. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="383">[383]</A> Consequently, so long as they held out, their casualties were slight ; but when they turned their backs multitudes were slain by the Jews, and many others were trodden to death by their own men. Five thousand fell in the rout ; the rest of the crowd succeeded in forcing their way into their entrenched camp. There Herod surrounded and besieged them, and they must have succumbed to an assault, had not the failure of their water-supply and thirst precipitated their capitulation. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="384">[384]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.384"> G</A> &nbsp; The king treated their envoys with scorn, and, although they offered a ransom of five hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A>, only pressed his attack the harder. Parched with thirst, the Arabs came out in crowds and willingly surrendered to the Jews, so that in five days four thousand were made prisoners. On the sixth the remnant in desperation came forth to battle ; these Herod engaged, killing some seven thousand more. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="385">[385]</A> Having, by this crushing blow, punished Arabia and broken the spirit of its people, he gained such a reputation with them that  the nation chose him for its Protector. 
 
<P> <P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c20">{20.}</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="386">[386]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.386"> G</A> &nbsp; But, this peril surmounted, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> was instantly plunged into anxiety about the security of his position. He was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony's</A> friend, and Antony had been defeated by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar</A> at <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium">Actium.</A> (In reality, he inspired more fear than he felt himself ; for Caesar  considered his victory to be incomplete so long as Herod remained Antony's ally). <A CLASS="verse" NAME="387">[387]</A> The king, nevertheless, resolved to confront the danger and, having sailed to <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes">Rhodes,</A> where Caesar was sojourning, presented himself before him without a diadem, a commoner in dress and demeanour, but with the  proud spirit of a king. His speech was direct ; he told the truth without reserve. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="388">[388]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.388"> G</A> &nbsp; " <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar,"</A> he said, "I was made king by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony,</A> and I acknowledge that I have in all things devoted my services to him. Nor will I shrink from saying that, had not the Arabs detained me, you would assuredly have found me in arms inseparable from his side. I sent him, however, such auxiliary troops as I could and many thousand measures of corn ; nor even after his defeat at Actium did I desert my benefactor. When no longer useful as an ally, I became his best counsellor ; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="389">[389]</A> I told him the one remedy for his disasters - the death of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleopatra.html#7">Cleopatra.</A> Would he but kill her, I promised him money, walls to protect him, an army, and myself as his brother in arms in the war against you. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="390">[390]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.390"> G</A> &nbsp; But his ears, it seems, were stopped by his infatuation for Cleopatra and by God who has granted you the mastery. I share Antony's defeat and with his downfall lay down my diadem. I am come to you resting my hope of safety upon my integrity, and presuming that the subject of inquiry will be not whose friend, but how loyal a friend, I have been." 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="391">[391]</A> To this <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar</A> replied : "Nay, be assured of your safety, and reign henceforth more securely than  before. So staunch a champion of the claims of  friendship deserves to be ruler over many subjects. Endeavour to remain as loyal to those who have been more fortunate ; since, for my part, I entertain the most brilliant hopes for your high spirit. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony,</A> however, did well in obeying <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleopatra's.html#7">Cleopatra's</A> behests rather than yours ; for through his folly we have gained you. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="392">[392]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.392"> G</A> &nbsp; But you have already, it seems, done me a service ; for Quintus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/didius.html#4">Didius</A> writes to me that you have sent a force to assist him against the gladiators. I therefore now confirm your kingdom to you by decree ; and hereafter I shall endeavour to confer upon you some further benefit, that you may not feel the loss of Antony." 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="393">[393]</A> Having thus graciously addressed the king, he placed the diadem on his head, and publicly notified this award by a decree, in which he expressed his commendation of the honoured man in ample and generous terms. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod,</A> after propitiating <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar</A> with presents, then sought to obtain pardon for Alexas, one of Antony's friends, who had come to sue for mercy ; but here Caesar's resentment was too strong for him, and with many bitter complaints against Herod's client the emperor rejected his petition. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="394">[394]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.394"> G</A> &nbsp; Subsequently, when Caesar passed through Syria on his way to Egypt, Herod entertained him for the first time with all the resources of his realm ;  he accompanied the emperor on horseback when he reviewed his troops at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemais.html#1">Ptolemais</A> ; he entertained  him and all his friends at a banquet ; and he followed this up by making ample provision for the good cheer of the rest of the army. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="395">[395]</A> Then, for the march to <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelusium">Pelusium</A> across the arid desert, and likewise for the return, he took care to furnish the troops with abundance of water ; in short, there were no necessaries which the army lacked. The thought could not but occur both to Caesar himself and to his soldiers that Herod's realm was far too restricted, in comparison with the services which he had rendered them. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="396">[396]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.396"> G</A> &nbsp; Accordingly, when Caesar reached Egypt, after the death of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleopatra.html#7">Cleopatra</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony,</A> he not only conferred new honours upon him, but also annexed to his kingdom the territory which Cleopatra  had appropriated, with the addition of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Qais">Gadara, </A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippos">Hippos</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samaria.html#1">Samaria</A> and the maritime towns of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza">Gaza,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthedon_(Palestine)">Anthedon,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa">Joppa,</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_Maritima">Straton's Tower.</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="397">[397]</A> He further presented him, as a bodyguard, with four hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauls">Gauls,</A> who had formerly served Cleopatra in the same capacity. And nothing so strongly moved the emperor to this liberality as the generous spirit of him who was the object of it. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="398">[398]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.398"> G</A> &nbsp; After the first period of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actia">Actian</A> era, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar</A> added to Herod's realm the country called  <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lajat">Trachonitis,</A> with the adjacent districts of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batanaea">Batanaea</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauran">Auranitis.</A> The occasion of this grant was as  follows. Zenodorus, who had taken on lease the domain of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysanias.html#3">Lysanias,</A> was perpetually setting the brigands of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lajat">Trachonitis</A> to molest the inhabitants of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus">Damascus.</A> The latter fled for protection to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/v/varro.html#8">Varro,</A> the governor of Syria, and besought him to report their sufferings to Caesar ; on learning the facts Caesar sent back orders to exterminate the bandits. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="399">[399]</A> Varro, accordingly, led out his troops, cleared the district of these pests and deprived Zenodorus of his tenure. This was the territory which Caesar subsequently presented to Herod, to prevent it from again being used by the brigands as a base for raids upon Damascus. When ten years after his first visit Caesar returned to the province, he, moreover, gave Herod the position of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurator_(ancient_Rome)">procurator</A> of all Syria, for the (Roman) procurators were forbidden to take any measures without his concurrence. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="400">[400]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.400"> G</A> &nbsp; Finally, on the death of Zenodorus, he further assigned to him all the territory between Trachonitis and <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee">Galilee.</A> But what Herod valued more than all these privileges was that in Caesar's affection he stood next after <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/agrippa.html#4">Agrippa,</A> in Agrippa's next after Caesar. Thenceforth he advanced to the utmost prosperity ; his noble spirit rose to greater heights, and his lofty ambition was mainly directed to works of piety. 
 
<P> <P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c21">{21.}</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="401">[401]</A> Thus, in the fifteenth year of his reign, he restored the Temple and, by erecting new foundation-walls, enlarged the surrounding area to double its former extent. The expenditure devoted to this work was incalculable, its magnificence never surpassed ; as evidence one would have pointed to the great colonnades around the Temple courts and to the fortress which dominated it on the north. The colonnades <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod</A> reconstructed from the foundations ; the fortress he restored at a lavish cost in a  style no way inferior to that of a palace, and called  it <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Fortress">Antonia</A> in honour of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antony.</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="402">[402]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.402"> G</A> &nbsp; His own palace, which he erected in the upper city, comprised two most spacious and beautiful buildings, with which the Temple itself bore no comparison ; these he named after his friends, the one Caesareum, the other Agrippeum. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="403">[403]</A> He was not content, however, to commemorate his patrons' names by palaces only ; his munificence  extended to the creation of whole cities. In the district of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samaria.html#1">Samaria</A> he built a town enclosed within magnificent walls twenty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_%28unit_of_length%29">stades</A> in length, introduced into it six thousand colonists, and gave them allotments of highly productive land. In the centre of this settlement he erected a massive temple, enclosed in ground, a furlong and a half in length, consecrated to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar</A> ; while he named the town itself Sebaste. The inhabitants were given a privileged constitution.

Lies found instant credit, but chastisement was even swifter than calumny : the accuser of a moment ago found himself accused and led off to death with him whose conviction he had obtained ; for the grave peril to his life cut short the king's inquiries. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="494">[494]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.494"> G</A> &nbsp; He grew so embittered that he had no gentle looks even for those who were not accused and treated his own friends with the utmost harshness : many of these he refused to admit to court, while those who were beyond the reach of his arm came under the lash of his tongue. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="495">[495]</A> To add to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#34">Alexander's</A> misfortunes, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antipater.html#15">Antipater</A> returned to the charge and, raising a band of kindred spirits, had recourse to every conceivable form of calumny. By his portentous fictions and fabrications the king was, in fact, reduced to such a state of alarm, that he fancied he saw Alexander coming upon him sword in hand. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="496">[496]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.496"> G</A> &nbsp; He, accordingly , had the prince suddenly arrested and imprisoned, and then proceeded to put his friends to the torture. Many died silent, without saying anything beyond what they knew ; but some were driven by their sufferings to falsehood and declared that Alexander and his brother Aristobulus were conspiring against him and were watching for an opportunity to kill him, while out hunting, meaning then to escape to Rome. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="497">[497]</A> This statement, improbable as it was and invented off-hand under the pressure of torment, the king nevertheless found satisfaction in believing, consoling himself for having imprisoned his son with the thought that his action had been justified. 
 
<P> <P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c25">{25.}</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="498">[498]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.498"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#34">Alexander,</A> perceiving the impossibility of shaking his father's belief, resolved boldly to confront the perils that menaced him. He, therefore, composed four books directed against his enemies, in which he avowed the conspiracy, but denounced most of them as accomplices, above all <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pheroras.html#1">Pheroras</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/salome.html#1">Salome</A> ; the latter, he declared, had one night even forced her way into his chamber and, against his will, had immoral relations with him. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="499">[499]</A> These documents - a mass of shocking accusations incriminating persons of the highest rank - had passed into Herod's  hands, when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archelaus.html#10">Archelaus,</A> alarmed for his son-in-law  and daughter, arrived in haste in Judaea. Coming with singular sagacity to their aid, he succeeded by stratagem in diverting the king's threats in another direction. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="500">[500]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.500"> G</A> &nbsp; For, the moment he met him, he exlaimed : "Where is my scoundrel of a son-in-law ? Where shall I set eyes on the person of this parricide, that I may tear him in pieces with my own hands ? My daughter, too, shall share the fate of her fine spouse ; for even if she has had no part in his schemes, as the wife of such a miscreant she is polluted. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="501">[501]</A> But you too, the intended victim of the plot, astonish me by your forbearance, in leaving, as it seems, Alexander still alive ! For my part, I hurried hither from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cappadocia.html#1">Cappadocia</A> expecting to find that the culprit had long since paid his penalty and to hold an inquiry with you upon my daughter, whom, out of regard for your exalted rank, I gave away to that wretch. But now, I find, we have to deliberate about the pair of them. If, then, the fondness of a father's heart unnerves you for punishing a rebellious son, let us each lend the other his hand, each take the other's place in visiting our wrath upon our children." 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="502">[502]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.502"> G</A> &nbsp; With this blustering oration he deluded Herod, notwithstanding the latter's attitude of defiance. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod,</A> at any rate, handed him for perusal the documents composed by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#34">Alexander</A> and examined chapter after chapter with him, dwelling upon each. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archelaus.html#10">Archelaus,</A> finding here an opportunity for furthering his ruse, little by little shifted the blame on to the persons whose names appeared in the volumes, particularly <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pheroras.html#1">Pheroras.</A> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="503">[503]</A> When he observed that he was gaining the king's confidence, he remarked : "We must be careful to see that all these villains have lot been conspiring against this young man, and not he young man against you. For I can see no reason why he should have plunged into such heinous crime, when he already enjoyed the honours of royalty and expected to succeed to the throne, unless there were others seducing him and misguiding the tractable spirit of youth. Such persons, indeed, have been known to impose not only on the young, but on old men as well ; by them the most illustrious houses and entire kingdoms have been overturned." 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="504">[504]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.504"> G</A> &nbsp; Herod assented to this speech ; and for a while relaxed his wrath with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#34">Alexander</A> and vented it upon <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pheroras.html#1">Pheroras,</A> as he was the main theme of the four documents. Pheroras, observing this quick change in the king's feelings and the paramount influence exercised on him by his friend <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archelaus.html#10">Archelaus,</A> despairing of saving himself by honourable means sought protection in effrontery : he abandoned Alexander and threw himself on the mercy of Archelaus. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="505">[505]</A> The latter replied that he did not see how he could sue for pardon for a man involved in such grave charges, which clearly proved that he had plotted against the king and been the cause of the young prince's present misfortunes, unless he were prepared to renounce his villainy and his denials, to own up to the crimes of which he was accused, and to ask pardon of his brother, who indeed loved him ; for that object, said Archelaus, he would render him every possible assistance. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="506">[506]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.506"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pheroras.html#1">Pheroras</A> took his advice, and assuming an attitude calculated to arouse the deepest compassion, in black raiment and in tears, threw himself at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodes.html#1">Herod's</A> feet and craved his pardon as he had often successfully done before. He confessed himself a polluted wretch, guilty of all that was laid to his charge, but deplored his mental derangement and madness, which he attributed to his passion for his wife. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="507">[507]</A> Archelaus, after thus inducing Pheroras to appear as his own accuser and to bear witness against himself, now proceeded to plead for him and sought to appease Herod's wrath, citing parallel cases in his own family history. He had himself, he said, suffered much worse injury from his brother, but had preferred the claims of natural affection to revenge ; for in kingdoms, as in corpulent individuals, there was always some member becoming inflamed from the weight which it supported ; yet what it needed was not amputation but some milder method of cure.

With an air of complete sincerity, Archelaus said that he had his permission to unite her to whom he would, save only Alexander ; for his dearest desire was to maintain the marriage ties which linked him to Herod. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="509">[509]</A> To this the king replied that Archelaus, by consenting not to break the marriage, would really be giving his son back to him, seeing that they already had children and that the young man was so deeply attached to his wife ; if she remained with him, her very presence would make him ashamed of his errors, whereas, were she torn from him, he would be driven to utter desperation ; for the domestic affections exercised a chastening and diverting influence on reckless characters. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="510">[510]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://anastrophe.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/perseus/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekNov21&getid=0&query=Joseph.%20BJ%201.510"> G</A> &nbsp; Archelaus was induced, not without difficulty, to assent, was reconciled to the youthful offender, and reconciled him to his father ; he added, however, that it was absolutely essential that the latter should be sent to Rome for an interview with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Caesar,</A> as he himself had forwarded a full report of the matter to the emperor. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="511">[511]</A> Such was the end of the ruse by which <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archelaus.html#10">Archelaus</A> rescued his son-in-law.

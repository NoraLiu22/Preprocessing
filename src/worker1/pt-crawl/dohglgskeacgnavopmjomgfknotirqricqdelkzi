<h3>Passage Illustrated: A Convivial Boxing Day</h3></h3>

<p class="one">"A merry Christmas, Bob," said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not
be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. "A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow,
than I have given you for many a year. I'll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist
your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a
Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle
before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!"</p>

<p>Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny 
Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a 
master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, 
or borough, in the good old world.  Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but 
he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing 
ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of 
laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought 
it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in 
less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him. [Stave 
Five: "The End of It," pp. 163-165]</p>

<h3>Commentary: Bridging the Divide of the Cash Nexus</h3>

<p class="one">In his last illustration Leech reinforces the notion expressed by 
<a href="../../../authors/carlyle/index.html">Thomas Carlyle</a> that mutual goodwill 
between man and master should replace the attitude that "business is business" and that 
the only bond between capital and labour (or, between the capitalist and the labourer) is
strictly monetary (the "cash nexus"). Thus, Leech's final image complements the highly 
nostalgic frontispiece <a href="../carol/1.html"><span class="drawing">Mr. Fezziwig's 
Ball</span></a>, in which Dickens had blurred the boundaries between work and leisure.
Dressed in white nightgown and revealing his long, white hair, Scrooge now resembles The 
Spirit of Christmas Past. His expression is jovial as his serves his clerk a glass of 
steaming punch. Indeed, the luminous clouds of steam from the ladle and the kettle on the 
hob, as well the roaring coal fire, impart an almost heavenly quality to the cheerful 
parlour scene, which recalls the cold hearth that Marley's ghost visits in the opening 
stave. Now the room is filled with light — "The Light of the World," of humanity 
and fellow-feeling — and decorated with greenery by Scrooge's own hand, signifying 
the ever-green nature of memory. Merry-faced Scrooge is slippers is a far cry from the 
Malthusian miser who quoted his master on the surplus population. According to Leech's 
conception, Scrooge has ushered in his clerk so quickly that Bob has yet to have a 
moment's leisure to unbutton his coat and take off his scarf. The footstool upon which 
the host rests one foot recalls the self-sae article of furniture upon which the Spirit 
of Christmas Present, torch held aloft, welcomed Scrooge to the abundance of the season, 
which included the bowl of punch to which the jolly giant gestured. Thus, in this final, 
summative image of Scrooge Leech has synthesized the former image of the inveterate miser 
with salient characteristics of the Second and Third Visitors. For Scrooge, then, life 
will never be "business as usual" again because now humanity is his business.</p>

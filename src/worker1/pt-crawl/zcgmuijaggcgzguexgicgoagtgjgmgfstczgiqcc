<P 
align=left>Perhaps 
no figure in history is as controversial or mysterious as Mary Magdalene. A 
devout follower of Jesus, Mary followed him to the very end, and was the first 
to witness his resurrection. Since then, she has been labeled such things as a 
prostitute, Jesus' wife, apostle and writer of the Gnostic Gospel of Mary. 
Although her name has been cleared of the prostitution label, the mysterious 
life of Mary Magdalene is still heavily studied and strongly debated, especially 
in recent 
times.</P>
<P 
align=left>Mary's 
appearances are few in the Bible, mostly during the days surrounding Easter 
weekend,&nbsp; but her actions and the effort to identify her have made her into 
a major figure in Christianity. Mary is first mentioned in Luke 8:13 as one of 
the followers of Jesus named Mary, called Magdalene. From this passage it can be 
implied that she was from the Galilean town of Magdala, about one hundred miles 
north of Jerusalem, however&nbsp; her name was not Mary. It was Miriam, which is 
the Hebrew equivalent of Mary. In the same passage it was said that she had 
seven demons cast from her by Jesus. During the time of Jesus, the demons that 
were cast would most likely have been a form of mental illness, rather than 
seven vices that many Christians longly believed and which strengthened the case 
for her label as a prostitute or actual demons that entered her body. After the 
exorcism of the "demons" she became a devout follower of Jesus.&nbsp;</P>
<P 
align=left>As a follower, Mary was one of many women that accompanied Jesus 
during his travels, most of whom are believed to have been wealthy. During his 
journey, he was visited by two women, the unnamed sinner in Luke 7 and Mary of 
Bethany, both of whom anoint his feet and dry them with their hair, similar to 
the way Magdalene anointed him shortly after his death. In 591, Pope Gregory 
the Great stated that all three were in fact one woman, Mary Magdalene, and this 
is how she became labeled as a prostitute, or the unnamed sinner. However the 
Second Vatican Council removed the prostitute label in 1969 after much debate 
and Biblical evidence that there was more than one Mary and that Mary of 
Magdalene and the unnamed sinner were two different 
figures.&nbsp;</P>
<P 
align=left>After Jesus' death, the most controversy around Mary 
Magdalene's life would unfold. In all four Gospels, she is the first to witness 
Jesus after his resurrection. Believed to be the Jesus' favorite by the 
apostles, Mary is asked to reveal secret teachings given to her by Jesus while 
consoling the apostles. After her revelation, which is found in the Gnostic 
Gospel of Mary, she has a disagreement with Peter about the teachings. This is 
the beginning of strengthening Peter's role in Christianity while lessening that 
of Mary's.&nbsp;Gnosticism was not accepted into early Christianity due to its 
strange views, during the formation of the early church. Gnostics believe that 
the salvation of the soul comes from internal knowledge of the mysteries of our 
world, rather than purity of the 
soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P 
align=left>Where Mary went and what she did after she left the apostles is 
debatable. One of the most extreme is that Mary was pregnant with Jesus' child 
and went to France, where her descendants eventually founded the Merovingian 
line of kings, made famous recently by the<I> Da Vinci Codes</I> by Dan Brown. 
Brown's book, a highly fictitious book, depicts Mary as the Holy Grail in Da 
Vinci's &quot;The Last Supper,&quot; rather than the chalice that he drank with. Brown's 
work was highly influenced by the book, <I>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</I> by Michael 
Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln, which was the basis of his writing. 
Some believed that Mary and Jesus were married since most Jewish men married and 
Jesus was closest to Mary, although no evidence supports or denies that 
claim.</P>
<P 
align=left>Most western Catholics, separated from the East after the Great 
Schism, believe she fled to France in a boat with Mary, Lazarus and others and 
lived out her life in a cave for 30 years before dying at the Chapel of 
Saint-Maximin, located in the Aix En province, about 75 miles northeast of 
Marseille, in the Southeast of France. In the Eastern traditions, Mary is 
believed to have left Jerusalem with Mary, mother of Jesus, and traveled to 
Ephesus, in modern-day Turkey. Both traditions only add to the mystery that 
surrounds the life of Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;</P>
<P 
align=left>Although many aspects of Mary's life are debatable, we do 
know that she was a diligent follower of Jesus and the first to witness his 
resurrection. Only in the past forty years have we revealed that her 
identification as a prostitute was false, which means that there is still more 
to learn about this Biblical mystery. With the amount of research and writing 
being done, it is likely that the future will yield some answers that either put 
to rest or raise more questions about the life, death, relationships, and 
apostle status of Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;</P>

from&nbsp;<BR>&lt;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/features/biblemysteries/mary.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/features/biblemysteries/mary.shtml</a>&gt;
(16 December 2005).</B><BR>This article describes the mysteries surrounding 
one of Christianity's most intriguing characters, Mary Magdalene. It examined 
why Mary might have been perceived as a prostitute, such as no evidence of being 
married or widowed and how her name describes where she came from, a small town 
in Galilee. The article goes further by describing the importance of her in the 
Bible, being the first to see Jesus after his resurrection and telling the 
apostles that he had arisen. Lastly, the article discusses the Gospels of Mary 
and Phillip, and how she gave advice and received criticism after Jesus' 
resurrection. The article is very easy to read and I recommend to readers who 
want to know more about Mary Magdalene.</P>
<P><B>Anonymous. Mary Magdalene: FAQ. <i> Magdalene.org</i>&nbsp;<BR>Available from
&lt;<a href="http://www.magdalene.org/faq.php" target="_blank">http://www.magdalene.org/faq.php</a>&gt;
(16 December 2005).</B><BR>The website 
provides answers to frequently asked questions about Mary Magdalene, such as who 
she was, if Jesus and Mary were married, and where she was born and died. The 
answers to these questions and others listed on the site are answered 
objectively and will provide the reader with some clarification about frequent 
questions commonly asked about Mary Magdalene. The site also provides many 
pictures associated with Mary as well as a list of books that are written about 
her.&nbsp;The goal of the site is to provide information about Mary Magdalene in 
a non-secular way. The site was founded by Lesa Bellevie in July 1998, who has 
written a book on Mary called <I>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Mary Magdalene 
</I>as part of her ongoing research that she started in 1997. She is an amateur 
historian, but the information is very well gathered and put 
forward.</P>
<P><B>Anonymous. Saints of July 22 available from &lt;<a href="http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0722.htm" target="_blank">http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0722.htm</a>&gt;
(16 December ).</B><BR>The website gives a listing of saints that are 
remembered on July 22. There is a biography of Mary Magdalene that describes the 
common misconception of her as a prostitute that stayed with her for nearly 2000 
years. The site also provides two possibilities of where she traveled to after 
the Resurrection of Jesus. The site is very helpful and has a vast number of 
other saints listed as well, which may be useful. I recommend the site to all 
readers.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Brock, Ann Graham. <i>Mary Magdalene, The First 
Apostle: The Struggle for Authority.</i> Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 
Press, 2003.&nbsp;</B><BR>Brock's book looks at the struggle for power between 
Mary and Peter after Jesus' death and immediate resurrection. She uses early 
Christian writings, such as the Gospels of the New Testament as well as Gnostic 
Gospels to show how Peter in his quest for authority subjugated the status of 
women that set the standard for the male hierarchy for years to come. The 
purpose of her book is to regain Mary's status as the first apostle so that 
other Christians can look to her example, regardless of gender, and take a more 
active role in the church. The book is extremely well written and I recommend it 
to those who are examining Mary's role in the beginning of Christianity as well 
as those who are trying to understand how she became better recognized as a 
sinner than an apostle. Ann Graham Brock is a professor at Harvard 
University.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Ehrman, Bart D. <i>Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci 
Code.</i> New York: Oxford University Press, 2004.</B><BR>The purpose of 
Ehrman's book is to separate fact from fiction in Dan Brown's book, <I>The Da 
Vinci Code.</I> He begins the book by listing ten factual errors that are found 
in the book, followed by a brief summary of the Brown's work. The rest of the 
book analyzes early Christianity and such figures as Jesus, Mary and Constantine 
that are included in the <I>Da Vinci Code. </I>In doing so, he uses primary 
documents to separate the errors and facts that are contained in the book. The 
book is well written and the list of errors that he provides will be helpful to 
those examining The <I>Da Vinci Codes</I> authenticity, or lack thereof. Bart 
Ehrman is a professor of history at the University of California 
Riverside.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Higgs, Liz. <i>Mad Mary.</i> Colorado Springs: 
Waterbrook Press, 2001.&nbsp;</B><BR>Liz Higgs' book can be broken down into two 
parts, Mad Mary: The Story and Mad Mary: The Study. In the first part, Higgs 
transforms the story of Mary Magdalene into the present day by telling the story 
of Mary Margaret Delaney, a fictional equivalent to Mary Magdalene, and Jake 
Stauros, a fiction preacher who is to be Jesus' equal. The story unfolds in a 
similar manner with Jake dying and resurrecting, although differently on Easter 
Sunday and Mary following him devotedly to the very end. In the second part of 
her book, she examines the real Mary Magdalene and how Christianity has recorded 
her since the death of Jesus. Her intent is to transform Mary Magdalene from the 
sinner into devout follower that she was by clearing up common misconceptions 
given to her by providing historical fact and avoiding bias and skepticism. She 
is an accomplished aouthor with over twenty books in print and has appeared on 
major network stations for religious and family programs such as PBS, BBC, 
A&amp;E and NPR.</P>
<P><B>Lampman, Jane. 'Who Was Mary Magdalene? The Buzz Goes 
Mainstream.' <i> Christian Science Monitor</i> 14 Nov 2003.</B><BR>Lampman's article discusses 
how Mary Magdalene has become center of attention in the Christian world after 
the release of <I>The Da Vinci Code</I> and offers commentary on the book by Ben 
Witherington III, a professor at Asbury Theological Seminary, who has his own 
citation further in the bibliography.. Her article examines the legend that 
Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a royal bloodline is due to some 
scholars belief that most Jewish men married. Since Jesus was Jewish, they 
believe that he was married and to Mary. She also discusses the Gospel of Mary, 
a Gnostic book that was seen as heretical in early Christianity. She looks at a 
recent book by Karen King of the Harvard Divinity School, T<I>he Gospel of Mary 
Magdala </I>and discusses how King believes Mary was an important apostle after 
the death and resurrection of Jesus. The article is well written and I recommend 
to those who are unfamiliar with what the Gnostic books contain and how they are 
separate from those found in the Bible. Lampman is a staff writer for the 
Christian Science Monitor.</P>
<P><B>PBS. 'From Jesus to Christ: The Gospel of 
Mary.' Available from&nbsp;<BR>&lt;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/primary/mary.html" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/primary/mary.html</a>&gt;
(16 December&nbsp; 2005).</B><BR>The PBS website provides an excerpt from the 
Gnostic Gospel of Mary where she speaks to the apostles following Jesus' death. 
In the Gospel of Mary, she tells the apostles about teachings that Jesus 
privately gave to her in a vision. Following her statements, two apostles, Peter 
and Andrew, don't believe that what she said came from Jesus and that the 
teachings are strange. Levi defends Mary and states that Jesus loved her more 
than the fellow apostles and calls Peter 'hot-tempered.' The excerpt is a 
valuable primary source that the reader can look at and see how it differs from 
the accepted books that are in the Bible.&nbsp;The intent of the site is to 
authenticate Biblical writings with historical evidence and 
data.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Ricci, Carla. <i>Mary Magdalene and Many Others: Women who 
Followed Jesus</i>. Trans. from Italian by Paul Burns. Minneapolis: Fortress 
Press, 1994.</B><BR>Ricci begins her book by hypothesizing on why women were not 
heard in the time of Jesus due to a number of social and religious factors that 
ultimately lead to the establishment of male-dominated texts. She then discusses 
how Mary became labeled as a prostitute and the further described the conditions 
that women faced in Galilee during the time of Jesus. The book then examines 
many of the women who followed Jesus, with prime concentration on Mary 
Magdalene. This is the best source I found concerning women and the social 
conditions in Galilee at the time of Jesus and will aid those studying not only 
Mary Magdalene, but other women followers of Jesus and women in Galilee at that 
time. Ricci received her doctorate from the University of 
Bologna.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Schaberg, Jane. <i>The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene</i>. New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002.</B><BR>Jane Schaberg's book takes an 
in-depth look at the life of Mary Magdalene by analyzing and evaluating her 
presence in early Christian texts and legends. She then looks at Gnostic texts 
and other sources that were termed heretical and believes that the Gnostic 
writings were seen this way due to the power struggle between Mary and Peter. 
She tries to restore Magdalene's image as a women who was faithful to her 
teacher to the end and that her labeling over time was due to the threat that a 
women was too close to Jesus and knew to much. She ends her book with excerpts 
from John 20 that link Mary as the possible successor to Jesus and the movement 
that he started. She received her Ph. D. in Biblical studies from Union 
Theological Seminary.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Schlumpf, Heidi. 'Who Framed Mary 
Magdalene?' <i> U.S. Catholic</i> Apr 2000. available from Academic Search Premier 
(accessed 8 Nov 2005).</B><BR>Heidi Schlumpf's article looks at how women today 
are trying to examine Mary Magdalene's role in the early church, the one that 
saw her as a prostitute and now as an advisor to the apostles, as a way of 
strengthening women's role in the church today. The breadth of the article 
examines the 4 Gospel accounts of Mary seeing Jesus after the Resurrection as 
well as how Pope Gregory the Great labeled her as a prostitute. It then 
discusses how Mary and Peter were at the center of the early church and Peter, 
being a male, became the leader and Mary's role became limited. I recommend the 
article to all readers who are doing research on Mary due to the quality of the 
work and the way the author breaks the article down into sections focusing on 
certain topics.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Van Biema, David. 'Mary Magdalene: Saint or 
Sinner?' originally in <i>Time</i> 11 Aug 2003. available from &lt;<a href="http://www.danbrown.com/media/morenews/time.html" target="_blank">http://www.danbrown.com/media/morenews/time.html</a>&gt;
(16 December 2005).&nbsp;</B><BR>This article examines the way Magdalene was wrongfully 
depicted as a prostitute by Pope Gregory the Great when he combined three 
Biblical Mary's into one person and the seven demons that were exorcised out of Mary 
were the seven vices. It then goes on to examine some of the thinking that Mary 
was pregnant with Jesus' child and started the Merovingian line of kings in 
France. Lastly, the article discusses the jealousy that Peter had in the Gnostic 
Gospel of Mary when Peter became enraged when Mary states that she has received 
private instruction from Jesus without the knowing of the Apostles. I recommend 
the article to all readers seeking to see how Mary was transformed from witness 
to prostitute and back again. David Van Biema is a writer for Time.&nbsp;The 
article is located at Dan Brown's website to provide background material on Mary 
Magdalene, who is a focal point of his book, <I>The Da Vinci 
Code.</I></P>

href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/135/story_13503.html">http://www.beliefnet.com/story/135/story_13503.html</A>&gt; 
(16 December 2005).</B><BR>The purpose of Witherington's article is prove 
that there is no historical evidence that Mary Magdalene's relationship was 
nothing more than student to teacher. He provides a background on who Mary 
Magdalene was, gives examples of where she appears in the New Testament, and 
defends that she was a devout follower of Jesus after he cast seven demons from 
her. He defends that Mary Magdalene was not a sinner, it was an assumption that 
occurred in the early Middle Ages. The article is well written and I recommend 
it to others who wish to know more about Mary and her appearances in the Bible. 
Witherington is a professor at Asbury Theological Seminary. Witherington is also 
mentioned in an earlier citation focusing on an article by Jane Lampman.</P>

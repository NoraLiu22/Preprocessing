<p><a href="bib-rva.html#rya97">DK Pocket Book</a> reports
&quot;During the French Administration (1881-1957) it became a
sea flag, with the French tricolor in the canton; this was removed when 
independence was achieved in 1956.&quot; Did this flag ever exist or are they getting 
mixed-up with Morocco?<br>
<i>Martin Grieve</i>, 13 April 2003</p>
<p>This seems consistent with French custom in their overseas possessions, 
though it seems also that all these flags are very seldom well documented and 
that sometimes at least they are &quot;wishful thinking&quot; or are patterns very rarely 
used. I guess we should look forward to someone demystifying these &quot;French 
ensigns&quot;.<br>
<i>&#381;eljko Heimer</i>, 13 April 2003</p>
<p>This seems to be consistent with French administrative thinking: don't 
publicise it because it's nobody else's business. Books on railways are able to 
tell you when a particular class of locomotive was in use on a particular line - 
provided the colonial territory was British. But if the territory was French, 
you can discover that a particular class was in use in a certain territory in a 
given period, but they never say on what line, and if the territory covered more 
than one colony (like French West Africa) they don't even indicate which colony 
the locomotives were used in.<br>
<i>Mike Oettle</i>, 15 April 2003</p>
<p>I have the Moroccan legislation, and I, too, would be interested if there is 
anything on Tunisia. As far as I was aware, there was never a tricolor on the 
Tunisian flag but this, of course, does not mean that there wasn't one.<br>
<i>Christopher Southworth</i>, 14 April 2003</p>
<p>On this occasion, <a href="bib-rva.html#rya97">DK Pocket Book</a> is not fully 
mistaken. The Flag Bulletin, no. 195, Sep.-Oct. 2000, is more or less devoted to 
Tunisian flags, and includes references in two articles to an *unofficial* and 
*short-lived* Tunisian flag with French canton. It also shows the flag on its 
cover.<br>
<br>
Firstly, <a href="bib-smi.html#smi00j">Smith (2000j)</a>, p. 187, says: &quot;An 
unofficial modification of the Tunisian national flag, used for a few years, 
added the French Tricolor to the design as a canton (...) (37).<br>
<br>
Footnote (37) says: Henri Hugon, &quot;Les Embl�mes des beys de Tunis&quot; (Paris: Leroux, 
1913), p. 61.<br>
<br>
Secondly, <a href="bib-smi.html#smi00l">Smith (2000l)</a>, p. 197, says:
&quot;Tunisia, a French protectorate, retained its national flag on land and at sea. 
Nevertheless, in the late 19th Century or early 20th Century an unofficial 
version of the flag was used with the tricolor canton. In 1925 a formal proposal 
was made to adopt that flag as official, but no action was taken. That flag, 
featured on the cover of this issue, does not appear to have been illustrated in 
any vexillological source.&quot;<br>
<br>
However, the first article mentions Tunisian <b>ensigns</b> repeatedly, and only 
refers to this unofficial variant as a <b>flag</b> -- so I would understand that such 
a variant was never used as an ensign. Thus <a href="bib-rva.html#rya97">DK Pocket Book's</a> statement regarding the 
Tunisian flag saying &quot;during the French Administration
(1881-1957) it became a sea flag, with the French tricolore in the canton&quot; is 
most probably wrong, and a mix-up with Morocco, as I guessed in the first place.<br>
<i>Santiago Dotor</i>, 16 April 2003</p>
<p>I found an old French journal (1904) on the net, reporting the visit of the 
Bey of Tunis in France. We can see on the picture the same flag as above used 
when the Bey visited the &quot;H�tel De Ville&quot; of Paris at

<i>Baba Sanfoor</i>, 10 August 2005</p>
<p>The newspaper here is the daily &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, founded by Mo�se Polydore 
Millaud (1813-1871) in 1863. This daily leaflet (40 x 30 cm) was 50% cheaper 
than the other ones and was not sold by subscription but in booths and by 
hawkers. &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; was the first French high-circulation daily. Millaud 
said &quot;I have the courage to be stupid&quot; and founded a new kind of journalism, 
mostly apolitical (which avoided paying a tax), and based on good sense and 
conformist moral. The daily included long cultural and scientific popular 
chronicles, long and vivid descriptions of news items and trivial events and 
serials, such as the famous &quot;Rocambole&quot; series written by Ponson du Terrail 
(incredible events or news are still commonly called &quot;rocambolesque&quot; in French). 
In 1890, the circulation of &quot;Petit Journal&quot; reached 1,000,000. Its new director, 
Girardin, created supplements, the most famous of them being the colour 
&quot;Supplement illustr�&quot;, whose pictures are one of the best examples of the 
popular iconography of the end of the 19th Century in France. In the early 
years of the 20th Century, the importance of &quot;Petit Journal&quot; decreased and it 
was superseded by the &quot;Petit Parisien&quot; as the main popular daily. [Encyclopaedia 
Universalis]<br>
<br>
The &quot;Petit Journal&quot; iconography seems today very naive, but remember that 
information and, above all, images were very rare at that time - photography was 
still uncommon and there was of course no TV. The &quot;Petit Journal&quot; was a main 
source of information on what happened in France and in the world, and it 
probably contributed to the development of the very specific French colonial 
iconography and (kind of) mythology.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it is not easy to assess the reliability of the representations shown 
by &quot;Petit Journal&quot;. The scene of interest for us took place in the City Hall of 
Paris, which does not necessarily prove that the designer of the picture 
actually attended the scene. Once again, we shall forget the camera flashes and 
the press conferences, which did not exist in the 1900's. Concerning the Tunisian 
flag, several hypotheses are possible: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the flag is represented as it was used during the ceremony.</li>
  <li>the designer was told there were Tunisian flags (or was requested to 
  represent them), but had no idea of how they could look; he consulted another 
  source, maybe correct, maybe erroneous, or was told by someone, maybe 
  reliable, maybe not.</li>
  <li>the designer was &quot;inspired&quot; by another flag of the same kind. We can think 
  of Morocco, but the civil ensign of Morocco with the French national flag in 
  canton was created only in 1919.</ul>
  A bad corollary is that the picture in the &quot;Petit Journal&quot; might have
  been the source, maybe correct, maybe wrong, for further reports of
  that particular flag of Tunisia.
  <br>
  My conclusion is that we have a source showing a Tunisian flag with the
  French national flag in the canton, dated 1904, but I cannot be sure
  of the reliability of that source.

<P>A Dublin genealogist becomes obsessed with the American girl renting
one of his apartments, threatening his relationships, his job and his life.
Based on the story by Joseph O'Connor, this film demonstrates strong influences
of European art house films such as Krzysztof Kieslowski's <I>A Short Film
About Love</I>. The result is a film which will appeal to an art house audience,
but which is best avoided by everyone else.</P>

<P>Romantic obsession is not meant to be explicable. The compulsions which
drive Brendan Coyle's character are beyond comprehension. This film does
not attempt to explain them, or even explore them, focusing instead on their
outward manifestations; his stealing her mail, his staring moodily at her
on the train, his tracing genealogical lines between them, et cetera. The
result is a sort of homage to insignificance, a poetic meditation on character
and colour which amounts to little more than the obvious. The lack of psychological
depth tells after half an hour, when this film begins to feel like an overextended
short. There is simply not enough material to flesh out a feature film,
and without even a modicum of engagement, there is nothing for the audience
to hold onto other than to admire the use of the frame and the palette to
evoke feelings of loneliness and obsession which we cannot share.</P>

<P>Of course this is precisely the point, and there are those for whom this
will prove a rewarding experience. But it revels in the conventional and
does nothing to expand the jaded European introversion it so ferverently
admires. The setting is new, but this could well be made in any European
country and come up exactly the same. Even Dublin is robbed of its individuality.
Though the object of the man's obsession is American, and some thematic
speculation on the mindset of the emigrant could be read into this, there
is nothing specifically Irish about the story. The milieu is so resolutely
internal to the character (and still alienating) that it succeeds in draining
the story of its specificity in an attempt at a pan-European art house sensibility.
Again, this is the point, and may be a triumph for some. But for me at least,
this was extremely unpleasant to watch and had long made its point and lost
its meaning before the predictable and equally uninteresting ending.</P>

<P>Nothing that happens seems justified (as it shouldn't, being a portrait
of obsession). Upon spying this girl through a window, he immediately becomes
focused upon possessing some part of her (though he wouldn't dream of actually
making contact, of course), which leads to him stealing her mail (which
may or may not strike you as interesting), and drawing away from his own
girlfriend (Andrea Irvine) and workmate (Darragh Kelly), costing him dearly
and never resulting in either consummation or catharsis. It is a pointless
tale which trades on its pointlessness. It takes on the character of a religion,
if you believe, no explanation is necessary, if you don't, no explanation
is possible. The result is a purely European film from a director who, curiously,
would later follow a more American path with <A HREF="iwd.htm"><I>I Went
Down</I>.</A></P>

<P>The bottom line is that this is a festival film to be applauded and lauded
by those eager to embrace this kind of sensibility. Others should avoid
it. It is not a bad film, but it is not necessarily a good one simply because
it wants to be.</P>

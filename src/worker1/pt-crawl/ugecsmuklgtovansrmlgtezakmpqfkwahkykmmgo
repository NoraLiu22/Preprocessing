Using County-by-County election return data from 
<A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/cbc/map.htm"> USA Today</A>
together
with County boundary data from the US Census' 
<A HREF="http://www.census.gov/tiger/boundary/51cobna.zip">
Tiger database</A>
we produced
the following graphic depicting the results.  Of course, blue is
for the democrats, red is for the republicans, and green is for all other.
Each county's color is a mix of these three color components in proportion
to the results for that county.  
<p>

Alaska, Hawaii, and the New England states are missing because the data
from USA Today doesn't match the county data from the US Census.
For example, the New England states' election return data is given
for each municipality and/or district rather than for each county.
Hence, it couldn't be easily matched with the county boundaries.

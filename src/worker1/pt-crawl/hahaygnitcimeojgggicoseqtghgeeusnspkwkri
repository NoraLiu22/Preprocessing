<p align="left">Throughout history, the traditional roles that
subordinated women passed from generation to generation. Although
most women faced a life of limited opportunity, a few were
capable of surpassing the traditional roles and gaining power and
influence. One of these women was Jeanne-Antionette Poisson, who
in the eighteenth century, rose beyond her class status and
gained title of <em>maitresse-en-titre</em> to Louis XV, King of
France. She was able to remain the King's mistress between 1745
and 1750, and remained powerful as the King's confidante until
her death in 1764.</p>

<p align="left">Madame de Pompadour was born Jeanne-Antionette
Poisson on December 29, 1721 in the rue de Clery. Her father was
Francois Poisson, a steward to the Paris brothers, and was forced
to leave the country after a black market scandal in 1725. At
this time, her mother, Louise Madeline de la Motte, was
befriended by Charles le Normant de Tornehem, who then looked
over the family. When Jeanne-Antionette was nine years old, her
mother had taken her to a fortune teller and was told that one
day she would become the mistress of a king. She was then given
the nickname Reinette, meaning &quot;little queen.&quot; Between
the ages of eight and twelve, Reinette spent much time in and out
of an Ursuline convent at Poissy where she received an education
and first took interest in the arts. Once she returned home for
good her mother insisted on giving her the best education because
of her belief that she would marry a rich man. She was given
voice lessons by Jeloitte, the star of the Paris opera, and
taught elocution from a dramatist, Crebillon.</p>

<p align="left">When Reinette reached the age of marriage, an
arrangement was made by Normant de Tornehem for her to marry his
nephew, Charles Guillaume le Normant d'Etoiles. In 1741 they were
married and in 1744 she gave birth to a girl named Alexandrine.
Shortly after she was married, she began to plan ways to gain
access into the most elusive circles. Soon she was entertaining a
great deal of men like Voltaire and Montesquieu in her chateau d'Etoiles. It did not take a long time for her name to be known
all over Paris and even by the King himself.</p>

<p align="left">After the death of the Duchess de Chateauroux in
1744, Reinette's chance came to become the King's mistress. Not
long after her appearance at the masked Yew Ball she was put up
in a room in King Louis XV's palace and given lessons on court
etiquette. Finally, on September 15, 1745, she was legally
separated from her husband and pronounced the Marquise de
Pompadour, the King's official mistress.</p>

<p align="left">Once established in court, she was very modest
and tried to win approval, despite the already implanted hatred
of her by many because of her bourgeoisie background. She was
very successful in finding ways to amuse and entertain the King.
Through the Theatre des Petits Cabinets, she entertained the King
with a total of one hundred twenty-two performances. She also
planned many intimate parties and suppers for the King to keep
him amused.</p>

<p align="left">The Marquise de Pompadour has widely been known
as a patron of the arts and literature. She had a huge library of
thousands of books and had given her patronage to the writer
Voltaire. She was also very successful in her artistic creations.
She loved new buildings and decorative arts, and thus the fashion
that she used is identified with the term &quot;Pompadour
style.&quot; Such interests allowed her to acquire many houses
and mansions such as the Hotel d'Evreux. She also planned the
building of the palace of Compeigne and the Petit Trianon Palace
at Versailles. The two most notable creations of the Marquise
were the porcelain works of Sevres and the Ecole Militaire.
Through her many works she became known as the patron of many
artists like Boucher, sculptors, and architects like Lassurance.</p>

<p align="left">Because she could no longer meet her lover's
demands, after 1750, the relationship between the King and the
Marquise was based strictly on friendship. At this time she
looked to play a larger role in the politics and government of
France. On October 12, 1752 the King made her a duchess, the
greatest favor he could bestow on her. When France was on the
verge of war with England, she played a major role in influencing
the &quot;Diplomatic Revolution,&quot; or the treaty that allied
France with her former enemy Austria. The treaty was signed on
May 1, 1756, and eventually led to the Seven Years' War. She also
demonstrated her power and influence over the King in the way she
was capable of removing her enemies from office and enabling her
friends to come into government. All of these proved to be
disastrous to France, and led to the unpopularity of the
Marquise. She was blamed for all the misfortunes that fell upon
France. The public hated her and began writing vicious letters,
pamphlets, and verses against her, and also began threatening her
with violent campaigns. Despite the public's view of her, the
King continued to remain faithful to the Marquise de Pompadour.</p>

<p align="left">The Marquise de Pompadour, who had put all of her
energy towards the affairs of the state, was physically fatigued
and became quite ill. She died on April 15, 1764. Through her
influential twenty years at court, she truly became an example of
rising above the traditions given to women.</p>

<p align="left">By Susan Arnett:</p>

<p>Women have always had a profound effect on history throughout the ages.
Madame de Pompadour is one female whose contributions and authority in France
have distinguished her as a historical figure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On December 30, 1721 Jean-Antoinette Poisson, the future Marquise de Pompadour
was born to Louise Madeleine de la Motte and Francois Poisson of the bourgeois
class. Francois was a steward to the Paris brothers who were responsible for
running the economy of France. Jean-Antoinette's childhood was not always the
easiest. Her father was exiled from France for charges of embezzlement when she
was very young, leaving her mother to raise two children alone. She was also a
very frail child who always had throat and nose problems. At age seven,
Jean-Antoinette was sent to the Ursuline convent at Poissy where she was well
educated and developed her love for the arts. Perhaps the most significant point
in Jean-Antoinette Poisson's young life came from a prophecy by fortune teller
Mme. Lebon. At age nine, this fortune teller told her that one day she would
reign over a king's heart. Even when she married her husband Charles-Guillaume
le Normant d'Etioles, whom she loved deeply, she told him in fun that she would
never leave him, except, of course, for the king.</p>
<p>Jean-Antoinette eventually began visiting the court of King Louis XV at
Versailles. After their first meeting the king instantly admired her beauty and
skill. He enjoyed watching her perform in plays at her own theater built in her
Etiolles estate. She was installed at court as Louis the fifteenth's official
favorite under the title of Marquis de Pompadour in 1744.</p>
<p>Madame de Pompadour had a profound effect over the private life of the court.
Before she arrived at the court, life had been quite boring for King Louis XV.
She organized suppers and brought many performances to the theater. She brought
back the sense of intimacy and extravagance that the French court had lost. She
also directed the artists of her time. She commissioned such artists as the
writer Voltaire and the painter Francois Boucher. Madame de Pompadour also
encouraged the manufacture of porcelain and decorated the palace of Versailles
in the Rococo manner.</p>
<p>Madame de Pompadour did not stay mistress to the king for long, in fact she
stayed the king's lover for only five years. Nevertheless, she stayed a true and
close friend to Louis XV until her death. To maintain her status, the marquise
took a part in the politics of France. She made and unmade generals during the
Seven Yearís War and helped to bring out the famous change of alliances. She
wanted peace within France so it could be a strong world power. Although she was
very ambitious, her life was still filled with frustrations, bitterness, and
unhappiness. Throughout her life in the court, Madame de Pompadour was many
times looked down upon by the French people. Coming out of the bourgeois class,
this mistress and friend of the king was taking a role usually reserved for the
aristocrats. Others saw her as a woman trying to seize power.</p>
<p>In 1764, the always fragile Marquis de Pompadour came down with a violent
headache. She was diagnosed as having congestion of the lungs. Two months after
her diagnosis, the beloved friend of the king died at the age of 46. Madame
Pompadour is proof that women had a role in history. Although she is not always
portrayed in a pleasant light, Madame de Pompadour is a part of history because
of her great qualities, talents, and influence.</p>

<p><b>Bernier, Oliver. </b><b><i>Louis the Beloved: The Life of
Louis XV</i></b><b>. Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company
Inc., 1984.<br>
</b>Bernier attempts to show Louis XV as an honorable King, and
one of the greatest rulers of this regime. This book takes the
reader through the years before he became King until his death.
This book portrays Louis XV in a more positive way, not looking
so much at his mistakes, but at his triumphs. It mentions Madame
de Pompadour as she comes into the King's life, and discusses her
strong influence over the King and her role with the arts. It is
effective for obtaining a general unbiased idea about the King's
mistress and the role she played during her twenty years in the
Court.[T.T.]<br>
Focusing more on the personality and achievements of King Louis XV, this book
takes a look at the life and reign of the long-maligned king. It sheds
historical truth, and shows a great deal of accurate objective research. A
portion of the book is devoted to Mme de Pompadour's role in the king's life. It
shows the amount of influence this lady had, even though much of her power was
not overt like those individuals with actual titles. The book is useful in
showing the type and amount of power women could actually attain in the
eighteenth century. [S.A.]</p>

<p><b>Cheek, Pamela. &quot;Prostitutes of 'political institution.'&quot; <i>Eighteenth
Century Studies</i> 28, no.2 (Winter 94/95): 193-120.)</b><br>
This article discusses the association between writing and prostitution in
eighteenth century France. Discussed is the rumor of the Marquise de Pompadour
suggesting that the police collect records of this demoralizing behavior. This
shows the authority that this woman had on the politics of the society. [S.A.]</p>

<p><b>Ducros, Louis. <i>French Society in the Enlightenment Century</i>. New
York, N.Y.: Lenox Hill Pub., 1971.</b><br>
This book views French Eighteenth Century Society as important. It gives a sense
of what took place during this time period. There is a small section on Madame
de Pompadour because of the way she dazzled the court with her various talents.
Her performances at her theater in Etioles are highlighted. This shows that
women in society were recognized not only for their beauty but also for their
talent. [S.A.]</p>

<p><b>Gaxotte, Pierre. </b><b><i>Louis XV and His Times</i></b><b>.
Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Co., 1934.<br>
</b>This book concentrates on Louis XV and how he became the
King. It devotes attention to the merits of this era rather than
its downfalls in an attempt to give another point of view about
Louis XV. Gaxotte does this to provide contrast to those writings
about him written by his enemies. It discusses the role of Madame
de Pompadour plays briefly, but gives enough information about
her to understand her importance. [T.T.]<br>
The author of this book makes it clear that he is interested in dispelling the
negative accounts of King Louis XV. Pierre Gaxotte points out that the king has
often been wholly judged on the testimony of his enemies. Madame de Pompadour is
mentioned throughout latter part of the text. She is described as the secretary
of state for pleasure because of her control of court affairs. The text is
useful in describing how this woman actually influenced the culture in France. [S.A.]</p>

Love Affair with Style,&quot; an art exhibit focused on rococo style that the
king and his mistress helped to create. Madame de Pompadour is also mentioned as
influencing the porcelain during the time period. A painting of her is included
in the article. This article is useful in displaying Pompadour's taste of style
and influence over the kings tastes. [S.A.]</p>

This is a fun article on the history of tall hairstyles for ladies. The tall
hairstyle trend was set by Madame de Pompadour in 18<sup>th</sup> century
France. The pompadour hairstyle is when a 3 foot wire frame tops the head, with
a tower of such things as vegetables, miniature glass animals, and toy ships.
This article is only important in giving one a sense of culture and lifestyle
for ladies at the time. [S.A.]</p>

<p><b>Gooch, G.P. </b><b><i>Louis XV: The Monarchy in Decline</i></b><b>.
London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1956.<br>
</b>This book is effective in portraying the character of Louis
XV, as well as the outcomes of the monarchy. While discussing
Louis XV in great detail, it also devotes two entire chapters to
Madame de Pompadour. The first chapter gives detailed information
about her childhood, her becoming the King's mistress, and her
status within the Court. It also describes her role in
entertaining the King, and the many buildings that she acquired
and decorated during her time. The second chapter about her is
about her relationship to the King as only a friend, showing the
influence she had over him. It discusses her unsuccessful role in
the Seven Years' War, as well as her role in other affairs of
France. This book is very useful in understanding the influential
role that Madame de Pompadour played during 1745-1764.<br>
The larger portion of this book is devoted to King Louis XV as an insufficient
ruler. It is not another narrative of his reign, but looks at how the
enlightened autocrat shaped the lives of his countrymen. Madame de Pompadour,
the mistress and friend of the king, is briefly identified but sheds little
detail on her role in history. [S.A.]</p>

Pompadour and her role in politics. He demonstrates how the people saw her as a
minister more powerful than the king. The article has an impact on women and
society and is useful because it shows a female in a powerful role. [S.A.]</p>

<p><b>Levron, Jacques. </b><b><i>Pompadour</i></b><b>. New York:

</b>This book is an excellent source for detailed information
about Madame de Pompadour. It is useful for anyone who wants an
account of her life. It takes the reader from her birth to her
death with detailed descriptions of her childhood, her marriage,
her journey in becoming mistress, and her role as the King's
mistress. This book is effective because it is divided into two
main parts. The first part tells the story of her childhood and
her influential role as King Louis XV's mistress. It includes her
relationship with others at Court, her buildings and interests,
and ends with her friendship to the King. The second part focuses
on politics and discusses her role in the affairs of France
including the Jansenist struggle and the Seven Years' War. It
concludes with the last years of her life. While it discusses her
positive role in decision-making, it also points out the negative
effects of some of the choices she made. [T.T.]<br>
This book presents a clear narrative on the life of Madame de Pompadour. It is
divided into two parts, her life as the king's mistress and her involvement in
politics. The information presented centers around how important this woman was
to the society of King Louis XV. It is useful in the way it conveys actual
events by presenting letters relevant to her life story. [S.A.]</p>

</b>Louis XV and Louis XVI are the main subjects of this book. Madame de
Pompadour is described as having an important role in foreign affairs, like the
negotiations that led up to the reversal of alliances in 1756. She made and
unmade ministers, and in times of war, even generals. She is blamed by many of
the French people for the extravagance of the court and disasters of the Seven
Years' War. [S.A.]</p>

<p><b>Maza, Sarah. <i>Private Lives and Public Affairs</i>. Berkeley and Los

This book's larger study is the public impact of the tales of private lives.
Stories of parties to highly publicized events gripped the attention of the
reading public in France. Madame de Pompadour's early life and influence are
two topics included in the book. The author's discussion is important to the
women of society because of the growing public role of women. Pompadour began
her career as a public woman through her life as a mistress. [S.A.]</p>

<p><b>Mitford, Nancy. </b><b><i>Madame de Pompadour</i></b><b>.

details about the main events in her life. From her birth until
her death, it tells how she came to power as the King's mistress
as well as her influence on the arts and in the politics of
France. It is very valuable for an in-depth analysis of the life
of Madame de Pompadour.<br>
The author shows a comprehensive depiction of Madame de Pompadour's life from
birth to death. The theme of the book looks at the important contributions that
the author sees as significant to history. It is useful and simply written so

</b>This article examines Madame de Pompadour's role in the
visual arts in the second half of the eighteenth century. Posner
discusses the views about her patronage to the arts, explaining
how she is known for having a profound influence over the arts.
The main theme of this article is to understand Madame de Pompadour's influences and motives and to show how her role in
the arts has been exaggerated. By providing a description of her
role, Posner is trying to show her having a limited role in the
arts and how she used such visual arts in order to show her
influence and status. [T.T.]<br>
This extensive article examines the role played by Madame de Pompadour in the
promotion of the arts in France during the years around 1750, when she was
mistress and friend of Louis XV. Apparently, works of art were designed to
allude to Pompadour's talents, virtues, and status. Also discusses her
limitations in he involvement in arts administration and promotion. [S.A.]</p>

main focus of this site is on the role of Madame de Pompadour as
a patron of the arts and relates the term &quot;Pompadour

Trianon and the decorative styles used. It is quite informative
for giving basic information on Madame de Pompadour and includes
numerous pictures and links to other related topics, but is not
very useful for in-depth research. [T.T.]<br>

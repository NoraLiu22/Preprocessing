<H2>The Nephew (1998)</H2>

<P>D: Eugene Brady<BR>
S: Donal McCann, Pierce Brosnan, Hill Harper</P>

<P>A small Irish island community is thrown into turmoil by the arrival
of a young man from America (Hill Harper) whose mother, a native, has recently
died. He finds himself the unwitting centre of an ongoing conflict between
his uncle Donal McCann and local bar owner Pierce Brosnan, who have been
at loggerheads since his mother left twenty years before. Further complications
ensue when the boy develops a friendship with Brosnan's daughter.</P>

<P>So what's here that we haven't seen before? Not much actually, except,
get this, it seems to have been funny to someone at some point in the development
of this script that the Irish-American youth is black. Ha ha. Hilarious.
It even cops out at that gag though, and after some initial cross-cultural
inappropriateness (which might, just might, have given the film some edge),
the entire question of race is dropped and dismissed as irrelevant, which
given the frames of reference of the story (jokes about the 'backwardness'
of the community and the conservatism of McCann's character) is simply not
believable. The rest is business as usual.</P>

<P>Like (too) many Irish films, <I>The Nephew</I> is set in a 'colourful'
world steeped in 'tradition' and framed by a lovingly photographed landscape
which offers a setting in which the drama is played out like a half-assed
allegory for Irish history. It is centrally concerned with how the past
affects the present, and pits character against character in an attempt
to uncover 'hidden' secrets which turn out to be pointless grudges rather
than real issues. There's nothing wrong with this as such, but it has been
done so often that the film required something special to make it interesting.
Perverse as it sounds, the racial angle did offer such an opportunity, but
it is peculiarly muted and confined to one or two punchlines and an embarrassingly
bad scene where farm hand Phelim Drew sings a rap version of &quot;Whisky
in the Jar&quot;. It seems that Ireland is not quite ready to face up to
its racial demons yet, though I suppose it is notable that a black character
features so prominently in an Irish film at all.</P>

<P>The film is bolstered by performances better than it deserves. McCann
is excellent in a role which is not well written, with Brosnan quietly effective
after the rigours of <A HREF="tnd.htm"><I>Tomorrow Never Dies</I> </A>and
<I><A HREF="dp.htm">Dante's Peak </A></I>(he was also co-producer)<I>. </I>It
is stolen by young Harper though, who is natural and likable. There are
many weak scenes written around him, but he rises above them and comes out
of the affair with a great deal more dignity than might be expected. Support
from a variety of familiar faces is interesting, with Sinead Cusack and
Niall Toibin contributing nicely, though some of the younger, less well
known cast are less effective.</P>

<P>Lush cinematography helps to keep you distracted, and bits and pieces
of it function relatively well. It does not perform as a whole though, with
too many cliches eventually overwhelming even the efforts of its cast. It
is also woefully inconsistent in its portrayal of the community, unable
to reconcile the emerging need to feature a more contemporary Ireland to
satisfy the domestic audience and to retain as many romantic ideals as possible
to ensure an international distribution deal. Instead of opting for one
or the other, it jumps between the two and never manages to be convincing
either way.</P>

<P>The film plays only on a most basic level and will bore most people long
before it resolves its crises in a formulaic fashion. It is not quite the
disaster that <A HREF="gits.htm"><I>Gold in the Streets</I> </A>was, but
in the year of <I><A HREF="bb.htm">The Butcher Boy</A></I>, <A HREF="gen.htm"><I><CITE>The</CITE></I><CITE>
General</CITE></A><A HREF="gen.htm"> </A>and even <I><A HREF="cheat.htm">How
to Cheat in the Leaving Certificate</A></I>, <I>The Nephew</I> does not
achieve the standard that Irish films have been reaching of late. Of course
we should remember that it is not that long since a film like this would
have been the one indigenous production of the year, so we should be grateful
that we have better films to compare it with, badly as it fares against
them. This is insufficient justification for a recommendation though, and
<I>The Nephew</I> is really best avoided by all except the curious.</P>

		In addition to being the warmest year on record when averaged over the entire globe, 2015 was also notable for all-time extreme heat records. Sixteen nations or territories tied or set all-time records for their hottest temperature in recorded history in 2015, and two (Israel and Cyprus) set all-time cold temperature records. For comparison, only two nations or territories set all-time heat records in 2014, and nine did in 2013. The most all-time national heat records held by any year is nineteen in 2010. Most nations do not maintain official databases of extreme temperature records, so the national temperature records reported here are in many cases not official. I use as my source for international weather records researcher Maximiliano Herrera, one of the world's top climatologists, who maintains a comprehensive list of extreme temperature records for every nation in the world on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm">his website</a>. If you reproduce this list of extremes, please cite Maximiliano Herrera as the primary source of the weather records. Wunderground's weather historian Christopher C. Burt maintains a database of these national heat and cold records for 235 nations and territories on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://www.wunderground.com/climate/extremes.asp">wunderground.com's extremes page</a>. <br/><br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639im_/https://icons.wxug.com/hurricane/2016/RecordTemps2015_global-final.jpg"><br/><br/><b><big>Notable global heat and cold records set or tied in 2015</b></big><br/>Hottest temperature in the world in 2015: 52.8°C (127.0°F) at Mitribah, Kuwait on July 30<br/>Coldest temperature in the world in 2015: -82.9°C (-117.2°F) at Dome Fuji, Antarctica, September 13<br/>Hottest temperature in the Southern Hemisphere in 2015: 49.2°C (120.6°F) at Reobourne Airport, Australia, February 21<br/>Coldest temperature in the Northern Hemisphere in 2015: -63.8°C (-82.4°F) at Geo Summit, Greenland, December 16<br/><br/>Number of major worldwide stations with at least 40 years of records that recorded their highest all-time temperature in 2015: 293 (for comparison, this number was 198 in 2014.)<br/><br/>Number of major worldwide stations with at least 40 years of records that recorded their lowest all-time temperature in 2015: 13 (for comparison, this number was 15 in 2014.)<br/><br/>- On February 21, Wittenoom, Australia recorded a minimum temperature of 35.1°C, which is a new world record of highest minimum temperature for the month of February.<br/><br/>- On March 24, Esperanza Base recorded 17.5°C, which is the highest temperature ever recorded in the Antarctic mainland and second in Antarctica only to the Signy Island record of 19.8°C. Signy Island is located far away from mainland Antarctica, and is just below the conventional latitude of 60°S.<br/><br/>- On July 26, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -30.7°C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in July in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -30.5°C at the Mt McKinley AWS, Alaska, U.S.<br/><br/>- On August 27, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -43.5°C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in August in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -43.4°C at Cathy AWS, Greenland.<br/><br/>- On October 24, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -60.0°C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in October in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -57.8°C at Northgrip, Greenland.<br/><br/>- On October 27, Vredendal in South Africa recorded 48.4°C, which is a new world record of highest temperature for the month of October.<br/><br/>- For the year, Coro in Venezuela recorded a yearly average temperature of 30.5°C (86.9°F), which is the hottest ever recorded anywhere in the Americas. It is also one of the highest average yearly temperatures ever recorded in the world outside the area of the Red Sea (lowlands/depressions/coasts of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somaliland, Saudi Arabia, Yemen). Outside of that area, only Bangkok Klong Thoey Station had a higher yearly average temperature: 30.7°C in 1998.<br/><br/><b><big>All-time national and territorial heat records set or tied in 2015</b></big><br/><b>French Guiana</b> set its national heat record on November 3, when the mercury hit 37.9°C (100.2°F) at Saint Laurent du Moroni. <br/><b>Indonesia</b> tied its national heat record on October 28, when the mercury hit 39.5°C (103.1°F) at Semarang Airport.<br/><b>Anguilla</b> set its national heat record on October 10, when the mercury hit 34.2°C (93.6°F) at The Valley Airport. This was the 3rd time in 2015 Anguilla broke its all-time heat record.<br/><b>Saint Barthélemy</b> set its national heat record on October 5, when the mercury hit 35.5°C (95.9°F) at Gustavia.<br/><b>Dominica</b> set its national heat record on October 4, when the mercury hit 35.5°C (95.9°F) at Canefield Airport. That tied the record set the previous day.<br/><b>The U.S. Virgin Islands</b> set their national heat record on September 11, when the mercury hit 35.6°C (96°F) at Charlotte Amalie Airport. Note: the unofficial record listed by NOAA for the U.S. Virgin Islands is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records">99°F</a> at the Charlotte Amalie Airport in 1988, 1994, and 1996. Mr. Herrera has researched the history of temperature measurements in the islands, and found that data taken at this airport was generally reliable after 1998 and before 1972. Between 1972 to 1998, the data was seriously flawed, with minimum temperatures up to 20°F from the real temperature.<br/><b>Hong Kong</b> set its national heat record on August 8, when the mercury hit 37.9°C (100.2°F) at Happy Valley. <br/><b>Germany</b> set a new national heat record of 40.3°C (104.5°F) twice in 2015: on July 5 and on August 7, both at the Kitzingen station in Bavaria.<br/><b>Vietnam</b> tied its national heat record of 42.7°C (108.9°F) at Con Cuong on May 30. <br/><b>Palau</b> tied its national heat record of 34.4°C (94.0°F) at Koror Airport on May 14. <br/><b>Venezuela</b> set a new national heat record of 43.6°C (110.5°F) at Coro on April 29. <br/><b>Laos</b> tied its national heat record of 42.0°C (107.6°F) at Thakhek on April 20.<br/><b>Ghana</b> set a new national heat record of 43.3°C (109.9°F) at Navrongo on April 10. This was the third time in 2015 that Ghana tied or set a new all-time heat record. <br/><b>Cocos Islands</b> (Australian territory) tied their all-time heat record with 32.8°C (91.0°F) on April 8.<br/><b>Equatorial Guinea</b> set a new national heat record of 35.5°C (95.9°F) at Bata on March 18. <br/><b>Wallis and Futuna Territory</b> (France) set a new territorial heat record with 35.5°C (95.9°F) on January 19 at Futuna Airport.<br/><br/>Special Mentions: <br/><b>Antarctica</b> set a new heat record for its <i>mainland</i> of 17.5°C (63.5°F) at Esperanza Base on March 24. Previous record: 17.4°C (63.3°F) at Marambio Base, set the previous day. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has appointed a committee to study this event and determine if this represents an official record for the continent. Note that this is a record for mainland Antarctica, not a territorial or continental record. The all-time maximum record for the continent and territory of Antarctica is 19.8°C (67.6°F) on January 30, 1982, in Signy Island, South Orkney, an island group located about 450 miles northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost portion of mainland Antarctica. Geologically, the South Orkney are on the Antarctic plate, and politically, they are part of Antarctica. <br/><br/><b>Switzerland</b> had its highest reliably measured temperature on record in Geneva on July 7, when the mercury hit 103.5°F (39.7°C). The only higher temperature ever measured in the country was a 106.7°F (41.5°C) reading on August 11, 2003 at Grono. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/heat-wave_temperature-record-set-in-geneva/41536236">reported at the Swiss news site swissinfo.ch</a>, this old record was achieved "using an old measurement technique of weather huts, which generally recorded temperatures a few degrees higher than modern instruments." Weather records researcher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm">Maximiliano Herrera</a> agrees that this year's 39.7°C reading in Geneva is the highest reliably measured temperature ever in Switzerland, though the August 11, 2003 temperature at Grono was probably warmer (near 40°C), after correcting for the known problems with the site. <br/><br/><b>Samoa</b> was originally listed by Mr. Herrera as tying its national heat record with 36.5°C (97.7°F) on January 20 at Asau, but a subsequent review of the record revealed possible issues with the measurement equipment, so this record is dubious.<br/><br/><b><big>All-time national and territorial cold records set in 2015</b></big><br/><b>Israel</b> set a new national cold record of -14.2°C (6.4°F) at Merom Golan on January 10.<br/><b>Cyprus</b> set a new national cold record for an inhabited place of -10.7°C (12.7°F) at Prodromos on January 9.<br/><br/>Special Mention: <br/><b>Oman</b> set an unofficial all-time cold record of -9.7°C (14.5°F) on January 20 at Jabal Shamas. The station is located on the top of a mountain above 3000m with no living population, and its time series is very short. Therefore, the record should be considered unofficial. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Oman in any representative station is -3.6°C (25.5°F) recorded at Sayq on January 26 1983. <br/><br/>A big thanks goes to Maximiliano Herrera for providing the information in this post.<br/>	<br/>Jeff Masters<br/>

		Thank You Dr. In looking over the stats, I would note that may scientists have predicted for years now that a good portion of effects of global warming would be felt in the Northern Hemisphere (due to Arctic melt issues) and we are also seeing many equatorial regions of the Earth (where the world is always the warmest) also setting several heat records.<br><br>I was corrected yesterday, when I noted that February was usually the coldest month in North Florida (by my personal experience here) that for Conus, January is usually the coldest overall month..............I was just outside and the current temp here in Tallahassee (with the sun out) is 69. <br><br>And here is the post from the Tally NWS Office at the top of their website for 2015:<br><br><i>RECORD EVENT REPORT<br/>NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TALLAHASSEE FL<br/>1132 AM EST TUE JAN 05 2016<br/><br/>...2015 WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR TALLAHASSEE...<br/><br/>2015 WAS OFFICIALLY THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD AT TALLAHASSEE...<br/>SURPASSING THE PREVIOUS RECORD SET IN 1933 BY 0.7 DEGREES.

		Thanks for the update Mr Masters. And to Maximiliano Herrera as well.<br/>Numbers are so overwhelming, but one thing strikes me, and it has to do with Greenland:<br/><br/><em>"- On July 26, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -30.7C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in July in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -30.5C at the Mt McKinley AWS, Alaska, U.S.<br/><br/>- On August 27, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -43.5C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in August in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -43.4C at Cathy AWS, Greenland.<br/><br/>- On October 24, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -60.0C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in October in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -57.8C at Northgrip, Greenland."</em><br/><strong></strong><br/>Could it be related to the meltwater from Greenland acting as a lid spread over the ocean, slowing the downwelling part of the current around there (as well as turning the area colder, as the map of last year's global anomalies show) or are there other much more influent patterns/oscillations at work? I was maybe thinking, after the demise of the arctic summer ocean ice, the "climatologically" coldest part, the meteorologic. pole could shift more towards Greenland and Eastern Siberia than the original north pole (hence the very high temps over the North Pole in the last weeks) ; or am I on a false lead there?

With current trends of production, there will be the equivalent of several more such layers by mid-century."<br/><br/>The study suggests that plastics have such a long-lasting impact on the planet's geology because they are inert and hard to degrade. As a result, when plastics litter the landscape they become a part of the soil, often ending up in the sea and being consumed by and killing plankton, fish and seabirds.<br/><br/>Plastics can travel thousands of miles, caught up in the "great oceanic garbage patches", or eventually being washed up on distant beaches. <em>Plastics can eventually sink to the sea floor,</em> <em><strong>to become a part of the strata of the future</strong></em>.<br/><br/>The rise of plastics since the mid-20th century, both as a material element of modern life and as a growing environmental pollutant, has been widely described. Their distribution in both the terrestrial and marine realms suggests that <em>they are a key geological indicator of the Anthropocene, <strong>as a distinctive stratal component</em>."</strong><br/><br/>----------<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://phys.org/news/2016-01-nyc-defense-advances-years.html" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">Link</a> / <strong>NYC flood defense plan advances, but completion years off</strong>, <em>Phys.org</em>.

And to Maximiliano Herrera as well.<br>Numbers are so overwhelming, but one thing strikes me, and it has to do with Greenland:<br><br><em>"- On July 26, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -30.7C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in July in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -30.5C at the Mt McKinley AWS, Alaska, U.S.<br><br>- On August 27, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -43.5C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in August in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -43.4C at Cathy AWS, Greenland.<br><br>- On October 24, Geo Summit in Greenland recorded -60.0C, which is a new record of lowest temperature ever recorded in October in the Northern Hemisphere (at any elevation). Previous record was -57.8C at Northgrip, Greenland."</em><br><strong></strong><br>Could it be related to the meltwater from Greenland acting as a lid spread over the ocean, slowing the downwelling part of the current around there (as well as turning the area colder, as the map of last year's global anomalies show) or are there other much more influent patterns/oscillations at work? I was maybe thinking, after the demise of the arctic summer ocean ice, the "climatologically" coldest part, the meteorologic. pole could shift more towards Greenland and Eastern Siberia than the original north pole (hence the very high temps over the North Pole in the last weeks) ; or am I on a false lead there?<br/>	</em></blockquote><br/><br/>This is not the reason. That reason has instead caused that cold blob between Iceland and eastern Greenland, but it's not related to those temperatures in the Plateau.<br/>There are two reasons:<br/><br/>1-Geo Summit has a very short serie and it has no "competition" : it can only beat itself as Northern Hemisphere coldest temperatures for most of the months.<br/><br/>2-The Jet Polar Stream has been very compacted during 2015 during many periods of time.<br/>This might be not only for the AO and QBO, but it seems there could be a relationship with the Julian Maden oscillation aka the current Nino. Let's not forget that the world coldest temperature was in 1983 during a strong Nino and the previous one was in 1958, during another strong Nino.<br/>NAM/SAM indexes seem to have a relationship with the ENSO cycles.

		On the topic of the weather in Florida, and with apologies for a possibly/probably dumb question. . . What is the warning significance of saying that storms have the potential for the "development of funnel clouds"? Said clouds are then said to have the further possibility of touching down and forming tornadoes. Why not just say potential for tornadoes? Or is this a regional thing and is how South Florida people are used to their warnings being worded?

The public sphere still believes some kind of government conspiracy is going on. In their eyes, climate action is simply a pretext for the covert communist takeover.

By mild, I mean less rain. In fact, none of our regions top windstorms have happened during El Nino's. The joke up here is about the incredible amount of Californians here that complain about the rain. So to keep their numbers down, every few years we donate our rain to them. After a few weeks of rain they are overcome from the grey and never consider it again. It doesn't seem to work though. (Can't link the Seattle Times article because I've hit my limit for the month. However you can google it, roughly 15000 Californians moved to Seattle last year alone.)

Most areas got 1-1.5 inches overnight, now the main focus has shifted south.<br/><br/>I'll admit I had forecast the heaviest rain to be a bit further north, and I got it wrong. I didn't get it wrong for the same reason as the models had forecast though. The models had the first wave of rain much weaker and coming in later. The first upper disturbance was stronger than expected, and given that there is isentropic ascent on the right side and descent on the left, the intensification causes initially more rain followed by some drying after.<br/><br/>If you look at the SPC mesoanalysis page, you can see how there was drying and descent that was more pronounced in the central zones than expected due to the upper wave of low pressure being a bit more robust.<br/><br/>Given that, I'd say the models were a bit off except the HRRR which did depict things really well. The rest of the model guidance did well in terms of amount but not for the same reason, They showed a heavy band of rain around this time of day over central zones with the current upper wave instead it is further south by a lot, while guidance had only light rain in most areas overnight into the morning.<br/><br/>I think it's likely the NWS took note that the short wave was going to be stronger than expected, leading to heavier rains early for central zones but less later, which is what happened, hence the reason they leaned towards rainfall being focuses further south. So models were right, but not for the right reason given they showed less rain early and more later as far as central zones, as apposed to the official forecast which did get it right for the right reason.<br/><br/>Given many areas from Ft. Myers to West Palm Beach have already seen 2-4 inches with locally higher totals, some places could end up with 5-6 inches before all is said and done. As another wave of low pressure approaches tomorrow before it all clears.

My own <strong>guess</strong> is, that more ice-free ocean surface causes more wind-driven mixing across the Arctic halocline, and models have failed to take that into account. There's lot of excess heat trapped beneath that halocline. I wouldn't be surprised to see not only ice-free summers, but also ice-free winters in the majority of Arctic sea area within few decades.<br/><br/>On the other hand, that image seems to be in disagreement with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/ice-conditions" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">latest assessment</a> by the Finnish meteorological agency, when it comes to the Baltic Sea ice extent.

And what that means is that values in the winter will always be lower because the troposphere is more shallow and cooler so total water vapor that the air can possibly hold is less, but values can be relatively as high as a result. A PW of 1.7-1.8 this time of year I would estimate to be like that of around 2.0-2.2 in the summer.<br/><br/>If you remember the massive flood event in early February 2006 in the Tampa Bay area where a strong upper level trough interacted with a stalled front on the 1-4 corridor, it led to powerful squall line to develop from the gulf across the Tampa Bay area. But steering lined up such that it just got stalled for 4-5 hours at a very strong intensity. I recently read back about the event, and Ruskin had a balloon launch that was a PW of 2.1 which I believe was a record highest value for February. That would be like 2.4-2.5 during the summer, or basically a tropical system.<br/><br/>Rainfall ended up being ridiculous, Tampa had over 8 inches, Clearwater had around 9.5, and some areas in Pinellas and Hillsborough not at official stations had 12+ in just 3-4 hours. I remember I had 9.2 in my gauge in about 4 hours. The flooding was crazy.

Jedkins01:</strong><br/><em><br/>	<br><br>Yeah that is really high, because the PW is basically a vertical integration of all water vapor in the column. And what that means is that values in the winter will always be lower because the troposphere is more shallow and cooler so total water vapor that the air can possibly hold is less, but values can be relatively as high as a result. A PW of 1.7-1.8 this time of year I would estimate to be like that of around 2.0-2.2 in the summer.<br><br>If you remember the massive flood event in early February 2006 in the Tampa Bay area where a strong upper level trough interacted with a stalled front on the 1-4 corridor, it led to powerful squall line to develop from the gulf across the Tampa Bay area. But steering lined up such that it just got stalled for 4-5 hours at a very strong intensity. I recently read back about the event, and Ruskin had a balloon launch that was a PW of 2.1 which I believe was a record highest value for February. That would be like 2.4-2.5 during the summer, or basically a tropical system.<br><br>Rainfall ended up being ridiculous, Tampa had over 8 inches, Clearwater had around 9.5, and some areas in Pinellas and Hillsborough not at official stations had 12+ in just 3-4 hours. I remember I had 9.2 in my gauge in about 4 hours. The flooding was crazy.<br/>	</em></blockquote><br/><br/>What is the usual pw values for an ENSO winter versus not in central FL I wonder?

		<strong>Welcome to the Renewable Energy Renaissance — Fight to End Fossil Fuel Burning is Now On</strong><br/><br/><em>Beneath the dark and growing cloud of human fossil fuel emissions there are a few carbon-free lights being kindled among all the black, coal-ash soot.<br/><br/>They’re the lights of a new renaissance. An unprecedented period of change for governments, the energy markets, and for individuals themselves. For we are all, whether we realize it or not, now embroiled in a struggle that will determine our own fates as well as that of our children and of all the generations to follow. For this renaissance is as much about liberation — the provision of clean energy choice as means to free ourselves from a wretched captivity to fossil fuel consumption — as it is about fighting to leave those very hothouse mass extinction fuels in the ground.</em><br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://robertscribbler.com/2016/01/27/welcome-to-the-renewable-energy-renaissance-fight-to-end-fossil-fuel-burning-is-now-on/#comment-66546" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">Link</a>

I will never forget it. I believe it happened on a Friday. I made a decision to get the heck out of there once it was clear the rains weren't stopping. Some of my coworkers were stuck in the building for the entire weekend because the parking lot was flooded to the point where you couldn't drive through it. When I arrived at work the next Monday, there were easily 15-20 stalled out cars in the parking lot from people who tried to leave and didn't make it more than 50 feet before frying their car's mainframe.<br/><br/>That was in the top 3 of the hardest I've ever seen it rain.<br/>	</em></blockquote><br/><br/>What was also odd about that event, is that it wasn't a typical heavy rain event for winter, in that the thunderstorms were extremely lightning active, as in summer amounts of CG lightning for 3-4 hours. The thunderstorms had a lot of gusty winds, and I think we had a severe thunderstorm warning at least 2 separate times, unusual for a stalled training line of activity, especially in winter. At one point, we had complete whiteout conditions from pure heavy rain, almost like a severe blizzard.<br/><br/>Our neighborhood was completely flooded, and we lost power for a few hours as well from the severity of either the wind or lightning. The rainfall rates were so heavy that some roofs collapsed including a Wal-Mart. The NWS did a report on it, and mentioned that some areas in Pinellas may have seen upwards of 6 inches in one hour during the peak. It was like having the inner core of a tropical system stuck over us for 3-4 hours straight. It's odd saying that after living in Florida for 15 years, one of the most intense rainfall events I've seen happened in February.<br/><br/>What happened this past summer was insane though also, the rain gauge at my parents house recorded 48 inches of rain from June-August. It was almost hard to believe after tallying it all up, which is basically like a few months in the Amazon basin. <br/>The year total for 2015 ended up being somewhere around 76 inches, but I don't remember exactly. If the Fall and Spring hadn't have been so dry, we might have made a run for the wettest year on record.

For only the third time in recorded history, coral reefs are experiencing a global “bleaching” event (where corals turn white; some ultimately die).<br/><br/>Australia’s reefs are feeling the impact, too. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is in charge of producing global bleaching forecasts. Surprisingly, it isn’t the Great Barrier Reef facing the greatest threat this year, but Western Australia’s less well-known coral reefs.<br/><br/>NOAA predictions for the Western Australia (WA) are about as severe as they get: there is a 60% probability of the most severe bleaching (“Alert 2”) for all of April 2016.</em><br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/https://theconversation.com/western-australias-coral-reefs-are-in-trouble-we-mustnt-ignore-them-53111" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">Link</a><br/><br/>Both were very well done, And certainly worth a bookmark. <br/>

		This post refers to post 149 about the storm survey, I'm doing this to prevent posts from being too long, lol.<br/><br/>Two weekends ago, we were covering the severe event that led to two EF2 tornadoes that killed 2 people and injured an additional 7 people. Some of the damage included normal homes that were completely destroyed, and condos with roofs ripped off and numerous windows blow out with the interiors sustaining serious damage.<br/>Here we have also an example of an E1 causing notable damage, including injuries which could have been deaths had those people in the lofted cars not had been as lucky.<br/><br/>Folks, I want to stress this again, the atmosphere doesn't care where you live. Too many times, including that weekend where people died, I saw posters here, including ones from Florida, who were saying "but Florida only gets weak tornadoes, not like the Midwest which destroy things and injure/kill people". <br/><br/>Yes, Florida gets less strong tornadoes, but they DO still happen here in Florida. While only 39 tornadoes have occurred in Florida of EF3 or stronger, that's still frequent enough to make note that they do happen.<br/>Also, an EF2 is considered a strong tornado by the NWS, as we saw from Central and SW Florida, they can and do injure and kill people, and are capable of doing significant damage to normal homes and other structures. There have been 318 tornadoes rated at EF2 in Florida, that is definitely a high enough number to show strong tornadoes happen here more than assumed.<br/><br/>But even when it comes to EF1 tornadoes, as we see from the survey from post 149, they can still be very dangerous and cause quite a bit of damage. There have been 910 tornadoes rated EF1 in Florida, that's a lot.<br/>So given this, please do not ignore tornado warnings if you live in Florida, don't make the mistake of assuming you don't need to worry because they "are only weak" here. Unfortunately, Florida has a high rate of tornado deaths, and I suspect it's partly because people don't take them seriously enough here.<br/>

At the very least people who travel a lot to the tropics should always consider being inoculated , or antibiotic prophylaxis before leaving. An amazing amount of people will go on vacation or business trip without doing anything, and it is very dangerous to them , there families and even the public.

Zika is just another in a long string of tropical diseases that may threaten the continental US in the future...just not next week. Of all the tropical viruses, if I had to chose one to get, it would be Zika, since I stand an 80% chance of have no symptoms at all. The increase in resistant forms of malaria worries more than a virus like Zika, and a lot of heavy breathing about it doesn't do anyone any good.

At the very least people who travel a lot to the tropics should always consider being inoculated , or antibiotic prophylaxis before leaving. An amazing amount of people will go on vacation or business trip without doing anything, and it is very dangerous to them , there families and even the public.<br/>	</em></blockquote>There is no vaccine for Zika, and no vaccine for almost any of the tropical viruses. Antibiotic prophylaxis for malaria should be avoided unless a person has known bad side effects to non-antibiotic malaria prophylaxis. It's the overuse of antibiotics that's contributing to resistant malaria. The most important thing for anyone traveling to the tropics is to avoid mosquito bites. That's very possible using the right clothing and repellents. The danger with these mosquito vector diseases is getting it and then getting bitten by a native mosquito when you return. That's what will spread a disease, since there's no other way to spread it. <br/><br/>When it comes to how people behave, we already have a flu/pneumonia vaccine that's 80 to 90 percent effective yet only about 60% the people at risk get it. We average 500 hospitalizations a week in the US for influenza and associated pneumonia. Seven people died from confirmed influenza last week, The real number is probably higher since many flu deaths are listed as caused by other respiratory diseases. In a mild year, about 3,000 people a year that we know of die from the flu. About 15,000 to 20,000 die of pneumonia, one of the prime causes of death in the elderly. If we can't get 40% of the people to take a cheap and easily administered vaccine, I don't have much hope for people taking precautions that require real effort.

Did your doctor draw a blood sample and have it sent to a tropical disease lab? If he did, what did it show? If he didn't, you need to have a blood sample tested ASAP. Your description cover a lot of tropical diseases that get better on their own in young people. It's also descriptive of malaria, and rural areas of Guatemala are endemic with malaria. The symptoms of malaria generally cease after a few weeks, as long as it doesn't kill you. It then continues to live and reproduce in your body and can cause grave problems later in life.

It looks like we should have at least 10 days above freezing. That should get them in good shape to resist the cold that's still inevitably coming later in February. One of my requirements for a move away from California was a place that I could still plant a winter garden. The first eight years here in SE Alabama were pretty good for winter gardens. From 2014 on, it's been pretty brutal though. I'm hoping to see a winter when the nighttime temperatures maybe stay at 30 or above rather than the teens and single digits like I've had since 2014.

Just the fact the precipitation was all ahead of the front mitigated against any heavy rain. Some places in north central Alabama did near an inch but it was a complete fizzle here. It was like watching a grape turn into a raisin watching it on radar last night. I'm hoping next week's possible severe weather also turns out to be a fizzle. One thing that Florida and I have in common this winter is that any storms even marginally capable of producing a tornado does produce a tornado, and more than one here. All EF-0 or EF-1's so far, but that luck is probably not going to hold as we get into our real severe storm season.

Would you also admit that "<strong>North Pole Above Freezing</strong>" headline was really just clickbait? The real story was not if the North Pole hit 33.

They are currently debating if the buoy data was good enough to use as a proxy of the North Pole hitting 33. It has happened before, or at least buoys near the North Pole have been above freezing before. It has never happened in December before, so that's why it was a story. Did it make it to 33? I guess those that know will make a ruling on it at some point, but it's the overall heat in the Arctic that's the issue, not just one day at Santa's workshop...or at least Mom always told me that's the address of Santa's workshop. :-)

Usually this is done in the spring with aircraft landing on the sea ice. However, in August 2015, the US Coast Guard with additional support from agencies such as the Office of Naval Research and NOAA carried out a ground breaking atmosphere-ice-ocean observation flight to the North Pole. This grew out of our Office of Naval Research-funded Seasonal Ice Zone Reconnaissance Surveys done by Coast Guard Station Kodiak in their C130 aircraft. The North Pole flight included&nbsp;air-dropping an IABP satellite-tracked, drifting, meteorological buoy (AXIB)</a>&nbsp;measuring &nbsp;atmospheric temperature and pressure. Because it was dropped at the Pole in August, this AXIB, buoy 132472, at 87.5°N, 12°W, is currently our closest to the Pole.<p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 20.16px;"><strong>What the NPEO/IABP buoys tell us about the 12/30/2015 warming event:</strong><br>AXIB 132472’s data along with that of other NPEO-deployed buoys are found at the&nbsp;North Pole Environmental Observatory</a>. As of 12/30/2015 at 1800Z, buoy 132472 was reporting the air temperature as -23.5°C (-10°F) which is pretty normal. However, looking at data from the last two days, courtesy of the&nbsp;<em>Wendy Ermold</em>&nbsp;of theInternational Arctic Buoy Programme</a>&nbsp;we see that over a couple of days the AXIB reported temperature near the North Pole rose significantly. It was -37°C at 1800Z, 12/28/2015 and reached a maximum of -8.52°C on 12/30/2015 at 0300Z, quite a rapid transition. So in summary, the forecast warming was qualitatively pretty good even though temperatures at the Pole didn’t reach up to the freezing point. In fairness the forecast front was very sharp so if it didn’t get quite as far north, that would explain temperatures at the Pole being significantly cooler than forecast.<p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 20.16px;"><strong>1/1/2016 Update on what NPEO/IABP buoys tell us about the 12/30/2015 warming event:</strong><br>Several bloggers and reporters brought it to our attention that at least one buoy near the North Pole had exceeded 0°C.&nbsp;The Washington Post reported&nbsp;</a>reported that “WMO ID Buoy 6400476 at a latitude of 87.45 degrees North hit a high temperature of 0.7 degrees C…” This was not one of the buoys that NPEO deployed in 2015, but Wendy found this buoy in the IABP database as imei 300234062788470. To get a better idea of how the warming progressed through the Central Arctic Ocean,&nbsp;Wendy has put together a sequence of maps</a>with all the IABP listed buoy positions color coded by temperature.<p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 20.16px;"><strong>For reference to earlier reports,</strong>&nbsp;the NPEO-deployed AXIB 132472 and WMO 6400476 (300234062788470) are identified by name. One can scroll through hourly maps and see the buoys report the passage of the warming through the North Pole region. At 0300Z on 12/30 AXIB 132472 at about 87.5°N, 44°W reached its maximum temperature of –8.52° C. At 1300Z on 12/30. WMO 6400476 (300234062788470) reached its maximum temperature of +0.7° C at about 87.5°N, 151°E, almost exactly on the opposite side of the Pole from the AXIB. Simple interpolation would suggest that the Pole never rose above freezing, but it is more significant that above-freezing temperatures actually projected farther into the Arctic Ocean than the Pole.<p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 20.16px;"><strong>It may be even more significant that the front passed the Pole in East longitudes</strong>, on the Russian side of the Pole. The projection of low atmospheric pressure associated with this storm event promotes a high Arctic Oscillation Index and forces a counterclockwise (cyclonic) wind pattern that accelerates the Transpolar Drift of sea ice across the Basin and out Fram Strait. By itself, a few hours of temperatures above freezing will likely not have a big impact on the Arctic Ocean ice pack. But accelerating the export of ice in winter depletes the Arctic Ocean of older thicker ice, leaving the extent of the thinner ice pack more sensitive to summer melt. In this connection, perhaps the most significant NPEO buoy result (see the&nbsp;NPEO 2015 Data Buoy Drift Map tab</a>) is that the NPEO buoys deployed near the North Pole in April are already (on 1/1/2016) south of 76°N in the Greenland Sea. In the early years (~2000-2005) of NPEO it typically took buoys deployed near the Pole one year to reach Fram Strait at 80°N. The roughly factor of two increase in speed shown is partly due to decreases in ice thickness and strength, but it is safe to predict that if cyclonic storm events like this one ending 2015 continue penetrating the eastern Arctic Ocean, they will increase ice export and reduce summer 2016 ice extent.&nbsp;<br><br><em>— Jamie Morison for the NPEO</em><p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 20.16px;">&nbsp;

A normal blood test is looking for things like white cell count and typical bacteria. Unless a sample is sent to a lab specializing in tropical diseases, a typical lab isn't looking for them and won't spot them. The chances are excellent you just got some unusual bacteria in your gut, and feeling like you were going to die is nature's way of not actually killing you...just making you feel like it might happen. It's usually because we <em>norte americanos</em> just cant resist all that luscious looking fruit at the hotel buffet. C'mon, now, tell the truth. You just had eat that pineapple or papaya or whatever fruit you didn't wash yourself, right? That's the most efficient way to get that crud in your gut. I wouldn't know, however, only reading about such things in text books, because I never ate any of that fruit...except for those grapes...and maybe that pineapple...a few times. :-)<br/><br/>It's not likely you got malaria, but the chance, just like a tornado coming down your street, is not zero. Talk to your doctor and see if he or she thinks a tropical disease blood test is worth it. Everyone's reaction to malaria is different, so the symptoms that you've read about are only typical ones, and we all know you're not typical, and I mean that in a good way.. Amiright?<br/><br/>Now, one last thing, since SAR is in his grandpa preaching mode. Never, ever again go anywhere in the tropics without taking a course of Chloroquine (or whatever your doctor recommends) before you leave and while you're away. It's cheap, doesn't make you feel too awful while you're taking it, but protects you from one of the most insidious diseases on earth. It has nasty, lifelong complications. My dad was in the Pacific for almost three years during The Big One, and didn't take his Atabrine because he heard it made the engine room controls down below get kind of flabby. As a result, he got malaria, and it wasn't properly treated for almost five years. He spent the rest of his life suffering from the disease, including terrible rheumatism and heart problems. Those mosquitoes know when a nice healthy white guy has shown up, and then the attack is on. I have spent lots of time in the tropics and I never contracted a mosquito borne illness. Those pineapples were another story, but you already know about that.

If it's really a world like none of us has seen, that would include you, and being able to tell much about what you haven't seen is...well, pretty difficult. You live in a dark world, Bob. I'd rather not do that until I really do know what's ahead rather than pretending I know. <br/><br/>We have two choices. We can do our best to live our lives as well as we can, helping those in need while we can, and trying not to do our part not make all the problems of the future worse. The other choice is to give up all hope and find a place like Scribbler's, where he'll feed that "we're all doomed" outlook you seem to think is our only option. We're headed for tough times ahead, but the world has always been headed for tough times ahead.

There is also a pretty good chance that for a relatively small expenditure compared with many tens of billions spent on researching treatments for chronic diseases we can develop a vaccine against Zika. Why would we not want to do that? And any investment in removing standing water close-by human settlements will also help against malaria, dengue and other diseases. Why would we not want to do that?<br/><br/>So, panic over Zika, no. But recognize the threat and take sound, effective actions against it, yes, absolutely.

It's spread to tropical America, probably not, though that is undoubtedly due to human activity. But, the potential to spread to regions that are not presently hospitable to the Aedes mosquito but will be in a warmer world does indeed have to do with climate change. Does that mean we are doomed? No, because humans clearly survive in the tropics despite a plethora of diseases. But it is a risk we should be aware of and prepared to deal with, rather than brushing off.

It's cheap, doesn't make you feel too awful while you're taking it, but protects you from one of the most insidious diseases on earth. It has nasty, lifelong complications. My dad was in the Pacific for almost three years during The Big One, and didn't take his Atabrine because he heard it made the engine room controls down below get kind of flabby. As a result, he got malaria, and it wasn't properly treated for almost five years. He spent the rest of his life suffering from the disease, including terrible rheumatism and heart problems. Those mosquitoes know when a nice healthy white guy has shown up, and then the attack is on. I have spent lots of time in the tropics and I never contracted a mosquito borne illness. Those pineapples were another story, but you already know about that.<br/>	</em></blockquote><br/><br/>Got a bad case of malaria in 85 during some "adventure travel" into denied areas of Burma. I was taking my preventative drugs, fansidar and chlorquinine like I should have but it was a strain resistant to those drugs because the area where I traveled was involved in an long going guerrilla war between the hill tribes and the govt in Rangoon and never had any organized malaria control efforts. The vivax malaria was like a bad case of the flu, headaches, body aches, with high fevers at night and low fevers in the day. The falcaprium malaria was much worse with the fever building and building while the bugs killed your red blood cells until the dead blood cells would clog the capillaries in your brain resulting in a coma and death. Needles to say, I was saved by intense hospitalization before it got to that point.<br/><br/>But there were complications like a damaged spleen, chronic fatigue, and loss of memory. I have recovered from it all except the memory loss which has gotten worse, probably complicated by "Old Timers Disease" and my smoking some "wacky tobaccy" when I was young and dumb.<br/>

It's perfectly reasonable to take preventative measures. It's perfectly reasonable to develop treatments and vaccines and tests.<br/><br/>But is the disease bringing on the zombie apocalypse? Is it a world ending catastrophe? Is it going to wipe out humanity overnight? Not remotely. But the media/social panic would have one thinking otherwise, and that's dangerous. Why? Because people vote and the more fear people have the less rational their decisions are.<br/><br/>For example, Zika is a tropical virus moving up towards the US. You have candidate A who says we should increase medical and biological research to find better cures and treatments for diseases. You have candidate B saying they're going to build a wall along Mexico and prevent any immigration to "stop Zika". Who get's the vote? After a couple of TV ads showing deformed infants being linked to "dirty evil Mexicans", candidate B will likely win by a landslide.<br/><br/>Remember how effective the "Wolf" ad was for Ronald Reagan?

We got about 2" and haven't seen any lightning or heard any thunder. Just some nice steady rains.

		Tropical Cyclone Warning Center Perth<br/>Tropical Cyclone Advice #7<br/><strong>TROPICAL LOW 08U</strong><br/>9:02 PM WST January 28 2016<br/>=============================<br/><br/>At 8:00 PM WST, A Tropical Low <strong>(1000 hPa)</strong> located at 16.7S 117.7E or 415 km north northwest of Port Hedland and 455 km north of Karratha has 10 minute sustained winds of 25 knots with gusts of 45 knots. The tropical low is reported as moving south at 7 knots.<br/><br/>Dvorak Intensity: T2.0/2.0/D1.0/24 HRS<br/><br/>The low is gradually strengthening and is forecast to become a tropical cyclone during Friday as it tracks southwards towards the Pilbara coast. It is forecast to reach category 2 intensity when it makes landfall on Saturday morning between Pardoo and Karratha, including near Port Hedland.<br/><br/>GALES may develop in coastal parts between Wallal and Dampier, including Port Hedland and Karratha, during Friday evening or overnight into Saturday morning. If the system tracks further to the east then GALES may develop as far east as Bidyadanga. If the system tracks further west then GALES may extend as far west as Mardie during Saturday.<br/><br/>DESTRUCTIVE WINDS with gusts to 150 km/h may occur near the centre on Saturday morning and afternoon including in the Port Hedland area.<br/><br/>Tides between Pardoo and Karratha are likely to rise above the normal high tide mark with very rough seas and possible flooding of low-lying coastal areas east of the crossing point.<br/><br/>Heavy rainfall associated with the system is likely to develop over the Pilbara and far western Kimberley from Friday and extend further inland as the system continues to track southwards on Saturday. A Flood Watch is current for the Pilbara and a Flood Warning is current for the De Grey River Catchment, see www.bom.gov.au/wa/warnings/ for more details.<br/><br/>Forecast and Intensity<br/>==============<br/>12 HRS 18.0S 117.7E - 30 knots (Tropical Low)<br/>24 HRS 19.2S 117.9E - 45 knots (CAT 1) northwest of Port Hedland/northeast of Karratha<br/>48 HRS 22.1S 119.0E - 30 knots (Tropical Low) Overland Western Australia<br/>72 HRS 28.0S 124.6E - 25 knots (Tropical Low) Overland Western Australia<br/><br/>Additional Information<br/>==============<br/>Deep convection was sustained west and south of the center during the day favored by strong upper divergent flow, reasonable monsoonal low level inflow and warm ocean temperatures in excess of 30C. Development has been gradual offset by moderate NE shear and by being quite broad and monsoonal by nature. Intensity of 25 knot maximum winds based upon Dvorak technique using a curved band pattern of -0.3 wrap in the past few hours indicating a DT of 2.0 consistent with a standard 24h development for the MET=2.0 as well. Otherwise there has been no recent Scat pass or objective guidance available. <br/><br/>The low has moved steadily to the south under the influence of a mid-level ridge to the east and monsoonal flow to the north, ahead of an upstream upper trough. Numerical weather prediction guidance is consistent in persisting the motion towards the Pilbara coast, and there is higher confidence than normal in the track. Landfall is forecast for Saturday morning between Pardoo and Karratha, including Port Hedland. <br/><br/>While gradual development is forecast in the next 24 hours to tropical cyclone intensity there is the risk of more rapid intensification in the 12 hours before landfall as the wind shear decreases. <strong>Landfall intensity is forecast to be at the higher end of what model guidance suggests at category 2 [55 knots] but there remains some uncertainty at this range. </strong><br/><br/>Tropical Cyclone Watches/Warnings<br/>=========================<br/>A TROPICAL CYCLONE WARNING is in effect for the areas of Bidyadanga to Mardie and the adjacent inland parts to Marble Bar and Pannawonica

And while weather may be a local phenomena, climate, which IS different than weather, is both regional and global. Climate looks at long-term patterns of temperature and precipitation over a long period of time over a large, defined area, and can be applied at a global level as well. As such, Dr. Masters was, as usual, correct in his statement.

Facts are that with our industrialized agriculture-food distribution system combined with austerity squeeze on the middle and lower classes there isn't nearly as much choice when it comes to diet, unless you're a rich yuppie who can afford to eat organic. Mom and Dad working two part-time minimum wage jobs to keep a roof over their kids heads are under a lot of stress, don't you think? Drinking and smoking are like any other drug addiction, a criminalized disease; helps keep the Police-privatized-prison-"justice" industrial complex growing: good for our modern "service-based" economy, since we really don't manufacture much anymore. As for our automobile society, we made the choice to tear-down public transportation systems a long time ago, urban electric public transportation used to be available in all cities and even small towns like Wheeling, WV, until they were bought up and destroyed by GM and tire companies (e.g. see USSC <em>United States v. National City Lines Inc.</em> decision, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://www.intransitionmag.org/archive_stories/streetcar_scandal.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">http://www.intransitionmag.org/archive_stories/st reetcar_scandal.aspx </a> ). Yes, smoking is bad for you but so is auto exhaust and the dust from tires, asphalt and brake linings. Enjoy that thought on your next jog down the road, then blame yourself if you get cancer from it.<br/>I hope you are correct about Zika, that it is only a warning and not a threat, but even the CDC doesn't know that yet.

The vivax malaria was like a bad case of the flu, headaches, body aches, with high fevers at night and low fevers in the day.

		Tornado in United States of America on January 28 2016 :<br/> " Two people were reported injured and many vehicles were tossed about as a twister touched down in <em>Coconut Creek, Florida</em>. Heavy storms on Wednesday morning soaked the area, just a few miles inland from <em>Florida's Atlantic coast, between Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale</em>. At Broward College, the twister picked up cars, tossing them around. Several vehicles ended up stacked on top of others. "<br/><br/>_____________<br/><em>New research that's good news for the panspermia theory (life could be seeded, "naturally" or not, across interplanetary distances) :</em><br/><br/>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://phys.org/news/2016-01-antarctic-fungi-survive-martian-conditions.html" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">Link</a> / <strong>) Antarctic fungi survive Martian conditions</strong> (simulated on the International Space Station) and don't fare too bad in outer space too (!). <br/><br/><em>It seems some of the 'shrooms <em>will</em> survive (almost) any type of climate change. :-)</em><br/><em>This is quite similar to <em>tardigrades</em>, as you can see on</em> <strong>Tardigrades in Space</strong> <em>(TARDIS) blog</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/http://tardigradesinspace.blogspot.fr/" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">Link</a>) : <br/><br/>" At last, the first results from the TARDIS experiment have been published! Space tardigrades stood the test!<br/>YES, indeed many of the tardigrades survived the trip in space, and a few of them became the first animals to return alive after exposure to both space vacuum and solar radiation.<br/>To recall our report in Current Biology,<em> the space vacuum and cosmic radiation did not affect their survival or reproduction at all</em>. This was true for both Richtersius coronifer and Milnesium tardigradum. What this means is that <em>these animals can either protect their cells from expected damage of the extremely dehydration impact of space vacuum, or that they can repair damage that arise in some way</em>. At the moment, we don't know which is true.<br/>- Some of the samples were exposed to solar light (UV-radiation) in addition to space vacuum and cosmic radiation, and we used two different optical filters to discriminate between the combined effect of UV-A and UV-B (280-400 nm), on one hand, and effects of the full spectrum of UV, including also UV-C and Vacuum-UV (116-400 nm). <em>Obviously, UV-radiation is difficult to handle also for tardigrades, since few animals survived these exposures.</em><br/>- But <em>one of the species, Milnesium tardigradum, did better than the other, and about 12 % of those exposed to UV-A and UV-B managed to recover, although their egg production was lower than in the control animals that stayed on Earth</em>. Also a few specimens exposed to the full UV range woke up and tried to get their bodies in shape again, but failed and died a few days later. "<br/><em>Too bad for those cute animals</em>.<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639im_/http://previewcf.turbosquid.com/Preview/2014/05/25__11_52_38/5.jpg4e47c52e-f003-426e-a7f4-851638054fd4Small.jpg">

They say they're about a month away from proving it. Bit of a game changer, if they're right.<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/emerging-diseases-other-health-threats-alphabetical-i-thru-z/zika-virus/745650-brazilian-experts-investigate-if-common-mosquito-culex-is-transmitting-zika-virus" target="_blank" onclick="if(!checkUrl(this.href)) return false;" rel="nofollow">Link</a>

This mosquito can establish seasonally even in northern locations that have hot summers but is killed by freezes and has to recolonize every summer. The epidemiology of Yellow Fever prior to vaccines may provide a clue to how Zika will progress.

It was yet another blow to parts of the country which have been battered by gales and heavy rain over the past weeks. And <em>last night forecasters warned things could get even worse</em>. The Met Office predicted ice could cause problems overnight and into this morning while predicting <em>the adverse conditions were expected to continue into the weekend</em>. A yellow "be aware" warning - <em>covering the entire country tomorrow</em> - has been issued for snow, ice, wind and rain. A further 50 properties were evacuated in nearby Jedburgh amid<em> fears that flooding could equal that seen during Storm Desmond at the beginning of December.</em> "<br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639im_/http://oiswww.eumetsat.org/IPPS/html/latestImages/EUMETSAT_MSG_RGB-airmass-westernEurope.jpg"><br/>Wind will pick up there in approximately 30 hours from now.

The relativist claim that the local data means more than the global average. All data is local, but those local nodes of data are able to be scaled to obtain a global view. This isn't relativst, but relationist. We have managed to take those local nodes and combine them to create a global view and this view is important as it allows us to understand the energy budget of a larger scale system that we simply lack the ability to measure directly. There are no global thermometers, but there are a lot of local ones we can apply mathematical principles to that allow us a larger scale. This scale, when taken in context with radiative forcings paints a clear picture of what is happening to Earth. It is like a tapestry, small points strung together to create an larger image. This is not an uncommon method for creating use able data to measure things we normally cannot.

At the time it was a "scientific revolution" in disease/mosquito control, but it's possible some of the very molecules you've seen them spray have been banned since. I've heard the same problem is still happening with banana farms too close to poor communities : accidents happen in Central America / Caribbean / South America sometimes with winds carrying the stuff sprayed from small airplanes used to kill certain fungal "disease", or other chemicals over houses nearby. Consequences look not pretty in these cases.

(1) THE AREA OF CONVECTION IS NOW LOCATED NEAR 17.3S 117.1E, APPROXIMATELY 337 NM <strong>NORTH-NORTHEAST OF LEARMONTH, AUSTRALIA.</strong> ANIMATED ENHANCED INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTS <em>RAPIDLY IMPROVING SPIRAL BANDING WITH CENTRAL CONVECTION FORMING OVER A WELL-DEFINED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER</em>. A 280856Z SSMIS 91 GHZ MICROWAVE IMAGE DEPICTS <em>DEEP CONVECTIVE BANDING ON THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PERIPHERIES</em>. CURRENT DVORAK ESTIMATES OF T2.0 (30 KNOTS) FROM PGTW AND APRF SUPPORT THE <strong>CURRENT INTENSITY ASSESSMENT OF 28 TO 32 KNOTS.

I was taking my preventative drugs, fansidar and chlorquinine like I should have but it was a strain resistant to those drugs because the area where I traveled was involved in an long going guerrilla war between the hill tribes and the govt in Rangoon and never had any organized malaria control efforts. The vivax malaria was like a bad case of the flu, headaches, body aches, with high fevers at night and low fevers in the day. The falcaprium malaria was much worse with the fever building and building while the bugs killed your red blood cells until the dead blood cells would clog the capillaries in your brain resulting in a coma and death. Needles to say, I was saved by intense hospitalization before it got to that point.<br><br>But there were complications like a damaged spleen, chronic fatigue, and loss of memory. I have recovered from it all except the memory loss which has gotten worse, probably complicated by "Old Timers Disease" and my smoking some "wacky tobaccy" when I was young and dumb.<br><br/>	</em></blockquote>Holy mackerel! I've visited a few semi dangerous places in my life, but the Burmese mountains were never on my list. I'm glad you found the right doctor in time. Malaria symptoms mimic so many other diseases that it's almost always misdiagnosed unless you get to a good tropical doctor. My dad suffered from many of your problems from his malaria. He did make it to 83 before it likely contributed to his death. He was lucky to find a VA doc in 1948 who actually knew what he was doing in terms of treating malaria. Everyone else said he had a bad cold...that lasted for four years. I don't know about that "wacky tobaccy" making it worse, but there was much more potent pot and hash available when I was around it in the late '60s in California than I had ever seen before. A person I know was proudly displaying his "score" a couple of months ago, telling me what good stuff it was. All I know is that it looked like what we used to call "seeds and stems" back then. :-)

My forecast today is for decreasing clouds. Instead, I got 0.09" of rain an hour ago, and none of those clouds look like they are decreasing. Even though the front went through yesterday, it's now stationary near Tampa. That's providing enough lift to the remaining moisture to wring out yet more rain. It's also only 49 degrees here. I don't think I'm going to make it to the forecast high of 58 today. The clouds actually are thinning out upstream though, and it looks like the sun will return tomorrow. It should be a really nice weekend here.

But after Europeans arrived in the area, the native population plummeted by more than 80%, probably because of a series of devastating epidemics. A new study suggests the crash took place 100 years after the first contact with Europeans. It also suggests that the sudden drop in the local population had dramatic ecological effects, including an increase in forest fires.</i><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 15px 0px; width: 699px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Benton Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><i>The authors of the paper used a "terrific combination" of dendro-ecology—which uses the rings of trees to determine their ages and reconstruct past environments—fire ecology, and LiDAR, a remote sensing technique based on laser light, says Steve Lekson, a Southwestern archaeologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who wasn't involved in the study. “It’s such an amazing approach,” agrees Richard Nevle, an environmental scientist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who has studied the ecological effects of the American Indian population crash. “No one has really pulled all these different pieces together so well before. It raises the bar.”</i><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 15px 0px; width: 699px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Benton Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><i>American Indian populations plummeted after the arrival of Europeans in the New World, largely because of&nbsp;the spread of smallpox, typhus, measles, and other infectious diseases. But archaeologists and historians have debated the exact timing and severity of the decline. Did diseases race out ahead of colonial settlement, decimating communities that hadn’t even met Europeans? Or did it take more sustained contact between the two populations to spark epidemics?</i>

As it says at Wiki, "The climate of Bitlis can be harsh, with long winters and heavy snowfalls. Summers are hot, and often humid.". Looks like Bitlis gets crossed off my places I'd like to visit list. :-) The mountains of eastern Turkey can be a difficult place, especially to fight a war. The Russians and Turks found that out when there was a two year long back and forth struggle to capture Bitlis in WWI. If the Russian army thought the winter weather in Bitlis is bad, it must be really bad.

There's no reason to think some type of new virus or bacteria will emerge just because the Northern Hemisphere gets warmer. What is likely to happen is diseases formerly endemic only in the tropics will start spreading to places that didn't have them before. However, some of these tropical diseases, like yellow fever, smallpox, and malaria, were endemic to Alabama in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. They have been mostly wiped out by the use of vector control or vaccination. As the world gets more crowded and warmer, it's things like typhus that will begin to be a much bigger problem that purely tropical diseases.

Population will and already has led to emerging diseases, because more people means more roads built into isolated forests. HIV is the most important case-it was likely endemic in isolated areas long before it emerged on the world scene. Similarly the recent Ebola outbreak was more worrisome than previous ones, because it was carried into large cities, whereas previous ones had remained in small rural pockets.

Otherwise it is hidden in your liver. <br/><br/>When I had malaria I didnt think I had it at first because the hospital tests in Thailand turned up negative. Plus I was taking the preventative drugs by the book so how could I have malaria? Unfortunately, I contacted a resistant strain in Burma that was overwhelming the drugs that were supposed to protect me. I thought I had a FUO, a fever of undetermined origin, and that was really scaring me. When I finally got a positive blood test for malaria it was a relief to finally know what I had. Lucky for me when I returned stateside a doc who had majored in tropical medicine pegged it and saved my life.

My former SIL was with us on a dive trip to Fiji. She didn't take her chloroquine regularly while we there, and stopped taking it altogether when she got home. Two weeks later, she was sick and, I mean, really sick. Her doctor took a blood sample, and it showed an elevated white count. He said she had the flu. On top of this, her husband was a doctor! A nitwit, but still, he was a doctor. By the time I finally convinced her to go to the one guy in Cincinnati who was a tropical disease specialist, she was much sicker. He confirmed with a differential she had malaria. She spent two weeks in the hospital hooked up to IV's, and nearly died from the dehydration alone. Malaria often doesn't become symptomatic for two or three weeks after exposure, so people will often think they are sick from something else. A rule out blood test, as you say, doesn't cost much, and it may save you from a lifelong chronic disease.

Wacahootaman:</strong><br/><em><br/>	Quote "tell the doc to have the lab check for the protozoan that causes malaria."<br><br>It will only show up in the blood when you have a high fever when the protozoa is attacking your red blood cells. Otherwise it is hidden in your liver. <br><br>When I had malaria I didnt think I had it at first because the hospital tests in Thailand turned up negative. Plus I was taking the preventative drugs by the book so how could I have malaria? Unfortunately, I contacted a resistant strain in Burma that was overwhelming the drugs that were supposed to protect me. I thought I had a FUO, a fever of undetermined origin, and that was really scaring me. When I finally got a positive blood test for malaria it was a relief to finally know what I had. Lucky for me when I returned stateside a doc who had majored in tropical medicine pegged it and saved my life.<br/>	</em></blockquote>Good point. As Pipejazz also said, you need to have the blood test done when you have a fever, even if you think the fever might be caused from something else. The malaria bug only shows itself when it's out in the bloodstream, and a fever can indicate that's happening. You had the misfortune of going to a part of the world that has some of the most resistant strains of malaria in the world. Even though you did everything right, you still got sick. Jed, being in Guatemala, was likely to have been exposed to a strain that's more likely to be killed off with treatment. One of my trips to Honduras was a medical mission. I treated kids in rural areas that had current acute episodes of malaria. They were very sick, and all we could do was to load them up on antibiotics, treat them for fluid loss, and hope for the best. It wasn't likely any of them would get hospital treatment. It was enough to make sure I always took those pills every night, even when I didn't feel like doing so.

		<blockquote class="blogquote"><strong>Quoting 378. sar2401:</strong><br/><em><br/>	Unfortunately, people who are sick and who have visited the tropics often won't get proper treatment unless they really demand it from their doctor, and their doctor has at least some training in tropical medicine. My former SIL was with us on a dive trip to Fiji. She didn't take her chloroquine regularly while we there, and stopped taking it altogether when she got home. Two weeks later, she was sick and, I mean, really sick. Her doctor took a blood sample, and it showed an elevated white count. He said she had the flu. On top of this, her husband was a doctor! A nitwit, but still, he was a doctor. By the time I finally convinced her to go to the one guy in Cincinnati who was a tropical disease specialist, she was much sicker. He confirmed with a differential she had malaria. She spent two weeks in the hospital hooked up to IV's, and nearly died from the dehydration alone. Malaria often doesn't become symptomatic for two or three weeks after exposure, so people will often think they are sick from something else. A rule out blood test, as you say, doesn't cost much, and it may save you from a lifelong chronic disease.<br/>	</em></blockquote><br/><br/>Ah rats! A new blog on my last post, again.

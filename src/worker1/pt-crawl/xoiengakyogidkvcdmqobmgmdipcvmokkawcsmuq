<p class="one"><span class="capton">An East End Factory</span> by 
Joseph Pennell (1857-1926). 1899. Illustration for Walter Besant's <span class="book">East London</span> (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1901), p. 31. </p>


<p>Among the main types of trade in the East End, Besant explains, are "dress, furniture, building, and machinery" (24). Nor were these all small concerns &mdash; sweat-shops, backyard workshops and so on. Jerry White writes, "the absence of large factories in London has been exaggerated." He explains that later in the period especially, "giant factories were a feature of London's working life" (173). Pennell shows a typical arrangement here, with his "East End Factory" close to the canal and its barges, tall masts from the ocean-going ships in the background, and a railway signal to the right. The interconnectedness of industry and transport could not be made plainer.</p>

<H3>(aka X-Men 2, X-Men United)</H3>

<P>D: Bryan Singer<BR>
S: Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen</P>

<P>The sequel to <I><A HREF="xmen.htm">X-Men</A></I> is an equally accomplished
comic book film aimed at audiences above the age of seven. It aspires to
actual characterisation, comes with a sly sense of humour and a strong thematic
centre, and it draws genuinely good performances from a willing cast including
distinguished Brit actors Brian Cox and Ian McKellen. Picking up roughly
where the original left off, the film opens with its most impressive scene
(never a good thing), introducing a new character, Nightcrawler (Alan Cummings)
as he launches an assault on the American President using his teleporting
abilities. Shortly afterwards we are introduced to the new villain, Stryker
(Cox), a vengeful military advisor whose campaign against the mutants goes
much further and deeper than the political demagoguery in part one. His
plan is to wipe them out entirely, and it does not take long to realise
that he also has something to do with the horrific memories which have haunted
Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) since the original and have yet to yield answers.
</P>

<P>The overriding theme of the X-Men franchise has always been one of the
lack of tolerance for diversity in our society and the schizms within disenfranchised
communities which can misdirect their energies. A thread along these lines
continues throughout <I>X2</I>, but was more fully explored in the first
film, leaving director Bryan Singer free to go in new directions from this
underlying base. The central themes in this film are of patrimony and education,
the systems which enforce and reinforce social prejudice and perpetuate
division. On one hand is the story of how Wolverine gained his claws, a
story of authority, shifting loyalties and divergent destinies which question
the nature of heroism and the right to choose one's own path regardless
of social conditioning. Meanwhile there is the story of Stryker himself,
a disillusioned father who blames Professor X (Patrick Stewart) for the
demise of his son, and, following a raid of Xavier's school which forces
the students to flee, we are introduced to Iceman's family, whose response
to his revelation that he is a mutant requires little decoding to read in
terms of an 'outing'. Families, fathers, creeds and beliefs are all thrown
into the mix here, and with the previously villainous Magneto (McKellen)
teaming up with the X-Men to outwit Stryker, the audience's sense of the
fault lines of heroism is located in more complex character dynamics than
usually expected of the genre. As in the first one, heroics are less a matter
of outrageous set pieces and more about values and choices in context.</P>

<P>The film is also careful to spend more time with its female characters.
Jane Grey (Famke Janssen) is thrust firmly centre stage with an unconventional
romantic triangle in which most of the angst and none of the pleasures are
hers. In a desperately unconvincing finale [spoiler alert] (which reprises
the climax of <I>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</I>, only without the sense
of necessity) she even gets to save the day by an act of sacrifice which
is her choice and hers alone. Storm (Halle Berry) also gets a little enhancement
this time, mostly through her relationship with the timid Nightcrawler (revealed
to have been under evil influences in the opening attack), though Rogue
(Anna Paquin) demonstrates a more genuine level of development as she pursues
a romantic relationship against seemingly impossible odds (given that she
cannot actually touch anyone with her bare skin). Even Mystique (Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos) gets to define herself on equal terms with those around her
and demonstrate skill, strength, and sensuality worthy of an effective villain
who could just as easily be a hero if she chose.</P>

<P>Choice and consequence are central to the film in every sense. The character's
choices, rooted as they are in specific conditions and circumstances, determine
the flow of the narrative, which, in turn, tells a meaningful story of the
importance of making decisions and the ability to change one's mind when
it is necessary. The film is also about having faith in oneself, about knowing
the basis for any given choice and understanding how taking a particular
path will affect the lives of others. The explicitness of the religious
sub-text is most unusual in a genre piece like this, but with Nightcrawler's
constant praying and his discussions on the subject of belief, it is impossible
to ignore its significance. Religion even provides the film with its most
emotionally powerful moment, as Nightcrawler recites the Lord's prayer in
a moment of quiet reflection unlike anything you will have seen in a superhero
movie before. Not all the choices are good ones, of course, and one nice
element of the plot is the depiction of the seduction of Pyro by Magneto,
a portrait of emergent villainy rooted in disillusionment, bitterness, and
adolescent angst.</P>

<P><I>X2</I> is not an unqualified success any more than its predecessor
was. Just as it possesses most of the strengths of <I><A HREF="xmen.htm">X-Men</A></I>,
it also suffers from its flaws. Again there are too many characters to allow
the film to ever settle down properly with any of them (though it comes
closer than its predecessor), again there is a sense of incompletion which
runs deeper than the teaser finale setting up part three, and again the
action scenes, though much improved, are never as rewarding as the genre
requires them to be. The climax in which [spoiler alert] Jane Grey gives
her life for the others is a problem because of the 'why?' factor in spite
of the weight it carries in story and character terms, and this weakens
the power of the storytelling on the whole.</P>

<P>There is still much to admire though, and to enjoy. The film's sneaky
sense of humour helps it past some of the hurdles of the genre, the performances
are very good, and the whole film has the same slick visual style as its
predecessor. Fans will enjoy it, casual viewers may also, and it seems likely
enough that there will be a third outing in which hopefully Singer gets
to finish what he has started before turning over the reins to someone else.
<I>X2</I> definitely has the feeling of something still in progress, though
a complete enough narrative in itself, and it would be nice to see it work
itself out.</P>

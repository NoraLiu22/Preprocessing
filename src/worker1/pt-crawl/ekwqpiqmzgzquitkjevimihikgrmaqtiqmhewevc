The 
Welsh Tricolour (&quot;Cymru Rhydd Diolch yn Fawr&quot;) is attributed to Rhys Gethin II. The Black Star 
represents unity and remembrance for all who have died fighting for Cymru 
(Wales). I have often seen the tricolour, but never as an actual flying flag, 
only as pictures.<i><br>

A horizontal tricolour has apparently been used by various groups over the years 
as a Welsh republican tricolour.<i><br>
Leighton Smart</i>, 11 February 2003<P>
I believe that the flag always bears a black star in the white stripe and I only 
know of the vertical version. The horizontal version could be confused with the
<a href="bg.html">Bulgarian flag</a> (only changing the order of red and green) 
and I assume it is less used, at least without a star.<br>
<i>Jaume Ollï¿½</i>, 17 February 2003<P>
I have never seen the 'Welsh tricolour' flag used on your website. The original 
Welsh tricolour which is occasionally used consists of a blue top, a white 
middle and a green bottom with the word Cyfiawnder (justice) on the white.<br>
<i>Muiris Mag Ualghairg</i>, 18 April 2003<br>
[Editor's note: see our page on <a href="gb_chart.html">Chartist flags</a>.] <P>
I have never seen these red, green, white flags with or without a black star - 
perhaps they are common in the north?<br>

The Welsh republican flag originated with the first Welsh Republican Movement 
(1950's) this flag is the usual Republican Tricolour. Welsh Republican Flag 
Colours are left to right Green, Red and White, It does not have a black star on 
it this is a 2002 innovation by Cymru 1400 USA. Unfortunately for a variety of 
reasons historically Welsh Republicanism was an extremely late development only 
originating in the 1950's. On 22 February 1797 a French expeditionary force 
landed at Garreg Gwasted near Fishguard sadly they were greeted by an hostile 
'Crown &amp; Country Brit Mob' and not a 'United Welshman Movement'. Wales then was 
not as Ireland seething with nationalist resentment to English colonial rule to 
compensate for this in present times some Welsh patriots of a &quot;Republican 
persuasion&quot; regard 22 February as a might have been &quot;Welsh Republic Day&quot;.<br>
<i>G. Gruffydd</i>, 2 March 2005<P>
The Welsh Tricolour, long associated with nationalism and republicanism, was 
seen proudly and defiantly flying during the royal opening of the new home for 
the National Assembly for Wales 'The Senedd' yesterday (1 March 2006 St Davids 
Day). The flag was the more traditional vertical striped green, red and white 
(without the black star). <br>

<span lang="en-ca">In &quot;The Young Republicans&quot; by &quot;Gweriniaethwr&quot; isbn 0 86381 
362 3 , I read that at the founding conference on 24th and 25th September 1949 
in Neath &quot;The Welsh Republican Movement adopted as its political emblem a 
tricolour flag of red, white and green&quot;. Also, on the 24th Nov 1949 Joyce Ann 
Williams interrupted the proceedings of the House of Commons during the &quot;Welsh 
Debate&quot; whilst displaying a &quot;red, green and white flag&quot;. In each case I presume 
that this might be the green, red and white tricolour newly invented but 
unfamiliar to the reporters ?<br>

<span lang="en-ca">The ' Variant Tricolour Flag ' may actually be an Urdd flag 
from the</span> <span lang="en-ca">1930's-40's, and the ' Welsh Republican Flag 
' and ' Welsh Patriotic</span> <span lang="en-ca">Front ' flags may thus be 
derivative from it.</span> I<span lang="en-ca"> was recently making some 
inquiries about the Urdd's colours - as to</span> <span lang="en-ca">whether 
they had had a triband flag. The reason for this is that the</span>
<span lang="en-ca">Welsh Republican Movement flag and the Welsh Patriotic</span>
<span lang="en-ca">Front flag both</span> <span lang="en-ca">seem to be 
derivatives of Y Urdd Gobaith Cymru colours. One of the</span>
<span lang="en-ca">precedents of the Urdd was the ' Byddin Cymru ' (' Army of 
Wales ')</span> <span lang="en-ca">and in its early years the Urdd</span>
<span lang="en-ca">was much more 'militaristic' in that</span>
<span lang="en-ca">mode of mass marching and coordinated gymnastic displays with 
flags</span> <span lang="en-ca">than it is now. Urdd Gobaith Cymru was 
established by Sir Ifan ab Owen</span> <span lang="en-ca">Edwards</span>
<span lang="en-ca">in 1922. His aim was to protect the Welsh language in a world</span>
<span lang="en-ca">where English dominated every aspect of life outside the home 
and the</span> <span lang="en-ca">chapel and in at least one of the issues of 
the magazine</span> <span lang="en-ca">'Cymru'r</span> <span lang="en-ca">Plant' 
that founded the movement he made his republican ideals very</span>
<span lang="en-ca">obvious.<br><br>I have read in Gwennant Davies' 'The Story of 
the Urdd 1922-1972' that</span> <span lang="en-ca">the triangular Urdd badge was 
introduced in 1944, and I note that its</span> <span lang="en-ca">order of 
colours - green, red, white - was</span> <span lang="en-ca">used in a Welsh 
Republican</span> <span lang="en-ca">Movement tricolour flag adopted in 1949 ( 
and there was a later</span> <span lang="en-ca">Patriotic Front flag of the 
1960's with these colours organised</span> <span lang="en-ca">horizontally ). 
These two dates</span> <span lang="en-ca">are very close, and suggest that</span>
<span lang="en-ca">either the latter is derived from the former or that they had 
a common</span> <span lang="en-ca">origin. Davies' book also mentions that in 
1926 &quot;the first Urdd banner</span> <span lang="en-ca">was presented&quot;</span>
<span lang="en-ca">and that by the summer of 1927 each Adran had its own</span>
<span lang="en-ca">banner in its own choice of colours. I take it from photos in 
the book</span> <span lang="en-ca">that these banners were like Sunday school or 
trade union</span> <span lang="en-ca">banners,</span> <span lang="en-ca">square 
and draped from a bar, but maybe a flag is also implied ? It</span>
<span lang="en-ca">seems likely that such a flag would be a white, red and green 
triband.<br><i>David B. Lawrence</i></span>, 24 January 2009<hr>

<p>At the Cilmeri rally, which celebrates the death of the last prince of Wales, 
or alternatively commemorates the end of Welsh independence in 1282, a variety 
of people turn up for various reasons and contribute different elements to the 
days events. Welsh flags of various sorts are in evidence, and I asked 
especially to take a photo of the Croes Naid (purple with gold ring cross on it) 
which they told me was Llewelyn's battle flag (?) and a green flag with both the 
stylised white eagle <a href="gb-w-eag.html">white eagle</a> 
and red dragon on it.

<p>The green flag represents the RDM (Red Dragon Movement) that has been going 
since the 1980s. The movement has been linked with direct action and was once 
run on cell guidelines. Were rumoured to have had firearms. The movement is now 
basically defunct even more so after the Welsh Assembly Referendum where under 
guidance of Dennis Coslett (former FWA commandant) they deemed no direct action 
was further needed as the will of the Welsh people could now shape the destiny 
of Cymru.<br>

image by <I>Antï¿½nio Martins-Tuvï¿½lkin</I>, 16 May 2007<P>Gethin kindly sent me a picture, 
a flag which features &quot;The Awen&quot; a symbol devised by Iolo Morgannwg and named 
for &quot;The Muse&quot; and used in his mystical bardic alphabet where each letter had 
layers of meaning, e.g., &quot;awen&quot; also means &quot;rein&quot; and therefore implies 
&quot;government&quot;. Iolo cooked up a heady mix of democratic politics and neo-pagan 
deism, highly relevant in his day when the government and the church were both 
part of the same establishment that radicals were opposed to. Thus, given that 
this symbol is also called &quot;Y Nod Cyfrin&quot; (which could be translated as &quot;the 
secret mark&quot; or even &quot;the subtle note&quot;, as in the sense of writing cryptically * 
) there is reason to believe that this was another one of those covert signs 
used by Welsh republicans during &quot;The English Terror&quot; circa 1800 (e.g., by 
drawing it in the road dust with a stick or toe, or perhaps by holding the hand 
pointing covertly downwards with the middle three fingers spread, like an 
inverted boy-scout salute. ).<br>
<br>
Gethin tells me that this design was created by Tony Lewis and the flag above 
was made in the 1970's. Tony Lewis was the Patriotic Front president, and this 
organisation basically included all of the usual suspects and flourished circa 
1965 - 1970. The black section of the flag seems to me reminiscent of the Free 
Wales Army flag, with a gold &quot;Y Nodyn&quot; as Gethin has called it in his email to 
me (he says that originally Iolo's was red).<P>*again Gethin's variation in 
spelling is suggestive of Iolo's bardic politics' having many layers of subtle 
meaning e.g. 'nodyn/nod/-au' = note, mark, 'the tokens'. Gethin says that 
originally Iolo's 'tokens' were red and that the three strokes represent Love, 
Truth and Justice (and Daf told me that they represent something similar in that 
they declare the aspects of Iolo's Deity, a sort of 'people's god' built out of 
a democratic trinitarianism in which he challenged the corruption of British 
christianity). Gethin also tells me that this black part of the flag was used as 
an armband, i.e. it actually represents the Patriotic Front as an organisation.<P>
The remainder of this flag is a triband version of the tricolour adopted by the 
Welsh Republican Movement in 1949 (presumably because the triband associated 
with early 19c Welsh republicanism had been adopted by Hungary in 1945 - in fact 
Hungarian republicans had already used it in before in 1848, so this might also 
explain why the violet Trilliw appeared in later 19c Wales).<br>

image by <i>Chris Fear</i>, 1 July 2005<p>The black flag with the red dragon is the banner of Cymru 1400 (The 
Welsh Republican Movement).<br>
<i>&quot;Moz&quot;</i>, 17 November 2003</p>
<p>During the 1960's there was an attempt to have Plaid Cymru adopt a 
'Nationalist Flag'. It was not officially accepted and never made much headway. 
I have seen, many years ago, a design for a &quot;Welsh Separatist Flag&quot; based on the 
American confederate flag but with a green background, white St Andrews Cross 
(as confederate flag) and 13 red stars (representing the 13 old Welsh counties). 
I have not however, seen this in use other than one person's personal home flag.<i><br>

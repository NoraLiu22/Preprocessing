<a name="intro"> </a><h3>1) Scope and Application</h3>
<p>Fox News Network, LLC ("Fox News," "our" or "we") wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets (collectively, the "Fox Weather Services"). California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below. Consumers in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and states with other similar privacy laws, please see Section 9 below. By using Fox Weather Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies ("Fox News Affiliates" or "Affiliates") is available at <a style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxcorporation.com">www.foxcorporation.com</a>.</p>
<p>As set forth in our <a style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxweather.com/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> at <a style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxweather.com/terms-of-use">https://www.foxweather.com/terms-of-use</a>, the Fox Weather Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Fox Weather Services without being registered with or subscribing to Fox Weather Services and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Fox Weather Service. This Privacy Policy applies to our collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally our practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>
<a name="collection"> </a><h3>2) Collection of Information</h3>
<p>Depending on your interactions with us, we and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:</p>
<p><strong>Location Information</strong> is the information we and our service providers collect from your device that allows us to provide weather alerts, weather forecasts, news, stories, and other content for your current location and other places you can choose. This feature uses precise location (such as precise GPS coordinates) when allowed by you, as well as other kinds of location such as coarse location (as may also be provided by your device) and IP address-based location. We also collect the location information you have entered in the app and the locations associated with event tracking you have created in the Fox Weather Services. You can disable the collection of precise location at any time using your device settings.</p>
<p><strong>User-Uploaded Content. </strong>User-uploaded content consists of video, audio recordings, photographs, or other material that you upload as part of the news-gathering and other functions of the Fox Weather Services. User-Uploaded Content, including personal information, may be used publicly: published as part of our other services; published on our social media pages on other platforms; or posted and displayed on our own services. User-Uploaded Content may be used in the Fox Weather Services at our sole discretion and is subject to the Fox Weather Terms of Use. You should not upload materials that reveal your personal information or the personal information of others. If you do not wish to disclose metadata to us that may be associated with your User-Uploaded Content, you should either refrain from uploading the content or take steps to remove such metadata before uploading it.</p>
<p><strong>Registration Information </strong>is the information you submit to register for a Fox Weather Service, for example, to create an account, interact with customer service, receive a newsletter, create FutureView events or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may also include, for example, name, email address, favorite locations, and zip code.</p>
<p><strong>Activity Information.</strong> When you access and interact with the Fox Weather Services, we and our service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox Weather Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox Weather Services from mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, advertising identifiers, and geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.</p>
<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Our websites, apps, and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox Weather Services, such as pages you have visited, app features you have used, locations you have entered in the app, event tracking you have created, alerts you have received, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.</p>
<p>Other parties that support the Fox Weather Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Fox Weather Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox Weather Services or other parties’ services. Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. We do not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled "To deliver relevant advertisements," below.</p>
<p>Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser. For more information about Google Analytics, please review the site "How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services," located at <a style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, please go to <a style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox Weather Services.</p>
<p><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Fox News Affiliates or business partners.</p>
<p>Depending on your interactions with us, Fox News may not have collected information from you for each of the categories above.</p>
<p><strong>'Do Not Track'</strong>. At this time we do not respond to the "Do Not Track" signal, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how the "Do Not Track" signal should be interpreted.</p>

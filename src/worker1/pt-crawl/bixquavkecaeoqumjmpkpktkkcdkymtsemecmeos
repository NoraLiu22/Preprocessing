<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">John (James Norton) has done everything he can
to give his son more than he ever had. Life keeps getting in the way, though,
because John is a single father, works as a window cleaner, and, as a result,
only has had so much time and money to provide his son the kind of life he wants
for the boy. Near the start of <i>Nowhere Special</i>, we learn that John
doesn't have much life left to do anything more for his child, either.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Writer/director Uberto Pasolini's film is an
inherently heartbreaking one, inspired by a true story, but the most intriguing
and, ultimately, effective aspect of the storytelling is how ordinary it feels.
Yes, John is dying, of presumably untreatable cancer, but this isn't a story
about that. It's simply about the lengths to which a father will go to best
ensure that his son will have the best life the child can.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">In this moment, that means spending as much
time with the boy as possible, even though it becomes increasingly difficult for
John to even stay awake when he's with his son. In the future, that means
placing Michael (Daniel Lamont), the son, with a family that might be able to do
more for the boy than he ever could. That's the theory, at least, but how can
John be certain that complete strangers will provide for, care for, or even just
accept someone else's child with the kind of love he has now and would have had
decades from now?</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">For most of the film, death isn't the first
thing on John's mind, although it's not the last thing, either. He has no
illusions of some sort of medical miracle, but he can't stop to think about
dying at the moment. For one thing, he still has a profession to maintain,
because he's still his son's only provider. For another, John has to visit
multiple homes, looking for a family that will meet the necessary but uncertain
requirements he has for the kind of people who should raise his son.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Finally, the man has no idea how to tell
Michael that the boy soon won't have his father any longer or if he even wants
to burden a 4-year-old child with that information. The kid's mother left the
two of them, after realizing a child wasn't going to repair the issues she and
John had, and now, the boy's father will be gone, too. Would it be better for
the kid to grow up with that knowledge and have ways to remember his father or
for John to simply disappear from Michael's life, hoping that the boy won't
remember him and have his adopted family as the only one he truly knows?</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">These are impossible questions, and in simply
letting us watch John go through the everyday challenges of living while dying
and the process of trying to select a family, the film acknowledges them as
such. There has to be an answer, because social services has its timeline to
make sure Michael will have a home and John will become too weak to do much of
anything soon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It's the most important decision John will ever
make, as he tells one of the social workers. What he doesn't say but is at the
heart of the problem is that he cannot and will never know if any decision will
be the correct one—if there even is one in such a situation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The whole of the story builds toward
devastation. It has to, because that's the reality of this scenario. The reason
the impact by the end is as intense as it is here, though, is in the way
Pasolini sticks to the simple realism of John's life as a working man, a father,
and someone trying to keep his imminent mortality at an arm's length, if only
because there's so much for him to do before that finality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The narrative, then, amounts to a series of
vignettes, which let us see John, Michael, and the father-son bond in little
moments. While cleaning windows, John might spot children's bedrooms or
playrooms and see all of the things he hasn't been able to give his son—not
with resentment or even regret but maybe with a little hope that Michael will
have that someday. The two spend time watching television, reading stories, and
playing at the park, although John can't do much physical activity to keep up
with his son.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">On visits to those possible families for
Michael, John listens to potential adoptive parents and scans their homes, and
in a private conversation with kind-hearted social worker Shona (Eileen
O'Higgins), he admits that he was hoping a single family would stick out from
the crowd in an instant. That hasn't happened, and he's starting to fear it will
never will.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Norton's performance is one of quiet, complex
particulars. Here's a man who doesn't say much, partly because that's the way he
is, growing up in foster homes and being raised to believe that showing emotion
is a sign of weakness, but mostly because his mind has to process so much that
doesn't make sense. How can he explain any of this to a child if he can't know
what will happen, understand why it's happening, and be optimistic about how
Michael's life will turn out as a consequence of this tragedy?</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">All of these little moments of affection
(Michael putting a blanket over his dad, who has fallen asleep before the kid
joins him to watch TV) and fear (John's regular work route has him passing a
cemetery) and contradiction (John watches a boy a few years old than Michael
cross the street on his own, knowing that will be his son one day that he'll
never see) in <i>Nowhere Special</i> build and build. They feel authentic, so
the inevitable heartbreak of the film is, too.</font>

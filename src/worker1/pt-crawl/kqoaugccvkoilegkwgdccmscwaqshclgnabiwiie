                <span class="note" id="note-1"><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a> <strong>Textual note</strong>. The decree was originally set up in the Agora in the “<a class="highlight" href="http://agora.ascsa.net/id/agora/monument/tholos">Sunshade</a>” (Skias), on the Acropolis, in <a class="highlight" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/580062">Piraeus</a> and at <a class="highlight" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579920">Eleusis</a> (ll. 60-62, cf. 56-57). The text is based on an 18th-century transcript of the Acropolis copy produced by Fourmont and a fragment of the Agora copy, containing lines 49-62 (<i>Agora</i> XVI 322  = <i>SEG</i> 24.147). AIO follows C. Doyen's edition of the text, which is based on close study of Fourmont's original transcript, except that we indicate all uncertain letters with underdots, rather than replicating Doyen's system for indicating different levels of uncertainty (<i>Chiron</i> 46, 2016, 453-87 = <i>SEG</i> 66.125; online English summary  in <a class="highlight" href="https://research-bulletin.chs.harvard.edu/2016/04/13/an-athenian-decree-revisited/"><i>CHS Research Bulletin</i> 4, 2015</a>). Though deliberately diverging in some details, we acknowledge debts to Austin and Doyen in our translation. For another recent edition and analysis of this decree, written without knowledge of Doyen's work, see M. Rizzi, <i>Marktbezogene Gesetzgebung im späthellenistischen Athen: der Volksbeschluß über Maße und Gewichte</i> (2017) = <i>SEG</i> 67.68.<br/><br/>
This decree is attributed by Tracy to the “School of the Cutter of <i>IG</i> II<sup>2</sup> 1028” (131/0-98/7 BC) and is dated by him to ca. 120 BC. It modifies the Athenian standard measures for dry volume and weight, probably to make conversion to Roman measures easier. This would have facilitated trade in Attic markets, but also at <a class="highlight" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599587">Delos</a>, which the Romans had placed under Athenian administration in 167 BC and had become the main entrepôt for Roman trade with the Eastern Mediterranean by the end of the second century BC (cf. <a class="highlight" href="/browse/bysource/Habicht/">Habicht, <i>Athens</i></a>, pp. 246-63, 291). For earlier Athenian decrees and laws dealing with weights, measures, and coinage, see <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/OR/155">OR 155</a> and <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/AIO/819">RO 25</a>. For a (slightly later) market regulation, see <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/IGII34/214"><i>IG</i> II<sup>3</sup> 4 214</a>.<br/><br/>
We adopt the conventional articulation of the text into 9 sections. Section 1 establishes the complaints procedure and punishments for sellers who use measures other than those laid down by this decree. Section 2 provides for official copies (<i>sekomata</i>) of the master measures (<i>symbola</i>) to be manufactured and distributed to market officials (see n. 4). Section 3 defines the new measures of volume for various nuts, dried fruits, olives, and figs (see n. 6) and Section 4 does the same for measures of weight (see n. 7). Sections 5-7 provide for the safekeeping of the master measures by public slaves (see n. 12). Section 8 orders a set of official copies to be dedicated on the Acropolis (see n. 13). Section 9 outlines punishments for damaging the master measures and orders the inscription of the decree. An addendum sets a maximum charge for using validated measures (see n. 15).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-2"><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a> The <i>Skias</i> (literally, “Sunshade”) was the common name for the rotunda in the Agora where the Council prytanies dined, also known as the "Tholos". Cf. <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/IGII31/1300"><i>IG</i> II<sup>3</sup> 1, 1300</a>. <i>Ath. Pol.</i> 51.2, written in the third quarter of the 4th century BC, mentions only the city and the Piraeus as official sites of weights and measures. If this is correct, Eleusis must have been added subsequently (Clinton).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-3"><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a> On banks (literally “tables”), see  <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/AIO/819">RO 25</a> with note. This is the only attestation of the “public bank” at Athens itself, but it also appears on Athenian-administered Delos (<i>ID</i> 1416, l. 41; <i>ID</i> 1670; <i>IG</i> II<sup>2</sup> 2336 = <i>SEG</i> 32.218). Similar “public banks” are attested in other Greek cities in the Hellenistic period, notably Miletos, cf. V. Gabrielsen, in Verboven, Vandorpe, and Chankowski, <i>Pistoi dia tèn technèn</i>, 2008, pp. 115-30. For punishment by sale of confiscated property, cf. <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/IGI3/421"><i>IG</i> I<sup>3</sup> 421</a>.</span>
<span class="note" id="note-4"><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a> The “master measures” (<i>symbola</i>) were to remain in safekeeping and serve as models for the official “copies” (<i>sekomata</i>; the word literally means “counterweights” or “standard measures”) made of lead (weights) or bronze (measures of volume), which would be distributed to market officials (cf. ll. 40-43).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-5"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a> This clause seems to allow Athenians to prosecute officials before the Council to collect the fine. In Classical Athens, private individuals submitted a 'catalogue' (<i>apographe</i>) of someone's property before the courts in order to charge them with owing a public debt or fine (Todd, <i>The Shape of Athenian Law</i>, 1993, p. 360). The phrase ‘any Athenian who wishes of those for whom it is permitted’ was a key slogan of the Classical democracy, expressing the right of all citizens to undertake political action in the Assembly and the courts (Demosth. 21.47; M. H. Hansen, <i>Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes</i>, 1991, pp. 266-68). The formula appears in other Late Hellenistic inscriptions (e.g. <i>I Eleusis</i> 250, ll. 30-31; <i>IG</i> II<sup>3</sup> 4, 1132, ll. 9-10). The Council of 600 is the Cleisthenic Council, which had 500 members in the Classical period (50 from each tribe), but expanded to 600 in the Hellenistic period after new tribes were established.</span>
<span class="note" id="note-6"><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a> This section establishes a special choinix to be used for various nuts and dried fruits. The choinix was a measure of dry capacity, notionally equivalent to a weight of 240 drachmas (1 kg). There were 8 choinikes in a hekteus and 48 choinikes in a medimnos. The most common choinix was the one used for grain (= 1.10 L), but the nut-choinix is to be larger. The measure is a cylinder with a depth of five “fingers” (<i>daktyloi</i>), i.e. 100 mm. The diameter of choinikes found in the Agora is usually 140 mm (7 “fingers”), so the volume of this nut-choinix would be 1.54 L (as the decree specifies, this is roughly 1.5 grain choinikes). The contents were to be piled up above the rim, which is to be 1 finger (i.e. 20 mm) wide, to prevent the contents from spilling out (Lang and Crosby, <i>Agora</i> X, pp. 42-45). A late second-century BC measure with these dimensions survives: <a class="highlight" href="http://agora.ascsa.net/id/agora/object/p%2014431">Agora P 14431</a> (M. Crosby, <i>Hesp.</i> 18, 1949, 108-13). The second choinix for fresh almonds, new olives, and figs is to be double the size of the first (i.e. with the same diameter, but a depth of ten “fingers” or 200 mm, thus a capacity of 3.08 L). This is equal to three grain choinikes or one <i>chous</i> (the standard unit for liquid capacity mentioned in l. 55). The key Roman measure of dry and liquid volume was the <i>congius</i> (3.27 L); with contents piled up, these new measures might be nearly equivalent to a half and a whole <i>congius</i> respectively, perhaps facilitating international trade in these goods (cf. L. Breglia Pulci Doria, <i>Mélanges de l'École française de Rome</i> 97, 1985, 417-19).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-7"><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a> This section raises the weight of the commercial mina. The Athenians used two systems for measuring weight. In the system used for coins and precious metals, 100 dr. = 1 mina (435 g) and 60 minai = 1 talent (26.1 kg). For other objects, there was a separate commercial mina, which the Athenians attributed to Solon, but which was probably introduced in 480 BC, when it weighed 105 drachmas (457 g; <i>Ath. Pol.</i> 10.2; L. Kallet and J. Kroll, <i>The Athenian Empire</i>, 2020, pp. 150-151). It was raised to 112 drachmas (488 g) at the beginning of the Hellenistic period, then perhaps to 125 drachmas (544 g), and it was 138 drachmas (601 g) by the time of this decree, which raised it by a further 12 drachmas (roughly a twelfth) to 150 drachmas (653 g; L. Willocx in C. Doyen and L. Willocx, <i>Pondera antiqua et mediaevalia</i>, 2020, 23-46). The commercial talent is also increased by a twelfth from 36 kg to 39.2 kg (the 5-mina weight is to be augmented by a fifth and the increase to the 10-mina weight is not specified; both oddities are probably due to textual corruption, but for another explanation, see Doyen, in Doyen, <i>Étalons monétaires et mesures pondérales entre la Grèce et l'Italie</i>, 2016, pp. 195-97). Several of these new weights survive, including <a class="highlight" href=" https://pondera.uclouvain.be/artifact/414/">BM 1842,0728.532</a> (1 mina), <a class="highlight" href=" https://pondera.uclouvain.be/artifact/11136/">BnF Bronze 2233</a> (1/2 mina). The “make-weights” (ll. 31-36) allowed officials and merchants to continue employing existing weights by adding a few coins or a smaller weight to the scales. The new commercial mina was double the weight of the Roman pound (<i>libra</i>), which weighed 327 g and one-and-a-half times the weight of the coin mina, which would have made commercial exchange between the three systems easier (Lang and Crosby, <i>Agora</i> X, pp. 2-4; Melville-Jones).</span>  
<span class="note" id="note-8"><a href="#ref-8">[8]</a> “Crown-bearing” or “Stephanephoric” coins are the Attic “New Style” coins, which bore olive crowns on their reverses (<a class="highlight" href="http://numismatics.org/collection/1944.100.24654?lang=en">image</a> from the ANS collection). These were tetradrachms (4-drachma coins) on the Attic weight-standard (= drachma of 4.36 g), which were probably introduced at Athens in 164/3 BC, following Athens’ acquisition of <a class="highlight" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599587">Delos</a> in 167 BC. They rapidly replaced the posthumous coinage of Alexander the Great as the main international trade currency in the Aegean (cf. <a class="highlight" href="/browse/bysource/Habicht/">Habicht, <i>Athens</i></a>, 242-45, 275-79; J. Kroll in <i>The Romanization of Athens</i>, 1997, pp. 146-47). Nearly forty city-states in Greece and Asia Minor adopted similar Stephanephoric coins in the 160s BC (A. Meadows in P. Iossif, F. de Callataÿ, and R. Veymiers, <i>ΤΥΠΟΙ: Greek and Roman coins seen through their images</i>, 2018, pp. 297-318). Around the same time as this decree, a decree of the Amphictyony was erected by the Athenian Treasury at <a class="highlight" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/540726">Delphi</a>, which required “all Hellenes” in all cities and festivals to make and receive their payments using these Attic coins (<i>F. Delphes</i> III 2 139 = <i>CID</i> 4 127).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-9"><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a> The “silver standard” is the mina of 100 drachmas (n. 7). The surviving text does not specify which goods would be weighed on this standard; literary sources and temple inventories indicate that they included coinage and precious metal items (Melville-Jones).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-10"><a href="#ref-10">[10]</a> Diodoros’ responsibility for providing the measures is probably connected to his position as manager of the harbour (cf. l. 47), referred to in <i>IG</i> II<sup>2</sup> 1012 of 112/11 BC, in which the Council grants an association of shipowners and merchants called the “Synod of Zeus Xenios” permission to honour him.</span>
<span class="note" id="note-11"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a> The hierophant, chosen from the genos Eumolpidai, was the leading male priest of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Cf. <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/IEleus/233"><i>I Eleusis</i> 233</a>. Clinton infers from this clause that by this date the managers (<i>epimeletai</i>) of the Mysteries (on whom cf. <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/IGII31/915"><i>IG</i> II<sup>3</sup> 1, 915</a>) "no longer exist and that the hierophant is now the chief administrator of the sanctuary" (<i>I Eleusis</i> vol. 2, p. 278).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-12"><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a> On public slaves, see <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/AIO/819">RO 25</a> and <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/Oliver/119-121">Oliver, <i>Honours for a Public Slave</i>, 119-121</a> with notes. This section indicates that public slaves could be transferred from one role to another, and that denying them further roles was considered an effective deterrent to malfeasance. The reference to the role as a “public service” (<i>leitourgia</i>) is striking, since this term usually refers to elite monetary contributions. The Metroon was the state archive in the Agora, cf. <i>Agora</i> XIV, pp. 35-38.</span>
<span class="note" id="note-13"><a href="#ref-13">[13]</a> This is the only full list of the measures in the surviving decree (the absence of the five-mina weight mentioned in l. 33 may be an error). Dedicating copies of the measures may have been intended to provide divine sanction to the new units. For roughly contemporary dedications of measures, see <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/IGII34/316"><i>IG</i> II<sup>3</sup> 4, 316</a> from Rhamnous and <i>ID</i> 1829 from Athenian-administered Delos.</span> 
<span class="note" id="note-14"><a href="#ref-14">[14]</a> This shows the ancient Council of the Areopagos, consisting of former archons, was still performing judicial functions at this time. After the Sullan Sack of Athens in 86 BC, its political power was enhanced and it became a decree-issuing body alongside the (Cleisthenic) Council and Assembly (cf. <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/AgoraXVI/333"><i>Agora</i> XVI 333</a>; <a class="highlight" href="/inscription/AIUK43A/10"><i>AIUK</i> 4.3A, 10</a>).</span>
<span class="note" id="note-15"><a href="#ref-15">[15]</a> This clause bars officials from charging more than three obols for using validated measures and weights (when settling disputes?). Choinikes were validated by applying lead sealings (e.g., <a class="highlight" href="http://agora.ascsa.net/id/agora/object/il%20701">Agora IL 701</a> on the aforementioned <a class="highlight" href="http://agora.ascsa.net/id/agora/object/p%2014431">Agora P 14431</a>), while weights are validated by stamping them with a countermark, since adding a sealing would alter their weight (e.g. <a class="highlight" href="http://agora.ascsa.net/id/agora/object/il%20315"><I>IL</i> 315</a>, same symbol). Some of the validation symbols also appear as annual mint-marks on the stephanephoric coinage (Cf. Crosby, <i>Hesp.</i> 18, 1949, 111-12).</span>

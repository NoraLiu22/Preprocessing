The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism</h5>

    <p class="fst">
<span class="cap"><a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 250 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">A</a></span> year ago, in <em>Die
    Neue Zeit</em> (1906&#8211;07, No.&#160;52), there appeared an article by
    Joseph Diner-D&#233;nes entitled &#8220;Marxism and the Recent
    Revolution in the Natural Sciences.&#8221; The defect of this
    article is that it ignores the epistemological conclusions which
    are being drawn from the &#8220;new&#8221; physics and in which we
    are especially interested at present. But it is precisely this
    defect which renders the point of view and the conclusions of the
    author particularly interesting for us. Joseph Diner-D&#233;nes,
    like the present writer, holds the view of the
    &#8220;rank-and-file Marxist,&#8221; of whom our Machians speak
    with such haughty contempt. For instance, Mr. Yushkevich writes
    that &#8220;ordinarily, the average rank-and-file Marxist calls
    himself a dialectical materialist&#8221; (p.&#160;1 of his book). And
    now this rank-and-file Marxist, in the person of
    J. Diner-D&#233;nes, has <em>directly</em> compared the recent
    discoveries in science, and especially in physics (X-rays,
    Becquerel rays, radium,
etc.<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E088" name="bkV14E088" href="#fwV14E088">[1]</a></sup>), with Engels&#8217;
    <em>Anti-D&#252;hring</em>. To what conclusion has this comparison
    led him? &#8220;In the most varied fields of natural
    science,&#8221; writes Diner-D&#233;nes, &#8220;new knowledge has
    been acquired, all of which tends towards that single point which
    Engels desired to make clear, namely, that in nature &#8216;there
    are no irreconcilable contradictions, no forcibly fixed boundary
    lines and distinctions,&#8217; and that if contradictions and
    distinctions are met with in nature, it is because we alone have
    introduced their rigidity and absoluteness into nature.&#8221; It
    was discovered, for instance, that light and electricity

<!-- vol=14 pg=251 src=v14pp72h type= --> <a name='v14pp72h:251' /> &nbsp; 

are only
    manifestations of one and the same force of
nature.<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E089" name="bkV14E089" href="#fwV14E089">[2]</a></sup> Each day it
    becomes more probable that chemical affinity may be reduced to
    electrical processes. The indestructible and non-disintegrable
    elements of chemistry, whose number continues to grow as though in
    derision of the unity of the world, now prove to be destructible
    and disintegrable. The element radium has been converted into the
    element
helium.<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E090" name="bkV14E090" href="#fwV14E090">[3]</a></sup> &#8220;Just as all the forces of nature
    have been reduced to one force, so all substances in nature have
    been reduced to <em>one substance</em>&#8221;
    (Diner-D&#233;nes&#8217; italics). Quoting the opinion of one of
    the writers who regard the atom as only a condensation of the
    ether,<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E091" name="bkV14E091" href="#fwV14E091">[4]</a></sup>
    the author exclaims: &#8220;How brilliantly does this confirm the
    statement made by Engels thirty years ago that motion is the mode
    of existence of matter.&#8221; &#8220;All phenomena of nature are
    motion, and the differences between them lie only in the fact that
    we human beings perceive this motion in different forms. . . . It
    is as Engels said. Nature, like history, is subject to the
    dialectical law of motion.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 251 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">On</a> the other hand, you cannot take up any of the writings of the
      Machians or about Machism without encountering pretentious
      references to the new physics, which is said to have refuted
      materialism, and so on and so forth. Whether these assertions
      are well-founded is another question, but the connection between
      the new physics, or rather a definite school of the new physics,
      and Machism and other varieties of modern idealist philosophy is
      beyond doubt. To analyse Machism and at the same time to ignore
      this connection&#8212;as Plekhanov
does<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E092" name="bkV14E092" href="#fwV14E092">[5]</a></sup>&#8212;is to scoff at the
      spirit of dialectical materialism, <em>i.e.,</em> to sacrifice
      the method of Engels to the letter of Engels. Engels says
      explicitly that &#8220;with each epoch making discovery even in
      the sphere of natural science [&#8220;not to
      speak of the history of mankind&#8221;], materialism has to
      change its form&#8221; <em>(Ludwig Feuerbach,</em> Germ. ed.,
      p.&#160;19).<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E093" name="bkV14E093" href="#fwV14E093">[6]</a></sup> Hence, a revision of the
      &#8220;form&#8221; of Engels&#8217; materialism, a revision of
      his natural-philosophical propositions is not only not
      &#8220;revisionism,&#8221; in the accepted meaning of the term,
      but, on the contrary, is demanded by Marxism. We criticise the
      Machians not for making such a revision, but for their
      <em>purely revisionist</em> trick of betraying the
      <em>essence</em> of materialism under the guise of criticising
      its <em>form</em> and of adopting the fundamental precepts of
      reactionary

bourgeois philosophy without making the slightest
      attempt to deal directly, frankly and definitely with assertions
      of Engels&#8217; which are unquestionably extremely important to
      the given question, as, for example, his assertion that
      &#8220;. . . motion without matter is unthinkable&#8221;
      <em>(Anti-D&#252;hring,</em>
p.&#160;50).<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E094" name="bkV14E094" href="#fwV14E094">[7]</a></sup>

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 252 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">It</a> goes without saying that in examining the connection between
      one of the schools of modern physicists and the rebirth of
      philosophical idealism, it is far from being our intention to
      deal with specific physical theories. What interests us
      exclusively is the epistemological conclusions that follow from
      certain definite propositions and generally known
      discoveries. These epistemological conclusions are of themselves
      so insistent that many physicists are already reaching for
      them. What is more, there are already various trends among the
      physicists, and definite schools are beginning to be formed on
      this basis. Our object, therefore, will be confined to
      explaining clearly the essence of the difference between these
      various trends and the relation in which they stand to the
      fundamental lines of philosophy.

1. The Crisis in Modern Physics</h3>

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 252 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">In</a> his book <em>Valeur de la science [Value of Science],</em>
      the famous French physicist Henri Poincar&#233; says that there
      are &#8220;symptoms of a serious crisis&#8221; in physics, and
      he devotes a special chapter to this crisis (Chap. VIII,
      <em>cf</em>. p. 171). The crisis is not confined to the fact
      that &#8220;radium, the great revolutionary,&#8221; is
      undermining the principle of the conservation of
      energy. &#8220;All the other principles are equally
      endangered&#8221; (p.&#160;180). For instance, Lavoisier&#8217;s
      principle, or the principle of the conservation of mass, has
      been undermined by the electron theory of matter. According to
      this theory atoms are composed of very minute particles called
      electrons, which are charged with positive or negative
      electricity and &#8220;are immersed in a medium which we call
      the ether.&#8221; The experiments of physicists provide data for
      calculating the velocity of the electrons and their mass (or the
      relation of their mass to their electrical charge). The velocity
      proves to be comparable

<!-- vol=14 pg=253 src=v14pp72h type= --> <a name='v14pp72h:253' /> &nbsp; 

with the velocity of light (300,000
      kilometres per second), attaining, for instance, one-third of
      the latter. Under such circumstances the twofold mass of the
      electron has to be taken into account, corresponding to the
      necessity of over coming the inertia, firstly, of the electron
      itself and, secondly, of the ether. The former mass will be the
      real or mechanical mass of the electron, the latter the
      &#8220;electrodynamic mass which represents the inertia of the
      ether.&#8221; And it turns out that the former mass is equal to
      zero. The entire mass of the electrons, or, at least, of the
      negative electrons, proves to be totally and exclusively
      electrodynamic in its
origin.<sup><a class="endnote" id="bkV14E095" name="bkV14E095" href="#fwV14E095">[8]</a></sup> Mass disappears. The foundations of
      mechanics are undermined. Newton&#8217;s principle, the equality
      of action and reaction, is undermined, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 253 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">We</a> are faced, says Poincar&#233;, with the &#8220;ruins&#8221;
      of the old principles of physics, &#8220;a general debacle of
      principles.&#8221; It is true, he remarks, that all the
      mentioned departures from principles refer to infinitesimal
      magnitudes; it is possible that we are still ignorant of other
      infinitesimals counteracting the undermining of the old
      principles. Moreover, radium is very rare. But at any rate we
      have reached a &#8220;<em>period of doubt</em>.&#8221; We have
      already seen what epistemological deductions the author draws
      from this &#8220;period of doubt": &#8220;it is not nature which
      imposes on [or dictates to] us the concepts of space and time,
      but we who impose them on nature"; &#8220;whatever is not
      thought, is pure nothing.&#8221; These deductions are idealist
      deductions. The breakdown of the most fundamental principles
      shows (such is Poincar&#233;&#8217;s trend of thought) that
      these principles are not copies, photographs of nature, not
      images of something external in relation to man&#8217;s
      consciousness, but products of his consciousness. Poincar&#233;
      does not develop these deductions consistently, nor is he
      essentially interested in the philosophical aspect of the
      question. It is dealt with in detail by the French writer on
      philosophical problems, Abel Rey, in his book <em>The Physical
      Theory of the Modern Physicists (La Th&#233;orie physique chez
      les physiciens contemporains,</em> Paris, F. Alcan, 1907). True,
      the author himself is a positivist, <em>i.e.,</em> a muddlehead
      and a semi-Machian, but in this case this is even a certain
      advantage, for he can not be suspected of a desire to
      &#8220;slander&#8221; our Machians&#8217; idol. Rey cannot be

<!-- vol=14 pg=254 src=v14pp72h type= --> <a name='v14pp72h:254' /> &nbsp; 

trusted when it comes to giving an exact philosophical
      definition of concepts and of materialism in particular, for
      Rey too is a professor, and as such is imbued with an utter
      contempt for the materialists (and distinguishes himself by
      utter ignorance of the epistemology of materialism). It goes
      without saying that a Marx or an Engels is absolutely
      non-existent for such &#8220;men of science.&#8221; But Rey
      summarises carefully and in general conscientiously the
      extremely abundant literature on the subject, not only French,
      but English and German as well (Ostwald and Mach in particular),
      so that we shall have frequent recourse to his work.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 254 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">The</a> attention of philosophers in general, says the author, and
      also of those who, for one reason or another, wish to criticise
      science generally, has now been particularly attracted towards
      physics. &#8220;In discussing the limits and value of physical
      knowledge, it is in effect the legitimacy of positive science,
      the possibility of knowing the object, that is criticised&#8221;
      (pp. i-ii). From the &#8220;crisis in modern physics&#8221;
      people hasten to draw sceptical conclusions (p.&#160;14). Now, what
      is this crisis? During the first two-thirds of the nineteenth
      century the physicists agreed among themselves on everything
      essential. They believed in a purely mechanical explanation of
      nature: they assumed that physics is nothing but a more
      complicated mechanics, namely, a molecular mechanics. They
      differed only as to the methods used in reducing physics to
      mechanics and as to the details of the mechanism. . . . At
      present the spectacle presented by the physico-chemical sciences
      seems completely changed. Extreme disagreement has replaced
      general unanimity, and no longer does it concern details, but
      leading and fundamental ideas. While it would be an exaggeration
      to say that each scientist has his own peculiar tendencies, it
      must nevertheless be noted that science, and especially physics,
      has, like art, its numerous schools, the conclusions of which
      often differ from, and sometimes are directly opposed and
      hostile to each other. . . .

    <p>
      &#8220;<a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 254 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">Down</a> to the middle of the nineteenth century, traditional
      physics had assumed that it was sufficient merely to extend
      physics in order to arrive at a metaphysics of matter. This

<!-- vol=14 pg=255 src=v14pp72h type= --> <a name='v14pp72h:255' /> &nbsp; 

physics ascribed to its theories an ontological value. And its
      theories were all mechanistic. The traditional mechanism [Rey employs
      this word in the specific sense of a
      system of ideas which reduces physics to mechanics] thus
      claimed, over and above the results of experience, a
      <em>real</em> knowledge of the material universe. This was not a
      hypothetical account of experience; it was a dogma. . .&#8221;
      (p.&#160;16).

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 255 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">We</a> must here interrupt the worthy &#8220;positivist.&#8221; It
      is clear that he is describing the materialist philosophy of
      traditional physics but does not want to call the devil
      (materialism) by name. Materialism to a Humean must appear to be
      metaphysics, dogma, a transgression of the bounds of experience,
      and so forth. Knowing nothing of materialism, the Humean Rey has
      no conception whatever of dialectics, of the difference between
      dialectical materialism and metaphysical materialism, in
      Engels&#8217; meaning of the term. Hence, the relation between
      absolute and relative truth, for example, is absolutely unclear
      to Rey.

    <p>
      &#8220;. . . <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 255 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">The</a> criticism of traditional mechanism made during
      the whole of the second half of the nineteenth century weakened
      the premise of the ontological reality of mechanism. On the
      basis of these criticisms a philosophical conception of physics
      was founded which became almost traditional in 7philosophy at
      the end of the nineteenth century. Science was nothing but a
      symbolic formula, a method of notation <em>(rep&#233;rage,</em>
      the creation of signs, marks, symbols), and since the methods of
      notation varied according to the schools, the conclusion was
      soon reached that only that was denoted which had been
      previously designed (<em>fa&ctail;onn&#233;</em>) by man for notation
      (or symbolisation). Science became a work of art for
      dilettantes, a work of art for utilitarians: views which could
      with legitimacy be generally interpreted as the negation of the
      possibility of science. A science which is a pure artifice for
      acting upon nature, a mere utilitarian technique, has no right
      to call itself science, without perverting the meaning of
      words. To say that science can be nothing but such an artificial
      means of action is to disavow science in the proper meaning of
      the term.

      point of knowledge of nature, the result must needs be a
      complete revolution both in the art of logic and the history of
      ideas. Physics then loses all educational value; the spirit of
      positive science it represents becomes false and
      dangerous.&#8221; Science can offer only practical recipes but
      no real knowledge. &#8220;Knowledge of the real must be sought

      crisis in physics only temporary. We shall presently see how Rey
      purifies Mach, Poincar&#233; and Co. of these conclusions. At
      present we shall confine ourselves to noting the fact of the
      &#8220;crisis&#8221; and its significance. From the last words
      of Rey quoted by us it is quite clear what reactionary elements
      have taken advantage of and aggravated this crisis. Rey
      explicitly states in the preface to his work that &#8220;the
      fideist and anti-intellectualist movement of the last years of
      the nineteenth century&#8221; is seeking &#8220;to base itself
      on the general spirit of modern physics&#8221; (p.&#160;ii). In
      France, those who put faith above reason are called fideists
      (from the Latin <em>fides,</em> faith). Anti-intellectualism is
      a doctrine that denies the rights or claims of reason. Hence, in
      its philosophical aspect, the essence of the &#8220;crisis in
      modern physics&#8221; is that the old physics regarded its
      theories as &#8220;real knowledge of the material world,&#8221;
      <em>i.e.,</em> a reflection of objective reality. The new trend
      in physics regards theories only as symbols, signs, and marks
      for practice, <em>i.e.,</em> it denies the existence of an
      objective reality independent of our mind and

<!-- vol=14 pg=257 src=v14pp72h type= --> <a name='v14pp72h:257' /> &nbsp; 

reflected by
      it. If Rey had used correct philosophical terminology, he would
      have said: the materialist theory of knowledge, instinctively
      accepted by the earlier physics, has been replaced by an
      idealist and agnostic theory of knowledge, which, against the
      wishes of the idealists and agnostics, has been taken advantage
      of by fideism.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 257 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">But</a> Rey does not present this replacement, which constitutes the
      crisis, as though all the modern physicists stand opposed to all
      the old physicists. No. He shows that in their epistemological
      trends the modern physicists are divided into three schools: the
      energeticist or conceptualist school; the mechanistic or
      neo-mechanistic school, to which the vast majority of physicists
      still adhere; and in between the two, the critical school. To
      the first belong Mach and Duhem; to the third, Henri
      Poincar&#233; to the second, Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, Thomson (Lord
      Kelvin), Maxwell&#8212;among the older physicists&#8212;and
      Larmor and Lorentz among the modern physicists. What the essence
      of the <em>two</em> basic trends is (for the third is not
      independent, but intermediate) may be judged from the following
      words of Rey&#8217;s:
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;<a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 257 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">Traditional</a> mechanism constructed a system of the
      material world.&#8221; Its doctrine of the structure of matter
      was based on &#8220;elements qualitatively homogenous and
      identical"; and elements were to be regarded as
      &#8220;immutable, impenetrable,&#8221; etc. Physics
      &#8220;constructed a <em>real</em> edifice out of <em>real</em>
      materials and <em>real</em> cement. The physicist possessed
      <em>material elements, the causes and modes</em> of
      their action, and the <em>real</em> laws of their action&#8221;
      (pp. 33-38). &#8220;The change in this view consists in the
      rejection of the ontological significance of the theories and in
      an exaggerated emphasis on the phenomenological significance of
      physics.&#8221; The conceptualist view operates with &#8220;pure
      abstractions . . . and seeks a purely abstract theory which will
      as far as possible eliminate the hypothesis of matter. . . . The
      notion of energy thus becomes the substructure of the new
      physics. This is why conceptualist physics may most often be
      called <em>energeticist</em> physics,&#8221; although this
      designation does not fit, for example, such a representative of
      conceptualist physics as Mach (p.&#160;46).
    </p>

    <p>
      <a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 257 . v14pp72h '" onmouseout="window.status=''">Rey&#8217;s</a> identification of energetics with Machism is not
      altogether correct, of course; nor is his assurance that the

<!-- vol=14 pg=258 src=v14pp72h type= --> <a name='v14pp72h:258' /> &nbsp; 

neo-mechanistic school as well is approaching a phenomenalist
      view of physics (p.&#160;48), despite the profundity of its
      disagreement with the conceptualists. Rey&#8217;s
      &#8220;new&#8221; terminology does not clarify, but rather
      obscures matters; but we could not avoid it if we were to give
      the reader an idea of how a &#8220;positivist&#8221; regards the
      crisis in physics. Essentially, the opposition of the
      &#8220;new&#8221; school to the old views fully coincides, as
      the reader may have convinced himself, with Kleinpeter&#8217;s
      criticism of Helmholtz quoted above. In his presentation of the
      views of the various physicists Rey reflects the indefiniteness
      and vacillation of their philosophical views. The
      <em>essence</em> of the crisis in modern physics consists in the
      breakdown of the old laws and basic principles, in the rejection
      of an objective reality existing outside the mind, that is, in
      the replacement of materialism by idealism and
      agnosticism. &#8220;Matter has disappeared"&#8212;one may thus
      express the fundamental and characteristic difficulty in
      relation to many of the particular questions, which has created
      this crisis. Let us pause to discuss this difficulty.

      another. This was speedily confirmed by William Ramsay and
      Frederick Soddy, who discovered that helium was one of the
      products of radioactive disintegration of radon (1903). Shortly
      afterwards it was discovered that helium was formed by the
      disintegration of radium and other radioactiye elements showing
      alpha-radioactivity. This formation of helium was an important
      argument in favour of the theory of radioactive transformations,
      and could only be explained by supposing that alpha-rays are the
      nuclei of helium atoms. This was confirmed in 1909 by the
      experiments of T. Rutherford and T. Royds.

      accepted in physics at the beginning of the twentieth
      century. The idea of the ether as a special material medium
      filling all space and acting as the carrier of light,
      gravitational forces, etc., was put forward in the seventeenth
      century. Later, the notion of different forms of the ether,
      independent of one another (electromagnetic, magnetic, etc.) was
      introduced to explain various phenomena. Owing to the success of
      the wave theory of light, the concept of the luminiferous ether
      (Christian Huygens, Austin Frosnel and others) was especially
      developed; subsequently the hypothesis of a

      arose. As science developed, however, the concept of the ether
      came into contradiction with new facts. The untenability of the
      hypothesis of the ether as a universal mechanical medium was
      proved by the theory of relativity; the rational elements
      contained in the hypothesis of the ether were reflected in the
      quantum field theory (tile vacuum concept).

      Plekhnnov criticised Machism and its adherents in Russia
      (Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and others) and pointed out the fallacy
      of their attempts to combine Marxism with the
      subjective-idealist philosophy of Mach and Avenarius. In so

<a onmouseover="window.status=' 14 . 381 . v14pp72h . ENDNOTE '" onmouseout="window.status=''">The</a> description of the concept of mass given by Henri
      Poincar&eacute; and quoted by Lenin was in accord with the level
      of development of physics at that time. The development of the
      electronic theory that followed the discovery of the electron
      made it possible to explain the nature of the mass of the
      electron. Joseph John Thom son advanced the hypothesis that the
      actual mass of the electron is determined by the energy of the
      electromagnetic field (i.e., the inertia of the electron is due
      to the inertia of the field). The concept of the electromagnetic
      mass of the electron was introduced, and this mass was found to
      depend on the velocity of motion of the electron. The mechanical
      mass of the electron, however, like that of any other particle,
      was regarded as unchanging. The existence of the mechanical mass
      should have been revealed by experiments on the dependence of
      the electromagnetic mass of the electron on its
      velocity. However, these experiments, performed by Walter
      Kaufmann in 1901-02, unexpectedly showed that the electron
      behaved as if all its mass was of an electromagnetic
      nature. Hence the conclusion was drawn that, in the case of the
      electron,

<!-- vol=14 pg=382 src=v14pp72h type=ENDNOTE --> &nbsp; 

mechanical mass, which was formerly regarded as an
      inalienable property of matter, has disappeared. This
      circumstance gave rise to various kinds of philosophical
      speculations and statements about the "disappearance of matter&#8217;,
      the fallacy of which was demonstrated by Lenin. The further
      development of physics (relativity theory) showed that
      mechanical mass also depends on velocity of motion and that the
      mass of the electron cannot be reduced wholly to electromagnetic
      mass.

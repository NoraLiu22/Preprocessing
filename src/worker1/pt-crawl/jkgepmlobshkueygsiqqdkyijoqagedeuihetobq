<P>D: Angelica Huston<BR>
S: Angelica Huston, Marion O'Dwyer</P>

<P>Dublin in the early 1960s: a recently widowed street trader (Angelica
Huston) faces the challenges of life as a lone parent, including dealings
with a local loan shark (Ray Winstone) and the amorous advances of a Frenchman
(Arno Chevrier), but finds solace in her friendship with a fellow trader
(Marion O'Dwyer). Despite an earnest attempt by Angelica Huston as both
actor and director, this adaptation of stand-up comedian Brendan O'Carroll's
first novel <I>The Mammy</I> cannot overcome the rash of clich&eacute;s
and the constant feeling that this is a low-rent version of the kind of
vision of working class Dublin popularised by admittedly more middle class
writer Roddy Doyle. Added to this the fact that it lacks the humour which
made Doyle so entertaining and made his insights seem less pat, it eventually
becomes almost unbearable, especially when it descends into melodrama and
fantasy.</P>

<P>The problems become evident in its first moments when a potentially funny
scene is overplayed by the three actors concerned. Huston and O'Dwyer visit
the social welfare office to obtain a widow's pension mere hours after the
death of Huston's husband. The lines are delivered with heavy-handed, eye-rolling
attempts at whimsy and satire which sets an unfortunate precedent for the
remainder of the film. Huston herself tries hard, but she is far too beautiful
and glamourous to carry the role. Vocally, while her pronunciations are
fairly good, her intonation is off. The result is that, like the film of
the whole, her performance is awkward, contrived, and ultimately fatally
artificial. It is unauthentic in a way which becomes increasingly telling
as the plot wends its way towards tearjerker territory before lurching inelegantly
into knockabout humour in its final minutes. </P>

<P>As director, Huston attempts to turn the whole thing into a story of
female liberation and self-discovery, and does so, but the plot, characterisation,
and dialogue are far too obvious to be effective. As an evocation of time
and place it does a serviceable job. It represents an urban social landscape
now more or less departed, which is curious given that the adaptations of
Doyle's films had brought matters fairly up to date. The sense of religion
and community solidarity which eventually becomes central to the film's
themes of feminist self-realisation frequently aims for an Ealing-ish feel
(as did the recent, awful <I><A HREF="wn.htm">Waking Ned</A></I>), but actually
winds up providing it with a laughable climax which is funny for all the
wrong reasons (and features an embarrassing cameo by Tom Jones). Amid this
'local colour' Huston attempts to wring from O'Carroll's basic story something
slightly worthwhile in terms of a vision of Irish femininity more in line
with standard feminist rhetoric. She succeeds in places, and manages to
give a sense of how her character retains her dignity in the face of economic,
social, and personal difficulties. But it's all very trite, and the film's
resolution eventually turns on a series of moronic 'comic' twists and unlikely
contrivances which undermine much of what Huston has been trying to do.</P>

<P><I>Agnes Browne</I> may play in foreign markets, but to an Irish viewer
it must be approached with the proverbial grain of salt. It is not a funny
film, so don't expect many laughs, in spite of O'Carroll's reputation for
profane, working-class comedy (incidentally he plays the local drunk). It
might work as something of a distant echo of time and place for those who
remember them, and as a tearjerking melodrama it might play with undiscerning
video or television audiences. On the whole however <I>Agnes Browne</I>
is a brave failure which was an unfortunate choice of second film for director
Huston (following the controversial <I>Bastard Out of Carolina</I>, made
for American cable TV). It's a pity that a woman raised at least partly
in this country and with such evident talent could not make something out
of the source material, but it just goes to prove that you can't make a
silk purse out of a cow's ear. Let's hope people have the good sense to
leave O'Carroll's subsequent novels to themselves and instead find new and
interesting subjects to tackle as films like <I><A HREF="cheat.htm">How
to Cheat in the Leaving Certificate</A></I>, <I><A HREF="nov.htm">November
Afternoon</A></I>, and <A HREF="divj.htm"><I>Divorcing Jack</I> </A>have
done.</P>

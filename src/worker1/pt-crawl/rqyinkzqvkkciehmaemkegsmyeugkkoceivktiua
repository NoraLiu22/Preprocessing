He was one of the first on the ground and one of the last to leave despite warnings to evacuate after the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster.</p>\n<p>Alex first considered pursuing a path in media when he recorded himself calling imaginary games of rugby league and tennis at age 12. His year six class was impressed with the tape so he decided then that it would be the career for him.</p>\n<p>After leaving high school at St. Ignatius&rsquo; College, Riverview and spending a year in Ireland, he completed a journalism degree at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst. He undertook work experience at A Current Affair in the late 1990s &ndash; and 20 years later has found himself back at Nine.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alex commenced his career in the media on radio where he presented the weekend morning news on ABC Central West in Orange, NSW and was an announcer at 2BS and B-Rock FM in Bathurst. He also started taking casual shifts at 2GB in Sydney reading the weekend overnight news and working as a weekend reporter.</p>\n<p>Alex&rsquo;s first big break into television came in 2003 when he walked into Prime News in Wagga Wagga, NSW, with a spare CV. The then news director says that Alex is still the only bloke he&rsquo;s employed straight off the street!</p>\n<p>In 2004, Alex made the move to Western Australia where he landed a job as a reporter in the famous gold mining town of Kalgoorlie, later becoming the sports presenter at Golden West News in Bunbury. Besides his home town of Coonamble in northern NSW, Kalgoorlie is his favourite place in Australia. &ldquo;The scope of stories and the people out there are just incredible&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The cameraman and I had to cover more than 772,000 square kilometres which often meant a lot of driving!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Alex then moved to the Seven Network as a general reporter in Perth in 2006. In 2007 he joined Sunrise and six months later, he became a general reporter for Seven News. Highlights include reporting on the Bathurst 1000, the Melbourne Cup, and the inspiring story of Jane McGrath.</p>\n<p>A news and sports nut, he landed the nightly sports presenter role in early 2009 and read the sport alongside news veteran Ian Ross and later, Chris Bath. Alex also filled in reading the 11:30 and 4:30 news bulletins as well as the late news updates.</p>\n<p>In December 2019, Alex returned to his love of sport and live TV as the sports presenter on Today. &ldquo;For me, it&rsquo;s the dream TV job&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;I get to work with the best in the business and follow one of my great passions. Sport is one of the great unifiers and in a country like ours, it&rsquo;s a privilege to give our loyal audience that all-important sports fix every week day morning!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Growing up on a sheep, cattle and wheat farm near Coonamble, Alex still gets back to the family farm whenever he can. The proud father of twin girls Audrey and Evie with his wife Bonnie, Alex is the creator and host of the Being Dad podcast interviewing dads and experts about every topic that affects fathers.</p>\n<p>Alex is also an ambassador for the Charlie Teo Foundation dedicated to finding a cure for brain cancer.

After leaving school, she worked as an advertising cadet at the Australian Financial Review before leaving to complete a journalism degree. She attended Sydney&#x27;s University of Technology where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications, majoring in Journalism.</p><p>While at university she produced the morning Blackchat program on Sydney’s Koori Radio before going to class, then did an internship at the ABC in the afternoons. Like many students who land the dream internship, she was forced to cut back her workload at university to facilitate the opportunity. Before graduating, Boney scored a job as a <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/politics\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"political\">political</a> correspondent for NITV in the press gallery at Parliament House in 2013, arriving the same week <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/kevin-rudd\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kevin Rudd\">Kevin Rudd</a> deposed <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/julia-gillard\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Julia Gillard\">Julia Gillard</a>. </p><p>“I remember being in Parliament House on a deadline for the news that night and having my uni course coordinator call me about an overdue assignment,” the 31-year-old told <a href=\"https://futurewomen.com/leadership/her-agenda-brooke-boney/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Future Women in a 2018 interview\">Future Women in a 2018 interview</a>.</p><p>“I had to say, ‘I’m filing for the actual news!’ That said, I got through with lots of extensions.” Within months, she was on the campaign bus following Kevin Rudd and <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/tony-abbott\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tony Abbott\">Tony Abbott</a>.</p><p>She then crossed over to radio in 2016 with the ABC, and became a fan favourite as the Triple J’s breakfast show newsreader with Ben and Liam. Towards the end of her newsreading stint on Triple J, Boney garnered a lot of interest after opening her bulletins by saying ‘Yaama’ – the word for “hello” in Gamilaroi, the Indigenous language of Northern NSW.</p><p>She has been at the forefront of youth culture since she began working in media in 2010, and – as a proud <a href=\"https://kamilaroianationsidentity.weebly.com/location.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gamilaroi Gomeroi\">Gamilaroi Gomeroi</a> woman – has written a lot about what it’s like to be an Aboriginal person in Australia. Her role as Entertainment Reporter for TODAY is a change of pace for Boney, but one that see her take on new challenges, including taking part in Nine’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://celebrity.nine.com.au/oscars\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Academy Awards\">Academy Awards</a>.</p><p>In December, 2018 she was announced as the new <a href=\"https://9now.nine.com.au/today\" title=\"TODAY showbiz\">TODAY showbiz</a> reporter. The new gig gives her the opportunity to work closely with industry legend and <a href=\"https://www.9now.com.au/today/2019/extras/meet-the-team/team/richard-wilkins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"entertainment editor Richard Wilkins\">entertainment editor Richard Wilkins</a>.</p><p>“I&#x27;m really thrilled to be joining the team and so excited to be working alongside Richard Wilkins,“ Boney told <a href=\"https://celebrity.nine.com.au/2018/12/22/20/16/brooke-boney-speaks-out-joining-today-show-australia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"9Honey\">9Honey</a>. “He&#x27;s such a legend in the business. It&#x27;s such an exciting time to be joining Nine and I am looking forward to learning from everyone on the Today team“.</p><p>As for how she will handle the 3am starts, Boney is lucky she already has a pretty solid morning routine from the 4am starts during her time in breakfast radio.</p><p>“I’m strict about my morning routine because I need the process to wake up. I’ll have a cup of tea with nice honey in it and gelatin. Then I’ll have some bone broth and some porridge or fruit,” Boney told Future Women.</p><p>She also shared her views on feminism as a process of checking yourself and evaluating what you think of other women in your own head.</p><p>“For so long there was only one seat for a woman at the table and now there are so many more opportunities for us, we don’t need to be competitive,” she added.</p><p>The Indigenous journalist grew up in Northern NSW and was one of six children, supported by her mother. Living primarily in housing commission, Boney faced much adversity as a young woman even dropping out in high school. But she was determined to not be a statistic.</p><p>“I really didn’t want to be a victim of the situation I was born into.” Boney told <a href=\"https://www.who.com.au/brooke-boney-grew-up-in-housing-commission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"WHO\">WHO</a>, “I wanted to work really hard to make sure I wasn’t poor ever again.”</p><p>Boney shares her excitement about being on TODAY.</p><p>“I&#x27;m so thrilled to be a part of this amazing program that has such an incredibly legacy,” Boney told 9Honey when her new role was announced.</p><p>INSTAGRAM: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/boneybrooke\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@brookeboney\">@brookeboney</a></p>","twitter":"BrookeBoney","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":false},{"id":"20e1c2ed-0fca-44f2-80b9-05778eaaa0c4","url":"/meet-the-team/today-show/david-campbell","image":{"src":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/_y4uSN6Y6nkRPB1pqlZECMY8d_A=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2020%2F01%2F07%2F13%2F51%2FDavid-Campbell.jpg","sizes":"110px","srcSet":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/_y4uSN6Y6nkRPB1pqlZECMY8d_A=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2020%2F01%2F07%2F13%2F51%2FDavid-Campbell.jpg 110w, https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/NQXIT6L-Q4ndvlf8eJ7pqpOltQo=/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2020%2F01%2F07%2F13%2F51%2FDavid-Campbell.jpg 220w","alt":"David Campbell"},"displayName":"David Campbell","position":"TODAY Show host","abstract":"","bodyCopy":"<p>David Campbell is one of Australia&rsquo;s most popular entertainers.</p>\n<p>A multi-platinum selling recording artist, Campbell has featured on TV, starred in theatre and cabaret, recorded three Top Ten albums, and sold out concert tours from coast to coast. He has a unique legacy as not just one of Australia&rsquo;s leading musical theatre stars, but also one of the few local performers to have achieved similar success in New York.<br>\n<br>\nBorn and raised in Adelaide, David was drawn to the performing arts - initially as an actor. He was performing at the STC and Sydney Opera House by the age of 22, and in 1997 starred in a major revival of&nbsp;<em>Les Miserables</em>&nbsp;in Sydney. Shortly after this, Campbell moved to New York, where his downtown cabaret show attracted major crowds. Due to what Time Out New York described as &ldquo;the biggest buzz since Barbra Streisand&rdquo;, Campbell moved his show to the iconic cabaret room Rainbow &amp; Stars, becoming the youngest performer ever to headline the venue.<br>\n<br>\nWith this success as a launch pad, Campbell was soon in demand from Broadway&rsquo;s most prestigious writers and directors. Stephen Sondheim cast him in the New York premiere of his musical&nbsp;<em>Saturday Night</em>, and he played leading roles in shows like&nbsp;<em>Babes In Arms&nbsp;</em>(at the Lincoln Center), and South Pacific.<br>\n<br>\nIn 2001, at the height of his New York success, Campbell was tempted back to Australia by the role of a lifetime - &lsquo;the wild one&rsquo; Johnny O'Keefe, in the musical phenomenon&nbsp;<em>Shout!</em>&nbsp;He toured Australia in the show for over a year, and became a household name as a result. Campbell went on to star in Australian productions of classic musicals like&nbsp;<em>Carousel and Company</em>, new works at the MTC and STC, and even in&nbsp;<em>Pirates of Penzance</em>&nbsp;for Opera Australia. Along the way, he picked up a Helpmann Award for Best Actor, for his 2005 role in&nbsp;<em>Sunset Boulevard.</em><br>\n<br>\nCampbell established himself quickly as one of the country&rsquo;s biggest-selling recording artists. His albums&nbsp;<em>The Swing Sessions</em>&nbsp;(2006),<em>&nbsp;The Swing Sessions 2</em>(2007), and&nbsp;<em>Good Lovin&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;(2008) all hit the Top Ten and achieved platinum sales. He has also mounted no fewer than five sell-out concert tours - for which he has received a further two Helpmann Awards. In 2009, his live concert DVD&nbsp;<em>Good Lovin&rsquo; Live</em>&nbsp;hit number one on the ARIA chart.<br>\n<br>\nDavid&rsquo;s album success included&nbsp;<em>David Campbell On Broadway</em>&nbsp;and the release of the album was complimented by the specially commissioned television documentary&nbsp;<em>David Campbell On Broadway</em>, produced by Luckiest Productions. A mixture of Broadway history, exclusive interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage of the album recording, the documentary was broadcast on the STVDIO Channel on Foxtel. Regularly performing in the USA as a headlining artist at G&rsquo;Day LA, Campbell has also acted as MC and headlined at&nbsp;<em>G&rsquo;Day NY</em>&nbsp;on several occasions.<br>\n<br>\nIn recent years Campbell&rsquo;s position in the Australian entertainment industry expanded with his appointment as Artistic Director of the Adelaide Cabaret Festival (the largest cabaret festival in the world), and the success of Luckiest Productions, the production company he runs with his wife, Lisa. Luckiest Productions now produces national tours and live theatre at the new Hayes Theatre in Potts Point.&nbsp; The first production at the Hayes Theatre, Sweet Charity, recently enjoyed a sell out season, critical acclaim and 8 x Helpmann Award Nominations.<br>\n<br>\nA highly sought after master of ceremonies, David has hosted many events for numerous corporate and charitable organisations.&nbsp; He has recently been appointed as an Ambassador for the Starlight Foundation and regularly supports Dr Charlie Teo&rsquo;s Cure For Life Foundation at numerous events nationally.

He moved into broadcast journalism, working at the radio and TV station in Tamworth, NSW. During the past 40 plus years, Penfold has worked for all three commercial networks in Sydney and Melbourne.<br/><br/> While working for Ten News in Melbourne, he was one of the first reporters into Darwin after Cyclone Tracy destroyed the city on Christmas Day in 1974.<br/><br/> He covered the Granville rail disaster as Nine’s reporter and toured Australia covering the first visit of the royal newlyweds, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. During his career at Nine, Penfold has worked for 9News, A Current Affair, Today (appearing on the first show in 1982) and Sunday.<br/><br/> From 1985 to 1987 he was based in Nine&#x27;s North American bureau reporting on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency, the Challenger space shuttle disaster and America&#x27;s discovery of the larrikin Aussie, Paul Hogan.<br/><br/>Penfold moved to the United Kingdom in 1987 to establish Nine&#x27;s first news bureau in London. It was an eventful time to be in Europe. The IRA was at war with the British, the royal family was dealing with the Charles and Diana crisis, Eastern Europe was throwing off the cloak of communism and Australia&#x27;s most-wanted man at the time, mafia boss Robert Trimboli, was on the run in Spain.<br/><br/>At the same time, the news focus swung onto Africa. Penfold reported the US’ unsuccessful attempt to bring peace to Somalia and the triumphant march to freedom by Nelson Mandela. Standing in front of Mandela&#x27;s house in Soweto and reporting live back to Australia was one his most memorable moments. Penfold was also there on November 9, 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell.<br/><br/>He reported from the former Yugoslavia during the Balkan conflict in the early 90s. In 1991, he was one of the first reporters into Kuwait City in the First Gulf War. Earlier he reported from Baghdad as the Australian Government attempted to negotiate the freedom of Australians trapped in the region.<br/><br/>After two years in Australia as head of the <em>A Current Affair</em> office in Melbourne, Penfold returned to his first love as a foreign correspondent and moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1997.<br/><br/>During his time as Nine&#x27;s US correspondent he has reported on hurricanes and cyclones, the Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump administrations as well as the ongoing tragedies of school shootings. </p><p>On the Hollywood beat he’s been there to see the success of stars such as Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe. </p><p>He was there in New York after the September 11 terrorist attacks on America. Penfold also went to Baghdad where he reported on the US invasion and while reporting Australia’s military role in Iraq, along with cameraman Richard Moran, escaped injury during a mortar attack on the Australian base.   </p><p>He has also travelled extensively, gathering feature stories on American places of interest and fascinating characters.<br/><br/>During his career Penfold has won several awards for his reporting. He won the Thorn Award for his coverage of a deadly fire in Sydney, a Penguin Award from the Television Society of Australia for his coverage of a murderous attack on mourners during an IRA funeral in Belfast, a Logie for his story on Sydney winning the bid for the Olympics and a Walkley commendation for his story of coming under fire in Iraq.  </p><p>In 2006, Penfold was awarded Australia&#x27;s most prestigious journalism prize, the Walkley Award for his coverage of the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans. </p><p>He resides in Los Angeles with wife, real estate agent Shar Penfold, and has two sons and one daughter and is now a proud grandfather.</p>","twitter":"rmpenfold","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":false},{"id":"b4af6a44-ecee-481b-8be0-2c2f9ec8aaaf","url":"/meet-the-team/foreign/lauren-tomasi","image":{"src":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/7jLLlNiRd5ZlUm20VSCXleIAOFY=/835x339:2383x1888/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F73d78c51-701c-434e-b619-ac2cb5b17b5a","sizes":"110px","srcSet":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/7jLLlNiRd5ZlUm20VSCXleIAOFY=/835x339:2383x1888/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F73d78c51-701c-434e-b619-ac2cb5b17b5a 110w, https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/l0iw2MHYnP8I7U--CRZfCylLPic=/835x339:2383x1888/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F73d78c51-701c-434e-b619-ac2cb5b17b5a 220w","alt":"Lauren Tomasi"},"displayName":"Lauren Tomasi","position":"US Correspondent","abstract":"<p> ﻿</p>","bodyCopy":"<p>Lauren is a US Correspondent.</p><p>Lauren studied journalism at the University of New South Wales, and undertook a year of study abroad in the United States, where she worked as a newsreader on a local radio station.</p><p>Prior to joining Nine, Lauren worked as a snow reporter in the NSW ski fields.</p>","twitter":"LaurenTomasi","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":false},{"id":"7239d006-248e-4125-ab1c-b255f4bfb9f2","url":"/meet-the-team/foreign/carrie-anne-greenbank","image":{"src":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/xDlrnQTlXqHwZsDWIwF-VG1yYTU=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2018%2F10%2F20%2F10%2F15%2Fcbg.JPG","sizes":"110px","srcSet":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/xDlrnQTlXqHwZsDWIwF-VG1yYTU=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2018%2F10%2F20%2F10%2F15%2Fcbg.JPG 110w, https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/LuJoQtLEXdWUqa4dI6eRq9lW7XU=/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2018%2F10%2F20%2F10%2F15%2Fcbg.JPG 220w","alt":""},"displayName":"Carrie Anne Greenbank","position":"Europe Correspondent","abstract":"<p>Carrie-Anne Greenbank is one of 9News&#x27;

He was recently recognised as Australia's Foreign Correspondent of the Year.</p>\n<p>Hailing from Melbourne, Tom studied Journalism at RMIT University before landing a job at WIN News in Ballarat in 2004.</p>\n<p>Tom then joined 9News in Melbourne in 2006. His coverage of several major stories including the tragic Black Saturday bushfires was recognised when he won the Melbourne Press Club's Young Journalist of the Year Award, and was also nominated for a Walkley Award.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Tom moved to Sydney to join the <em>A Current Affair</em> team. There he was part of the Logie-nominated investigation into sexual abuse by Robert Hughes on the set of <em>Hey Dad!</em>, which led to the actor being jailed for 10 years.</p>\n<p>His coverage on the ground at the Japanese tsunami disaster in 2011 resulted in a nomination for a Walkley Award. The same year saw him in the midst of the devastating Queensland floods and Christchurch earthquake.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Tom moved back to 9News. He was reporting from the field as the NSW bushfire crisis unfolded in 2013, part of Channel Nine's Logie Award-winning coverage of the disaster.</p>\n<p>Tom became Channel Nine's Europe Correspondent at the beginning of 2015, assuming the position in what would prove to be an extremely turbulent time for the region. Many nations there suffered their worst attacks since World War II as terrorism rocked the continent, with atrocities in Paris, Nice, Brussels, London, Munich, Tunisia and Egypt.</p>\n<p>He also reported from major events including earthquakes in Italy, the shock of Brexit, and the first discovery of parts of the missing plane MH370 on the remote island of Reunion.</p>\n<p>Tom has also had several stints in the network's US Bureau, covering major stories including the shock death of Michael Jackson, as well as being on the campaign trail with Donald Trump as he stormed towards his historic election win in 2016.</p>\n<p>In 2017 Tom returned to Sydney to co-host Weekend TODAY, and in 2019 joined the TODAY team.</p>\n<p>But perhaps most notable has been his time with <em>60 Minutes</em>.

He's also completed the New York and Melbourne marathons, but without doubt his favourite sporting memory was being there to witness his beloved Richmond finally breaking its 37-year premiership drought in 2017.</p>\n<p>Instagram: @tomsteinfort</p>","twitter":"TomSteinfort","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":false},{"id":"4179d9fe-1a0a-415d-8465-05bf3fb05415","url":"/meet-the-team/melbourne/peter-hitchener","image":{"src":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/8y8j2MFsuLPl-Ssb5Dw-js1g5oQ=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F01%2F10%2F15%2F28%2F1001_peterhitchener.jpg","sizes":"110px","srcSet":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/8y8j2MFsuLPl-Ssb5Dw-js1g5oQ=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F01%2F10%2F15%2F28%2F1001_peterhitchener.jpg 110w, https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/iqyW40GqjXwbHT0Hn7IO9JfVtJY=/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F01%2F10%2F15%2F28%2F1001_peterhitchener.jpg 220w","alt":"Peter Hitchener"},"displayName":"Peter Hitchener","position":"Presenter","abstract":"There are few people in the news business with the experience, credibility and integrity of Channel Nine&rsquo;s Peter Hitchener.","bodyCopy":"<p>There are few people in the news business with the experience, credibility and integrity of Channel Nine&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hitchener\" title=\"Peter Hitchener.\">Peter Hitchener.</a></p>\n<p>Hitch, as he is affectionately known, has been bringing Melburnians their news for more than 35 years and is undoubtedly Australia&rsquo;s most trusted and respected news presenter.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Hitchener celebrates 48 years as a newsmaker - the past 40 of them with the Nine Network &ndash; a remarkable feat in any industry, let alone the highly competitive field of broadcast journalism.</p>\n<p>Born and raised in remote rural Queensland, his parents ran a sheep and cattle property 30km outside Texas, a small town near the New South Wales border.</p>\n<p>Their only links to the outside world were ABC radio, on shortwave reception, and The Courier Mail newspaper which arrived the day after publication.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone in our family eagerly devoured the paper and listened to the radio news,&rdquo; Hitchener said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am sure that is where my interest for news first developed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 1965, after completing his secondary education at a Gold Coast boarding school, Hitchener juggled an arts degree with part-time work, writing, editing and presenting news at Brisbane's 4BH radio station.</p>\n<p>A year later, he deferred his degree to take up a full-time position in radio and television at ABC Brisbane. On radio, he presented breakfast music programs, read the news and covered special events including the Queen&rsquo;s royal tour of Australia. On television, he presented the main weeknight news bulletin.</p>\n<p>Hitchener moved to the ABC in Sydney in 1973 and again worked in radio and television. On television, he read the evening news when main presenter James Dibble was on leave. While on radio, he wrote and read news bulletins.</p>\n<p>At the end of 1973, he joined TCN-9 in Sydney to present National Nine News and a year later he went to GTV-9 Melbourne as the main weeknight presenter.</p>\n<p>In 1976, he teamed up with Sir Eric Pearce to present the evening edition of National Nine News in Melbourne. The partnership lasted three years and Hitchener describes the late Sir Eric as &ldquo;a very funny person and a great mentor &ndash; we became good friends&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>While presenting news for GTV-9, Hitchener also established himself as a popular radio personality. In 1977, he began hosting the breakfast slot on 3AW and switched to 3AK in 1979. He stayed with the station until 1985.</p>\n<p>In 1979, he became GTV-9&rsquo;s chief weekend news presenter and read the main National Nine News bulletin when Brian Naylor was on leave. He took over as chief newsreader for GTV-9 in December 1998 when Naylor retired after 45 years in the business.</p>\n<p>When the big stories break, more people turn to Peter Hitchener on Nine News than any other news outlet. In an ever-changing media landscape, Hitchener and the team at Nine News can be relied upon as Melbourne&rsquo;s most credible, accurate and trusted source of news.</p>\n<p>The tragic Black Saturday bushfires that ravaged Victoria in 2009 touched us all. In total, 173 people lost their lives, including former Nine News presenter and close friend of Hitchener, Brian Naylor. Despite the personal sorrow that he was experiencing, Hitchener was there, on the frontline, bringing Melburnians the tales and images of devastation that will forever be etched in our hearts and minds.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Personally, it was the most terrible event that I&rsquo;ve ever reported on,&rdquo; Hitchener said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can only imagine how it must have been for the people of the fire affected towns when the flames came through.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Among the other big stories that Hitchener has presented, he ranks the death of Princess Diana, together with the Hoddle Street and Port Arthur massacres among the most memorable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our news team always strives to reflect the changing interests of our audience,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;News is far more immediate now. It&rsquo;s so much more personal and not nearly as formal as it used to be. We can cover stories anywhere in the world quickly and much more accurately with the new technologies that are available.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2009, Hitchener made international headlines when a massively magnified seagull walked across a real-time projection of the Melbourne skyline behind his head while he was reading the news.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I knew it was there but chose not to allude to it because I was reporting on a cold case murder enquiry,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t an appropriate time to share a laugh with the audience, but that seagull has now gone on to become a star of the internet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hitchener loves nothing more than meeting the everyday Melburnians who make up the vibrant city to which he reads the news each weeknight at 6pm. A great deal of his time away from work is spent on community service activities. He is a patron for Able Australia (formerly the Deaf Blind Society of Victoria), a position formerly occupied by Sir Eric Pearce, and a guest speaker for many charity, community and school events in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>A keen animal lover, Hitchener lives in inner suburban Melbourne. He enjoys the occasional hit of tennis or round of golf and is a lifelong supporter of the Australian Rules St Kilda Football Club.</p>\n<p><strong>Honours and Awards:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Australia_Day_Honours\" title=\"2017 Order of Australia medal\">2017 Order of Australia medal</a> - Australia Day Honours list \"for services to the broadcast media and to the community\"&nbsp;</p>","twitter":"phitchener9","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":false},{"id":"90df5d92-f1f0-41f2-97f9-d0a8bf5eb63e","url":"/meet-the-team/melbourne/tony-jones","image":{"src":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/f3Id_A4Jdt1k-zyzy43dyM4SL78=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F03%2F11%2F12%2F38%2FTony-Jones-TODAY-headshot.jpg","sizes":"110px","srcSet":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/f3Id_A4Jdt1k-zyzy43dyM4SL78=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F03%2F11%2F12%2F38%2FTony-Jones-TODAY-headshot.jpg 110w, https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/cGk40IezF40-M7Z5m2P5ny-Se7w=/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F03%2F11%2F12%2F38%2FTony-Jones-TODAY-headshot.jpg 220w","alt":"Tony Jones"},"displayName":"Tony Jones","position":"9News Sports Presenter","abstract":"Nine News sports presenter Tony Jones studied at a radio school before beginning his career in radio newsrooms in country Victoria and Melbourne's 3AW.

Being a mother of two young children at the time, it was an experience that hit close to home.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That was a shocking story, absolutely awful,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The parents would arrive not knowing if their child was one of those being held hostage.

Lewis went on to become a legend virtually overnight and earned such celebrated nicknames as &ldquo;the King&ldquo;, &ldquo;the Emperor of Lang Park&ldquo; and the even &ldquo;the High Priest of the Spectacular&ldquo;. </p>\n<p>His first-grade career in Brisbane kicked off with Valleys in 1978, when he scored three tries on debut as an 18-year-old. It goes without saying that this match was played at the then Lang Park, the ground Lewis called his own. He went on to make 301 first grade appearances with five clubs &mdash; Valleys (135), Wynnum-Manly (76), Wakefield Trinity (10), Broncos (46) and Seagulls (34), and in a career spanning 15 years, he never once played reserve grade. </p>\n<p>Although the re-birth of Queensland Rugby League supremacy came with the ingenious introduction of State of Origin football, the feats of Lewis were no doubt the catalyst. There were others like Mal Meninga, Gene Miles, Bryan Niebling, Paul Vautin, and later Bob Lindner, Allan Langer and the Walters family. But Lewis has  been there from the start. Until he retired from the Origin arena at the end of the 1991 series, the King had missed only two matches &mdash; both through injury. He captained the Maroons from 1981 to 1991 and won 19 of the 30 matches in which he played. Wally was named man of the match a record eight times &ndash; twice as many as any other player in the game&rsquo;s history. In 1993 and 1994 he was the Queensland Origin coach. </p>\n<p>In Queensland, Lewis <em>was</em> State of Origin football! As a player he dominated the scene and chants of &ldquo;Wally, Wally&ldquo; at Lang Park on State of Origin night became legendary. Since his retirement, a bronze statue has been erected in his honour at Lang Park, and the Queensland player of the series now wins the Wally Lewis Medal.</p>\n<p>On the international scene, his dominance was just as monumental. In 1986 he became only the second Queenslander to captain a Kangaroo touring side to Great Britain and France and only injury in 1990 robbed him of breaking a string of records in the game. Lewis played in 33 tests for his country between 1981 and 1991. He captained Australia 23 times, and in 1986 became only the second captain to lead the Kangaroos on an undefeated Ashes tour. When the Kangaroos first achieved that feat &mdash; four years earlier &mdash; Lewis had been the vice-captain. </p>\n<p>There will never be any doubt about his place in Rugby League history &mdash; or Queensland's history for that matter. Wally Lewis became, and still is, an inspiration to  many, young and old. His magnificent feats on the football field will never be forgotten. </p>\n<p>Off the field, Wally has found time to support a variety of organisations including Surf Life Saving Queensland. He was an active member of Nobby's Beach Surf Club between 1975 and 1991. Wally also dedicates his time to charities such as the Hear and Say Centre for deaf children. He is married and has three children.</p>","twitter":"WallyLewis9","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":false},{"id":"d34599d1-673a-41d9-b473-fa4f67f30ee4","url":"/meet-the-team/brisbane/bruce-paige","image":{"src":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/FymjanvZZ-7s4m6A5RgpAeVAoI0=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2016%2F07%2F18%2F12%2F05%2FPaige.jpg","sizes":"110px","srcSet":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/FymjanvZZ-7s4m6A5RgpAeVAoI0=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2016%2F07%2F18%2F12%2F05%2FPaige.jpg 110w, https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/8vznw3tNBIKn4Loi0BZmcY1-YOw=/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2016%2F07%2F18%2F12%2F05%2FPaige.jpg 220w","alt":"Bruce Paige"},"displayName":"Bruce Paige","position":"Seniors Reporter","abstract":"<p>Highly-regarded television presenter Bruce Paige joined Nine News Queensland in 1985 and spent 19 years presenting Nine News.

Ever since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve always asked questions, so becoming a journalist seemed a natural fit. It&#x27;s a profession that&#x27;s taken me around the country, overseas, and pushed my boundaries like no other job could.

My first job in the industry, was taking game notes for journalists at C7 Sport, the now defunct pay-tv rival to Foxtel. But it wasn&#x27;t until I got to help out with breaking news coverage on the 2003 Colombia space shuttle tragedy, that I knew I wanted to work in the media.</p><p>I studied journalism in Sydney, at the University of Technology, whilst working as a producer at Seven News. It&#x27;s a career path that landed me a role as producer and researcher at Sunday Night. Working with legendary investigative journalists like Mike Munro and Ross Coulthart, I helped uncover undisclosed genetically modified ingredients in baby formula and travelled to Vanuatu to film a story on one of the last stone-age tribes in the world.</p><p>In 2011, I moved to Dubbo in Western New South Wales for my first posting as a reporter with Prime7 News. Covering six shires spanning 40 000km²; crime, water shortages, community issues and agricultural stories were regular features of the job. My big break came some two years later, when I revealed police had started digging for Lateesha Nolan, one of the victims of then fugitive murderer Malcolm Naden.</p><p>That story helped me land a job at Nine News in Brisbane as a journalist and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. Covering Queensland is unlike any other state. The tropical weather exposes you to natural disasters, like cyclones and floods, you rarely see in other states. As a senior reporter, I cover all story rounds. But special interests include transport, aviation and politics.

2023, Langdon took over hosting duties on A Current Affair, Australia&#x27;s No. 1 daily current affairs program.</p><p>Prior to that, Langdon was co-host of TODAY, alongside Karl Stefanovic. She joined TODAY on January 4, 2020 in what became the biggest news year in modern memory, starting with bushfires that rolled into COVID-19, economies in freefall, Black Lives Matter protests, the Beirut explosion, the US election and then ending the year with American politics in turmoil. </p><p>Langdon previously co-hosted Weekend TODAY with David Campbell in 2019, combining her presenting commitments with her 60 Minutes role as a reporter. </p><p>She joined 60 Minutes in 2011. Among her achievements include stories she has filed from Somalia in the midst of a brutal civil war, venturing into the raging heart of one of the most active and dangerous volcanoes on earth and coming face to face with Grizzly bears in the Canadian wilderness.</p><p>Langdon joined 60 Minutes after nine years in the Sydney newsroom, where she frequently travelled the globe to cover major stories. She has also presented the 6pm Nine News Sydney bulletin and filled in on TODAY, co-anchoring the network&#x27;s coverage of the Queensland flood disaster and reporting for the telethon that raised more than $10 million for the victims. </p><p>In 2010, while in South Africa for the FIFA World Cup, Langdon was the only Australian journalist to make it into Cameroon to cover the plane crash that killed six Australian mining executives. At home, she played a key role in Nine&#x27;s award-winning coverage of the Australian federal election and hosted the prime-time documentary &#x27;A Royal Engagement&#x27; when Prince William and Kate Middleton announced their plans to marry. Other major news events Langdon has covered include the drug wars in the Mexican town of Juarez, the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta, and the return to Balibo in East Timor with the families of the five Australian newsmen killed during the Indonesian invasion in 1975.</p><p>She wrote the book &#x27;The Child Who Never Was –The Tegan Lane Story&#x27; (released in 2007) after covering the inquest into the disappearance of the baby born to former water polo champion, Keli Lane.

ZOO DOCTOR, which she wrote and produced, was one of the top 24 programs nationally, in a ratings year that included the Atlanta Olympics and a series of blockbuster movies.</p>\n<p>In the same year that Grimshaw hosted TODAY ON SATURDAY she also hosted Nine&rsquo;s new reality TV series ANIMAL HOSPITAL.</p>\n<p>In November 1996 Grimshaw became co-host of TODAY with Steve Liebmann &ndash; a role she held for nine years.</p>\n<p>The following year, Grimshaw hosted the Nine Network&rsquo;s marathon live coverage of the miraculous rescue at Thredbo of Stuart Diver.</p>\n<p>Having hosted TODAY live from Thredbo the previous morning, she was familiar with the disaster site, and was called in to host Nine&rsquo;s non-stop coverage, after an extended edition of TODAY ON SATURDAY concluded. She took over the chair at midday, and finished 6 hours later, only minutes after Stuart Diver was finally brought to the surface.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was an extraordinary day.&nbsp; We were the only commercial network to maintain continuous coverage throughout the day and the whole country tuned in.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There was enormous pressure to report carefully and respectfully. We knew that family and friends of the victims were watching on the mountain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will never forget seeing Stuart Diver&rsquo;s bare feet emerging from that hole as they brought him out on the stretcher.&nbsp; It was hard to stay composed in that moment,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Only a month later she hosted the Nine Network&rsquo;s continuous coverage on the death of Princess Diana.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I remember sitting in the newsroom, preparing to go to air, when the wires snapped the newsflash - just two words &ndash; Diana dead.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For a split second we all just stared in disbelief.&nbsp; Less than a minute later I delivered the news on air, and we were crossing to our London Bureau,&rdquo; said Grimshaw.</p>\n<p>In November 1998 Grimshaw expanded her television commitments with TODAY to include commentating on the WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS 1998 Holden Equestriad Series for dressage, show jumping, and cross country. Grimshaw had trained in eventing herself and relished the opportunity to be involved in a sport she felt so passionate about.</p>\n<p>January 1999 saw her take on hosting the 26-part documentary series OUR COUNTRY. The program featured different aspects of Australia&rsquo;s extraordinary geography and unique lifestyle and was the sister program to OUR CENTURY.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Grimshaw achieved another career highlight starring as a character voice for Dreamworks&rsquo; Animated Film, <em>Shark Tale</em> headlined by Will Smith, two-time Academy Award winner Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Renee Zellweger (Chicago, Bridget Jones' Diary), Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie (Girl Interrupted), Jack Black (School of Rock), and multiple Oscar-nominated director Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Goodfellas).</p>\n<p>Grimshaw played the voice of a fish journalist character called Katie Current.&nbsp; The voice of Katie Current in the US release of the film was played by Katie Couric, co-host of the NBC Today Show.</p>\n<p>Grimshaw says it was a career highlight to be working alongside the <em>Shark Tale</em> star line-up.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When your fellow fish are people like Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Will Smith and Angelina Jolie, it&rsquo;s fair to say that I&rsquo;m the minnow of the cast,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>In her time on TODAY Grimshaw interviewed almost 14,000 people including Prime Ministers, world leaders, movie stars, sports stars and everyday people in the news, presenting from locations including Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong, London and Gallipoli.</p>\n<p>On 30 January 2006, Grimshaw began presenting A CURRENT AFFAIR, replacing previous host Ray Martin.</p>\n<p>That year she covered the unbelievable story of human courage and survival with the rescue of the two miners in Beaconsfield, Brant Webb and Todd Russell.</p>\n<p>Her interview with the pair &ndash; titled The Great Escape &ndash; was compelling viewing and was one of the most watched shows of 2006. It was a journalistic coup which enriched an already stellar career.</p>\n<p>Arguably at her peak, Grimshaw has tackled some of the most divisive issues of recent years and the most controversial of her career.</p>\n<p>A string of hard-hitting, exclusive interviews in 2009 created headlines across the country and set the agenda for the nation&rsquo;s talk radio stations in the days that followed.</p>\n<p>Standouts among them were her groundbreaking interviews with swimmer Simon Cowley and the fellow swimmer who assaulted him, Nick D&rsquo;Arcy.</p>\n<p>In May 2009, Grimshaw chaired what was undoubtedly the most compelling television interview of the year, when she probed former Cronulla Sharks player Matthew Johns and his wife in relation to allegations of group-sex.</p>\n<p>Grimshaw went on to win the <a href=\"https://www.walkleys.com/award-winners/tracy-grimshaw-simon-cowley-nick-darcy-and-matthew-johns/\" title=\"2009 Walkley Award\">2009 Walkley Award</a> for Broadcast and Online interviewing.</p>\n<p>The award, her first Walkley, is testament to a television journalism career during which she has consistently been one of Australia&rsquo;s most respected, talented and versatile journalists.</p>\n<p>Walkley Award judges commented: &ldquo;When Matthew Johns sat down to talk to Tracy Grimshaw, we all sat down. It was compelling television as we watched a man&rsquo;s career crumble. A tense and difficult interview, with the reporter also under particular pressures, but Grimshaw proved the expert interviewer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2010, Grimshaw fronted five entire episodes devoted to the <em>Hey Dad</em> scandal, featuring interviews with the show&rsquo;s cast and crew, including Gary Reilly, Ben Oxenbould, Sarah Monahan and Simone Buchanan.</p>\n<p>The same year, Grimshaw was nominated for a Walkley Award for Television Current Affairs Reporting in recognition of her interview with Shelly Walsh, a police officer from Cowra, NSW, who stumbled across the murder scene of her mother and two children, killed with an axe by her own father.</p>\n<p>During her time as host of A CURRENT AFFAIR, Grimshaw has presented headline-generating interviews with Paul Hogan, Bert &amp; Patti Newton, Lindy Chamberlain, Reg Grundy, Susan Falls, Michael Parkinson, Laura Andrassy and Shweta Verma (&ldquo;pram mum&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>In recent years, Tracy has made headlines for her revealing sit-down interviews with the likes of Don Burke, Bob Hawke and Pauline Hanson, and had her seminal career recognised by being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Logie_Award_for_Most_Popular_Personality_on_Australian_Television\" title=\"nominated for a Gold Logie in 2018\">nominated for a Gold Logie in 2018</a>.</p>","twitter":"tracygrimshaw","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":true},{"id":"c2630057-2689-4698-aaa5-1e5f3436354e","url":"/meet-the-team/a-current-affair/georgia-linnell","image":{"url":"/assets/img/portrait-placeholder.50f5f3ed.png","alt":"Georgia Linnell"},"displayName":"Georgia Linnell","position":"Associate Producer","abstract":"<p> </p>","bodyCopy":"<p> </p>","twitter":"","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":true},{"id":"c91be462-6469-4966-9c58-d8be6c1b3746","url":"/meet-the-team/a-current-affair/mathew-woolfrey","image":{"url":"/assets/img/portrait-placeholder.50f5f3ed.png","alt":"Mathew Woolfrey"},"displayName":"Mathew Woolfrey","position":" ","abstract":"<p> </p>","bodyCopy":"<p> </p>","twitter":"","email":"","hideAuthorInIndex":true},{"id":"f42e6e02-dab7-440f-878c-c0e3ddcea035","url":"/meet-the-team/a-current-affair/simon-bouda","image":{"src":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Hn8U0wEV5QPG-e3Q7j1syK6BoRA=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FImages%2FTeam-bios%2FNSW%2F1007_SimonBouda.jpg","sizes":"110px","srcSet":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Hn8U0wEV5QPG-e3Q7j1syK6BoRA=/110x110/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FImages%2FTeam-bios%2FNSW%2F1007_SimonBouda.jpg 110w, https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/hDOi0uhLXGxbDmx4x2URSPRiyak=/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FImages%2FTeam-bios%2FNSW%2F1007_SimonBouda.jpg 220w","alt":"Simon Bouda"},"displayName":"Simon Bouda","position":"A Current Affair Crime Editor","abstract":"Simon Bouda began his journalism career in 1976 as a part-time copyboy for News Limited where he worked for four years before moving to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> in 1980.","bodyCopy":"Simon Bouda began his journalism career in 1976 as a part-time copyboy for News Limited where he worked for four years before moving to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> in 1980.\n<p> While there, he covered everything from finance to police rounds. </p>\n<p> In 1982, Bouda began working for the <em> Northern Daily Leader </em> in Tamworth.

In 1986 Liz produced and presented a memorable documentary called 'The Great Gift', the story of heart transplant patients and the work of brilliant heart surgeon, Dr Victor Chang. For that documentary she was awarded a Logie and, soon after, the job as co-host of the national breakfast program Today. For 10 years, Liz got up at around 4am to prepare for one of the industry's toughest jobs - two hours of live television covering subjects from sport to politics, showbiz to economics. Four to five interviews a day, ranging across all these subjects, made her one of the most skilled interviewers in television. She has also hosted special event telecasts for Channel Nine over the years that have included Winter Olympics, the announcement of Sydney's successful Olympic Games bid, and fronted Today from New Guinea, Los Angeles, Wimbledon, New York, Dublin and the top end of Australia.

She completed a Bachelor of Arts (Communication) Degree at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst in 1989 and soon after landed a job in Channel Seven's Sydney newsroom as an assistant to the chief-of-staff. Tara moved to WIN Television in Wollongong in 1991, where she completed a cadetship in journalism. In June 1992 she joined the Nine Network's Nightline, compiling features including 'Australian Agenda' reports. Tara left Nightline in July 1993 to report for A Current Affair. Initially based in Melbourne, she moved to A Current Affair's Sydney office in 1994.

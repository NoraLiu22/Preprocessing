											<a name="WHAT_IS_SQUASH">WHAT IS 
											SQUASH?</a></strong></span><br><br>
											Squash is a racket and ball sport 
											played by two players in a 
											four-walled court with a small, 
											hollow rubber ball. The players 
											alternate in striking the ball with 
											their racquets onto the playable 
											surfaces of the four walls of the 
											court. The objective of the game is 
											to hit the ball in such a way that 
											the opponent is not able to play a 
											valid return. There are about 20 
											million people who play squash 
											regularly world-wide in over 185 
											countries.[1] The governing body of 
											Squash, the World Squash Federation 
											(WSF), is recognized by the 
											International Olympic Committee 
											(IOC), but the sport is not part of 
											the Olympic Games, despite a number 
											of applications. Supporters continue 
											to lobby for its incorporation in a 
											future Olympic program.<br><br>
											<strong><span class="auto-style5">
											<a name="RULES">RULES</a></span><br>
											<br class="auto-style5">General 
											Rules of Play<br>* </strong>You can 
											only hit the ball once before your 
											opponent hits it. The contact must 
											also be singular; you cannot ‘carry’ 
											the ball.<br>* The ball can only 
											bounce once on the floor.<br>* You 
											must make every effort to clear your 
											shot and ensure your opponent has 
											room to play their shot.<br><br>
											<strong><span class="auto-style5">
											<a name="CONCENTRATION">
											CONCENTRATION</a></span><br class="auto-style5">
											</strong><br>* Focus/Concentrate on 
											the task<br>* The ability to keep 
											thinking about the game plan.<br>* 
											To concentrate, without distraction, 
											for an entire match including:<br>* 
											The ability to evaluate the 
											strengths and weaknesses of the 
											opponent<br>* Keep reviewing the 
											basics of the game plan for its 
											effectiveness.<br>* Stay positive 
											right to the end of the match.<br>* 
											Keep our mind within the court and 
											focus on the task at hand.<br>* 
											Minimise distractions from outside 
											the court, including the Referee<br>
											<br><strong>
											<span class="auto-style5">LET
											<a name="PLEASE">PLEASE</a></span><br class="auto-style5">
											<br></strong>Understanding 
											interference<br>The striker must 
											make every effort to give the 
											opponent a clear path to the ball. 
											The opponent must also make every 
											effort to get to the ball. The 
											following must be practiced to avoid 
											interference:<br><br>A striker must 
											make every effort to provide his 
											opponent with unobstructed and 
											direct access to the ball<br>The 
											striker must give a fair view of the 
											ball to his opponent both before and 
											after the ball is hit<br>Last, the 
											opponent must give the striker 
											freedom to hit the ball directly to 
											all of the front wall<br>If 
											interference is called, the play is 
											a let, or a stroke. A stroke is a 
											point awarded to the obstructed 
											player. A &#39;No let&#39; is given in the 
											following situations:<br><br>The 
											opponent would not have made a good 
											return<br>The opponent did not make 
											sufficient effort to get to and play 
											the ball<br>If the opponent created 
											his own interference<br>If the 
											opponent ignored the interference 
											and played on<br>A let is always 
											given if one player stops from 
											hitting the ball due to a reasonable 
											fear of striking their opponent with 
											either the ball or the racquet. The 
											let is allowed even if no 
											interference actually occurred.<br>
											<br>The referee will award a stroke 
											to a striker if the opponent does 
											not make every effort to get out of 
											the way and the striker would have 
											made a good return. A stroke is also 
											awarded if the player would have 
											made a winning return, even if the 
											opponent makes every effort to avoid 
											interfering. Last, the referee may 
											also award a stroke to a striker if 
											their opponent makes unnecessary 
											physical contact or has an excessive 
											racquet swing.<br><br>In addition to 
											previous mentions of lets, rallies 
											are replayed when:<br><br>The 
											striker does not hit the ball in a 
											manner to ensure the safety of his 
											opponent<br>A player is distracted 
											by an occurrence on or off the court<br>
											The receiver is not ready for the 
											serve and doesn.t attempt to return 
											it<br>The ball breaks during play<br>
											Court conditions affect play<br>A 
											player may appeal a decision that 
											affects the rally by asking &quot; Let, 
											please &quot;. The referee stops play and 
											decides on the appeal. Penalties 
											that the referee may levy include a 
											warning, and a stroke, game, or 
											match awarded to the opponent.<br>
											<br>For sake of good sportsmanship, 
											players should not fish for lets. 
											Fishing is when the player tries to 
											bend the rules to win the point. In 
											other words they play the players 
											not the ball. So instead of making 
											every effort to play the ball, they 
											will stop play and hope the referee 
											will give them stroke.<br><br>

											Squash Competition Format<br>
											</strong>The Commonwealth Games 
											Squash competition is held according 
											to the rules of the World Squash 
											Federation (WSF) and will feature 
											five medal events: Men’s Singles, 
											Women’s Singles, Men’s Doubles, 
											Women’s Doubles and Mixed Doubles.<br>
											<br><strong>Singles</strong><br>
											Men’s and women’s events have the 
											same format and rules. Events are 
											conducted in a knockout format, with 
											the best two players progressing to 
											the gold medal match. Players 
											knocked out in the first round of 
											the main draw are entered into the 
											Plate competition and players 
											knocked out in the first round of 
											the Plate competition are entered in 
											the Consolation Plate competition. 
											Players knocked out in the second 
											round of the main draw are entered 
											into the Classic Plate competition.<br>
											<br>Singles events will have a 64 
											draw except where entries dictate. 
											If there are more than 64 entries 
											there may be an initial round before 
											the round of 64. If there is a round 
											of 64 there will be six rounds of 
											competition and if there is a round 
											of 32 there will be five rounds of 
											competition.<br><br>
											<strong class="auto-style3">Doubles<br>
											</strong>Men’s, women’s and mixed 
											events have the same format and 
											rules. The Doubles competition of up 
											to 32 pairs, involves a pool 
											competition with the winners of each 
											pool progressing to the knockout 
											stages. Depending on entry numbers, 
											each pool will be contested by 
											three, four or five teams and 
											similarly depending on entry 
											numbers, the knock-out stage will 
											consist of two or three rounds.<br>
											<br><strong>
											<span class="auto-style5">
											<a name="CHALLENGE">CHALLENGE</a> 
											MATCH</span><br class="auto-style5">
											</strong><br>Team line-ups must be 
											based on order of merit, with the 
											best player at number one, the 
											second-best player at number two, 
											and so on. The most accepted and 
											traditional method of establishing 
											an order of merit is the challenge 
											ladder system. If a player wins a 
											challenge match, they move up the 
											ladder; if they lose, they move 
											down. Coaches must be sure that 
											whatever systems they use are 
											logical and consistent throughout 
											the season and throughout the 
											ladder, and acceptable to their 
											teams and to other coaches.<br><br>
											Illness and Injury: A player should 
											not lose their place on a team 
											ladder simply because they have been 
											ill or injured for any length of 
											time. However, the longer a player 
											is unable to practice and play 
											matches with their team, the more 
											likely it is that their capabilities 
											would diminish while the 
											capabilities of their peers would 
											improve. Therefore, a player 
											returning to the line-up after an 
											extended absence (2 weeks or more) 
											should either be re-inserted at 
											their old position or offered a 
											challenge against the player who was 
											in the position immediately below 
											them when the absence began. Should 
											the returning player lose this 
											challenge, they should be allowed to 
											play at least one more challenge 
											down prior to their participation in 
											their first team match.<br><br>There 
											must be a competition-based 
											rationale for a returning player’s 
											spot in the line-up. The longer a 
											player has been out, the more 
											compelling the need for downward 
											challenges to re-establish the order 
											of merit.<br><br>Changes to 
											Line-ups: A line-up cannot change in 
											terms of order of merit on 
											consecutive days of competition. A 
											line-up can, however, be adjusted 
											when a player or players are added 
											or removed from it. When a player is 
											added to or removed from a line-up, 
											all other players are moved 
											accordingly in the established order 
											of merit. For example, if the number 
											4 player on a team is injured and 
											has to be removed from the line-up, 
											the number 5 player would move up to 
											the number 4 position, the original 
											number 6 player would move up to the 
											number 5 position, and so on.<br>
											<br>Challenges to Line-ups: Each 
											coach is obligated to provide 
											opposing coaches with match line-ups 
											in a timely fashion for review and 
											inquiries. An opposing coach can 
											challenge a player’s ladder position 
											based on their match and challenge 
											record that season. A coach must 
											have available upon request a list 
											of challenge results available for 
											the opposing coach to inspect before 
											each match, and the results of 
											earlier season matches are available 
											online<br><br><strong>
											<span class="auto-style5">
											<a name="TIPS">TIPS</a></span></strong><br>
											<br>1. Make sure your grip is 
											correct! You want to have a neutral 
											grip that allows you to hit both the 
											forehand and backhand from the same 
											grip. There should be a V shape that 
											runs between your thumb and 
											forefinger. Your forefinger should 
											extend up the shaft of the racket 
											giving you extra control of the 
											racket head.<br><br>2. Lift your 
											racket up on the way to the ball. As 
											soon as you know which side the ball 
											is going, take your racket head back 
											so that by the time you arrive you 
											are ready and in position to hit the 
											ball. You will be amazed by how much 
											time you have and the options you 
											can create.<br><br>3. Keep your 
											shoulders facing the side wall at 
											the point of impact on both the 
											forehand and backhand side. If you 
											over rotate and end up facing the 
											front wall you’ll most likely drag 
											the ball into the middle of the 
											court.<br><br>4. Link your movement 
											to your shot. You want to step and 
											hit so that your swing starts just 
											as your foot plants in the lunge 
											position. This helps create a 
											balanced, stable position where a 
											transfer of weight takes place 
											through the shot.<br><br>5. Give 
											yourself the best possible chance 
											and don’t let the first game slip by 
											as a result of not warming up 
											properly. Hit the ground running and 
											get yourself match ready for the 
											word go. Download our extensive 
											guide to warming up and see your 
											performance improve dramatically!<br>
											<br>6. Make sure your serve hits the 
											side wall. If you’re able to hit a 
											high serve that hits the side wall 
											before dropping into the back 
											corner, you will cause your opponent 
											lots of problems. The backhand 
											volley is one of the most difficult 
											shots in the game and serve gives 
											you a real chance to put your 
											opponent under lots of pressure from 
											the first shot of the rally.<br><br>
											7. Try to play from in front of your 
											opponent! If you can hit the ball 
											into the back corners and take 
											charge of the T zone you’ll find the 
											game much easier than if you are 
											always behind. Think about using 
											height to get the ball into the back 
											corners and then push forward 
											towards the T zone so that you’re 
											ready for the next shot.<br><br>8. 
											Volley more! Volleying takes time 
											away from your opponent and allows 
											you to stay closer to the T. Learn 
											to volley and try to take the 
											opportunities whenever you can.<br>
											<br>9. Hit the open space! If you 
											can hit the ball where your opponent 
											isn’t then you’re going to make them 
											run! Avoid hitting the ball back to 
											your opponent but also be aware that 
											a poor shot into open court can 
											leave you exposed.<br><br>10. Learn 
											to hit a good straight drive! If you 
											can hit the ball straight into the 
											back corners from all areas of the 
											court then you will limit your 
											opponent’s chances to volley and 
											give yourself the chance to get in 
											front and apply pressure.<br><br>11. 
											Learn how to return serve properly. 
											Start with an open stance facing the 
											front wall and watch your opponent 
											whilst standing approximately 1 
											racket length away from the corner 
											of the service box. This starting 
											position allows you to watch where 
											the ball is going and then transfer 
											weight into the shot.<br><br>12. 
											Play with the right ball for your 
											level! There are different balls 
											that bounce to varying degrees. The 
											pro ball should only be played with 
											when you can hit it hard enough to 
											warm it up and make it bounce 
											properly.<br><br><strong>

											<a name="FORMULA">FORMULA</a></span><br class="auto-style5">
											<br></strong>The Fitness Formula for 
											Squash and racket sports consists of 
											a number of items:<br><br>
											Cardio-respiratory fitness;<br>
											Muscle endurance, a combination of 
											the ability to deliver appropriate 
											anaerobic and aerobic power together 
											with the ability to recover (mainly 
											anaerobic recovery);<br><br>Muscle 
											strength, which is more important in 
											tennis than the other racket sports;<br>
											Muscle speed, an important component 
											of power in all the racket sports;<br>
											<br>Flexibility<br>Low percentage

											<span class="auto-style5">
											<a name="NUTRITION">NUTRITION</a></span></strong><br>
											<br>Day to day training of full-time 
											squash players increases daily 
											energy and carbohydrate 
											requirements. If squash players do 
											not consume adequate carbohydrate 
											between training sessions, they may 
											suffer fatigue and unwanted weight 
											loss and this will directly affect 
											their performance and training 
											gains. Squash players in heavy 
											training need to start recovery 
											nutrition immediately after 
											exercise. Ideally, squash players 
											should aim to consume 50 – 100 grams 
											of carbohydrate within 30 minutes 
											after training. Recovery snacks 
											should be combined with fluid to 
											replace fluid lost during exercise. 
											Squash players who are undergoing 
											puberty need extra energy and 
											nutrients for the growth and daily 
											activity. Each of the following 
											provides approximately 50 grams of 
											carbohydrate. Eat 1 to 2 of these 
											portions to ensure fast recovery 
											after a heavy training and repeat 
											this pattern after 2 hours until the 
											normal eating pattern have been 
											resumed.<br><br>650 – 800 ml of

											<br>Squash is a popular sport with 
											many participants in Australia and 
											worldwide. There are approximately 
											15 million players in 135 
											nations.1,2 The small dimension of 
											the squash court occupied by two 
											people, swinging racquets and a 
											small ball potentially travelling in 
											excess of 200 km/hour, with the 
											ability to penetrate the eye socket, 
											contribute to a high risk of eye 
											injury in this sport.3–10 
											Internationally, squash has been 
											reported as either the first or 
											second highest ranked sport 
											associated with sports related eye 
											injuries.6,11–13<br><br>These 
											injuries are almost completely 
											preventable14 by protective 
											eyewear.15 Standards approved 
											polycarbonate eyewear is the only 
											appropriate eyewear, protective 
											against squash eye injuries.14,16–18 
											Most prescription lens materials can 
											splinter on impact13,19 and other 
											unsuitable types of eyewear, such as 
											open eyeguards, may exacerbate these 
											injuries.15,20<br><br>Fewer than 10% 
											of players actually wear suitable 
											eye guards when playing 
											squash.6,19,21,22 To foster 
											protection, it is necessary to 
											understand the reasons why so few 
											players wear such protection. The 
											literature suggests that knowledge 
											of injury risk contributes to 
											decisions to adopt safety 
											measures.23–25 Surveys have found 
											many players who use inappropriate 
											eyewear believe it to be suitably 
											protective.6,19,21,22 Competition 
											players tend to use protection in 
											matches but not during practice.21 
											However, the literature has not 
											addressed influences on use of 
											eyewear or how this might vary 
											according to player characteristics.<br>
											<br>The purpose of this study is, 
											therefore, to describe player 
											characteristics associated with 
											knowledge and use of protective 
											eyewear.<br><br><strong>
											<span class="auto-style5">
											<a name="EFFICIENCY">EFFICIENCY</a></span></strong><br>
											<br>A high-level performance in 
											squash depends on many factors or 
											elements of the game, among which 
											appropriate playing tactics are 
											clearly of great importance. It 
											manifests itself in a variety of 
											strokes executed by the player or 
											group of players in a match. Given 
											the great number of different 
											strokes and their execution in 
											various parts of the court, a player 
											may select and use different strokes 
											in identical or similar 
											circumstances or the same strokes in 
											different circumstances. The proper 
											choice of stroke depends on the 
											player’s tactical assessment that 
											leads to the choice of the most 
											efficient stroke in the given 
											circumstances<br><br><br></span>

											<br>Circuit training is an excellent 
											way to improve mobility, strength 
											and stamina. The circuit training 
											comprises 6 to 10 strength exercises 
											that are completed one exercise 
											after another. Each exercise is 
											performed for a specified number of 
											repetitions or for a set time before 
											moving on to the next exercise. The 
											exercises within each circuit are 
											separated by a short rest period, 
											and each circuit is separated by a 
											longer rest period. The total number 
											of circuits performed during a 
											training session may vary from two 
											to six depending on your training 
											level (beginner, intermediate, or 
											advanced), your period of training 
											(preparation or competition) and 
											your training objective.<br><br>

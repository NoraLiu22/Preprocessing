<H1> Philodemus, On Hellenistic Philosophers</H1>

<BR><P><I> Amongst the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum_papyri">Herculaneum papyri</A> that have been unrolled, there are some summaries of the history of the Greek philosophical schools; three of them cover the Hellenistic period. They were probably all part of a larger work, with the Greek title &Sigma;&#973;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8182;&nu; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&#972;&phi;&omega;&nu;, which was written by <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodemus">Philodemus</A>. Clearly one of scrolls (the history of the Academics) was a first draft - some scraps have been found of the final version. There is also a separate treatise &quot;On the Stoics&quot;, which contains some more information about the key dates in Zenon's life, and fragments of a biography of the Epicurean philosopher Philonides, although it is not certain that this was written by Philodemus.</I>
 
<BR><P><I>Because of the unusual way that the papyri have been preserved, reading the text is notoriously difficult; in many places it is too scrappy to translate, and even in the better preserved portions some words or phrases may be misrepresented here. See <A HREF="../info/translate_key.html">key to translations</A> for an explanation of the format.</I>

<P><I>In time, we can look forward to a new, improved  critical edition and translation of these texts, produced by the University of Pisa; see their <A HREF="https://greekschools.eu">Greek Schools</A> project page.</I>

To those <I>who say this</I> it should be replied that the man who intends to be a philosopher, even when he is somewhat inexperienced, must keep himself pure from all such things, both in word and in deed; and as he advances in years, he should eradicate <I>the errors of</I> his disposition, or otherwise correct them.

<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="dsc11">11</A> . . . of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoics;</A> and it is agreed that the 'Republic' is thoroughly bad, but they say, "just as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A> in his earliest <I>writings</I> is said to have been in error <I>but</I> not to deserve condemnation, therefore neither should Zenon <I>be criticised</I>." But I say that in the earliest <I>writings of Epicurus</I> nothing disgraceful or impious can be found, but <I>the 'Republic'</I> is full of such things, which is why we are condemning it, not because it has some common and widespread errors, which are unavoidable, since it is impossible for anyone to be infallibly wise right from the beginning; and such criticisms should not be made against truly pious men by ordinary individuals. And the change and correction that occurred . . . in the others and <I>among</I> the later Stoics . . .

<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="dsc12">12</A> . . . they overlook the fact that, at the beginning of the treatise, <I>Zenon</I> explains that <I>the 'Republic'</I> sets forth what is appropriate for both the places in which he dwelt and the times in which he lived, and therefore he would deserve censure, if he did this; inasmuch as he used impossible principles to make laws for non-existent people, ignoring the people who <I>really</I> exist; and because, if this was his purpose, he was a wretched man to suggest such outrageous principles, and in what follows to attempt such reasonings as not leave <I>any</I> excess of impiety; and lastly, that through other <I>means</I> he proposed laws of a similar nature.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="ds3">[3]</A> &nbsp; Both the former ones, of whom he is an admirer, and the successors of the school <I>of philosophy</I>, some boldly claim that the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoics</A> ought not to be called to account for the failings of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon;</A> for if . . .

These judgements involve not only <I>Zenon</I> but also the other Stoics, so that even if one <I>of them</I> disowns Zenon, such as (?) <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/poseidonius.html#1">Poseidonius,</A> he will still keep the [rest of <I>the tenets of </I> the school].

<P> <A CLASS="verse" NAME="dsc14">14</A> . . . they are remote, and nothing different happens to them, because most of them are guarantors.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="ds4">[4]</A> &nbsp; To say that the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoics</A> accept <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A> on account of his discovery of the End is <I>the statement</I> of an audacious man; because they also admire the rest of his doctrines. And it is unreasonable to accept the End and not interpret the other things in accordance with it. And in consequence of the End, <I>it is necessary</I> to accept what is set out in the 'Republic'. Considering this, it would have been better if he had not become wise, so that he would not be criticised for his faults. Therefore they agree that he was a great man, even if not a wise man, and that he was the founder of their school. [But if] he had been a mediocre man, he would not have been so ambitious to fill [his work] with disgraceful [doctrines] and offensive . . .

<P> . . . [these doctrines] are accepted [by most <I>of them</I>], and admired by them, as being characteristic of their sect.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="ds5">[5]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="verse" NAME="dsc15">15</A> But with regard to those noble men who accept the 'Republic' as faultless, what could one say that was more absurd? They try to provide justifications only for the "thigh-parting", when it is surrounded by so many evil things, although they have announced that they are justifying the <I>whole</I> 'Republic', not <I>only</I> one part of it.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="ds6">[6]</A> &nbsp; But since some of our contemporaries have doubts, as they say, about the 'Republic' of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/diogenes.html#2">Diogenes,</A> <I>in which</I> they deviate from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoicism,</A> it must be said that it was <I>written</I> by Diogenes, <I>as shown</I> by its style, and as the catalogues and the libraries indicate. And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleanthes.html#1">Cleanthes</A> in his 'On Clothing' mentions it as a work of Diogenes; he praises it and gives both a summary of its contents and an account of some sections of it. And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/chrysippus.html#1">Chrysippus</A> in his 'On the City and the Law' mentions it . . . . . . in the Republics. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="dsc16">16</A> And in his <I>own</I> 'Republic', when taking about the uselessness of weapons, he says that Diogenes says the same thing - something which <I>Diogenes</I> seems to have written only in the 'Republic'. And in his 'On things that are not in themselves preferable' he says that in the 'Republic' Diogenes proposes a law that <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talus_bone#As_dice">knucklebones</A> should be used as currency. This is contained in the work about which we are talking, and in the first book of 'Against those who think differently about prudence'. Also in his 'On life according to nature' he mentions it, along with the impious <I>statements</I> it contains, and he expresses agreement with them. And in the fourth book of 'On Virtue and Pleasure' he often mentions <I>the 'Republic'</I> and its contents, with approval. And in the third book of his 'On Justice' [he mentions] the opinion about cannibalism . . . . . . <I>he</I> recorded. Perhaps he talks <I>about</I> the same topic in the seventh book of his 'On Duty' . . . this exists. <A CLASS="verse" NAME="dsc17">17</A> And Diogenes himself in his <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/atreus.html#1">'Atreus'</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/oedipus.html#1">'Oedipus'</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philiscus.html#5">'Philiscus'</A> repeats many of the offensive and impious <I>statements</I> in the 'Republic', as <I>being</I> agreeable <I>to him</I>. And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antipater.html#8">Antipater</A> in his 'Against the Schools of Philosophy' mentions the 'Republic' of Zenon and the opinions of Diogenes, which he recorded in his 'Republic'; he expresses admiration for their lack of emotion {<FONT CLASS="exotic">apatheia</FONT>}. And some say, "The 'Republic' does not belong to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sinope.html#1">Sinopean,</A> but to someone else - some wicked person, not Diogenes" . . .

<P> <I>Apart from the following fragments of his biography, Philonides and his brother are known from two inscriptions (see <A HREF="../docs/ogis/s241.html">OGIS_241</A>); and the name of Philonides also appears in the introduction to the second book of 'Conics' by <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga">Apollonius of Perge</A>, which takes the form of a letter: &quot;Apollonius to Eudemus, greeting. &nbsp; If you are in good health, it is well; I too am moderately well. I have sent my son Apollonius to you with the second  book of my collected Conics. Peruse it carefully and communicate it to those who are worthy to take part in such studies. And if Philonides the geometer, whom I introduced to you in Ephesus, should at any time visit the neighbourhood of Pergamum, communicate the book to him. Take care of your health. Farewell.&quot;</I>

<P> <I>On the controversial question of the relationship between Philonides' philosophical beliefs and his interest in geometry, see &quot;The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy&quot;, chapter 18.2 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&pg=PA587">Google Books</A> ); and R.

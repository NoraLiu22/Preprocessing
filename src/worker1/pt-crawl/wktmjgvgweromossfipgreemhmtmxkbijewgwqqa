<P> <FONT CLASS="ref">[11.1]</FONT> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#1"> L</A>&nbsp; In the army of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philippus.html#2">Philippus</A> there were various nations, and after his death different feelings prevailed among them. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Some, oppressed with an unjust yoke, were excited with hopes of recovering their liberty; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> others, from dislike of going to war in a distant country, rejoiced that the expedition was broken off; <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> others grieved that the torch, kindled at the daughter's nuptials, should have been applied to the funeral pile of the father. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> It was no small fear, too, that possessed his friends on so sudden a change, contemplating at one time <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#2">Asia</A> that had been provoked, at another <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/europe.html#1">Europe</A> that was not yet pacified, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> at another the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/illyria.html#1">Illyrians</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrace.html#1">Thracians</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dardani.html#1">Dardanians</A>, and other barbarous nations, who were of wavering faith and perfidious dispositions, and whom, if they should all rebel at once, it would be utterly impossible to resist. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> To all these apprehensions the succession of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A> was a relief, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> who, in a public assembly, so effectually soothed and encouraged the people, as to remove all uneasiness from those that were afraid, and to fill every one with favourable expectations. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> He was now twenty years old; at which age he gave great promise of what he would be, but with such modesty, that it was evident he reserved the further proofs of his ability for the time of action. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> He granted the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonians</A> relief from all burdens, except that of service in war; by which conduct he gained such popularity with his subjects, that they said they had changed only the person, not the virtues, of their king. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.2">[11.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> His first care was about his father's funeral, when he caused all who had been privy to his murder to be put to death at his burial-place. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> The only one that he spared was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#43">Alexander</A> Lyncestes  his brother, preserving in him the man who had first acknowledged his royal authority, for he had been the first to salute him king. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> His brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caranus.html#2">Caranus</A>, a rival for the throne, as being the son of his step-mother, he ordered to be slain. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> In the beginning of his reign he put down many tribes that were revolting, and quelled some seditions in their birth. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Encouraged by his success, he marched with haste into Greece, where, after his father's example, having summoned the states to meet at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/corinth.html#1">Corinth</A>, he was appointed general in his place. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> He then turned his attention to the war with Persia, of which a commencement had been made by Philippus; <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> but, as he was engaged in preparations for it, he received intelligence that "the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thebes.html#1">Thebans</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athens.html#1">Athenians</A> had gone over from his side to that of the Persians, and that the author of the defection was the orator <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demosthenes.html#3">Demosthenes</A>, who had been bribed by the Persians with a large sum of money, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> and who had asserted that the whole army of the Macedonians, with their king, had been cut off by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/triballi.html#1">Triballi</A>, producing the author of the information before an assembly of the people, a man who said that he had been wounded in the battle in which the king had fallen. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> In consequence of which statement," it was added, "the feelings of almost all the cities were changed, and the garrisons of the Macedonians besieged." <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> To repress these commotions, he marched upon Greece with an army in full array, and with such speed, that they could scarcely believe they saw him of whose approach they were so little aware. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.3">[11.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> In the course of his march he had exhorted the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thessaly.html#1">Thessalians</A> to peace, reminding them of the kindnesses shown them by his father Philippus, and of his mother's connection with them by the family of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aeacidae.html#1">Aeacidae</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> The Thessalians gladly listening to such an address, he was chosen, like his father, supreme commander of the whole nation, and they resigned into his hand all their customs and public revenues. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> The Athenians, as they had been the first to rebel, were also the first to repent of their rebellion, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> turning their contempt for their enemy into admiration of him, and extolling the youth of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A>, which they had previously despised, above the merits of old generals. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Sending ambassadors, therefore, they deprecated war; and Alexander, listening to their treaties, and severely reproving them for their conduct, laid aside hostilities against them. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> He then directed his march towards Thebes, intending to show similar indulgence, if he found similar penitence. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> But the Thebans had recourse, not to prayers or in treaties, but to arms, and, being conquered, suffered the severest hardships of the most wretched state of subjugation. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> It being debated in a council of war whether the city should be destroyed, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phocis.html#1">Phocians</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/plataea.html#1">Plataeans</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thespiae.html#1">Thespians</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/orchomenus.html#2">Orchomenians</A>, who were the allies of Alexander and sharers in his victory, dwelt upon the destruction of their own cities and the cruelty of the Thebans, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> urging against them not only their present, but former, defection to the Persians, to the prejudice of the common liberty of Greece; <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> "on which account," they said, "they were an object of general hatred, as was manifest from the fact that all the Greeks had bound themselves by an oath to demolish Thebes as soon as they had conquered the Persians." <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> They brought forward also the fabulous accounts of their old crimes, with which they had filled every theatre, to make them odious not only for their recent perfidy, but for their ancient infamy.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.4">[11.4]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#4"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleadas.html#3">Cleadas</A>, one of those who had been taken prisoners, being permitted to speak in their behalf, said, that "they had not revolted from the king, whom they understood to be killed, but from the king's heirs; <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> that what had been done in the matter was the fault, not of treachery, but of credulity; for which, however, they had already suffered severely by the loss of the flower of their soldiery; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> that there was left them only a multitude of old men and women, equally weak and harmless, but who had been so harassed by contumelies and insults, that they had never endured anything more grievous; <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> and that he did not now intercede for his countrymen, of whom so few survived, but for their unoffending natal soil, and for a city which had given birth, not only to men, but to gods." <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He endeavoured to work upon the king, too, from his superstitious regard for Hercules, who had been born at Thebes, and from whom the family of the Aeacidae was descended, and from the reflection that the youth of his father Philippus had been spent at Thebes; <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> and he conjured him "to spare a city which adored some of his ancestors, who had been born in it, as gods, and saw others who had been brought up in it, princes of the highest dignity." <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> But resentment was more powerful than entreaty. The city was in consequence demolished, the lands divided among the conquerors, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> and the prisoners publicly sold, their price being settled not for the profit of those who bought them, but according to the hatred of their enemies. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Their fate seemed to the Athenians deserving of pity; and they therefore, though contrary to the king's prohibition, opened their gates for the reception of the exiles. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> At this proceeding Alexander was so displeased, that when they deprecated war by a second embassy, he forbore from hostilities only on condition that their orators and leaders, through confidence in whom they had so often rebelled, should be delivered up to him. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> The Athenians preparing to comply, lest they should be compelled to abide a war, the matter ended in this arrangement, that the orators should be retained and the generals banished; <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> when the latter immediately went over to Darius, and formed no inconsiderable addition to the strength of the Persians.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.5">[11.5]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#5"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> When he set out to the Persian war, he put to death all his step-mother's relations whom Philippus had advanced to any high dignity, or appointed to any command. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Nor did he spare such of his own kinsmen as seemed qualified to fill the throne, lest any occasion for rebellion should be left in Macedonia during his absence; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> and of the tributary princes he took such as were distinguished for ability to the war with him, leaving the less able at home for the defence of his dominions. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Having then assembled his troops, he put them on shipboard, where, excited with incredible animation at the sight of Asia, he erected altars to the twelve gods to offer prayers for success in the war. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He divided all his private property, which he had in Macedonia and the rest of Europe, among his friends, saying, "that for himself Asia was sufficient." <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Before any ship left the shore, he offered sacrifices, praying for "victory in that war, in which he had been chosen the avenger of Greece so often assailed by the Persians, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> to whom," he said, "a reign sufficiently long had been granted, a reign that had now reached maturity, and it was time that others, who would conduct themselves better, should take their place." <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Nor were the anticipations of the army different from those of the prince; <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> for all the soldiers, unmindful of their wives and children, and of the length of the expedition from home, contemplated the Persian gold, and the wealth of the whole east, as already their own prey, thinking neither of the war nor its perils, but of riches only. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> When they arrived at the continent of Asia, Alexander first of all threw a dart into the enemy's country, and leaped on the shore in full armour, like one dancing the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tripudium">tripudium</A>. He then proceeded to offer sacrifices, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> praying that "those countries might not unwillingly receive him as their king." <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> He also sacrificed at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/troy.html#1">Troy</A>, at the tombs of the heroes who had fallen in the Trojan war.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.6">[11.6]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#6"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> Marching forward in quest of the enemy, he kept the soldiers from ravaging Asia, telling them that "they ought to spare their own property, and not destroy what they came to possess." <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> His army consisted of thirty-two thousand infantry, and four thousand five hundred cavalry, with a hundred and eighty-two ships. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Whether, with this small force, it is more wonderful that he conquered the world, or that he dared to attempt its conquest, is difficult to determine. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> When he selected his troops for so hazardous a warfare, he did not choose robust young men, or men in the flower of their age, but veterans, most of whom had even passed their term of service, and who had fought under his father and his uncles; <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> so that he might be thought to have chosen, not soldiers, but masters in war. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> No one was made an officer who was not sixty years of age; so that he who saw the captains assembled at head-quarters, would have declared that he saw the senate of some ancient republic. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> None, on the field of battle, thought of flight, but every one of victory; none trusted in his feet, but everyone in his arms. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> King Darius, on the other hand, from confidence in his strength, abstained from all artifice in his operations; observing that "clandestine measures were fit only for a stolen victory;" he did not attempt to repel the enemy from his frontiers, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> but admitted them into the heart of his kingdom, thinking it more honourable to drive war out of his kingdom than not to give it entrance. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> The first engagement, in consequence, was fought on the plains of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/adrasteia.html#2">Adrastia</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> The Persian army consisted of six hundred thousand men, who were conquered not less by the valour of the Macedonians than by the conduct of Alexander, and took to flight. The slaughter among the Persians was great. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Of the army of Alexander there fell only nine foot-soldiers, and a hundred and twenty horse, <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> whom the king buried sumptuously as an encouragement to the rest, honouring them also with equestrian statues, and granting privileges to their relatives. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> After this victory the greater part of Asia came over to his side. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> He had also several encounters with Darius's lieutenants, whom he conquered, not so much by his arms, as by the terror of his name. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.7">[11.7]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#7"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> During the course of these proceedings, he was acquainted, on the information of a certain prisoner, that a conspiracy was forming against him by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#43">Alexander</A> Lyncestes the son-in-law of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antipater.html#1">Antipater</A>, who had been made governor of Macedonia. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Fearing, therefore, that, if he were put to death, some disturbance might arise in Macedonia, he only kept him in prison.
  
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> He soon after marched to a city called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gordium.html#1">Gordium</A>, which is situated between the Greater and Lesser <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phrygia.html#1">Phrygia</A>, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> and which he earnestly desired to take, not so much for the sake of plunder, as because he had heard that in that city, in the temple of Jupiter, was deposited the yoke of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gordius.html#2">Gordius</A>'s cart; the knot of which, if anyone should loose, the oracles of old had predicted that he should rule all Asia. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The cause and origin of the matter was as follows. When Gordius was ploughing in these parts, with oxen that he had hired, birds of every kind began to fly about him. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Going to consult the augurs of the next town on the occurrence, he met at the gate a virgin of remarkable beauty, and asked her "which of the augurs he had best consult." <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> When she, having heard his reason for consulting them, and knowing something of the art from the instruction of her parents, replied, that "a kingdom was portended to him," and offered to become his wife and the sharer of his expectations. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> So fair a match seemed the chief felicity of a throne. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> After his marriage a civil war arose among the Phrygians; <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> and when they consulted the oracles how their discord might be terminated, the oracles replied that "a king was required to settle their disputes." <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Inquiring a second time as to the person of the king, they were directed to regard him as their king whom they should first observe, on their return, going to the temple of Jupiter on a cart. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> The person who presented himself to them was Gordius, and they at once saluted him king. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> He dedicated the cart, in which he was riding when the throne was offered him, "to kingly majesty," and it was placed in the temple of Jupiter. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> After him reigned his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/midas.html#1">Midas</A>, who, having been instructed by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/orpheus.html#1">Orpheus</A> in sacred rites, filled all Phrygia with ceremonies of religion, by which he was better protected, during his whole life, than by arms. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A>, having taken the city, and gone to the temple of Jupiter, requested to see the yoke of Gordius's cart, <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> and, when it was shown him, not being able to find the ends of the cords, which were hidden within the knots, he put a forced interpretation on the oracle, and cut the cords with his sword; and thus, when the coils were opened out, discovered the ends concealed in them.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.8">[11.8]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#8"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> While he was thus engaged, intelligence was brought him that Darius was approaching with a vast army. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Fearing the defiles, he crossed Mount <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/taurus.html#1">Taurus</A> with the utmost speed, advancing, in one of his forced marches, five hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_%28unit_of_length%29">stades</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Arriving at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarsus.html#1">Tarsus</A>, and being charmed with the pleasantness of the river Cydnus, which flows through the midst of the city, he threw off his armour, and, covered as he was with dust and sweat, plunged himself into the water, which was then excessively cold; <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> when, on a sudden, such a numbness seized his nerves, that his voice was lost, and not only was there no hope of saving his life, but not even a means of delaying death could be found. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> One of his physicians, named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philippus.html#34">Philippus</A>, was the only person that promised a cure; but a letter from Parmenion, which arrived the day before from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cappadocia.html#1">Cappadocia</A>, rendered him an object of suspicion; <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> for Parmenion, knowing nothing of Alexander's illness, had written to caution him against trusting Philippus, as he had been bribed by Darius with a large sum of money. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Alexander, however, thought it better to trust the doubtful faith of the physician, than to perish of certain disease. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Taking the cup from Philippus, therefore, he gave him Parmenion's letter to read, and, as he drank, fixed his eyes upon the physician's countenance while he was reading. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Seeing him unmoved, he became more cheerful, and recovered his health on the fourth day after.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11.9">[11.9]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte11.html#9"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> Meantime Darius advanced to battle with four hundred thousand foot and a hundred thousand horse. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> So vast a multitude of enemies caused some distrust in Alexander, when he contemplated the smallness of his own army; but he called to mind, at the same time, how much he had already done, and how powerful people he had overthrown, with that very moderate force. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> His hopes, therefore, prevailing over his apprehensions, and thinking it more hazardous to defer the contest, lest dismay should fall upon his men, he rode round among his troops, and addressed those of each nation in an appropriate speech. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> He excited the Illyrians and Thracians by describing the enemy's wealth and treasures, and the Greeks by putting them in mind of their wars of old, and their deadly hatred towards the Persians. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He reminded the Macedonians at one time of their conquests in Europe, and at another of their desire to subdue Asia, boasting that no troops in the world had been found a match for them, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> and assuring them that this battle would put an end to their labours and crown their glory. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> In the course of these proceedings he caused the army occasionally to halt, that they might, by such stoppages, accustom themselves to endure the sight of so great a multitude. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Nor was Darius less active in drawing up his forces. Rejecting the services of his officers, he rode himself through the whole army, encouraged the several divisions, and put them in mind of the ancient glory of the Persians, and the perpetual possession of empire vouchsafed them by the immortal gods. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Soon after a battle was fought with great spirit. Both kings were wounded in it. The result remained doubtful until Darius fled,<FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT>  when there ensued a great slaughter of the Persians, of whom there fell sixty-one thousand infantry and ten thousand horse, and forty thousand were taken prisoners. On the side of the Macedonians were killed a hundred and thirty foot and a hundred and fifty horse. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> In the camp of the Persians was found abundance of gold and other treasures; <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> and among the captives taken in it were the mother and wife, who was also the sister, of Darius, and two of his daughters. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> When Alexander came to see and console them, they threw themselves, at the sight of his armed attendants, into one another's arms, and uttered mournful cries, as if expecting to die immediately. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Afterwards, falling at the feet of Alexander, they begged, not that they might live, but that their death might be delayed till they should bury the body of Darius. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> Alexander, touched with the respectful concern of the princesses for Darius, assured them that the king was still alive, and removed their apprehensions of death; directing, at the same time, that they should be treated as royal personages, <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> and giving the daughters hopes of husbands suitable to the dignity of their father.

As he was returning, on one occasion, from a banquet, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/medius.html#1">Medius</A>, a Thessalian, proposing to renew their revelling, invited him and his attendants to his house. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Taking up a cup, he suddenly uttered a groan while he was drinking, as if he had been stabbed with a dagger, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> and being carried half dead from the table, he was excruciated with such torture that he called for a sword to put an end to it, and felt pain at the touch of his attendants as if he were all over wounds. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> His friends reported that the cause of his disease was excess in drinking, but in reality it was a conspiracy, the infamy of which the power of his successors threw into the shade.

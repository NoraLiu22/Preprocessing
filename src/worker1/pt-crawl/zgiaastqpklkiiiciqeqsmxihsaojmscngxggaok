/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

	<p><font size="-1"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Remarkably, scientists already knew about mix-and-match cryptic-conspicuous forms of protective coloration in three other contexts. One of these is deimatism, in which cryptic prey briefly flash a hidden conspicuous patch to cause the predator to hesitate--such prey might or might not have chemical defences. Another is flash coloration, whereby prey expose conspicuous patches while fleeing but hide them as soon as they come to rest, causing the predator to search for an inappropriate object. The third is distance-dependent camouflage, in which defended prey are cryptic far off but conspicuous up close. However, none of these three examples was used to solve the aposematism paradox until now. With a new solution at hand, namely that aposematism can evolve without loss of crypsis, it is essential to examine how widespread the phenomenon is by investigating other groups of species with 'dangerous' reputations, such as sea slugs and snakes. Once again, Wallace has led the way, and we mortals simply follow on behind. . . . --Tim Caro, 1 June 2023. <i>Nature</i> 618: 34-35.

	<p><font size="-1"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The preceding paragraphs raise the question: What is the probability of the emergence of technological intelligence (TI) (e.g., humans) in land- and ocean-based habitats? Earth is composed of both types of environments, but ocean worlds only possess the latter. This topic has an unexpectedly long history. Alfred Russel Wallace, who is renowned as the codiscoverer of the theory of natural selection (along with Charles Darwin), contended over a century ago that worlds with both continents and oceans are apposite for the evolution of complex animal-like life forms (Wallace 1903, Ch. 12). In recent times, by performing mathematical analyses, Simpson (2017) and Lingam & Loeb (2019) posited that the concomitant existence of oceans and continents on Earth was pivotal for the genesis of TI. . . . --Manasvi Lingam <i>et al.</i>, 1 March 2023. <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i> 945:23.<br><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Copernican alternative we tackle entails subscribing to the notion that TI is much harder to engender in OBHs than in LBHs. This premise was intimated in Wallace (1903, Ch. 12) and postulated in the Bayesian treatment by Simpson (2017). If this conjecture is correct, the water-to-land transition of vertebrates constitutes one of the major evolutionary breakthroughs in Earth's history (Knoll & Bambach 2000). . . . --Manasvi Lingam <i>et al.</i>, 1 March 2023. <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i> 945:23.

<p><font size="-1"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he did better than many of his contemporaries when it came to respecting local knowledge. In his 1852 paper, for example, Wallace notes that his fellow European naturalists often give vague information about the locality of their collected specimens, and fail to specify such localities in relation to river margins. By contrast, he writes, the "native hunters are perfectly acquainted" with the impact of rivers on the distribution of species, "and always cross over the river when they want to procure particular animals, which are found even on the river’s bank on one side, but never by any chance on the other." Likewise, in his 1853 book, Wallace frequently corroborates his findings with information he has obtained from Indigenous people--for example, about the habitat preferences of umbrellabirds (<i>Cephalopterus ornatus</i>) or of "cow-fish" (manatees; <i>Trichechus inunguis</i>) . . . --Camila C. Ribas, 5 January 2023. <i>Nature</i> 613: 26.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interestingly, and just a few years before his death, in 1910 Wallace had two important publications. His contribution to the Harmsworth multi-author work, <i>Natural History</i>, was an article on global biogeography. On a very 'busy' map (p. 69), he depicted the realm divides using thin, often ambiguous, closely spaced dotted lines; in the Indo-Australian Archipelago, he followed Wallace (1863). He then added bolder lines to delimit the ranges of key taxa: tigers, monkeys (here he meant all primates as it included Madagascar's lemurs and Asia's lorises and tarsiers), marsupials and a "region without cats." Arguably, what Wallace was demonstrating on this portion of the chart, and in other places also, is the inherent problem of drawing a realm-boundary across what is a biogeographically 'messy' part of the globe. As is appreciated today, the biotic distributions reflect the present and recent-glacial-period geography, and the deeper geological and geotectonic history, as well as the high-level biological complexity . . . --Jason R. Ali & Lawrence R. Heaney, January 2023. <i>Journal of Biogeography</i> 50(1): 33.

		<p><font size="-1"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     . . . In one 1881 piece on the subject, the <i>New York Times</i> speculated: "In the present age we are coming to a point where the assurance of weather prophets begins to look less ridiculous . . . Men are no longer sure that they cannot, in some future time, control the elements to such an extent that uninhabitable regions will become habitable, arid districts become arable, frozen islands unlock their ice-bound coasts. . . . The attention to tree-planting points one way, namely, to a modification of climate through the attraction and retention of moisture and the formation and retention of soil . . . But lately, thanks to the labors of geologists like Dr. Croll, and of naturalists on the largest mental scale like Alfred Russel Wallace, a great stride forward has been made in our knowledge of the action of the sea upon the climate of contiguous lands." Wallace, the <i>Times</i> explained, had shown how in the geological past, even the North Pole had enjoyed tropical climes. Ocean currents bathed its Arctic shores with gentle warmth, not unlike the Gulf Stream. The editorial speculated that if a waterway could be created following "the track of the old sea that geologists have long laid down between Asia and Europe, the northern shores of both continents would support rich vegetation, birds and beasts, communities of civilized men." Noting proposals for flood control on the Mississippi and a canal through Panama, the editorial went on to ask: "what will we not be capable of in the year 2000? Is it madness to imagine that bodies of warm tropical water can be led to cold shores?" . . . --Robert Suits, 2023. <i>The Western Historical Quarterly</i> 54:  144-145.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spinoza contended that God and nature are one and the same: that is, that all of existence is a single entity/reality, and that there is nothing 'outside' of it. There are thus no 'first causes' in the sense of a God operating against natural law to create new, unpredictable results. Among the implications of this position is that there is no such thing as the 'supernatural,' a term that, obviously, describes a departure from natural law. This also means that there are no such things as miracles, if one interprets the latter concept to signify events that are brought about through an independent God's (or some other) aberrant influence on the natural state of things. What, then, did Spinoza think of the 'miraculous' events that have been witnessed and described over history by seemingly sane and reliable sources? Simply, that these are instances of the emergence of causalities that are not yet appreciated in objective terms--that is to say, that are 'natural,' but merely so odd and rarely witnessed as to require new appreciations of the underlying physical reality. This is exactly what Wallace argues in two of his early treatments of spiritualism (see Wallace 1866, 1870).  Wallace wanted us to accept that the phenomena of spiritualism are a part of the natural order, and that such things as the medium Daniel Home allegedly levitating in the air are not 'miraculous' events, but instead a not-yet understood aspect of the potentialities inherent in the natural order. . . . --Charles H. Smith, December 2022. <i>Alfred Russel Wallace Notes</i> 23: 3.

This is how Wallace describes his aim: "Having long been acquainted with most of the works dealing with the question of the supposed Plurality of Worlds, I was quite aware of the very superficial treatment the subject had received, even in the hands of the most able writers, and this made me the more willing to set forth the whole of the available evidence--astronomical, physical, and biological--in such a way as to show both what was proved and what suggested by it." This choice of topic might well be considered ahead of its time, as it is now of far greater interest than ever before; one wonders how Wallace's opinions might have evolved in the light of increased scientific knowledge . . . --Martin Rees, August 2022. <i>Astronomy & Astrophysics</i> 63(4): 4.22.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dominant theorizing and research surrounding the operation of intersexual selection in evolutionary psychology tends to be guided by an adaptationist framework and aligned with models of sexual selection involving direct benefits (e.g., parental care) and indirect "good gene" and condition-dependent benefits. In this way, evolutionary psychologists more often espouse Alfred Russel Wallace's utilitarian viewpoint that traits become attractive because they honestly signal vigor and vitality, which gives priority to natural selection. In doing so, Darwin's esthetic perspective originally articulated in <i>The Descent of Man</i> and alternative models of sexual selection (e.g., Fisherian runaway), are given less consideration. This is despite some informative reviews on the topic in evolutionary psychology. In the current conceptual analysis, we discuss the potential of Prum's Lande-Kirkpatrick (LK) null model of sexual selection to help make sense of some of the mixed evidence regarding the links between attractive traits and purported markers of phenotypic and genetic condition. We then consider how the implications of the LK null model can help to shift theoretical assumptions and guide future work in evolutionary psychology on intersexual selection . . . --Adam C.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other writings I have advanced my belief that Wallace's adoption of spiritualism had relatively little effect on the development of most of his scientific positions, but now I must admit that in one sense, at least, it did. Then again, it was perhaps not so much spiritualism per se, but this earlier 'lesson' involving mesmerism: that one must not assume ignorant superstition underlies all of the more remote-from-convention phenomena, but instead first consider the possibility that a real world basis exists for belief in same.  And this was not just a 'Devil's advocate' kind of position:  he felt that unbiased assessments should begin with posed naturalistic explanations, no matter how divergent the phenomenon in question might be. Thus, my verdict elsewhere that his efforts to isolate causes, though possibly including ventures into the realms of scientism and hypernaturalism, never invoked theism: for example, he followed Spinozian logic arguing that the observed 'miracles' of the past ages were not necessarily fictions or violations of natural law, but in most cases likely consisted of phenomena not yet understood within a scientific context. . . . --Charles H.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major obstacle for Wallace and his many agendas, on both natural and social fronts, was cognitive dissonance: despite his spectacular talent for marshalling evidence, it was often not enough merely to back up his arguments with factual information.  And he was aware of this from quite early on.  As far back as the mid-1840s, when he found himself able to elicit many of the effects of mesmeric trance scoffed at by most doctors and men of science, he felt he had learned his "first great lesson in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest.  The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong." (Wallace 1893)  Years of resistance to his natural selection model by conservative thinkers provided another such lesson, as did his attempts to convince his peers of the relevance of spiritualism.  But the coup de grace came with the earlier-mentioned 1870s conflict with the flat-earthers over the Bedford Canal Experiment, devised to prove that the earth is, the urgings of cult extremists notwithstanding, a sphere. . . . --Charles H.

Since the 1800s, researchers and bird enthusiasts have pondered the question of why some species lay decorated eggs and what purpose this could serve. Egg shapes vary from elliptical to spherical, ground colors range from white to bright blue to brown, and eggshells can be heavily patterned with additional pigments. Alfred Russel Wallace was the first to suggest that variation in egg coloration represented the general fitness and health of the hen and that egg color and patterning were only constrained by predation. The adaptation of pigment patterns in eggs is driven by natural selection with predation selecting for crypsis through patterns adapted to nest substrates. Various hypotheses have additionally been proposed to explain variation in egg pigmentation within and between species, including thermoregulation of the embryo, enhanced shell strength, and antimicrobial properties of pigments . . .  --Emily W.

. . . Before boarding again, they were told by an employee of the mill that they should wait a little longer because the <i>pororoca</i> was on its way. The great wave this time broke quickly and violently. After the waters calmed down, back in the river, Wallace could see the devastation it had caused: uprooted trees, layers of mud, collapsed ravines (Wallace 1853: 129-130). According to Wallace, the most common explanation for the phenomenon was the meeting of fresh water from the upper course of the river with the salt water existing in the lower course. Others believed that the pororoca occurred due to excess water in a river considered narrow by Amazonian standards. Wallace claimed that both beliefs were wrong: when analyzing the depth of the river and the shallows along the voyage, he concluded that the waters of the high tides, pushed by the ocean, reached the Guamá River at high speed. When they reached the narrowest points, they increased in size and, when they rushed into the shoals existing in the bed, they generated a fast wave. Wallace illustrated this process with a drawing. Each time the wave crashed into a shoal, it became higher and stronger as the river narrowed further and further upstream (Wallace 1853: 130-131) . . . --Nelson Sanjad & Cláudio Ximenes, 2022. <i>Rodriguésia</i> e00512022.2022, p. 5.

Wallace, the younger co-discoverer of Darwinian evolution, presented 'harmony' as an overarching selection force in the evolution of life: 'health, strength, and long life are the results of a harmony between the individual and the universe that surrounds it'. For Wallace, a plant or animal is in harmony with its environment when it is well-matched to it. When the environment changes, a species can fall out of harmony. Natural selection can return an animal species to harmony with a changing universe, 'like the governor of a steam engine', but only through slow change over many generations. In contrast, Wallace notes that 'man is kept in harmony by his mind'. In <i>The Descent of Man</i>, Darwin quotes Wallace, saying that 'man is enabled through his mental faculties to keep with an unchanged body in harmony with the changing universe'. The concept of harmony here is clear enough: organisms that better harmonise with their environment will flourish. In the classical meaning, harmony is defined as the joining together of diverse elements into a well-<i>fitted</i> whole: so, 'survival of the fittest' could also reasonably be termed 'survival of the harmonised'. Harmony is an important concept in many cultures, including in indigenous spiritual systems in the Americas and in Africa. Historically, the concept emerged as a dominant philosophical theme almost simultaneously around 550 BC in ancient China and in ancient Greece, a coincidence perhaps comparable to the simultaneous discovery of Darwinism. While the concept of 'harmony' might strike some as unscientific, it actually played a key role in the development of the Western sciences. . . . --Lin & Lomas, 2022.

...Wallace's line, named after him, as the boundary between the Oriental realm and the Australian realm, is his important contribution. His "the geographical distribution of animals" is regarded as the foundation work of animal geography. Although some people have made some modifications, it is almost unchanged until now.  However, people's discussion on higher zoogeography has not stopped. On the one hand, they discuss the rationality of "Wallace's line," and on the other hand, they try to equip biogeography with quantitative analysis methods. In the 21st century, people's attention to animal geographical zoning is rising rapidly, and various geographical zoning schemes of 7-14 boundaries are proposed for different animal groups with different methods . . . --Shen Xiaocheng <i>et al.</i>, 2022. <i>Journal of Environmental Science and Engineering</i> B11: 97.

Contrary to what most historians have assumed, we show that Wallace made important contributions to the study of ethnology in Britain even before publishing on his theories of human origins and evolution, as well as biogeography of human diversity, in the 1860s. We argue that Wallace's collaboration with Latham on the Crystal Palace ethnological exhibition is decisive to our understanding of two important points: the scholarly reception of the ethnographic findings from his Amazonian journey and the emergence of indigenous Amazonian peoples as visual displays in the British public's imagination through the new science of ethnology. Wallace's participation in the exhibition was his first direct contribution to this field upon returning home. In addition, the handbook to the exhibition fostered the dissemination of his travel narrative, mistakenly assumed not to have been very well received . . . --Victor Rafael Limeira-DaSilva & Juanma Sánchez Arteaga, November 2021. <i>Nuncius</i> 36(3): 646.

The impact of Chambers's anonymously-authored <i>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i> on Wallace has been discussed frequently over the years, but Humboldt's hold on him, apart from the German's example as a natural history collector and observer, has largely been ignored.  Nevertheless, the influence is there, manifest in Wallace's usage of Humboldtian terminology over the rest of his life, and in the younger man's adoption of many of the older one's philosophical views. In particular, the notion that the factors supporting evolution are balanced is chapter and verse from Humboldt's 'general equilibrium of forces' principle, the very foundation of Humboldtian science.  Beyond this, Humboldt promoted a concept of 'terrestrial physics'--loosely, physical geography--that sought to elaborate on the interconnectedness of vegetation with its surrounding environment.  All of this was based on the proposition that the infinite forces of nature were constantly in conflict, yet tended to balance one another out.  In Wallace's work, the most obvious appropriation of these ideas is natural selection itself,  which  Wallace  once  famously  likened  to  the  action  of  the  governor  on  a  steam engine. . . . --Charles H.

The term "active Darwinism" captures one of the main conclusions of this article. Darwin himself was an active proponent of the idea, both in <i>The Origin of Species</i> and in his book <i>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</i>. He clearly considered sexual selection to be distinct from natural selection, a view that was strongly challenged by his co-discoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace. Like many modern neo-Darwinists, Wallace argued that sexual selection could readily be explained by natural selection. Why has this argument not been settled even after more than 150 years? If it was a straightforward empirical question surely it would have been. The problem is that it is not a straightforward empirical question, particularly within reductionist accounts of living organisms. To see this point we have only to ask the question what is the theory of natural selection? . . . --Denis Noble, July 2021. <i>Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology</i> 162: 126.

The first concerns the several groups of people who, though often nominally friends of Wallace's memory, are in my opinion doing damage to the goal of reaching an accurate overall appreciation of his contribution. This effort will not involve pointing fingers at individually named persons--there is no need--but, nevertheless, at some stage one feels an urge to take stock. Second, I would like to describe Wallace's general approach to knowledge accumulation, a central component of which involves the willingness to be flexible; I then provide a sample of the many times he modified his opinion as he encountered new, mind-changing, kinds of information. . . . --Charles H.

. . . Wallace spent his life considering the relationship between evolution and geographical distribution in his theory, and continued to explain the influence changes in the geographical factors of the environment have on the distribution of living things and evolution. He stressed changes in the Earth's crust such as upheaval and subsidence as impacts had on the distribution and isolation of living things. This is also reflected in the differences between Darwin's and Wallace's theories of evolution. In Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i>, the main constituent of evolution is very much the bion. An individual in a species occupies various positions and locations in connecting with the ecosystem, the individual proactively adapts to those conditions and variation is produced. At length, the variation of each individual accumulates on average, the whole species diverges and new species are formed. In contrast, Wallace's evolutionary theory states that the unit of evolution is variation; only variations to adapt to changes in environmental conditions such as ensuring a food supply occur; and these evolve into a new independent species . . . --Wataru Nojiri, 2021. <i>Bulletin of the Research Institute, St. Andrew’s University</i> 46(3): 130.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I surmise Wallace recognized a distinction between the possibly 'productive' or 'unproductive' agendas behind such 'thought-transference.' Whereas premonitions in some cases represented useful event-specific warnings, and the contents of dreams were attuned to more general ethical lessons, the proactive, pre-emptive, strategy of prayer was more problematic.  Simply, so many prayers were merely self-serving efforts that could not be justified in the larger scheme of things.  (Consider, for example, the pre-game prayers for victory sometimes offered by athletic teams: except in the rarest of situations, why would any self-respecting higher power feel compelled to honor these desires any more than they would their opponents'?)  As Hubbard states above, "all useful effort is sacred, and nothing else is or can be." . . . --Charles H. Smith, November 2020. <i>Alfred Russel Wallace Notes</i> 13: 4.

Furthermore, Gandhi frequently resorted not only to science, but to theories of scientists as well, which he used to express or reinforce his own ideas. For example, during a speech in a meeting organised by the Muir Central College Economic Society in 1916, he referred to Alfred Russel Wallace, a scientist well known for his contribution to the development of the theory of evolution and belief in an intangible origin. Gandhi suggested that science ought to be practised by everyone without any distinctions--of expert and layman, or of elite and subaltern--giving more importance to a research attitude, rather than scientific qualifications. That is to say, with regard to the creation of scientific knowledge, every person or every worker is recognised as part of the scientific process without replacing the specific expertise of everyone, including that of scientists. Similarly, regarding the popularisation of science, Gandhi suggested that knowledge cannot be transferred from the expert to the lay person, but has to be a collaborative effort in which science can benefit from the process as well, encouraging science to turn to the community . . . --Paulina Lopez & Ravi Agarwal, Winter 2019/Spring 2020. <i>India International Centre Quarterly</i> 46(3 & 4): 273-284.

In particular, he never cites isostatic rebound as a potential influence, and barely even refers to the fairly obvious effect that the water-into-ice exchange would have had at various stages of the glacial epochs.

Wallace’s letter is another example of the acute sense of the limited supply of fossil fuels that ran accross Britain throughout the 19th century. This growing challenge to free trade could also be understood as a shift of generation and ideology in the Liberal Party. Gladstonian Liberalism, based on financial orthodoxy and state abstention, was contested by a more interfering kind of liberalism: the election of Joseph Chamberlain as mayor of Birmingham in 1873 and the ensuing municipal gospel based on the supplying of cheap staple commodities like water and gas which could be seen as a powerful symbol of these new public expectations. . . . --Charles-François Mathis, 2 Dec. 2018. <i>French Journal of British Studies</i> 23(3).

The latter apparently became a factor in Wallace's life on his reading of Humboldt's <i>Personal Narrative</i> in the early- to mid-1840s, but it is not clear just when he began to adopt the older man's philosophical and methodological ideas. By then Wallace had already read Darwin and probably Lyell, two other naturalists indebted to Humboldt's method, and within a year or two Liebig and Meyen. He probably saw the first volumes of <i>Cosmos</i> before leaving for South America, and the translated <i>Aspects of Nature</i> while in the field. Both of the last two works were also likely available to him in the Malay Archipelago, either during his visits to Singapore, or through the personal library of James Brooke. . . . --Charles H.

Despite the fact that the defensive function appears to be a charming and conceivable explanation for these weevils with completely fused and rigid elytra, approximately 150 years after Wallace’s proposal, we still do not understand the ecological and adaptive significance of the hard body of these weevils, and we have no solid empirical evidence to evaluate this hypothesis. Nevertheless, our earlier observations of only extremely large lizards (thus with higher biting force; ∼3% of the trials) consuming the weevils pointed to the feasibility of Wallace’s hypothesis (Tseng et al., 2014). [Our] study provides the first empirical evidence to support the morphological defence hypothesis pioneered by A. R. Wallace almost 150 years ago. Our findings clearly indicate that the hardness of aposematic Pachyrhynchus functions as a secondary defence against predator lizards, whereas the tarsal claw serves no defence function, and no toxins or repellents are stored in the weevil. . . . --Lu-Yi Wang <i>et al.</i>, 2018. <i>Journal of Experimental Biology</i> 221.

Adaptation to water types has been demonstrated to affect gene flow, making it an important source for diversification of the Amazonian fish fauna. However, this classification focuses on large rivers and fails to acknowledge the importance of small forest streams that flow through non-flooded forest, known as igarapés. As compared to large river channels, igarapés cover a much greater area than the Amazon River and have a distinct hydrochemistry, mostly due to soil and vegetation. We assessed the importance of water type on habitat choice and spawning in Crenuchus spilurus, a small fish that inhabits igarapés inserted within blackwater and whitewater river basins. Lineages from the Rio Negro (blackwater) and Amazon River (whitewater) basins showed active selection of igarapé water in habitat choice trials and had greater spawning success in igarapé water when compared to water from their respective flooded forest basin. Due to the hydrochemical conditions of igarapés acting to shape reproduction and behavior of C. spilurus, our results expand Wallace’s intuition that water types influence diversity by providing evidence that igarapés represent an important habitat driving adaptation in Amazonian fishes. . . . --Gabriel Stefanelli Silva, 2018.

In fact, Darwin himself used the metaphor in exactly such a way when, for instance, he wrote: It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. The codiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, complained to Darwin that by employing such language he had misguided his audience. Darwin, however, was confident that, with time, people would understand his theory correctly. Given what we know today about people's predisposition to reason in intentional terms about natural events, it seems that Wallace had a point. By using an intentional metaphor to explain a natural process, Darwin triggered and strengthened rather than overcame people's intuitive thinking about nature (see Blancke et al., "From Ends to Causes," for a similar analysis of cladograms; Shtulman, this volume). . . . --Stefaan Blancke <em>et al.</em>, 2018.

Already in these reviews--his very first publications--his support for Darwin can be discerned. In subsequent publications, his Darwinian stance was substantiated (cf. James 1987 [1868]; 1950b [1890]: 683ff.). Darwin’s theory was also an intellectual turning point for Charles Sanders Peirce. In his eyes, it initiated "the greatest mental awakening since Newton and Leibniz" (Peirce cited in Brent 1998). In Peirce’s highly complex theoretical framework, evolution is a far-reaching concept that synthesizes cosmological, logical, semiotic, and biological considerations. Therefore, his evolutionary thinking cannot be identified with a Darwinian position alone. On the biological level, however, Peirce, like James, was an early proponent of the primacy of natural selection. Also, Peirce regarded Darwin’s theory as making a significant contribution to the transition from deterministic to probabilistic theories. Finally, Peirce based his evolutionary epistemology, according to which the perception of the world is the result of the long-term selection of psychological mechanisms, on Darwin’s theory (cf. e.g., Peirce 1992 [1878]: 181f.). . . . --Frithjof Nungesser, August 2017. <i>European Journal of Sociology</i> 58(2).

Fifty years after its publication, there is still no consensus as to the primary mechanisms that contribute to the origin and maintenance of the LDG. Yet the remarkable diversity of life found in the humid tropics is as fascinating to biologists today as it was to Pianka in 1966 or to Wallace and Darwin more than 150 years ago. Here we briefly review how each of the six hypotheses summarized by Pianka has fared over the past 50 years. The <i>time</i> hypothesis, which dates back to A. R. Wallace, is perhaps the oldest and most widely accepted of the six hypotheses. Since Pianka, development of detailed databases on the fossil record and knowledge of paleoclimates has provided a clearer of picture of the development of biodiversity through deep time, and this has provided new opportunities for examining the time hypothesis. For example, a time-integrated biogeographic analysis of diversification in forest trees has suggested that tropical environments are older and thus have had more time for diversification (reviewed in Fine 2015), consistent with the time hypothesis. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis are challenging because it is difficult to separate the effects of age and climate (tropical vs. temperate). If tropical environments are older, historically larger, and more diverse, is the increased diversity due to age, area, climate, or all of the above? A recent approach to this problem examined the joint effects of time, area, and latitude on speciation of endemic fish and found that age, area, and latitude have significant and equivalent effects (Hanly et al. 2017). . . . --Douglas W.

	Demography, gerontology, and their cognate fields have been influenced by the widespread notion that biological senescence of entire organisms involves some type of cumulative process of damage or accumulating physiological disharmony that is inherent to life. The influence of this assumption is to be found in the writings of most authors in these fields, starting with Aristotle (fourth Century BCE) in his monograph, 'On the Length and Brevity of Life'. It continues to prevail in most of the popular and academic publications on senescence, from Aubrey de Grey’s seven types of damage to innumerable technical works on the supposed molecular machinery of senescence. Dissenting from this view have been the works of many evolutionary biologists, starting with an obscure note from Alfred Russel Wallace (ca. 1870) and the early neoDarwinian works of August Weismann (1891) . . . --Michael R.

This understanding has been questioned recently by the historian John van Wyhe, who points out that with regard to the second matter, at least, there appears to be no evidence of a 'smoking gun' variety proving it so. In the present essay the circumstances of Wallace's interest in the matter are reviewed, and van Wyhe is taken to task with alternate explanations for the facts he introduces in his argument.

The importance of Wallace’s idea was to identify discontinuities (i.e., rivers) in the (then considered) largely homogeneous Amazonian landscape that could account for species distribution breaks. Recent studies on Amazonian drainage evolution have shown that it is actually quite complex and dynamic, and there is ongoing debate surrounding the dating of major Amazonian geologic events. Based on concordance in species distribution patterns, multiple areas of endemism have been proposed, all delimited by the Amazon River and its major tributaries . . .  J. P.

<p><font size="-1"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 19th century, evolution burst on the scene, greatly influencing and ultimately modifying conceptions of a balance of nature. Fossils that seemed unrelated to any living species, as noted above, conflicted with the balance of nature, because they implied extinction, a manifestly unbalanced event that furthermore could be seen to imply that God had made a mistake. Whereas Ray had been able to argue that living exemplars of fossil species would be found in unexplored parts of the earth, by the 19th century, this explanation could be rejected. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck resolved the conflict in a different way, arguing that species continually change, so the balance remains the same. The fossils thus represent ancestors of living species, not extinct lineages. Robert Chambers, another early evolutionist, similarly saw fossils not as a paradox in a balanced nature but as a consequence of the fact that, as the physical environment changed, species either evolved or went extinct. Alfred Russel Wallace was perhaps the first to question the very existence of a balance of nature, in a remarkable notebook entry, ca. 1855: "Some species exclude all others in particular tracts. Where is the balance? When the locust devastates vast regions and causes the death of animals and man, what is the meaning of saying the balance is preserved… To human apprehension there is no balance but a struggle in which one often exterminates another". In modern parlance, Wallace appears almost to be asking how "balance" could be defined in such a way that a balance of nature could be a testable hypothesis . . . --Daniel Simberloff, October 2014. <em>PLOS Biology</em> 12(10).

'Fame' and 'eminence' are one thing, and 'influence', another. Certainly there were many colleagues of his time who looked upon his varied interests with disdain, but there seems to be little indication that this treatment had any effect on shutting down his literary production, or its overall reception. Using Google's Ngram Viewer, Beccaloni (2013) has traced citations of Wallace's works since his time, and while in the earlier years of Wallace's career, Charles Lyell's (and of course Darwin's) works were much more highly cited, in his later years he had passed Hooker, Huxley and Owen, and was about even with Lyell. Lastly, there is little if any evidence that any of Wallace's scientific writings encountered resistance to getting into print, from any of those who might have disapproved of his spiritualism or socialism. One should therefore seriously question whether such disapproval had much of an effect on his literary career--and the general level of esteem held for him--at all. . . . --Charles H.

It is conceivable that floral mimicry could function to attract pollinators as prey for predators such as the orchid mantis, yet there is no experimental evidence of this. The orchid mantis, <em>H. coronatus</em>, is often described as an aggressive mimic, implying that this predatory insect mimics a flower and attracts insect pollinators as prey (Wallace 1877; Annandale 1900). This hypothesis was first discussed more than a century ago by naturalists such as Alfred Russell Wallace (1877) and Lord Nelson Annandale (1900) and was inspired by observations and accounts of single specimens. This hypothesis has never been experimentally investigated yet it continues to permeate scientific and nonscientific literature and is often assumed to be an established fact. Resemblance of animals to plant parts can function analogously to mimicry in cases of masquerade, where animals are misclassified by predators as inedible objects. The possibility that resemblance to plants can act as an aggressive lure rather than for camouflage has not been previously demonstrated. If the orchid mantis is a flower mimic, then pollinators should misclassify the mantis as a flower rather than as a predatory insect. As opposed to masquerade, where being misclassified as a plant part serves a protective function, floral mimicry should elicit an attractive response from pollinators. We predict that flying insects should be attracted to orchid mantises at similar rates to real flowers . . . --James C. O'Hanlon, Gregory I. Holwell &amp; Marie E.

Others have looked upon him as a man whose positions on critical issues flip-flopped on several occasions, making his overall views suspect.

Still others, with varying agendas, have claimed he was the real originator of the theory of natural selection, and that Darwin stole from him--an accusation made more to the ends of vilifying Darwin than gaining any insight into Wallace’s thought.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's Sarawak Law paper and Ternate essay were part of an ongoing pro-transmutation argument aimed at Lyell. In almost every paragraph of the latter in particular there are references, often direct, to statements made in the <em>Principles of Geology</em>. The themes considered by Wallace include domestication, struggle for existence and species (''ecological,'' to use a modern term) interaction, extinction and succession of species, abundance and rarity of populations, gradual environmental change and its perturbing effects on species, etc. Even Wallace's citation of Malthus in connection with his insight into struggle and natural selection may stem from Wallace's reading of struggle in Lyell's principles, based on the strikingly similar terms in which Lyell discussed the factors (in this case extrinsic) holding down populations: at the edge of the range, against a barrier, when environment is changing, ''stragglers are ready to multiply rapidly on the slightest increase or diminution of heat, rainfall, etc. that may be favorable to them'' . . . --J.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) was an influential figure within Russian pre-Synthetic evolutionary biology, i.e. the time period before the Synthetic Theory of Evolution was established (ca. 1880-1930s). His major works were translated into Russian and his general ideas were read and discussed by both insiders and outsiders of scientific evolutionism. At the same time, Wallace played a controversial role in the growth of Darwinism in Russia, and Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882) has eclipsed Wallace in his influence on Russian evolutionary thinking. In this paper we briefly outline Wallace's impact on Russian pre-Synthetic scientific evolutionism and its general intellectual climate. We demonstrate that both Russian pro-Darwinian evolutionists and anti-Darwinians (scientific anti-Darwinians as well as creationists) were fully aware of Wallace's contributions to the development of evolutionary theory. Yet, Wallace's radical selectionism, as well as his controversial arguments for "design in nature", predetermined his special place within the Russian intellectual landscape . . . --Georgy S.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book <em>Island Life</em>, Wallace (1880) mentioned that, because of human activities, endemic species that inhabit islands may become rare or driven to extinction. He further elaborated on this idea in <em>The Wonderful Century</em>, wherein Wallace described human destructiveness and summarized the negative effects of the ''clearing of forests'' and the ''devastation'' of the landscapes by careless humans (Wallace 1898, p. 373). In his last monograph, <em>Social Environment and Moral Progress</em>, Wallace (1913) described man's ''power over Nature'' with respect to the deterioration of natural resources in the nineteenth century, and the spread of factory systems. Hence, the ''man in the shadow of Darwin'' was one of the first scientists who issued a warning stating that humans may be responsible for the destruction of the environment and the extinction of rare species (Kutschera 2013). In this article, we have shown that Wallace's predictions were largely correct . . . --Ulrich Kutschera & Simon Kleinhans, September 2013. <em>Theory in Biosciences</em> 132(4): 263-264.</font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Von Humboldt's <em>Personal Narrative</em> was also the key work which inspired Alfred Russel Wallace to visit the tropics where he famously and independently of Darwin formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection. Wallace too had ideas similar to Darwin and von Humboldt regarding climate and the latitudinal diversity gradient but he went further to incorporate geological and historical determinants (Wallace, 1878; Berry, 2002). Also like von Humboldt, Wallace was preoccupied with climatic uniformity at multiple temporal scales in the tropics and its impact on species diversity: "Whether we consider the differences between day and night temperatures, the variations of temperature from month to month or from year to year, or those extreme variations which we experience once perhaps in a generation or in a century [. . .] all alike are unknown in the equatorial regions, save in a few limited and quite exceptional areas. In these more favoured portions of our earth there prevails such a general approach to uniformity of conditions (without ever reaching absolute uniformity) as seems best adapted to bring about the greatest productivity, together with extreme diversity in every department of the great world of life.

Critically, moreover, I consider the remarks about Lyell should be discounted as satisfactory evidence that Wallace's letter and manuscript did not leave Ternate on 9 March. Regarding the <i>My Life</i> recollection in particular, it is more likely that the words "who had thought so highly of my former paper" were written for the benefit of the reader of the autobiography, and not as an explanation of why he sent the letter and manuscript when he did. Several pages before these words (on page 355 of volume one of <i>My Life</i>), in discussing the writing of his earlier milestone work 'On the law which has regulated the introduction of new species' (Wallace, 1855), Wallace had just described how Darwin told him (in his third letter to Wallace) how Lyell was one of "two very good men" who had "specially called his attention" to this work. The more one looks at this sequence, the more it appears that the the words on page 363 were just a literary device reminding the reader of 1905 who was who, and how Lyell was related to the story. . . . --Charles H.

Wallace challenged the medical establishment in regards to vaccinations and encouraged all to avoid such a dangerous treatment method that was unnatural or against the laws of nature and which was more important than any rule established by untrustworthy scientists. Wallace was joined by some prominent scientists of the Victorian age to remove the compulsory vaccination act and discredit the vaccine paradigm. He argued with the Journal, <em>Lancet</em>--a medical journal that would come to prominence in the vaccine world in the 20th century. The <em>Lancet</em> diaskeuasts noted that Wallace and his colleagues ignored large amounts of scientific data in arriving at their anti-vaccine conclusions--a stance noted in the 21st century with those arguing against vaccines. Little wonder that more progress in vaccinology was slowed and the next vaccine was developed in France and certainly not in England. Unfortunately such events would repeat themselves in the 20th century with severe consequences for the public health.

Darwin (1871) started &quot;the zebra is conspicuously striped, and stripes cannot afford any protection in the open plains of South Africa&quot;.

How is it that the memes of poetry remained a strong presence in the life of Wallace but disappeared from the life of Darwin even though both men were very much involved in scientific research that led both to the same revolutionary paradigm of natural selection? Perhaps the answer to this question may be found in a famous clash between the two scientific titans. For as Himmelfarb has remarked, 'Wallace not only had the distinction of being the first Darwinist; he was also the first renegade Darwinist'. And the issue on which Wallace became a 'renegade' was hardly trivial. Whereas Darwin believed that the science of evolution could completely account for the human species, Wallace had his doubts. His 'little heresy' as he called it was actually not so little, for he questioned whether the science of natural selection could account for 'the moral and higher intellectual nature of man' . . . --Bryce Christensen, October 2012. <em>Changing English: Studies in Culture and Education</em> 18(4): 400.</font></p>

It has been shown experimentally that background matching effectively reduces predation risk imposed by predators, for example, in fishes and birds. Preference for backgrounds that reduce the risk of detection has thus been suggested to be an important and wide spread strategy among prey animals to decrease their predation risk.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea to classify stages of speciation is about as old as the Theory of Natural Selection. Not long after Darwin's publication of 'The Origin of Species', Wallace (1865) laid out a classification scheme for distinct stages in the formation of species based on observations of swallowtail butterflies. Mallet has recently suggested that this may have been 'the first attempt by a Darwinist to enumerate and classify the . . . "varieties" that Darwin argued were the forerunners of species' (Mallet, 2009: 40). Darwin, Wallace, and their followers thus represented the first wave of interest in understanding the stages of the speciation process. However, it was not until the second wave that data from well-designed field experiments would help clarify the population genetic processes involved in the stages of speciation . . . --David B.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Although many have argued over Darwin's true beliefs on speciation (Mayr, 1947; Mallet, 2008, 2009; Schemske, 2010), Wallace (1865) articulated the first known classification scheme for stages in the formation of species (Mallet, 2009). The biosystematists, beginning with Turesson (1922) and peaking with the books by Clausen and Dobzhansky in 1951, represent the second wave of interest in 'stages'. Similar to Darwin and Wallace, the biosystematists were motivated by the role of natural selection in the formation of distinct groups and species. A handful of biologists, such as Grant (1981), carried on the torch of the biosystematists into the 1980s . . . --David B.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's natural selection emphasizes ecological interactions. Bateson noted his use of the steam engine governor analogy as a means of describing its operation in the famous essay 'On the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type' (Wallace 1858; see excerpt below), and went so far as to interpret Wallace's thinking (see first quotation below) as the first example of cybernetic modelling. One immediate benefit of this kind of thinking is that it becomes easier to differentiate selection for domestication from 'natural' selection: in the former, the ideal of fitness is a predetermined one and is deliberately selected for, whereas in the latter, removal is not predetermined, leaving successful adaptation a function of environmental engagement--of <i>whatever</i> sort. Importantly, such engagement can then be considered in independently conceived ecological and biogeographical terms, thus focusing on assembly rules and eliminating the tautological trap. Darwin, by contrast, once stated: "It is a beautiful part of my theory, that domesticated races of organics are made by precisely same means as species--but latter far more perfectly and infinitely slower" (Darwin 2002). . . . --Charles H. Smith, June 2012. <i>Journal of Biosciences</i> 37(2): 203.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . After planting doubts about sexual selection as the unique explanation, Wallace (1868) associated sexual dichromatism with the nesting habits of birds in relation to the risk of nest predation. He considered that, assuming that (i) incubation attendance by either sex promotes cryptic plumage in open nesters, but (ii) not in cavity or domed nesters, (iii) conspicuous sexual monochromatism should be associated with cavity or domed nesting, and (iv) sexual dichromatism with conspicuous males and cryptic females should be related to open nesting (Table 1). Wallace (1868) offered support for the two last predictions by listing 23 phylogenetically related groups of birds (i.e. families or genera) with conspicuous monochromatism nesting in cavities or domed nests and seven families with bright males and dull females with open nesting habits. Wallace (1868, 1889) also predicted that because of the higher phylogenetic lability of plumage colour, changes in nesting habits would come first and be followed by changes in coloration. Darwin (1871) disagreed with this view and forcefully argued that plumage coloration could select for changes in nesting habits while the opposite was less plausible. In nearly a century and a half elapsed since Wallace first presented his theory on avian sexual dichromatism in relation to nesting habits, few attempts have been made to empirically check its validity despite the attention that sexual dichromatism as variable reflecting the strength of sexual selection in different bird species has received during the last decades (see for instance, Amundsen &amp; P&auml;rn, 2006) and the huge increase in information on avian natural history and phylogeny . . . --J.

We have also corrected for phylogenetic relationships in all analyses as nesting habits, and to a lesser degree sexual dichromatism, may show a marked phylogenetic component as already argued by Wallace (1889). According to the fundamental assumption of Wallace that incubation attendance by either sex promotes cryptic plumage in open nesters, but not in cavity nesters, conspicuousness in either sex should be related to incubation attendance, nest type and their interaction (Prediction 1). Moreover, the predictions by Wallace that conspicuous sexual monochromatism should be associated with cavity or domed nesting, and sexual dichromatism with conspicuous males and cryptic females should be related to open nesting, were tested by relating degree of male and female conspicuousness to nest type and sexual dichromatism. . . . --J.

To a seasoned naturalist like Wallace, this unique juxtaposition of dramatically different faunas, first noted by M&uuml;ller (1846), was obvious, was anomalous, and begged explanation; so it is perhaps no accident that biogeographic study effectively began in the IAA. The range limits of many terrestrial taxa are coincident with the eastern edge of the Sunda Shelf, and the taxonomic compositions of communities on either side are distinctly different. Wallace advocated geological explanations for these biological differences. He suggested, for example, that Bali and Lombok were formerly widely separated and had only recently moved to their present positions &lt;40 km apart; he also noted that faunal discontinuities were associated with deep straits (Wallace 1860). Wallace first described the Line in an 1858 letter to H.W. Bates (Marchant 1916, p. 66) before he mapped the Line (Wallace 1863) that was later given his name by Huxley (1868) and expounded upon these observations in books on the IAA and biogeography in general (e.g., Wallace 1869). The veracity of Wallace's observations was debated because the existence of such a stark faunal divide seemed improbable, and this spurred intense study of distribution patterns in the region (e.g., Weber 1902). . .&ndash;David J.

  sexual dimorphism provided a foundation for sexual selection 
  theory. Two alternative processes, originally proposed by Darwin and Wallace,
  differ primarily in the timing of 
  events creating the dimorphism. In the process advocated by Darwin, a novel
  ornament arises in a single sex, with 
  no temporal separation in the origin and sex-limitation of the novel trait.
  By contrast, Wallace proposed a process 
  where novel ornaments appear simultaneously in both sexes, but are then converted
  into sex-limited expression by 
  natural selection acting against showy coloration in one sex. Here, we investigate
  these alternative modes of sexual 
  dimorphism evolution in a phylogenetic framework and demonstrate that both
  processes contribute to dimorphic 
  wing patterns in the butterfly genera <em>Bicyclus</em> and <em>Funonia</em> . . . Our analyses
  support both hypotheses advocated by 
  Darwin and Wallace for the origin of sexual dimorphism: some sexually dimorphic
  ornaments arise concomitantly 
  with sex-limited expression, while others arise in both sexes but are subsequently
  lost in one sex. Thus both modes 
  of evolution are applicable to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in butterflies

In support of this idea, hawk-like plumage, with cryptic upperparts and pale, barred underparts, is more prevalent in parasitic than in nonparasitic cuckoos (Payne 1967) and most likely evolved after the evolution of brood parasitism (Kr&uuml;ger et al. 2007) . . . &ndash;Justin A.

Although theories of animal colouration were developed principally in regard to terrestrial species (Wallace 1879; Poulton 1890; Cott 1940; Edmunds 1974), from early on they were applied to aquatic species too (e.g., Wallace 1889; Beddard 1895; Longley 1916, 1917). Nonetheless, colouration of aquatic organisms is subject to different selection pressures than those operating on land because scattering of light in water leads to an unchanging angular distribution of light direction; light only penetrates surface waters, the extent to which additionally depends on turbidity; light may be refracted at the surface; and species that use the water column may be viewed by prey, predators or conspecifics from almost any angle (Lythgoe 1987; Marshall 2000; Hanlon et al. 2009; Zylinski et al. 2009).

He argued that incipient and intermediate stages might have little selective survival advantage, as with a partially developed wing; yet evolution progressed to new forms and greater complexity as if teleologically guided. Wallace thus predicted the problem of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; (Behe, 2004). A group composed of Paleo-anthropologists and Linguists similarly argued that the physical and cognitive articulations required for human speech are so sophisticated that it is difficult to imagine intermediary systems (Picq <em>et al.</em>, 2008).

  by evolutionary computation, artificial life, multi-agent systems and social
  cognition, we develop a 
  more realistic distribution of environments. The basic idea is straightforward:
  intelligence is the result of evolution 
  through millions of generations interacting with other live beings. Thus
  we define intelligence in this context, 
  interacting with other agents of similar intelligence. We formalise the so-called
  Darwin-Wallace distribution for 
  agents and environments. Despite the many options and the many sources of
  uncomputability, we claim that, 
  conceptually, the notion of Darwin-Wallace distribution is useful to re-visit
  previous definitions of intelligence. The 
  next step is how this notion can be used for AGI development and evaluation.

  used to describe this type of speciation is allopatry, as opposed to sympatry,
  where ancestral and 
  descendant species coexist in the same environment (or parapatry if they
  exist side by side, with a hybridisation 
  zone in between). If two populations having evolved separately come back
  in contact later on, the intermediate 
  phenotype of their offspring could make them unfit for either environment,
  and this would then provide the selective 
  pressure for the selection of additional reproductive barriers, in a process
  called reinforcement, and often referred to 
  as 'the Wallace effect'. Indeed, the earliest promoter of the
  view that reinforcement could occur under the pressure 
  of natural selection was undoubtedly Alfred Wallace, who disagreed with Darwin's
  views that reproductive 
  isolation could not possibly result from natural selection: &quot;<em>The
    sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny
    has not been acquired through natural selection</em>&quot; (The Origin, Summary
  of Hybridism chapter). This point was a 
  subject of written exchanges and arguments in private correspondence between
  the two around 1858 <em>[[sic]]</em>, 10 
  years after their joint communication to the Linnean Society in July 1858,
  but Wallace formally published his views 
  only in 1889, some twenty year later, in chapter VII of his book called <em>Darwinism</em>.
  On the subject of allopatry 
  versus sympatry, I do take a very divergent view to that adopted by a majority
  of evolutionary biologists to this day. 
  Rather, I choose to follow Wallace's path against Darwin's in
  thinking that natural selection plays a major role in 
  the reproductive isolation that defines species, and I shall actually venture
  some steps further than Wallace, and will

It stands in contrast to the dogma that, despite the dramatic cultural and biological diversity of contemporary humans, adaptive genetic changes and especially adaptive population differences have been limited or non-existent over the past 10 000 years. This belief probably stems from a reluctance to apply evolutionary theory to humans and human behaviour. This reluctance dates back at least to Alfred Russel Wallace (co-discoverer along with Darwin of evolution via natural selection) disbelieving that natural selection could have led to the formation of the human mind. Contrary to this, evidence shows that adaptive evolution has accelerated in humans and that genes related to psychiatric conditions are highly differentiated across human populations.

Barriers at each stage can arise as byproducts of within lineage evolution as a result of natural or sexual selection or genetic drift, but natural selection against maladaptive hybridization itself can also drive evolution of reproductive isolation barriers (Wallace, 1889; Fisher, 1930; Dobzhansky, 1937). This process is usually termed reinforcement, and as the name implies, it requires the pre-existence of some degree of reproductive isolation, which is then 'reinforced' by the evolution of additional barriers. Studies of reinforcement have focused overwhelmingly on premating barriers. . . . Nevertheless, selection on postmating barriers is at least theoretically possible (Wallace, 1889; Coyne, 1974).

One reason for the results, they suggested, was that predators may not be sufficiently confused to generate selection for mimicry when just 2 different forms are involved. In an explanation for the evolution of conspicuous signals, Wallace (1889, p. 255) suggested that &quot;not only do fewer individuals of each species need to be sacrificed in order that their enemies learn the lesson of their inedibility (in cases of mimicry), but they are more easily recognized at a distance and thus escape even pursuit. There is thus a kind of mimicry between closely allied species as well as between species of distinct genera, all tending to the same beneficial end.&quot; One explanation for Beatty et al's findings is that mimicry reduces confusion in visually complex environments. It has also been argued, in a theoretical treatment, that the mere coexistence of visually distinctive aposematic species can be mutually beneficial (Turner and Speed 1999). If predators that ingest members of one chemically defended species become risk averse with respect to further toxin ingestion, while their physiology copes with the toxins, it has been suggested that predators may heighten avoidance of species that could contain toxins, even in the absence of signal mimicry . . . &ndash;Hannah M.

  the first edition of <em>The
    origin of species</em>)
  relied on selection as the main cause of 
  evolutionary change, but saw that hybrid sterility could not be directly
  selected; instead, he argued that it arises as a 
  side-effect of divergence. In contrast, Wallace's (1889) enthusiasm
  for selection led him to argue that not only could 
  it strengthen prezygotic isolation, by what we now call reinforcement, but
  that group selection could even cause 
  hybrid sterility. Then, as now, ecological divergence that allows distinct
  species to live together in sympatry received less attention than reproductive
  isolation . . . --N. H. Barton,

  appreciation to the status of a significant

  explanations that invoked incidental physiological mechanisms in males and
  the need to suppress their effects in females, to avoid predation . . . Wallace
  was of course wrong in his denial of the plausibility of sexual selection, 
  although not completely wrong to doubt that aesthetic appreciation of combative
  prowess were the primary factors. 
  It took a century to recognize that the theory needed to be based instead
  on asymmetries of parental investment in

  to pursue abstract intellectual 
  feats such as science, mathematics, philosophy, and law, given that opportunities
  to exercise these talents did not 
  exist in the foraging lifestyle in which humans evolved and would not have
  parlayed themselves into advantages in 
  survival and reproduction even if they did? I suggest that the puzzle can
  be resolved with two hypotheses. The first 
  is that humans evolved to fill the &quot;cognitive niche,&quot; a mode
  of survival characterized by manipulating the 
  environment through casual reasoning and social cooperation. The second is
  that the psychological faculties that 
  evolved to prosper in the cognitive niche can be coopted to abstract domains

  abstraction and productive combination, both vividly manifested in human

  of their lives, Darwin and Wallace became estranged. Darwin argued that
  natural selection 
  was sufficient to explain the origin of the existing biological world. Wallace
  believed that natural selection alone 
  was insufficient to explain the existence of complex structures such as the
  human brain. From the bioenergetic 
  perspective, Wallace's reservations were justified, as complexity can
  be generated only through the information-
  generating power of energy flow and the cumulative information storage capacity
  of nucleic acids. It took more than 
  3.5 billion years for these systems to amass sufficient information to generate
  the human brain. Thus the missing

  between energetics and information . . . --Douglas C. Wallace, 11 May 2010. <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In participating in the initial debate on the theory of evolution, Alfred Russell Wallace (1864) suggested an explanation was necessary for (1) the comparative stability in human physiology from the late Pleistocene epoch (starting approximately 130,000 years ago), during which lower animals had continued to evolve drastically; (2) the emergence of racial varieties among humans without reliance on a discredited theory of successive emergence'; and (3) the extent to which the human brain drastically altered the prevailing rules of evolution. Wallace argued the reason brain evolution outpaced gross anatomical change, was because once a sufficiently complex brain evolved, brain development offered the most efficient way to gain evolutionary advantage. This was not the case for animals with smaller brains, which continued to diversify in variety in geologically recent times. Human racial characteristics, such as variation in skin color, were the exception, but resulted largely from differences in external stimuli, particularly climate, since few species have ever enjoyed anything approaching the geographic range Homo sapiens attained even before historical times. The animal brain confronts us with a physical object that behaves at least partly according to deterministic physical rules, but also seems to display a degree of behavioral indeterminacy, or flexibility--the kind of adaptational advantage that might contribute to heightened entrepreneurial awareness. Although Wallace's hypothesis is over 100 years old, it not only remains widely accepted, but forms the foundation for modern views of brain evolution . . . --Robert F. Mulligan, March 2010.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing in 1878 in a famous book of essays known as <em>Tropical Nature</em>, Wallace used the recent discovery that the Earth had been through great ice ages as the basis for his explanation for latitudinal richness gradients. He suggested that even though the numbers of species in any place (in the high or low latitudes) might tend to build up over time as life forms proliferated, an ice age every once in a while would obliterate much of the life in the higher latitudes. The severe cooling, combined with the great ice sheets that scraped down from the north, would have wiped out most species that lived in high-latitude environments. The tropics, by contrast, must have remained a reservoir of diversity--a benign, constant environment that accumulated species faster than it could lose them. Farther from the outer edges of the tropics, the effects of the ice ages would become increasingly strongly felt, giving a general gradient in species richness the farther away from the tropics one went. And each time the higher latitudes began to recover and form new species, they would be knocked back by another calamitous ice age . . . --Johnathan Adams, February 2010.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace proposed to redefine
  Darwinism in a way that excluded Darwin's
  principle of sexual selection. The 
  main result of the Darwin-Wallace controversy was that most Darwinian biologists
  avoided the subject of sexual 
  selection until at least the 1950's, Ronald Fisher being a major exception.
  This controversy still deserves attention 
  from modern evolutionary biologists, because the modern approach inherits
  from both Darwin and Wallace. The

  theories of senescence (Wallace, <em>ca.</em> 1865; Weismann,
  1889) were group-selectionist in 
  nature, proposing that individuals senesce and eventually die in order to make
  space and resources available for 
  future generations composed of younger, more vigorous individuals. However, such
  arguments are circular because, 
  if ageing is one of the reasons why individuals must be replaced, they presuppose
  that individuals must deteriorate 
  over time. Moreover, they fail to explain how a population of altruistically
  senescing individuals would not be 
  subject to invasion by more slowly senescing or even non-senescing invaders.
  Recent studies have placed group-
  selectionist arguments on a stronger theoretical foundation by emphasizing instances
  where senescence appears to 
  be &quot;selected for its own sake&quot; as a result of kin- or group-level
  benefits including payoffs to close relatives, and 
  reduced local extinction risk due to communicable diseases or chaotic population

  such as whether maternal emotions influence the fetus, have made a remarkable
  tour. 
  Alfred Russel Wallace was co-originator of the theory of evolution by natural
  selection written in 1859 by Darwin. 
  When Wallace (1893c) wrote the above quoted sentence in a letter entitled 'Prenatal
  influences on character' into 
  Nature, the belief that a mother's emotions could affect the child she
  carries was seen as resting on old wives' tales. 
  Wallace (1893a,b) was also publishing articles about the possibility of being
  able to study whether 'individually 
  acquired characters are inherited'. Lamarck had incorporated this idea
  in his theory of directed evolution; it was 
  seriously challenged in 1880 by Weismann's theory, on which the modern
  understanding of genetic inheritance 
  became based, and since the turn of the 20th century it became widely rejected
  by the scientific community. 
  However, this old question that had originated in ancient time, with Greek philosophers,
  recently got renewed 
  interest with the discovery of epi-genetic variation between individuals and
  the finding that in some cases epigenetic 
  variants can be inherited by the offspring, a biological inheritance that cannot
  be explained by changes in the DNA-

  there would in each generation be 
  on the average an increase in the length of the nectaries, and also an average
  increase in the length of the proboscis 
  of the moths, and this would be a necessary result from the fact that nature
  ever fluctuates about a mean, or that in 
  every generation there would be flowers with longer and shorter nectaries,
  and moths with longer and shorter 
  probosces than the average&quot; (p. 476). Second, </font><font size="-1">Wallace

  the 1850s by the naturalist A. R. Wallace, when he collected vocabularies
  in these easternmost islands of the Indo-
  Malaysian archipelago. In a well-known book on his travels in this region
  Wallace proposed a distinction between 'Malay' and 'Papuan' languages
  in the Moluccas. Following Wallace's lead, Ray applied the name 'Papuan' to
  the 
  non-Austronesian languages of Melanesia, as a convenient catch-all. Soon
  after, Wilhelm Schmidt observed that 
  non-Austronesian languages were present on the north coast of the New Guinea

  systems is a continuous stream of new

  dramatic enough to lead Alfred Russell Wallace to designate a human phenotypic

  with more distantly related Papuan languages occurring in the Far Eastern
  provinces, especially in areas where

  technologist's definition of
  technology as dealing with mechanical artifacts alone, 
  Wallace's insight has major relevance. The subject matter of technology,
  according to the Preface to <em>History of 
    Technology</em>, is &quot;how things are done or made&quot;; and most students
  of technology, to my knowledge, agree with this. 
  But the Wallace insight leads to a different definition: the subject matter
  of technology would be &quot;how man does or 
  makes.&quot; As to the meaning and end of technology, the same source, again
  presenting the general view, defines them 
  as &quot;mastery of his (man's) natural environment.&quot; Oh no,
  the Wallace insight would say (and in rather shocked 
  tones): the purpose is to overcome man's own natural, i.e. animal,
  limitations. Technology enables man, a land-
  bound biped, without gills, fins, or wings, to be at home in the water or
  in the air. It enables an animal with very 
  poor body insulation, that is, a subtropical animal, to live in all climate
  zones. It enables one of the weakest and 
  slowest of the primates to add to his own strength that of elephant or ox,
  and to his own speed that of the horse. It 
  enables him to push his life span from his &quot;natural&quot; twenty years
  or so to threescore years and ten; it even enables 
  him to forget that natural death is death from predators, disease, starvation,
  or accident, and to call death from 
  natural causes that which has never been observed in wild animals: death
  from organic decay in old age . . . --Peter

  is, the approach from human biology, thus leads to the 
  conclusion that technology is not about things: tools, processes, and products.
  It is about work: the specifically 
  human activity by means of which man pushes back the limitations of the iron
  biological law which condemns all 
  other animals to devote all their time and energy to keeping themselves alive
  for the next day, if not for the next 
  hour. The same conclusion would be reached, by the way, from any approach,
  for instance, from that of the 
  anthropologist's &quot;culture,&quot; that does not mistake technology
  for a phenomenon of the physical universe. We might 
  define technology as human action on physical objects or as a set of physical
  objects characterized by serving 
  human purposes. Either way the realm and subject matter of the study of technology
  would be human work . . . --Peter Ferdinand Drucker, 2010. <em>Technology,

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility is that Wallace
  was deliberately romanticizing his actual observations and experiences
  there. 
  Nancy Stepan has noted that the popular success of <em>The Malay Archipelago</em> came from its fulfilment of 
  contemporaneous readers' expectations of what an account of the tropics
  should be, in contrast to his 1853 account 
  of his travels in South America, Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro, which
  was not only &quot;unromantic,&quot; but &quot;unheroic,&quot; and did
  not sell well . . . However, I would like to put forth another possibility:
  what if Wallace's 
  portrayal of the archipelago as paradise, and more specifically, his portrayal
  of interracial relations and &quot;uncivilized&quot; society as positively
  pre-lapsarian, resulted not from the impulse to romanticize, but rather, a
  stubborn 
  fidelity to scientific accuracy? . . . --Tiffany Tsao, 2010. <em>Australasian
    Journal of Victorian Studies</em> 15: 28-41.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . I will show how Wallace arrived at his
  surprisingly favourable and anti-scientific&quot; assessments of the 
  inhabitant races and communities of the Malay Archipelago by applying the
  principles of taxonomic classification 
  to the human realm. Given that Wallace's primary employment in the
  Malay Archipelago was to collect specimens 
  of flora and fauna and classify them according to the principles of the Linnaean
  taxonomic classification system, his 
  adoption of what I will term a &quot;taxonomic perspective&quot; in viewing
  the humans whom he encountered should hardly 
  be surprising. Using these same principles of taxonomic classification, Wallace
  was able to achieve a perspective on 
  the Malay Archipelago hitherto unachieved by authoritative accounts of the
  region, challenging the predominant 
  scientific views of race held at the time and unsettling even his own views
  of the &quot;uncivilized&quot; races . . . --Tiffany 
  Tsao, 2010. <em>Australasian Journal of Victorian Studies</em> 15: 28-41.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . for Wallace, feeling &quot;that
  savages were in some respects superior, would not have necessarily made
  it true. I 
  would argue instead that his positive portrayals of human life in the archipelago
  had just as much scientific basis as 
  his opening portrayals of the archipelago's natural environment as
  an otherworldly Eden. If Wallace's construction 
  of a paradisiacal natural environment relied on his utilization of scientific
  precedent and natural selection theory, it 
  was his application of taxonomic classification that enabled him to see the
  human individuals and communities of 
  the archipelago as uniquely paradisiacal as well. Wallace's taxonomic
  perspective enabled him to break away not 
  only from dominant perceptions of the races as different stages on a single,
  linear scale of sociocultural evolution, 
  but also from the social Darwinist tendency of his day to view interracial
  relations as an inexorable struggle in which the white races would prevail

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . The female limitation
  of mimicry is usually explained by a combination of sex-dependent predation 
  pressure and sexual selection: (1) female butterflies carry heavy egg-loads
  and are therefore aerodynamically 
  constrained in their escape flights. Thus, females are thought to be more
  vulnerable to predation and presumably 
  gain a greater fitness advantage from Batesian mimicry compared to males
  (Wallace 1865 . . . ), and (2) wing colour 
  patterns are assumed to be constrained by sexual selection to a much greater
  extent in males than in females. Thus, 
  male mimicry is selectively disfavoured when its natural selective advantage
  is overwhelmed by the sexual selective 
  advantage of nonmimetic coloration that may be more successful during inter-
  or intrasexual encounters. However, 
  these hypotheses do not explain the presence of and natural variation in
  female-limited mimetic polymorphism . . . --Krushnamegh Kunte, November 2009. <em>Animal Behaviour</em> 78(5): 1029.</font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . The behavior of females in search of a mate impacts the success of males in mate competition and, hence, the force of sexual selection on male phenotypic characters. The search behavior of females is also subject to selection because the search strategy used by a female determines the likelihood that she encounters a high quality male in the search process. This latter idea is germinal in the views of Alfred R. Wallace who argued that females would, had they evolved the cognitive ability, choose mates who provide them with a fitness benefit (Wallace, 1871, 1889; reviewed by Cronin, 1991). The search strategy favored by selection, in this situation, is the strategy that provides the highest fitness return to searchers. Janetos (1980) stimulated the study of search strategies when, more than one hundred years later, he showed that a fixed sample search strategy provides a higher fitness return to females than several alternative strategies. . . . --Daniel D.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The models proposed by Wallace and Weismann describe aging as a programmed process that evolved through direct selection on senescence as a beneficial trait (Weismann 1889). These models suffer from a reliance on group theory and do not provide an explanation for why an individual with a mutation that confers increased life span--and thus an increased opportunity to produce offspring--would not be selected over individuals without such a mutation. This view of aging was challenged in 1952, when Peter Medawar proposed the "mutation accumulation" theory, revolutionizing the way most biologists think about the evolution of aging (Medawar 1952). The underlying reasoning is based on the observation that, even in the absence of aging or other intrinsic decline, most species experience a substantial rate of mortality from external forces such as accident, disease, or predation. For a given species, fewer individuals live to progressively older ages, diminishing the force of natural selection in an age-dependent manner and resulting in stronger selection against genes that are deleterious early in life relative to genes that are deleterious late in life (Fisher 1930; Haldane 1941). The mutation accumulation theory states that genes with late-acting deleterious effects will accumulate in the germline, resulting in an increase in mortality with age (Medawar 1946, 1952) . . . --George L.

  can fold their wings together, hiding the dorsal surface, a dorsal-ventral 
  partitioning of visual signals may present one solution to accommodating potentially
  antagonistic selective 
  pressures. The speculation that dorsal wing patterns are important for mate signalling,
  while the ventral surface may 
  be more subject to selection by natural enemies is, in fact, not new (Darwin
  1871; Wallace 1889), although no study 
  has directly tested this hypothesis in a comparative framework. In addition to
  a dorsal/ventral partition, butterflies 
  may separate signals between forewing and hindwing, given their ability to hide
  the forewing behind the hindwing 
  when at rest. These two surface axes, dorsal-ventral and forewing/hindwing, offer
  butterflies two spatial dimensions 
  that may be partitioned to serve different, potentially antagonistic, signal

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin (1862) and Wallace
  (1867) provided a possible explanation for such extreme elongation, suggesting
  that the long nectar spur of the Malagasy star orchid (<em>Angraecum sesquipedale</em>)
  evolved in a coevolutionary race with a giant hawkmoth. According to this
  model, selection on the hawkmoth favours longer tongues to better reach
  the orchid's nectar, while selection on the orchid favours nectar spurs
  that are longer than hawkmoth tongues because this ensures contact with
  the orchid's reproductive parts (thus maximizing pollen transfer) . . .
  Darwin was not proposing a general mechanism for the evolution of corolla
  tube length, but was specifically interested in the extreme case of <em>A.
    sesquipedale</em> (Darwin 1862). Furthermore, in expounding on Darwin's
  idea, Wallace (1867) actually envisioned that initial stages in tube elongation
  would involve pollinator shifts, and suggested that a coevolutionary race
  would begin only when the tube length corresponded to the tongue length
  of the largest hawkmoth in the habitat . . . --Nathan Muchhala &amp; James

  . . The classical view of reinforcement is that selection can only strengthen
  prezygotic isolation, not postzygotic because selection cannot favor a <em>further</em> reduction
  in the fitness of hybrids (Wallace 1889; Dobzhansky 1940). (Selection can
  favor a reduced fitness of juveniles where these compete with siblings,
  but the principle is the same). This argument applies where a single allele
  strengthens isolation, but not when isolation is strengthened by an <em>association</em> between
  existing incompatibilities. As we show below, the two different incompatibilities
  then do not have to be at different stages of the life cycle: each may
  have the same status, and we cannot say that one evolves &quot;to&quot; reinforce
  the other. The evolution of the association itself can be seen as adaptive,
  in the sense that (directly or indirectly) it raises the mean fitness of
  the population. However, it can involve incompatibilities at any stage
  of hybridization . . . --Nicholas H. Barton &amp; Maria Angeles Rodriguez

    studies--their relative youth and geographical isolation--were clearly identified

    natural selection, in his 1881 book <em>Island Life</em>. First, many islands
    are either volcanic in origin or have been completely under water at some
    point in their history. These islands emerge above the ocean surface as blank
    slates for colonization and subsequent evolutionary diversification, on which
    the development of ecological and evolutionary systems can be observed from
    their beginnings. Each island represents a new opportunity for living forms
    to appear and proliferate. The first colonists, finding untapped resources
    and lacking the constraints of a resident biota, often diversify in novel
    directions. This evolutionary idiosyncrasy is enhanced by unbalanced colonization--strong
    dispersal abilities are not evenly distributed across the ecological spectrum

  would not recognize. But the idea that a biological species might possess latent 
  powers makes no sense in Darwinian terms. It suggests the forbidden doctrine

  in conflict with the Darwinian principle that just as useful genes are selected 
  for cultivation and advancement, useless genes are subject to negative selection 
  pressure and must therefore drain away into the sands of time. Wallace identified

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This understanding brings natural selection closer to cybernetics and information theory than to a purely materialmechanicist framework. All the contextual parameters that enact the selection--no less than all the historical and unique conditions of a given moment--can be compared to the totality of possible paths and constraints that create higher probabilities towards certain paths over many others, as advocated in information theory. In this sense, the way in which regulation is being conceptualised in molecular and developmental biology has some close analogies to the concept of 'natural selection.' After all, natural selection is about regulation, as is explicit in Alfred Russel Wallace's language, particularly in his famous paper from 1858 "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type" where he compares the action of balancing adaptation to the centrifugal governor of the steam-engine, a clear instance of negative feedback in a cybernetic system. Gregory Bateson (1972, 1979) highlighted in several passages of his work Wallace’s anticipation of cybernetic thinking (see for example Bateson 1972: 428-429). Thus, there is an analogy and continuity, between developmental and physiological regulation and so-called natural selection. . . . --Luis Emilio Bruni, 2008. <i>The American Journal of Semiotics</i> 24(1-3): 57-203, 205.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that phenomena strive for reality--that 
  is, to become distinct--then there must by default be a process whereby constitutive 
  elements are demarcated as 'included' and, of course, an opposite process, 
  whereby elements become the 'excluded'. According to [Charles] Fort: &quot;It 
  is our expression that nothing can attempt to be, except by attempting to exclude 
  something else: that that which is commonly called 'being' is a state 
  that is wrought more or less definitely proportionately to the appearance of 
  positive difference between that which is included and that which is excluded.&quot; 
  This process leaves a trace, however, in the sense that one cannot subsequently 
  provide a full and comprehensive description of the thing in question. Even 
  Darwin, Fort argued, 'was never able to tell what he meant by a &quot;species&quot;.' 
  Echoing Wallace's (1875) earlier concerns over the close-mindedness of modern 
  science, Fort argued that this body of knowledge was itself but one instance 
  of localization, wherein an attempt is made to separate out those explanations 
  which are deemed acceptable and proper from those that are not. The raw material 
  of the world becomes organized and interpreted to fit into preconceived notions

  causes a plethora of facts and events to emerge from this chaotic landscape,

  feels its way through surrounding ignorance,' he suggested, like 'a wagon 
  train feels its way across a prairie.' And yet, 'Science relates to real 
  knowledge no more than does the growth of a plant, or the organization of a 
  department store, or the development of a nation: that all are assimilative, 
  or organizing, or systematizing processes that represent different attempts

  most studies implicitly assume that these &quot;aposematic&quot; warning signals 
  simply indicate the presence of some repellent defense such as a toxin, it has 
  been speculated that the intensity of the signal might reliably indicate the 
  strength of defense so that, for example, the nastiest prey might &quot;shout

Alfred Russel Wallace (1853) gave the scientific literature its initial hint of this fact in his discussion of the distinctly different river types in the Amazon basin: 'white-water', 'black-water' and 'bluewater' (changed in later usage to 'clear-water'). Harald Sioli, in a paper published a century after Wallace’s book, went on to point out that the large white-water rivers (so-called because of their visibly large concentrations of suspended sediment) of Amazonia had their origins in the Andes or the Andean foothills. Ronald Gibbs reiterated and substantiated this fact a decade later in his doctoral dissertation research, for which he travelled thousands of kilometres on local river boats, sampling the suspended-sediment concentrations of the Amazon and its tributaries. . . . --Robert H.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I present a critical review of the 
  literature which, when combined with the results of some comparative analyses, 
  suggests that just a few selective agents can explain much of the variation 
  in egg appearance. Ancestrally, bird eggs were probably white and immaculate. 
  Ancient diversification in nest location, and hence in the clutch's vulnerability 
  to attack by predators, can explain basic differences between bird families 
  in egg appearance. The ancestral white egg has been retained by species whose 
  nests are safe from attack by predators, while those that have moved to a more 
  vulnerable nest site are now more likely to lay brown eggs, covered in speckles, 
  just as Wallace hypothesized more than a century ago. Even blue eggs might be 
  cryptic in a subset of nests built in vegetation. It is possible that some species 
  have subsequently turned these ancient adaptations to new functions, for example 
  to signal female quality, to protect eggs from damaging solar radiation, or 
  to add structural strength to shells when calcium is in short supply. The threat 
  of predation, together with the use of varying nest sites, appears to have increased 
  the diversity of egg colouring seen among species within families, and among 
  clutches within species. Brood parasites and their hosts have probably secondarily 
  influenced the diversity of egg appearance. Each drives the evolution of the 
  other's egg colour and patterning, as hosts attempt to avoid exploitation by 
  rejecting odd-looking eggs from their nests, and parasites attempt to outwit 
  their hosts by laying eggs that will escape detection . . . --R. M. Kilner, 
  August 2006. <i>Biological Reviews</i> 81(3): 383.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's hypothesis for 
  egg colouring is intuitively appealing because it can explain why so many bird 
  eggs are white or speckled or some shade of brown in colour, and because it 
  is consistent with observations that more cryptic offspring are less vulnerable 
  to attack by predators. Furthermore, Lack (1958) found that a species' nest 
  site could explain some of the variation in egg patterning and colouring amongst 
  the Turdinae. He found that hole-nesters were more likely to lay white immaculate 
  eggs, whereas about 80% of birds whose nests were placed in exposed sites covered 
  their eggs in red or brown speckling, which he interpreted as an adaptation 
  for concealment. However, experimental evidence in support of Wallace's hypothesis 
  is rather mixed . . . --R. M. Kilner, August 2006, <i>Biological Reviews</i> 81(3): 385.</font></p>

  support, this adaptive view of ageing and death was soon dismissed, to such 
  an extent that in the 1920s it was labelled a &quot;perverse extension of the 
  theory of natural selection&quot; (Pearl 1922). This has remained the case since

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than a century, a debate has raged 
  as to whether death constitutes an intentional ontogenetic program, the so-called 
  Wallace-Weismann hypothesis, or the passive result of an inexorable accumulation 
  of defects. By accounting for benefits to kin, the former assertion becomes 
  more plausible. The inability to identify definable discreet mechanistic pathways 
  for programmed death has provided a major source for criticism of this theory. 
  Although evolutionary dynamics and pluralism may both contribute to the Darwinian 
  value of phenoptosis, intuitive appeal persists in the notion of an oligarchy 
  of functional hubs underpinning the many proximate mechanisms of phenoptosis. 
  Indeed, given its processes' central roles in apoptosis, the mitochondrion may 
  represent an ideal candidate to serve as one such hub on the level of the organelle. 
  The induction of cellular damage by reactive oxygen species has been noted to 
  be a mechanism of self-termination that encompasses all scales of biology. However, 
  we believe that identification of hubs that operate on the level of systems 
  as opposed to that of subcellular components may afford greater potential utility 
  for modification and correction. Endocrine pathways, particularly those involving 
  reproduction and circadian rhythms, have already been implicated in this regard

  (3) can use conspicuousness as a cue for distinctiveness such that animals with

  took a different tack. The humane Wallace was a reformer but also a stout defender 
  of Darwinian inheritance. So, although he believed that English society was 
  increasingly dysgenic, Wallace rejected compulsory eugenics as elitist and barbarous. 
  Wallace proposed that eugenic ends could be realized by an expansion of women's 
  education and their political and economic freedom. Like Mill, he believed that 
  the law could reduce women's economic dependency, which, he argued, would work 
  to reduce the incentive for women to make dysgenic marriages. &quot;Progress is still 
  possible, nay, is certain,&quot; said Wallace, &quot;by . . . that mode of selection which 
  will inevitably come into action through the ever-increasing freedom, joined

  through the agency of female choice in marriage&quot; (1890). In leaving &quot;the improvement

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions under which aposematism, 
    the conspicuous coloration of unpalatable or otherwise defended prey, could 
    evolve have long been a topic of speculation (Wallace 1867; Poulton 1890). A 
    perceived roadblock to the initial establishment of rare, aposematic mutants 
    is the intense predation to which they would be subjected by naive predators. 
    Conspicuous prey, albeit defended, are much more likely to be seen by predators, 
    and if predators are unaware of their defence (and do not show neophobia), then 
    such prey are more likely to be attacked on encounter. This means that rare 
    conspicuous mutants of defended prey should, on average, be attacked more frequently 
    than their cryptic conspecifics. A possible solution to this problem, first 
    suggested by Fisher (1930), is that gregariousness could facilitate the evolution 
    of distastefulness (and hence aposematism). Thus, if prey are warningly coloured 
    and aggregated, then an attack on one individual by a naive predator could lead 
    to subsequent avoidance of others in the group, often relatives, that share 
    the same trait (this proposal was the initial inspiration for Hamilton's (1963) 
    theory of kin selection) . . . --Christopher D. Beatty, Roderick S. Bain &amp;

    is allopatric, species can disperse over geographic barriers (that have geological 
    or climatic causes) and become isolated, or geological or climatic changes can 
    cause populations of species to become isolated from one another by creating 
    barriers within formerly continuous ranges; the latter is termed vicariance. 
    In either case, the isolated populations diverge and eventually speciate . .

    Wallace originally invented the concept now known as aposematism to describe 
    prey that combine warning displays with secondary defences (Wallace 1867, 1889). 
    More than a century later, the evolution of aposematism remains a remarkably 
    fertile and controversial area of research. Warning displays are still of interest 
    to researchers, in part, because the proximate mechanisms by which they operate 
    tell us much about predator behaviour and predator-prey coevolution. As originally 
    envisaged by Wallace (1867) and Poulton (1890), warning displays function to 
    enhance discrimination, to accelerate learning and perhaps slow down forgetting

  . . aposematic displays remain the focus of considerable attention because, 
  for many researchers, their initial origins contain at least two important evolutionary 
  paradoxes. First, it is generally assumed that before the first aposematic traits 
  evolved, prey were both highly cryptic and had effective secondary defences. 
  If secondary defences are costly (and they often are), then their presence in 
  prey already highly protected by crypsis is paradoxical: why pay for repellent 
  secondary defences if your enemy rarely finds you? Second, there is a better-known 
  paradox of warning signals, which also emerges from commonly held assumptions 
  about initial conditions. Ever since the seminal theoretical model of Harvey <em>et al.</em> (1982), it is widely taken that aposematic mutants must emerge 
  from defended cryptic species. When this is the case, new aposematic forms suffer 
  combined and highly effective barriers to survival because of their rarity and 
  their conspicuousness . . . --Michael P. Speed &amp; Graeme D. Ruxton, 21 February

  originally envisaged, warning displays might be conspicuous so as to be &quot;very 
  distinct from the protective tints of the defenceless animals allied to them&quot; 
  (Wallace 1889, p. 232). Hence a good reason that aposematism may evolve initially 
  is to prevent confusion with undefended prey. On its own, behavioural conspicuousness 
  itself may not be a sufficiently reliable signal of non-profitability to function 
  as an aposematic display. As we found . . . prey can evolve some heightened 
  levels of behavioural conspicuousness even when they do not evolve adaptive 
  secondary defences. Hence, some additional discriminative cue may be necessary 
  for defended prey to minimize erroneous attacks by educated predators . . .

  evolutionary parallelism . . . Second, mimicry spanning distantly related organisms,

    we believe Wallace when he writes about evolution yet ignore him when he turns 
    to spiritualism? Part of the reason is the context in which we receive his writings 
    today. Spiritualism is now out of fashion, hoaxes have been exposed, and there 
    is no longer a social context for the idea of spiritualism. The experiments, 
    while repeatable in Wallace's day, are no longer repeatable, and thus they fail 
    one of the hallmarks of the scientific method. But they were repeatable then! 
    When one reads Wallace's works, one is struck by how he acted with complete 
    warrant in exploring spiritualism scientifically. As Kuhn has demonstrated,

    as maps and illustrations. These images had a strong impact on the emergence of dioramic displays by providing
    two-dimensional forerunners for what were later implemented as three-dimensional museum installations. As we
    show in this paper, the new mode of illustration introduced by Wallace in 1876 formed a crucial influence. In <em>The
      Geographical Distribution of Animals</em> Wallace elected to illustrate different biogeographical zones by the
    simultaneous display of animals from different taxa against an ecologically appropriate background. By and large,
    each animal was itself in some way unique to its zone and could potentially have been used as a surrogate for the

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The co-inventor of evolutionary theory, 
  Alfred Russel Wallace, was aware of the significance of Darwin's views. In his 
  book, <i>Darwinism</i>, (originally published in 1890) Wallace took pains to 
  distance himself from Darwin on the question of human capacities. He pointed 
  to the mistake that someone might make by conjecturing that all geological changes 
  are due to factors such as flooding, volcanic activity, the action of the wind 
  and the sun, and so on while overlooking the special contribution made by glaciation. 
  Glaciation is an important cause of change, but is radically different from 
  the other causes of geological change. By analogy, Wallace argues, &quot;Because 
  man's physical structure has been developed from an animal form by natural selection, 
  it does not necessarily follow that his mental nature . . . has been developed 
  by the same causes only (Wallace 1897: xx).&quot; Our mental capacities and 
  our morality, Wallace suggests, may be due to something quite different from 
  natural selection . . . --Andrew Brennan, 2003. <i>Worldviews</i> 7(3): 276-277.</font></p>

  Tylor's doubts about psychic phenomena were suppressed and Spiritualism roundly 
  denounced as a survival of animistic beliefs (Tylor 1873). Yet, even the formulations 
  used in <em>Primitive Culture </em>betray an ambivalence within its scheme of 
  mental evolution that seems fundamental to contemporary scientific politics. 
  Tylor felt forced to class modern Spiritualism with &quot;primitive&quot; animism--the 
  kind of arbitrary classification that Wallace was up against in his critique 
  of <em>Primitive Culture </em>and in his earliest writings on botany. But Tylor 
  also had to acknowledge that Spiritualism was not just a survival but an extraordinary 
  revival of animism. He even went as far as to recognize the anomalous status 
  of Spiritualism within his progressionist scheme, because the former &quot;is a truly 
  remarkable case of <em>degeneration</em>&quot; (1873), the possibility of which <em>Primitive 
    Culture</em> was originally intended to argue out of existence . . . --Peter

  In <em>Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</em>, the argument about perception 
  was developed after Wallace denounced the theoretical fallacy of assuming that 
  because Spiritualist phenomena ran counter to our knowledge of the laws of nature, 
  they cannot exist. He argued that the physical phenomena that occur during a 
  seance, can only be explained by presuming invisible intelligences, which was 
  only &quot;another and more striking illustration than any we have yet received of 
  how small a portion of the great cosmos our senses give us cognisance&quot; (1874). 
  He compared the force exerted by these intelligences with light, heat, electricity, 
  and magnetism (ala &quot;modes of motion&quot; of a space-filling &quot;ether&quot;) to show how 
  these &quot;diffuse and subtle&quot; forms of matter can act upon &quot;ponderable bodies&quot; 
  and become known to us only by their effects. The fact that we do not know this 
  higher sense is no argument, Wallace wrote, because likewise the &quot;faculty of 
  vision&quot; would be &quot;inconceivable&quot; to a race of blind men. &quot;It is possible and 
  even probably that there may be modes of sensation as superior to all ours as 
  is sight to that of touch and hearing&quot; (1874). The subject of divination, in 
  particular, allowed Wallace to elaborate on this? The clairvoyance that is at 
  the basis of divination led him to suppose a &quot;new sense&quot; that amounts to &quot;a 
  kind of rudimentary perception, which can only get at the truth by degrees.&quot;

    will reach the theory of natural selection in the end. On closer inspection, however, the Wallace case offers at least a
    few openings to those sceptical about the independence of the theory from its history. One move would be to deny
    that Wallace did, in fact, 'co-discover' the theory of natural selection. Rather, he came up with a theory quite

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three 
    features of Wallace's account of the evolution of human mind and morals stand 
    out. First, he conceived the selective environment to be other proto-human groups--which 
    would have an accelerating effect on the evolutionary process, since social 
    environments would rapidly change through responsive competition. Second, he 
    proposed that selection worked on the group, rather than the individual--which 
    allowed him to explain the rise of altruistic behaviour, that is, behaviour 
    perhaps harmful to the individual but beneficial to the group. In his original 
    essay on the transmutation of species (1858), Wallace conceived of the struggle 
    for existence as occurring among varieties instead of individuals. He continued 
    to think in such group terms when considering the evolution of moral behaviour. 
    Finally, in a note to the published version of his talk to the Anthropological 
    Society, he mentioned that he was inspired to develop his thesis by reading 
    Herbert Spencer's <em>Social Statics</em>. Spencer's own early brand of socialism 
    had pulled Wallace to his side. In <em>Social Statics</em>, (1851), Spencer 
    had envisioned a gradual and continual adjustment of human beings to the requirements 
    of civil society, with individuals accommodating themselves to the needs of 
    their fellows, so that eventually a classless society would emerge in which 
    the greatest happiness for the greatest number would be realised. Spencer assumed 
    that the inheritance of useful habits would be the means by which such evolutionary 
    progress would occur, while Wallace believed natural selection to be the agent 
    of that progress . . . --Robert J. Richards, 2003. In Jonathan Hodge &amp; Gregory

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 
    basis of personal experiments and reliable reports from other scientists, Wallace 
    concluded that the universe is populated with a hierarchy of spirit beings, 
    some of whom are in contact with the human population on earth, usually through 
    mediums. According to Wallace, the spirit beings lower in the hierarchy, acting 
    through mediums, were responsible for a variety of paranormal phenomena, including 
    clairvoyance, miraculous healings, communications from the dead, apparitions, 
    materializations of physical objects, levitations, etc. More powerful spirit 
    beings may have played a role in the process of evolution, guiding it in certain 
    directions . . . --Michael A. Cremo, 2003. In his <em>Human Devolution: A Vedic

  is a miracle that a dead man should come to life; because that has never been observed in any age of any country&quot;
  Wallace noted two flaws in this argument. First, the appeal to uniform human experience, granting the truly uniform
  nature of the experience, insures that no really new fact could ever be established. Second, Wallace questioned the
  veracity of Hume's version of uniform human experience. &quot;Reputed miracles abound in all periods of history,&quot;
  wrote Wallace (1896, p. 8). And they continued up to the present, thus nullifying Hume's assumption. . . --Michael

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . The space-filling ether of nineteenth century physics is no longer with us. But there are modern scientific
  concepts that would allow Wallace's basic system to operate. According to deterministic chaos theorists,
  immeasurably small random perturbances of matter can rapidly propagate into large-scale effects that are not easily
  predictable. Scientists sometimes give the example of a Caribbean butterfly that by its wings sets off motions of air
  molecules. These movements might eventually amplify to steer a hurricane from open sea into the American coast.
  If the butterfly had flapped its wings slightly differently, the hurricane might not have hit land. According to this
  idea, Wallace's spirit beings might make infinitesimal adjustments on the subatomic level that would quickly
  propagate into observable spiritualist effects. One might also propose that they are somehow capable of
  manipulating the curvature of Einstein's space-time continuum. They could thus produce gravitational effects, for
  gravity is said to be the result of curvature in the continuum. Or one might propose that the spirit beings induce
  slight changes in the quantum mechanical vacuum, which in some ways resembles an ether. Of course, this
  approach is limiting, and rather than straining to find ways to explain spiritualist phenomena in conformity with
  currently accepted physical laws, it may make more sense to come up with a new theoretical system that more
  naturally incorporates both the normal and paranormal phenomena . . . --Michael A. Cremo, 2003. In his <em>Human
    Devolution: A Vedic Alternative to Darwin's Theory</em>. (Bhaktivedanta Book Publishing Inc.): 128.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Wallace favored the latter course, but his system has certain puzzling features. Although a dualist, he does
  not appear to accept the existence of individual conscious entities before their earthly embodiment. According to
  Wallace, there is an original spiritual mind from which matter is generated. Individual spiritual minds, associated
  with spiritual bodies (souls), are only developed from and in material bodies, as they come into existence (Wallace
  1885; in Smith 1991, p. 100). After death, the individual minds, as above stated, go to &quot;the first grade of spirit life,&quot;
  where they experience progress or the lack of it based on their earthly habits. But if individual spirit souls can exist
  after earthly embodiment, why not before? And why is there any need at all for earthly embodiment, which is not an
  altogether pleasant experience? Why not skip that and go directly to the highest grade of spiritual life? . . . --Michael
  A. Cremo, 2003. In his <em>Human Devolution: A Vedic Alternative to Darwin's Theory</em>. (Bhaktivedanta Book
  Publishing Inc.): 129.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Here is another problem with Wallace's system. In his works, Wallace details reports of varied spiritualistic
  phenomena, such as levitation, apparitions, and clairvoyance, from his own time and throughout history. But he
  ignores reports of transmigration of souls, which occur widely in almost all times and places. The reports of
  transmigration are just as credible as any other category of evidence he considers. The existence of this phenomena
  requires, however, certain modifications in Wallace's system. At death, souls would pass not necessarily into the
  first phase of spiritual existence but perhaps into new material bodies. According to religious systems that
  incorporate transmigration, such as the Vedic system, some souls, because of their strong attachment to their last
  embodiment, do not attain new material bodies, but remain for some time as ghosts. This actually fits in quite well
  with the observations of Wallace and other spiritualists, who found that the spirits they contacted often desired to
  communicate with living friends and relatives . . . --Michael A. Cremo, 2003. In his <em>Human Devolution: A Vedic

    of unthinkingly placing English society at the top of the evolutionary tree, 
    he argued that the evolutionary process had gone awry. In Wallace's hands evolutionary 
    theory ceased to act as a rationalization of what was and became a promise of 
    what could be. The key here was to hold up so-called savage societies as occasionally 
    more civilized and more advanced than the West. Thus towards the end of his 
    popular travel book <em>The Malay Archipelago </em>(1869), Wallace favourably 
    contrasted primitive morality with the 'social barbarism' of Victorian England. 
    If a savage society could attain a higher level of morality, then something 
    must have disturbed England's evolutionary progression. The villain was <em>laissez-faire </em>individualism. Human evolution--the development of man's moral and intellectual

    You heard an example in the long passage I have just read out. And some have 
    suggested that Wallace, unlike Darwin who clearly saw selection as choosing 
    among <em>individuals</em>, was proposing what modern theorists rightly denigrate 
    as 'group selection'. This would be true if, by 'varieties', Wallace meant geographically 
    separated groups or races of individuals. At first I wondered about this myself. 
    But I believe a careful reading of Wallace's paper rules it out. I think that 
    by 'variety' Wallace meant what we would nowadays call 'genetic type', even 
    what a modern writer might mean by a gene. I think that, to Wallace in this 
    paper, variety meant not local race of eagles, for example, but 'that set of 
    individual eagles whose talons were hereditarily sharper than usual.' . . .

  sense. He believed that sexually selected ornaments were badges of good health, selected for their capacity to
  advertise the health of a male--bad health as well as good. One way to express Hamilton's Wallacean idea is to say
  that selection favours females who become skilled veterinary diagnosticians. At the same time, selection favours
  males who make it easy for them by, in effect, growing the equivalent of conspicuous thermometers and blood-pressure metres. The long tail of a Bird of Paradise, for Hamilton, is an adaptation to make it easy for females to
  diagnose the male's health, good or bad. An example of a good general diagnostic is a susceptibility to diarrhoea. A
  long dirty tail is a give-away of ill-health. A long clean tail is the opposite. The longer the tail, the more
  unmistakeable the badge of health, whether good health or poor . . . --Richard Dawkins, October 2002. <em>The Linnean </em>18(4): 22-23.</font></p>

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The check 
    that 'human nature' placed upon hopes of social improvement is illustrated by 
    Malthusianism. This was popularly conceived of as an argument about the limits 
    human nature--in particular the impulse to procreation--placed upon progress. 
    Thus the transformation sought by Owen in social relations was predicated upon 
    the malleability and educability of the individual. Human nature can be improved 
    beyond the limits set by present-day social relations, and education and environmental 
    reform both play a role in this. Did these ideas influence Wallace's views on 
    nature? In one important respect they did. Wallace's views on instinct and its 
    role in animal and human behaviour are different from those of Darwin and contradict 
    much of what passed for Darwinian psychology after the publication of the <em>Origin</em>. 
    When Wallace talks about instinct in nature, whilst not denying its existence, 
    he tends to discount the role of preformed, inherited behaviour and to talk 
    up the notion of learning. Moreover, he returns throughout his life to the same 
    proposition: the role of instinctive behaviour is small, that of learning relatively 
    greater . . . --Greta Jones, March 2002.<em> British Journal for the History

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Wallace saw many instances 
  of mismatch between existing faculties and the environment. The natural world, 
  like the social, was a site of dissonance between wants and the environment. 
  The wants were relatively fixed points--the need for food and so on--but the 
  behavioural responses to these were malleable. He noted a species of bird which 
  in Africa and India 'eat only insects' whilst those in South America 'in great 
  measure live upon fruits which they capture on the wing as they do insects. 
  There is no difference in their structure but being in different countries surrounded 
  by different circumstances they are led to adopt different habits'. In downgrading 
  instinct Wallace introduced the idea there was always space for change, a potential 
  for specialization or variability in behaviour even among individuals from the 
  same species. Nature was not filled up with all that was possible for its full 
  exploitation. The potential spaces in it were not necessarily occupied nor all 
  the forms of behaviour found in natural organisms perfectly matched to their 
  environment. Wallace constantly repeated this. In the case of the anatomy of 
  birds wants and habits were limited by their structure, not structure by wants 
  and habits, but even with the same structure behaviour differed. There is always 
  room for modification and change. This contributes to the unsettled and evolving 
  natural world . . . --Greta Jones, March 2002.<em> British Journal for the History

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . .The 
  difference in approach between Darwin's and Wallace's views on population is 
  discernible in their respective contributions to the Linnean Society in 1858. 
  Darwin introduces Malthus almost immediately and proceeds to litter his text 
  with phrases and analogies from the <em>Essay on Population</em>. For Darwin, 
  nature at war is 'the doctrine of Malthus applied in most cases with tenfold 
  force'. Along with the struggle for mates introduced in his closing paragraphs, 
  death is a major selective factor and death is the consequence of this 'enormous 
  multiplying power'. In contrast Wallace begins with the question of varieties

  &quot;with the theory of evolution, as with statistical thermodynamics, the notion of contingency became established in
    the very heart of nature. Since Newton (1934), physics had been based on a rigid determinism, which extended to all
    sciences. Evolutionary theory and statistical thermodynamics completely transformed the way of looking at nature,

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 
    Darwin's publication of <i>Origin of Species</i> until Wallace's publication 
    of his autobiography in 1905, Wallace was perhaps the most influential critic 
    of the idea that the bright coloration of animals could be the outcome of female 
    mate choice. Wallace saw no reason to invoke what to him was an unsubstantiated 
    assumption that females of non-human animals were capable of and inclined to 
    discriminate among males based on the quality of their ornaments (Wallace 1878, 
    1889). Instead, Wallace searched for explanations of colorful plumage that would 
    allow such traits to be understood as utilitarian, not ornamental and extravagant. 
    In his studies of bird coloration, Wallace did not focus exclusively or even 
    primarily on gaudy plumages. Rather Wallace focused much of his research on 
    the subtle differences among species and individuals in explicitly non-ornamental 
    traits like the buff, brown, gray, and green plumage of birds (Wallace 1878, 
    1889) . . . --Geoffrey E. Hill, 2002. In his <i>A Red Bird in a Brown Bag: The 
      Function and Evolution of Colorful Plumage in the House Finch</i> (Oxford University 
    Press): 7.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Far more convincingly than Darwin, 
  Wallace showed how most plumage coloration supported the theory of evolution 
  by natural selection. Most species, most of the time, are colored in ways that 
  appear to enhance their survival and fecundity. Wallace provided an explanation 
  for sexual dichromatism and drab female plumage that stands today as a triumph 
  of the power of the comparative method in addressing evolutionary questions. 
  Through his knowledge of the nesting biology of birds, Wallace showed that species 
  with exposed nests in which the female alone incubates almost invariably have 
  drab female plumage whether the male is colorful or not. Retesting and confirmation 
  of this idea have only lately occurred. Wallace also was the first to set forth 
  the idea that colorful plumage functions as a signal of species recognition. 
  This became the most widespread explanation for colorful plumage for over seventy 
  years, and it remains a too-often-ignored hypothesis in modern treatments of 
  plumage coloration. Wallace also foreshadowed the now popular and well-supported 
  idea that ornamental plumage could serve as a reliable signal of condition in 
  his discussions of vital energy (Wallace 1878, 1889) . . . --Geoffrey E. Hill,

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace 
    never seems to have suffered from the abstract doctrine of Philosophical Necessity. 
    Charting his intellectual progress toward science, he notes that Robert Owen 
    provided his introduction to &quot;advanced views.&quot; Owen's &quot;fundamental principle, 
    on which all his teaching and all his practice were founded, was that the character 
    of every individual is formed <em>for</em> and not by himself, first by heredity 
    . . . and second by environment.&quot; Here, as with Martineau, Mill, Galton, and 
    Darwin, philosophy intersects moral vocation, for this view requires restructuring 
    the moral and legal system, which is based on the view that &quot;all men <em>could</em> be good if they liked.&quot; In a determinist system, people cannot be &quot;<em>deterred</em> from future aggression&quot; unless the conditions in which they develop are changed. 
    Hence Owen's &quot;successful&quot; New Lanark. For Wallace, implicitly, the vocation 
    of science and, one might hazard, the nature of his theory, grow from this insight 
    into hereditary and environmental determinism . . . --George Levine, 2002. In

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . While Wallace defers to chance in amusing ways and exhibits a Darwinian modesty in relation to his career,
  he sees a pattern of happy accident that implies something other than mere material causation. For himself, he can
  argue that: &quot;many of the conditions and circumstances that constitute our environment, though at the time they may
  seem unfortunate or even unjust, yet are often more truly beneficial than those which we should consider more
  favourable. Sometimes they only aid in the formation of character; sometimes they also lead to action which gives
  scope for the use of what might have been dormant or unused faculties (as, I think has occurred in my own case).&quot;
  But often, he says, those circumstances are not favorable, and if they consistently lead to bad consequences, &quot;the
  system of society&quot; is at fault. Wallace's willingness to accept inconsistency, to refuse the totalizations of a system
  making, marks his autobiography and his scientific life, and surely was consistent with--either as cause or effect--his
  own strong leanings toward socialism . . . --George Levine, 2002. In his <em>Dying to Know: Scientific Epistemology

    precisely this latter characteristic, and the way in which Wallace's radical 
    positions intertwined--his faith that some kind of willpower or spirit, lying 
    outside or beyond natural selection, was responsible for moral evolution in 
    the human species; his rejection of the more crude, social Darwinian deductions 
    from biological theory; and his attack on the wastage of nature caused by rampant 
    industrialism--that make him a valuable exponent of both the potentialities 
    and the limitations of evolutionism as a philosophy. I am particularly interested 
    here, of course, in Wallace as a tropicalist, especially the concern he articulated 
    for the despoliation of tropical nature, a theme that emerged in his mature 
    consideration of his tropical experiences and which, though connected to the 
    new evolutionary outlook, was not a necessary outcome of it (Darwin, for example, 
    did not share Wallace's concerns about the consequences of tropical destruction). 
    This is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of Wallace's multifaceted contributions 
    (most histories of environmentalism make no mention of him). In this chapter, 
    then, I approach Wallace as arguably the most interesting student of tropical 
    nature in the second half of the nineteenth century, a writer of popular natural-history 
    books who was also a philosopher of nature, someone whose evolving representations 
    of tropical nature take us into the post-Humboldtian, evolutionary era, and

  overweening domination for purposes of commerce and gain. In his mature writings, he expressed the ideas that
  nature had not, in fact, been created just for human appreciation or consumption; that plants, animals and human
  beings formed a network of mutual interdependence; and that it was Europeans' actions that had the most
  profoundly negative effects on nature and culture, effects which could not be repaired easily . . . --Nancy Leys

    there was undeniably an 'individualist' accent to Wallace's program of interventionist 
    egalitarianism. Wallace was not a collectivist. His socialism was never an attraction 
    to a great and organising state. &quot;Socialism&quot; was to Wallace 'the use by everyone 
    of his faculties for the common good, and the voluntary organisation of labour 
    for the equal benefit of all' (Wallace, 1905). The use of the word 'voluntary' 
    in his definition of socialism is surely significant. Under Wallace's socialism 
    industry would be run by enterprises composed of capital-owning workers. Land 
    nationalisation would not amount to a system of state farms or agricultural 
    collectives. Rather, the state would be the sole owner of land, and would rent

  scientific achievement, we have argued, makes for a jarring disconfirmation 
  of this theory. Rather than seeking to inscribe norms justifying the dominance 
  of one class, one race, one genera, Wallace sought to overturn such conventional 
  dominance: of the wealthy, of the white race and (we may add here) of men. And, 
  rather than being 'organically connected' to science's ruling elite, few could 
  be less connected than Wallace to the elite and its social formations . . .

  illustrative lines. Different taxonomic groups (with different histories and different dispersal abilities) will

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Amazonian tropical rainforest harbors a species diversity that is vastly disproportionate to its geographic
    area. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to account for this, tending to emphasize aspects of the
    maintenance or origins of the megadiversity. The oldest such hypothesis has its roots in the works of Alfred Russel
    Wallace, who observed that the ranges of some closely related neotropical vertebrate species (primates, birds) abut
    at major rivers. Indeed, Wallace defined distinct areas within South America, bounded by major Amazonian rivers
    like the Negro, Madeira, and Amazon, which differed in species composition of communities. These and similar
    observations have prompted the suggestion that lowland Amazonian rivers, of which there are many, may function
    as effective barriers to the dispersal of organisms. This may have a variety of consequences for patterns of species
    diversity on the Amazonian landscape. First, major Amazonian rivers may have played a significant role in species
    generation by impeding gene flow between populations with the eventual evolution of sister species on opposite
    banks. Second the expansion of species from their centers of origin may be halted by the presence of large
    watercourses; therefore, they may be restricted to only one bank. Finally, compared with a species distributed across
    landscapes without barriers, the probability of subsequent recolonization of a species that has gone locally extinct
    on one bank will be lower because immigration from the opposite bank is less likely . . . All of these factors might
    be expected to accentuate differences in species composition of opposite-bank communities . . . --Claude Gascon <em>et

    It is easy to see that if two populations are kept separate--by mountains or

    longer interbreed successfully. Their differences may have evolved by natural 
    selection, but their reproductive isolation is merely a side effect of changes

    Wallace and Theodosius Dobzhansky argued that natural selection would reinforce 
    reproductive barriers between diverging populations. There has been little evidence,

    in <em>The Origin of Species</em>, Darwin wrote little on biogeography, yet 
    his views on the efficacy of dispersal dominated biogeographical theory until 
    relatively recently. I think the answer lies in Wallace being too far ahead 
    of his time. I have often wondered what Wallace would have thought about modern 
    geological evidence concerning the origin of Indonesia, and I am convinced it 
    would have given him the key to understanding the distributional patterns he 
    described in <em>Malay Archipelago</em>. The problem, of course, was that this 
    evidence was not available until a century later. Given the lack of credible 
    alternative explanations and the pressure from Darwin to conform to accepted

    and geographically pervasive barriers to gene flow have facilitated speciation 
    in allopatry across much of Amazonia, but obviously differ with respect to the 
    identity, location and duration of these barriers. The oldest of these, the 
    riverine barrier hypothesis, derives from observations of animal distributions 
    made by Wallace (1849, 1876). It posits a role for major Amazonian water courses 
    in impeding gene flow between populations on opposite banks. The predictions 
    for this hypothesis include that (i) many recently evolved sister taxa occupy 
    opposite banks of large rivers, (ii) levels of genetic differentiation between 
    populations on opposite river banks increases with increasing river width and 
    flow rate and (iii) taxa of the upland terra firme forest show higher levels 
    of differentiation across rivers than taxa of the seasonally flooded varzea 
    forests found adjacent to the river. This last prediction assumes that the strength

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's 
    first essay on the origin of the colour sense was published simultaneously with, 
    but independently of, Gladstone's paper. He had presented a possible evolutionary 
    route for animal colour vision, starting with perception of degrees of brightness, 
    ending with perception of colours according to wave length. In his view, green 
    and blue would have been the first colours to which the eye became specially 
    adapted, in accord with their universal presence in foliage and sky, as well 
    as their soothing influence. Reds, yellows and violets would follow, as present 
    in small amounts, offering great contrast, and useful to animals hunting for 
    food and mates. This essay was revised and republished a year later, with specific 
    response to Gladstone (and through him, to Magnus and Geiger). 'These 
    curious facts' wrote Wallace, with regard to Gladstone's Homeric data, 'can 
    not, however, be held to prove so recent an origin for colour-sensations as 
    they would at first sight appear to do'. He pictured brightly coloured structures 
    as having evolved in response to an already present and well-developed ability 
    of animals, especially birds, to see colour, long before the arrival of man. 
    Wallace concluded that 'Man's <i>perception</i> of colour in the time 
    of Homer was little if any inferior to what it is now . . . owing to a variety 
    of causes, no precise <i>nomenclature</i> of colours had become established

  increased, Wallace became convinced that a vast civilizational crisis was at

  of capitalism. A few months before his death in 1913, he wrote (<em>The Revolt

    major contribution to the literature of reform is his corrosive criticism of 
    nineteenth-century society, through which he offered a human vision of social 
    reformation. He advocated recognizing racial equality, nationalizing land, giving 
    women equal opportunity for education and employment, decreasing military expenditure, 
    and saving the environment. His friend James Marchant wrote in <em>Alfred Russel 
      Wallace: Letters and Reminiscences </em>(1916) that &quot;his greatest ambition was 
    to improve the cruel conditions under which thousands of his fellow-creatures 
    suffered and died, and to make their lives sweeter and happier.&quot; . . . --Charles

  responsible for the behavior of men and women, that instead the prime agent of social discord was bad government.
  He argued that the state ought to provide equality of opportunity and that no one should get a head start through
  inheritance: &quot;To secure equality of opportunity there must be no inequality of initial wealth. To allow one child to
  be born a millionaire and another a pauper is a crime against humanity.&quot; Andrew Carnegie would later share this
  view on the inheritance of wealth. Wallace further argued that the state ought to own and manage railways and pay
  the doctors. He envisioned a Ministry of Public Health, its doctors acting as servants of the state, that is, of people--and he added, perhaps mischievously, &quot;they should be paid according as they keep people well and not ill.&quot; . . . --Charles Blinderman, 1998.

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1881 
    Wallace took the lead. He formed The Land Nationalization Society on his own 
    lines, with himself as President. In <em>Land Nationalization</em> (1882) he 
    laid out his program. The state was to assume title to all land. To meet a conservative 
    debating ploy, he would compensate present landowners. However, he ingeniously 
    minimized the amount in a manner that tells us he knew the nuts and bolts of 
    his subject. Compensation was to be an annuity limited to the duration of lives 
    in being. It was to be based only on the net income actually being derived from 
    the land before nationalization--i.e. not from the highest and best use, and 
    not from future higher uses. All men and women (Wallace, like Mill, was also 
    a feminist) could bid to lease parcels from the state for actual use. In the 
    socio-biological terms in which he thought, this would consummate the natural 
    relation of man to nature. It would also let men alternate between industry 
    and agriculture as Wallace, a loving gardener, himself did. Wallace's Land Nationalization 
    was individualist, not collectivist. Individual lessees were to have secure 
    tenure, and tenant-rights to improvements. Rents to the state would be used, 
    not to engross the state, but to obviate taxes. These rents would be based on 
    the assessed &quot;inherent value&quot; of land, dependent only on natural and social 
    conditions. As a surveyor and a biogeographer, Wallace readily distinguished 
    &quot;inherent value&quot; from man's improvements to land, which he saw as transitory. 
    Tax assessors in most American states and other former English colonies distinguish 
    land and improvements routinely today, and many did then, too, although in England 
    itself the concept was somewhat novel . . . --Mason Gaffney, October 1997. <em>American

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace, on the other hand, explained evolution not in terms of competitive struggles between species and the
    environment, but in terms of the governor that regulates the speed of a steam engine by maintaining constancy in the
    angular velocity of a flywheel. As Bateson puts it, building on Wallace's idea, the job of evolution is to maintain the
    constancy of something--specifically, the survival of the entire system comprised of all species and the environment.
    Darwin, according to Bateson, focused on the wrong subject--the individual species--when in fact the real subject of
    evolution is the species plus environment. In fact, the species and the environment <em>co-evolve</em>, to use a term that is
    popular among management writers today. Moreover, if you add the remarkable findings reached in the past thirty
    years by biologist Lynn Margulis, this process of co-evolution sustains the total system through <em>cooperative</em> symbiotic relationships, <em>not</em> competitive knock-outs . . . --H. Thomas Johnson, 11 October 1997. Keynote

    evolution. Paleontologists tend to stress Africa as the cradle of humanity, to view Cro-Magnon Europe as the site
    where late ice age human culture flowered, and to neglect Australia as a remote outpost occupied by supposedly
    primitive Aborigines. Human behavior took a Great Leap Forward sometime between 100,000 years ago, where
    there were still no signs of art or complex tools anywhere in the world, and the period around 40,000 to 30,000
    years ago, when great art and complex tools began to abound in Europe. Paleontologists usually assume that this
    development began among humans in Africa or the Mideast, then spread to Europe and finally (in diluted form) to
    our poorer cousins in aboriginal Australia. But anatomically modern humans appeared in Australia <em>before</em> they did
    in Europe--probably by 60,000 years ago and possibly even earlier. To reach Australia, the protohumans who had
    reached Asia from Africa around one million years ago (as attested by the famous Java Man fossils) had to cross a
    dozen straits separating Australia from Asia. . . .Each next strait would have been a stimulus to improve our nascent
    watercraft technology; each new island, a stimulus to adapt to a new environment and to invent new technologies;

    of 'higher' and 'lower' races, and was clearly committed to a notion of long-run progressive change in organic
    evolution and in human history. Yet there is no easy or simple mapping of the higher and lower, civilized and
    savage onto the progressive evolutionary narrative. Social, moral and intellectual progress are differentiated from
    one another, and lack of harmony between them can be catastrophic in its consequences. The hierarchical ordering
    'higher' and 'lower' is sometimes used by Wallace to refer to inherited differences between peoples, but is also
    sometimes used to denote levels of civilization, and to do so in ways which do not carry any obvious value
    connotation. The word 'civilization' carries a negative as often as a positive valuation in Wallace's writing. Whilst
    the civilized nations remain in a state of social and moral 'barbarism', uncivilized savages approach a 'perfect social

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 
    not just Darwin's opponents who regard the analogy as evidence against the causal 
    efficacy of selection. A. R. Wallace, the co-discoverer of natural selection, 
    addresses the analogy in his opening comments of the Darwin-Wallace paper of 
    1858. &quot;One of the strongest arguments which have been adduced to prove the original 
    and permanent distinctness of species is, that varieties produced in a state 
    of domesticity are more or less unstable, and often have a tendency, if left 
    to themselves, to return to the normal form of the parent species; and this 
    instability is considered to be a distinctive peculiarity of all varieties.&quot; 
    For Wallace, modification by artificial selection is limited and temporary, 
    and therefore causally inefficacious in the production of new species. If natural 
    and artificial selection were truly similar, then the analogy suggests that 
    natural selection is incapable of forming new species. Consequently, Wallace 
    argues against the analogy by emphasizing the differences between domestic breeding 
    and nature. &quot;It will be observed that this argument rests entirely on the assumption, 
    that varieties occurring in a state of nature are in all respects analogous 
    to or even identical with those of domestic animals . . . <strong>But it is 
      the object of the present paper to show that this assumption is altogether false</strong>&quot; 
    (emphasis added). Wallace's vow to argue against the analogy is inexplicable 
    unless he has embraced the view that artificial selection is inefficacious in 
    the formation of new species. Surely Darwin was aware of Wallace's views, expressed 
    so forcefully in the Darwin-Wallace paper, as he wrote the <em>Origin</em> .

  Darwin recognized some important distinction between domestic and natural varieties, 
  and happily agrees with Wallace on the distinction. Wallace, in the preface 
  to his <em>Darwinism</em>, likewise emphasizes his agreement with Darwin, describing 
  his views as complementary. &quot;I have endeavoured, by means of a series of diagrams, 
  to exhibit to the eye the actual variations as they are found to exist in a 
  sufficient number of species . . . <strong>It will be found that, throughout 
    the work, I have frequently to appeal to these diagrams and the facts they illustrate, 
    just as Darwin was accustomed to appeal to the facts of variation among dogs 
    and pigeons</strong>&quot; (emphasis added). Wallace certainly seems to regard himself 
  as doing something very similar to what Darwin is doing. That would be surprising 
  if he had thought Darwin to be making an analogical argument--given his earlier 
  rejection of the argument. Wallace argues against the analogical argument by 
  emphasizing the negative analogy between domestic breeding and nature. Unlike 
  natural selection, artificial selection does not maintain fitness. Consequently, 
  domestic varieties are unfit. Wallace makes this point in the 1858 Darwin-Wallace 
  paper . . . --Richard A. Richards, March 1997. <em>Studies in History and Philosophy

    than a surveyor, less a biologist than a biogeographer, less an evolutionist 
    than an ethnographer. For seven formative years his job had been prescriptive 
    economic geography. Parish upon parish, field upon field, he had set limits 
    to human livelihoods, marking boundaries, drawing lines. In later years he would 
    become an exemplary naturalist, but always boundaries and borders, habits and 
    habitats, concerned him. Once he even likened the &quot;System of Nature&quot; to a &quot;dissected 
    map,&quot; the pieces of which could be assembled in a &quot;mosaic.&quot; The picture is of

    and 
    species of the one are often represented by closely allied families, genera

    earlier suggestion that a connection may exist between the perennial woody habit 
    of island species and reproductive strategy deserves closer inspection. He argued 
    that the perennial insular woody growth form primarily reflects selection for 
    longevity (rather than for woodiness <em>per se</em>) of insect-pollinated species 
    in an environment where insects initially should be expected to be rare, noting 
    that the resulting increase in size may have provided additional advantage in 
    niche competition among initial colonizers. Bramwell's studies of breeding behavior 
    are generally compatible with that view, since in <em>Echium </em>species studied, 
    the woody island forms were found to be outbreeding, setting only 0-11% fertile 
    seed in selfings, whereas their continental sisters as well as the herbaceous 
    island inhabitant <em>E. bonnetii</em> were preferentially inbreeding . . .

  favor rare, large, conspicuous inflorescences among outbreeders and, as a consequence, select perennial (and
  therefore woody) habits capable of producing them, in agreement with Wallace's salient arguments. Under this
  view, diversity of contemporary woody <em>Echium </em>forms reflects a multiplicity of selectable developmental pathways
  toward longevity, rather than selection for specifically environment-adapted variants of such woody perennial habits
  as schematically depicted in Fig. 3. In other words, insular woodiness in <em>Echium </em>might simply betray &quot;survival of
  the founders,&quot; and many differences between perennial woody habits could be nonadaptive . . . --Uta-Regina B&ouml;hle,

    was merely a correlate of 'vigour', by which he implied health. A female should choose a mate adaptively by
    picking the most vigorous male, and it would just so happen that he would also be the most colourful. We too found
    colour to correlate with a variable, plasma proteins, that may be indicative of vigour. In addition, female kestrels in
    our colony in mate choice experiments have consistently preferred males with high display rates (vigour?),

  males of many birds are more brightly coloured than their mates, the degree of dimorphism varied greatly, with the
  most common case being for males 'to have the same general hue as the females, but deeper and more intensified'.
  Although it may be difficult to discount the role of sexual selection for extreme cases, such as house finches, the
  common, subtle patterns of colour variation between the sexes may be more difficult to explain except as non-functional consequences of other biochemical processes. If such processes are fundamental to avian physiology, it
  may explain why sexual dichromatism is so common in birds, and why reds, yellows and oranges are so pervasive . .

    edition of Wallace's book. Especially interesting because Wallace was so closely involved with the evolution
    arguments of his day, it is independent of the three connected scientific arguments and may be seen as another
    aspect leading to the same conclusion. Wallace argued that since humanity is the result of a long chain of
    modifications in organic life, since these modifications occur only under certain circumstances, and since the

    the impoverishment of the temperate faunas. In modern terms, Wallace proposed an 'equilibrium' hypothesis for
    vegetation, and an 'historical' hypothesis for faunal patterns. In the latter half of this century, these two schools of

    concept of species as distinct reproductive units was carried over into the 
    post-Darwin period. It was stated by Wallace (1889), Eimer (1889), and others. 
    I will present Wallace's characterization of species in a paraphrased form. 
    A species is an assemblage of individuals which: (1) are modified in structure, 
    form, and constitution so as to be adapted to their particular conditions of 
    life; (2) are differentiated from other allied assemblages; (3) reproduce their 
    like: and (4) usually breed together (Wallace, 1889). Some students of species 
    in the early post-Darwin period began to characterize species, not only as reproductive 
    units, but as units of interbreeding. We see this in Wallace's fourth point 
    above: species are individuals &quot;which usually breed together&quot; (Wallace, 1889). 
    According to Poulton (1903) a species is &quot;an interbreeding community&quot;. Karl 
    Jordan (1905) stated that the individuals of a species occur together in an 
    area and form an interbreeding community (&quot;eine Paarungsgemeinschaft&quot;). Wallace's 
    first point listed above puts adaptation into the set of characteristics of 
    species. This was an innovation at the time and one which did not become generally 
    accepted until much later . . . --Verne Grant, October-November-December 1994. <em>Biologisches Zentralblatt </em>113(4): 406.</font></p>

    observation seems paradoxical. Domestic animals have less need to be cryptic 
    than their wild counterparts, but, at least for humans, the presence of symmetry 
    is a major failing of camouflage. Symmetrical patterning gives away animals

    primate distributions were affected by river barriers and showed that the Basin was divisible into four major
    geographic areas bounded by the Amazon, Negro, and Madeira rivers. This hypothesis, although not mutually
    exclusive from others, has received recent attention and support. Ayres (1986) and Ayres and Clutton-Brock (1992)
    have confirmed Wallace's original observation by documenting the correlation between the degree of private
    community similarity on opposite banks of Amazonian rivers and river width, or flow rate. Additionally, Capparella
    has shown that the degree of genetic divergence among samples of understory bird species is related to river width.
    One explicit expectation of the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis is that increasing divergence should relate positively to
    river size (width, flow rate, etc.). Hence, differentiation should increase along both sides of a green river, from its
    headwaters to the mouth, as the barrier widens and the potential for cross-river gene flow diminishes. However, the
    expectation for any given taxon is likely to be complicated by the dynamic nature of floodplain rivers, because
    populations have the potential for passive transfer from one side to the other by river-bend cutoffs, or oxbow lake
    formation, through time . . . Consequently expectations of the potential force of riverine barriers are likely to vary
    among taxa that occur in the river floodplain (the seasonal flooded forest, or &quot;v&aacute;rzea&quot; of the Amazon Basin) as
    opposed to those that are limited to upland, nonflooded forest, or terra firme. The pattern and degree of divergence
    may also depend on other ecological characteristics . . . --James L. Patton <em>et al</em>., August 1994. <em>Evolution </em>48(4):

    the argument has been made that aesthetic criteria in general are secondary 
    and essentially in the service of a more fundamental process. Thus, Wallace 
    has disputed Darwin's claim that female choices of maters reflect strictly aesthetic 
    tastes, that is, beauty for beauty's sake (Wallace, 1889, 1892). Rather, Wallace 
    insisted that beauty is likely to be associated with good health and vigor, 
    which are deemed the primary bases for choice. The theoretical advantage that 
    accrues to Wallace's position is that sexual and natural selection are parsimoniously 
    working in unison. Within the classical Darwinian perspective, female choice 
    of the most flamboyantly adorned or colored male can imply choice of a mate 
    vulnerable to predators and likely to produce offspring with similar vulnerabilities. 
    None of this is intended to imply that either Darwin or Wallace is right or 
    wrong. After the passage of more than a century, the issue is still under debate,

    for genetic isolation has been called the Wallace Effect by Grant, in honor 
    of A. R. Wallace who first suggested it (Wallace 1889). Control of a species' 
    altitudinal boundary by a pathogen-environment interaction may provide an appropriate 
    arena for the Wallace Effect. The scenario for speciation suggested above begins 
    with a very unlikely event: establishment of a new disease-resistant population 
    outside the normal habitat of the parent species. Though unlikely, such speciation 
    across a &quot;pathological barrier&quot; requires no changes of climate, elevation of 
    mountain chains, or other large scale phenomena. It suggests that the potential 
    for the establishment of peripheral isolates in new ecological settings may 
    exist at the margin of a great many species. This scenario is similar to the 
    concept of the &quot;upstart species&quot; of Harper or of new species &quot;budding off' from 
    older species . . . --William Burger, December 1992. <em>Biotropica </em>24(4):

    monochromatic and polychromatic species, pelage pigmentation would be helpful 
    for identifying conspecifics, especially at distances where odor and vocalizations 
    would be unreliable cues. In polychromatic species it would also narrow the 
    range of choices within a herd when looking for the mother, particularly when 
    her head cannot be seen clearly. Alfred Russel Wallace recognized the significance 
    of body pigmentation when he wrote in 1889, under the subject of &quot;Colour as 
    a means of recognition&quot;: &quot;If we consider the habits and life-histories of those 
    animals which are more or less gregarious, comprising a large proportion of 
    the herbivora, . . . we shall see that a means of ready recognition of its own 
    kind, at a distance or during rapid motion, in dusk of twilight or in partial 
    cover, must be of the greatest advantage and often lead to the preservation 
    of life.&quot; Within a colour category, the young would have to rely on other cues, 
    be they visual, auditory, or olfactory. For example, the length of pelage was 
    one of the cues eliminated in this study by cutting the does' hair, because 
    in a previous study I noticed that the offspring of long-haired females tended 
    to solicit females with long hair like that of their mothers. Although cues 
    present in the head are probably important for individual recognition, at a 
    distance the fine detail of facial characteristics might not be as discernable 
    as markings on parts of the body with more surface area. The specific visual 
    cues used for recognition should depend on the characteristics of the group 
    or species, the habitat in which the species is found, and the perceptual capabilities 
    of the developing individuals . . . --Carlos R. Ruiz-Miranda, November 1992. <em>Behaviour </em>123(1-2): 136-137.</font></p>

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfred Russel Wallace developed a theory of evolution by natural selection at the same time that Charles
    Darwin did. He applied his theory to one of the earliest scenarios of human evolution. He related the split between
    the first human beings and the apes to the habitats in which they lived. Wallace proposed that hominids, our
    bipedally walking ancestors, arose on the great plains and high plateaus of Eurasia, isolated there by shrinking
    forests. His deduction was based on the fact that apes today live in dense forested areas. Wallace thought, therefore,
    that bipedally striding humans must have evolved in open, flat areas. Darwin disagreed on the geography, believing
    that a tropical environment with abundant fruit was our ancestral hominids' environment. He preferred an African
    origin for the human lineage. The chimpanzee and gorilla, he pointed out, were both African and the closest living

    speciation: asymmetric gene flow between parapatric populations, and asymmetric cross-incompatibility in both
    parapatric and sympatric (sub-)populations. Asymmetry in cross-incompatibility describes the situation where in one
    population the rejection of cross-matings is markedly stronger than in the other population. However, whether these

    European model of cultural progress rather than biological history that flashes before the reader. The narrative
    motion of the European mind searching backward through its own memory is obscured, and the narrative motion of
    the tropical landscape advancing into the European landscape is foregrounded. Wallace's representation suggests
    than in looking at the trees he is not simply experiencing perceptual confusion; he is perceiving future forms in
    present ones. The link between trees and pillars, between tropical and European, is thus seen as a historical
    inevitability rather than an optical illusion or perceptual accident. Where Darwin's illusions increase formal variety,
    however, Wallace's limit it. Rather than a single form blossoming into multiple analogous forms, Wallace's eye
    perceives several different species in terms of a single European form. The distinction between Darwin's and
    Wallace's representational strategies roughly correlates to the differences in their evolutionary theories. Darwin
    believed in random competitive evolution while Wallace believed in adaptive, environmental evolution . . . --James

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . In Wallace's nature all selection is purposeful and relatively precise; nature tends toward utility, and clears
  way all forms that are not useful. James's theory of vision can be seen as the perceptual corollary to Wallace's
  evolutionary theory. The Jamesian mind, like Wallace's evolutionary nature, establishes a formal standard that must
  be met, and all those forms that fail to meet that standard are eliminated; in Wallace's nature they die off, in James's
  vision they go unperceived. It is therefore appropriate that Wallace should use a Jamesian representational model.
  Where Darwin portrays visual forms mutating and multiplying as they compete for space in the reader's perceptual
  field, Wallace portrays the selection of forms according to an imageable standard of reference. Moreover, because
  this formal standard is European, the forms of nature are selected according to the standard of reference of
  European experience--the viewer perceives trees as pillars, and those trees that look less like pillars are ignored.
  Wallace's representation of evolution thus involves the reader in a more and more familiar world . . . --James

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until just before 1880 Wallace had firmly believed &quot;that vaccination was a scientific procedure, and that Jenner
    was one of the great benefactors of mankind.&quot; As a young man he had voluntarily undergone vaccination and
    subsequent revaccination, just before leaving for South America on a naturalistic trip. He had never questioned the
    effectiveness of the operation until reading several anti-vaccination texts and meeting William Tebb, the 1870
    successor of John and Richard Gibbs as leader of the Anti-vaccination League and founder of the Anti-vaccination
    Society of America. Convinced by Tebb's arguments, Wallace joined him in the battle for the new cause. Aware of
    his ignorance on medical matters, Wallace always based his arguments on statistic figures rather than on strictly
    sanitary aspects. Harry Clements, his biographer, writes: &quot;no one was apparently able seriously to challenge him on
    the figures.&quot; . . . --Giacomo Scarpelli, 1992. <em>Nuncius </em>(Italy) 7(1): 115-116.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . These moral principles were also applied to another field of study, that of the so-called &quot;Psychical
  Research&quot; which caught Wallace's interest very early, in fact earlier than we might possibly think. Spiritism, in
  Wallace's mind, had a eudaemonist socratic meaning: ghosts were seen as moral and spiritual guides to man.
  Wallace then developed the idea of man as center of a pre-ordained universe, in which the pain which man is
  subject to being the most sensitive creature, and the evil which he must fight since he is capable of discerning, are
  seen as necessary steps towards the completion of moral rather than organic developments, necessary to enter into a
  superior spiritual sphere. We can now truly understand this sentence: &quot;the whole purpose, the only <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre </em>of
  the world [ . . . ] was the development of human spirit in association with the human body&quot; . . . This conception of a
  pre-existing order and a synchronicity can explain the logic which backed Wallace's opinions and attitudes . . . --Giacomo Scarpelli, 1992. <em>Nuncius </em>(Italy) 7(1): 120-121.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Wallace . . . brought forth an alternative explanation which involved totally different powers. Man has the
  faculty of artificially selecting vegetable and animal species; similarly a Higher Intelligence could have controlled
  and directed Natural Selection in the human development process, in a particular and highly ethical aim . . .
  Effectively, Wallace, induced by the moral ideal earlier mentioned, was trying to find a solution that would not clash
  with his vision of <em>harmonia naturae</em> and undermine the theory of Natural Selection with whatsoever extension or
  correction. His was not a denial of the theory but, paradoxically, the result of his excessively rigourous attitude.
  Wallace, the hyperselectivist, preferred to involve a Superior Intellect, in other words a <em>deus ex machina</em>, rather than
  admit that his primary theory might possibly have been less absolute . . . --Giacomo Scarpelli, 1992. <em>Nuncius </em>(Italy)

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Wallace was driven in his crusade by ethical and social issues, as well as the intention of preventing the
  disruption of the biological balance. This was altogether a kind of civil protest aimed towards a general reform of
  society, freed from imposition. Wallace believed that an improvement of the population's economic conditions
  would have resulted in higher hygienic standards and a richer diet, and consequently, in a decreased spread of
  diseases, smallpox included. He also envisaged the creation of a Ministry of Health employing teams of Doctors.
  These purposes, which seem so obvious today, were in his time little less than revolutionary. It can be said that
  Wallace foresaw the creation of National Health Service . . . --Giacomo Scarpelli, 1992. <em>Nuncius </em>(Italy) 7(1): 128.</font></p>

  heavens for planets having a physical environment comparable with that of the earth and on which intelligent life
  might be presumed to have evolved. Properly understood, Wallace argued, the theory of evolution told against such
  a possibility--certainly against the emergence of intelligence akin to human. However close the physico-chemical

  followed the same nuanced path as on earth. One minor deviation at an early stage and the whole process would

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's scientific case rested on his conclusion that the human brain, including that of the most primitive
    peoples, was more powerful than was necessary for survival. For a large part of his early life Wallace had lived
    among primitive peoples in South America and Southeast Asia, an experience that convinced him that these people,
    simple as they have appeared in mind and action, were equal in intelligence to Europeans. As the modern
    anthropologist Loren Eiseley remarked, Wallace displayed &quot;scarcely a trace of the racial superiority so frequently
    manifested in nineteenth-century scientific circles,&quot; in which were included Darwin and Thomas Huxley. If human
    beings possessed brain capacities beyond what was needed for survival, Wallace reasoned, then how could natural
    selection bring about its evolution? Where was the &quot;survival value&quot; of that capacity if that capacity was not fully
    used? After all, natural selection improved an organ only through its adaptation to the pressure of environment. In
    the case of the human brain, however, the capacity was greater than human beings really required or that the
    pressure of environment could account for. Wallace logically concluded on those grounds that &quot;some higher
    intelligence directed the process by which the human race was developed.&quot; . . . --Carl N. Degler, 1991. In his <em>In

  groups. Thus he could not account for those differences through the operation of natural selection. He did, however,
  accept the common anthropological view of the time that the differences in levels of culture or civilization which
  occurred among the diverse peoples of the world derived from differences in their biological capacities. Some
  cultures were higher than others because the people in those societies were biologically superior. That was the
  opening in his theory of human evolution through which racism entered. It was that opening which Wallace closed
  with his conception of the intellectual equality and therefore the equal cultural capacity of all peoples. As things
  turned out, Wallace looked to other ways and matters in his effort to make evolution less competitive and
  threatening. He did not develop any further his assertion of the mental equality of all peoples, or at least few took
  notice of its relevance. Yet that was the precise argument, elaborated and tirelessly defended, that undermined in
  time the concept of racism in America. Its elaboration and defense underpinned the concept of culture, an idea that
  in the twentieth century became not only an alternative to a racial explanation for human behavioral differences but
  also a central concept in social science . . . --Carl N. Degler, 1991. In his <em>In Search of Human Nature; The Decline

  twentieth century, but his assertion of the special, indeed unique, nature of man, because of his brain, continued to
  influence many, directly or indirectly. The eminent modern American anthropologist Loren Eiseley, for example
  was among them. His sympathetic response to Wallace reflects the views of many other American social scientists
  today. Eiseley did not doubt that Wallace has a better understanding of the roots of human nature than Darwin. In
  his book <em>Darwin's Century</em>, Eiseley contrasted Darwin's conception with that of Wallace. &quot;The mind of man, by
  indetermination, by the power of choice and cultural communication,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is on the verge of escape from the
  blind control of that deterministic world with which the Darwinists had unconsciously shackled man. The inborn
  characteristics laid upon him by the biological extremists have crumbled away,&quot; he was relieved to report. In
  Eiseley's judgement, Wallace stood out among evolutionists of his own time because he recognized even then that
  human beings had escaped from biological evolution. &quot;Wallace saw and saw correctly, that with the rise of man the
  evolution of parts was to a marked degree outmoded, that mind was now the arbiter of human destiny.&quot; . . . --Carl N.

    analogous to the natural process even in later years. His mechanism did not even address the basic question of how

    In the pages of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>, over several editions, 
    Alfred Russel Wallace argued the case for acclimatization. He was more careful 
    than most, at that stage, in distinguishing between domestication, naturalization 
    and acclimatization. And yet arguing from first evolutionary principles and 
    from plant and animal biogeography, he urged that &quot;numerous facts in the distribution 
    of races show that man must, in remote ages at least, have been capable of constitutional 
    adaptation to climate&quot;. In more recent times, the migrations of the Jews, and 
    the settlement of the Dutch in South Africa, the English-speaking peoples in 
    America and Australia, and the Spanish in South America all demonstrated that

  show that man must, in remote ages at least, have been capable of constitutional

  evolution. Wallace forthrightly claimed that a conversion to spiritualism proximately caused his rejection of natural
  selection as an adequate principle to explain human evolution; and virtually all historians have taken him at his

  'good hunter or warrior' considerably exceeds that of an ordinary Englishman.&quot; Wallace had simply miscalculated
  the brain power the savage actually needed for survival; thus neither primitive man nor modern native likely had in
  excess what could be delivered by natural selection or augmented by entering into civilized life. On the question of

    Wallace letter is no longer in existence).&quot; But it is clear that Wallace did <em>not</em> ask Darwin to arrange for publication. Unfortunately, as Mayr notes, 
    the letter that accompanied Wallace'1s paper is lost. However, we have Darwin's 
    word for it that there was no such instruction. On the same day that Wallace's 
    paper arrived, Darwin wrote an anguished letter to Lyell, in which he refers 
    to Wallace's &quot;MS, which he does not say he wishes me to publish&quot;. Then, a week

    from a moral presumption. It seems wrong to publish someone's work, without

In contrast, Wallace reasons, the male gains from early emergence as an adult fly (protandry) of which small size may be a by-product, by acquiring access to females throughout the period of emergence and hence maximizing the number of females fertilized in a life time (Wallace, 1889).

    where we would use the term 'isolating mechanisms'.&quot; If this were the case, then Darwin advocated the incidental
    origin of reproductive isolation mechanisms, Wallace their origin by natural selection. Grant has gone on to suggest
    that it would be &quot;fitting and desirable&quot; to call the selective origin of reproductive isolation mechanisms the &quot;Wallace
    effect&quot;. There can be no question that some late nineteenth-century naturalists did use the word &quot;sterility&quot; where
    evolutionists now use &quot;reproductive isolation mechanisms&quot;. But I would argue that in their debate Darwin and
    Wallace meant what we do by &quot;sterility&quot;. The distinction Wallace drew in point 6 of his 1 March 1868 letter
    between &quot;disinclination to cross-unions&quot; and &quot;sterility&quot; certainly supports his view. Consequently Wallace was not
    proposing the selective origin of reproductive isolation mechanisms in general, but rather the selective origin of the
    particular <em>post</em>-mating mechanisms of cross- and hybrid sterility. Since, according to current theory, these forms of
    sterility are precisely the types of reproductive isolation that <em>cannot</em> be produced by selection, the Darwin-Wallace
    debate provides little historical justification for the term &quot;Wallace effect&quot;. The present view on the origin of sterility
    is essentially Darwin's view of an incidental origin. Furthermore, during the debate it was Darwin not Wallace who
    recognized the possibility of the selective origin of pre-mating reproductive isolation (&quot;disinclination to cross&quot;),

    selection on females might be stronger than that on males for a variety of reasons. 
    First, birds might preferentially select females if they were larger, more valuable 
    (e.g. because they contain eggs or embryos), or more easily captured than males. 
    Wallace originally proposed a version of this hypothesis to account for female-biased 
    polymorphisms in butterflies. He suggested that female butterflies might be 
    more vulnerable to predators because they are laden with eggs and fly more slowly. 
    Recently, it has been shown that birds do preferentially select female cicadas, 
    which are less vagile and more nutritious than males. Even if birds did not 
    discriminate between the sexes in prey species, selection on females might still 
    be more intense if avian predators encountered or noticed more females than 
    males. Female-biased encounter rates could result if the sex ratios of adult 
    prey were heavily skewed towards females, if females occurred more often in 
    microhabitats frequented by predators, or if females engaged in behaviors that 
    made them more conspicuous than males. The differential predation hypothesis 
    would be supported if birds ate females more frequently than males; it can be 
    refuted if males completely lack protective patterns but are still eaten by

    Spencer, wrote Wallace, was misconceiving natural selection. It does not work 
    by favouring 'any special bone, or muscle, or limb . . . but <em>by the selection 
      of the capacities or qualities</em>.' By 'capacities or qualities' Wallace meant 
    things like strength or speed. Wallace maintained that artificial selection 
    works in the same way. The breeder selects for qualities such as quickness, 
    not for particular variations of bones. 'The two modes of selection are thus 
    strictly analogous and strictly comparable.' He further insisted that natural 
    selection is not limited by the supply of variation because 'as a matter of 
    fact, there is a sufficiency of <em>useful</em> variation always present in 
    each succeeding generation to increase any required life-preserving quality, 
    all theoretical objections to the contrary notwithstanding.' Artificial selection 
    is not the 'point after point' improvement of organs; both modes of selection

    that male colour was due to &quot;great vigour and health and generally higher vitality&quot;.

  question of animal colouration. Interestingly enough, criticisms from Wallace focused on ambiguity in the argument
  about female aesthetic sense. The process by which female choice was effected was not made clear. Most discussion
  revolved around the issue of whether females were exercising some conscious choice or were being excited by and
  yielding to a male. Was it selecting or succumbing? Darwin (1871) originally thought it was selection. He states:
  &quot;No doubt this implies powers of discrimination and taste on the part of the female . . .&quot; Wallace (1891, 1901)
  objected to this notion of conscious choice, returning again and again to the admonition that female choice could not
  be shown in nature. Wallace stated that while female birds may be excited by a display of decorative plumage, there
  was no reason to suppose that this conferred a mating advantage. It is difficult to understand Wallace's reasoning in
  the light of his own ideas. He stated that colour and ornament are concomitant with vigour and general health and
  that it is the most healthy, persistent males that will mate. Differences between Darwin and Wallace seem to be a

    stayed away from the quagmire of the morphological controversy on species and varieties but based his conclusion
    on a rather strictly ecological argument. He concluded that population size of a species is not at all determined by
    fertility but by natural checks on potential population increase. An enormous number of animals must die each year
    to keep the number constant, and &quot;those that die must be the weakest--the very young, the aged, and the diseased--while those that prolong their existence can only be the most perfect in health and vigour--those who are best able to

    variants from crossing back into the unvaried population. Accordingly we don't find in Wallace's writings Darwin's
    attempt to explain speciation by isolation. Possibly Wallace concluded swamping could be ignored because by
    observation permanent varieties/species exist in nature. Thus he might have concluded backcrossing is in fact not
    significant in nature. Also, as he viewed the line between species as something other than a barrier preventing
    intermixing, he would not have felt the need to explain how such barriers are effective. Another consideration that
    subsequently supports Wallace's attitude is implicit in his approach to the theory of natural selection. Unlike

  Although Darwin cannot and does not specify in advance the kind of explanatory mechanism he is seeking he is
  able to say what kind of causal process he does not want, viz., the agent--teleological process of the creationist
  theories. His goal state can be described only in terms of a few desiderata, viz., a theory consisting of universal laws
  applicable to all organisms including humans and bringing together a wide variety of previously unconnected facts,
  and one in which the process of evolution is &quot;gradual&quot; in the sense that it is in conformity with Lyellian
  uniformitarianism applied to living organisms. Specifically, all large evolutionary changes are to be explained in
  terms of persistant small incremental changes occurring over a long time, and the law governing these changes are

    essentially two views on the origin of isolating mechanisms . . . The first view, championed by Darwin (1872), holds
    that isolating mechanisms originate as an incidental by-product of genetic divergence in geographically isolated
    populations. The second view, argued by Wallace (1889), holds that isolating mechanisms are established by means
    of natural selection in zones of overlap between incipient species . . . The contemporary view, which holds that
    premating reproductive barriers (often behavioral) are built up by natural selection in areas of sympatry in order to
    supercede postmating barriers that arose allopatrically, has come to be known as the Wallace effect. The plausibility

    Wallace's line marked a boundary which was the eastern limit of the great majority of East Indian mammals, like
    rhinoceroses and elephants. Others made their assessment on the proportion of western and eastern elements to be

    it is interesting to note that in this disagreement there are faint echoes of 
    the other matter which separated Darwin and Wallace at this time: sexual selection 
    through female choice. Darwin wanted to argue that the beauty of, say, the peacock 
    as opposed to the peahen, is a function of the females choosing beautiful males. 
    Wallace argued that the difference is essentially a function of the females 
    being more drab than the males, this drabness coming through the female's need 
    for camouflage from predators as they incubate their eggs and care for their 
    young. In arguing this way, Wallace was certainly not invoking group selection. 
    However, unlike Darwin, who was emphasizing the individual nature of selection 
    by seeing the main competition (at this point) as coming from within the species, 
    Wallace was deemphasizing competition within the group by seeing the threat 
    coming from without . . . --Michael Ruse, November 1980. <em>Annals of Science </em>37(6): 625.</font></p>

  let us offer solace to the opponents of human sociobiology. If one uncomfortable 
  with a rather extreme individual selectionism, particularly as applied to man, 
  and if one yet wants historical precedent to legitimize one's yearnings, then 
  no less than the sociobiologists can one find the most respectable of intellectual 
  ancestors. One may not be able to claim one of the fathers of evolutionism, 
  but one can claim the other: Alfred Russel Wallace. He was a group selectionist, 
  and moreover he was not prepared to see man treated on a par with other organisms. 
  I certainly do not want to pretend that today's biologists would find convincing 
  the details of Wallace's doubts about the all-sufficiency of individual selection, 
  or that those who criticize human sociobiology grind the same metaphysical axe 
  as did Wallace (although interestingly, politically Wallace was fairly left-wing, 
  as are many of today's critics). But, given Wallace's conclusions, it does seem 
  true to say that the critics of human sociobiology are no less part of the evolutionary 
  tradition than those they criticize! . . . --Michael Ruse, November 1980. <em>Annals

    Darwin was for sexual selection, while Wallace was against it and for natural selection instead. It is true that from
    1876 on, Wallace gave up sexual selection--he rejected female choice completely and interpreted male combat as
    just a form of natural selection. But the debate between Darwin and Wallace took place in 1867 and 1868, with a
    brief resumption in 1871 after publication of the <em>Descent of Man</em>. During this earlier period, Wallace fully accepted
    female choice and male choice, at least in birds. Wherever Darwin invoked female choice or male choice in birds,
    Wallace invoked it too. In other words, Darwin and Wallace agreed that, in birds, sexual selection was the cause of
    the coloration of the more brilliantly colored sex. Thus the debate did not come down to all sexual selection on one
    side and all natural selection on the other. The disagreement with respect to birds centered on the cause of the
    coloration of the less conspicuous sex . . . --Malcolm Jay Kottler, June 1980. <em>Proceedings of the American

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must fantasy inevitably accompany speculation on the plurality of worlds? Fortunately not, for even the history
    of the question contains a few indications of sober deliberation. In this respect, two nineteenth-century dissenters on
    plurality, William Whewell and Alfred Russel Wallace, stand out as the first post-Copernican thinkers to rein in
    imagination by proposing sensible rules for thinking about such a provocative but thorny issue. When Whewell's <em>Of
      the Plurality of Worlds </em>was published in 1853, it challenged what had become, since the sixteenth century, a
    traditional belief in the existence of life elsewhere. Fifty years later, Alfred Russel Wallace, co-discoverer of the
    theory of natural selection and later Percival Lowell's most tenacious opponent, extended the dissenting tradition by
    writing the first study that successfully synthesized biological and astronomical perspectives on life in a plurality of
    worlds . . . --William C. Heffernan, January-March 1978. <em>Journal of the History of Ideas </em>39(1): 82-83.</font></p>

  the dissenters' strictures on reasoning. There was a gratifying irony in this, for while most of Wallace's peers found
  fault with the book, they unwittingly based their comments on the rules which Whewell and Wallace considered
  necessary for careful speculation on plurality. For instance, H. H. Turner, the Savilian professor of astronomy at
  Oxford, captured the thrust of the many unfavorable reviews of <em>Man's Place</em> when he insisted that the universe is
  probably not bounded in the sense of having an edge; that even if it were, there would be no center; and that even if
  the sun were at the center, such a position would not be uniquely stable. Like other critics, Turner was able to seize
  on the flaws in the argument of life beyond the solar system and thus ignore the strengths of Wallace's overall
  position--the banishment of theology when considerations of probability were at stake, the introduction of an
  explicitly evolutionary perspective, and the low likelihood of life within the solar system. Wallace had created a
  grand and only somewhat flawed synthesis, although few people remarked on this . . . --William C. Heffernan,

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . And what about the climate itself? Lowell had claimed that although Mars receives only half the earth's
  heat, the absence of an atmosphere would actually mean that the sun's radiation would have a more direct effect on
  it than on the earth. Wallace was appalled that a respected scientist could be responsible for such an hypothesis. The
  opposite would have to be the case, as Wallace showed: because of its lack of sufficient atmosphere, Mars must
  retain heat more poorly than the earth. There would also have to be greater variations in temperature between the
  ground and the air a few feet above it, and Wallace pointed out that these would impede the development of
  advanced organisms . . . --William C. Heffernan, January-March 1978. <em>Journal of the History of Ideas </em>39(1): 95.</font></p>

  could it be said that the two traditions were methodologically indistinguishable? Certainly not. Precisely because
  they were dissenters, Whewell and Wallace had been forced to articulate their position with a degree of care that no
  pluralist had ever shown. Because they were inspired by different and unusual convictions about man's status, the
  dissenters had to take the scientific road to plurality; for their case would not otherwise have been heard. In this
  way, discussion of the possibility of life in other worlds was transformed; for in later years, the metaphysical
  context of the debate would fall away, leaving a core of scientifically grounded speculation for which Whewell and
  Wallace had prepared the way . . . --William C. Heffernan, January-March 1978. <em>Journal of the History of Ideas </em>39(1): 100.</font></p>

    at the Military Medical Academy of St. Petersburg. Several years later, Pavlov 
    was to begin his studies there on &quot;psychic&quot; reflexes, employing visual and auditory 
    stimuli to signal the taste of acid or meat powder in the mouth of dogs. Poulton's 
    summary of two decades of comparative animal research upon the positive effects 
    of satisfying foods and the negative effects of annoying tastes was presented 
    eleven years before E. L. Thorndike's (1897) doctoral thesis on animal intelligence 
    and the law of effect. Pavlov and Thorndike went on to investigate conditioned 
    responses more rigorously, and ultimately their students operationally defined 
    a series of methodological &quot;laws&quot; . . . --John Garcia &amp; Walter G. Hankins,

    I want to suggest that the first step in any study of his contribution must 
    be a careful analysis of how he actually presented his idea in the 1858 paper, 
    concentrating especially on the kind of variation that was the basis of natural 
    selection. Strangely enough, such a detailed analysis is provided neither by 
    Beddall nor McKinney, both of whom simply assume that what Wallace eventually 
    discovered was a straightforward equivalent of the Darwinian theory. This assumption 
    is common to most general accounts of the history of evolutionism, and was shared 
    by Darwin himself. But there are good reasons for suggesting that Wallace's 
    initial concept of selection differed considerably from Darwin's, or at least 
    was expressed in very different terms . . . --Peter J. Bowler, January 1976. <em>Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences </em>31(1): 18.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . It was only at a later 
  stage in his thought--after he had discovered the principle of divergence--that 
  Darwin actually came to realize that varieties would at some stage have to compete 
  with one another. The essence of Wallace's mechanism was for Darwin a secondary 
  insight gained some time after he had worked out the primary mechanism of selection 
  acting on individual differences. Furthermore, when Darwin discussed varieties 
  coming into conflict, he pictured this as a geographical effect caused by one 
  form's invading and conquering the territory of the other. Wallace on the other 
  hand, simply wrote of species splitting into varieties as though this occurred 
  across the whole geographical range, with members of each variety in face-to-face 
  conflict at all points. Wallace's failure to appreciate the role of geographical 
  factors in the formation of varieties again suggests that he may not at first 
  have recognized natural selection as the agency that created the varieties out 
  of individual differences. Or, if he did recognize the action of natural selection 
  on individual differences, he had certainly failed to work out its full implications 
  for his own theory of selection acting among the varieties . . . --Peter J.

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . 
  It is clear that in the later stages of his career Wallace was fully aware of 
  the importance of individual variation to selection. He was able to exploit 
  both modes of representation employed by Darwin, using especially the range 
  concept to make a notable contribution to the measurement of variation among 
  wild populations. But all of this occurred after he had read the <em>Origin 
    of Species</em>, with its clear descriptions of Darwin's primary conception 
  of selection's acting on the individual differences first to form varieties 
  and then species. His own first paper on natural selection had side-stepped 
  this level of the mechanism and developed a theory of competition among the 
  varieties after they had been formed. This was a valid Darwinian mechanism, 
  but one which to Darwin himself represented a second level of selection which 
  utilized the varieties formed from the selection of individual variations. It 
  may be that from the beginning Wallace also recognized the primary action of 
  selection upon individual differences, and simply preferred to describe the 
  mechanism acting at the second level because he was more familiar with what 
  he called permanent varieties. But even if this were so, there are certain points 
  in the 1858 paper which suggest that he had at least failed to work out the 
  consequences of the first level of selection for his own theory . . . --Peter

    the more recent date for the ice age and a consequently accelerated rate of 
    species change, Wallace arrived at a figure of 24 million years for the time 
    since the beginning of the Cambrian. This estimate, he concluded happily, would 
    fit easily within Kelvin's limits and still leave a period three times as long

    As early as 1876, the naturalist and zoogeographer Alfred Wallace noted that 
    &quot;we live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all of the hugest, 
    and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared.&quot; He remarked especially 
    on the &quot;sudden dying out of so many large Mammalia, not in only one place but 
    over half the land surface of the globe&quot; (Wallace 1876). At the end of the Pleistocene 
    in North America, there was a loss of 33 genera of large mammals (&gt;50 kg), 
    while only 13 genera had become extinct in the preceding 1 or 2 million years. 
    Smaller mammals (&lt;50 kg) were not similarly affected, nor were marine mammals, 
    which we might also expect to show high extinction rates if the cause were environmental 
    catastrophes. Wallace (1911) observed that these sudden extinctions were not 
    correlated with major environmental changes, such as those responsible for the 
    extinction of the dinosaurs, but seemed to coincide with the arrival, on different 
    continents at different times, of Stone Age man . . . --Richard S. Miller &amp;

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This concept 
    of the separation of the human personality from the human body meant that Wallace 
    considered man and the relation of science to man in a context wholly different 
    from that of the advocates of scientific naturalism. As William Irvine once 
    described the evolution of Huxley's mind, &quot;He became interested in man as a 
    physical mechanism, as an anthropoid ape, as a social unit and a citizen, as 
    a delicate machine for the discovery of scientific truth, but never to any appreciable 
    extent in man as a personality and a human being.&quot; Wallace's development was 
    exactly the reverse. He was originally interested in the physical mechanism 
    of man for the sake of the moral personality encased therein. He studied the 
    anthropoid ape because it resembled man. He wrote on social questions in the 
    hope that society might be so organized as to allow the moral faculties to flourish. 
    Throughout his long and varied scientific career, Wallace was primarily concerned 
    with what Koestler has dubbed &quot;the ghost in the machine&quot; rather than with the 
    machine itself . . . --Frank M. Turner, 1974. In his <em>Between Science and 
      Religion; The Reaction to Scientific Naturalism in Late Victorian England</em> (Yale University Press): 82.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . In the London Anthropological Society address of March 1864, Wallace continued to discuss, though in a
  very different kind of forum, matters that had weighted upon his mind for over twenty years. He brought into the
  professional scientific sphere the scientific concepts and goals that he had learned in the provincial mechanics
  institutes. The address was his single most important comment on man and contained the latent seeds for all his later
  departures from scientific naturalism. The American evolutionist John Fiske recalled that the address &quot;seemed to
  open up an entirely new world of speculation.&quot; Such speculation was indeed new to men who had known little or
  nothing of &quot;physical puritanism&quot; or the &quot;belated rationalism&quot; of the working-class culture in which Wallace had
  come to maturity. For Wallace the paper was simply a continuation of his earlier thought . . . --Frank M. Turner,
  1974. In his <em>Between Science and Religion; The Reaction to Scientific Naturalism in Late Victorian England</em> (Yale
  University Press): 83-84.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Spiritualism furnished Wallace with a scientific explanation for the development of man's moral nature and
  brought man's total being under the rule of rational cosmic law. In a curious manner, the theory of spiritualism
  provided a law for the moral world analogous to that provided by natural selection for the organic world. Natural
  selection removed the necessity for an arbitrary and interfering God of Special Creation. Spiritualism banished the
  arbitrary God of predestination and replaced Him with a uniform law of individual moral progress and of personal
  moral responsibility. . . --Frank M. Turner, 1974. In his <em>Between Science and Religion; The Reaction to Scientific
    Naturalism in Late Victorian England</em> (Yale University Press): 88.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . &quot;Consistency,&quot; the tract by Robert Dale Owen, Robert Owen's son, particularly interested Wallace. The
  younger Owen, who himself also later converted to spiritualism, argued that the doctrine of predestination led to
  immoral living because it rendered one's eternal reward a matter of chance rather than a function of the virtue of
  one's life. Concurring in these arguments, Wallace moved very quietly and painlessly from faith to skepticism. His
  loss of faith grew directly out of a situation succinctly described by a writer later in the century: &quot;God, and
  immortality, and the Bible have been so taught as to make scepticism the only refuge for morality to flee to.&quot;
  Wallace later identified this rational skepticism with agnosticism. His skepticism, however, more nearly resembled
  deism. He did not deny the possibility of religious knowledge or of pure religion but rather the validity and morality
  of the Christian religion. Most important, Wallace and the Owenites did not dismiss the moral significance of the
  questions that Christianity had addressed. The questions of religion remained valid even if the Christian answers
  were false. The Owenite criticism of Christianity made Wallace, as well as genuine Owenites, highly susceptible to
  a rational religion, such as spiritualism, that was based on empirical evidence and that emphasized social
  cooperation and benevolent individualism . . . --Frank M. Turner, 1974. In his <em>Between Science and Religion; The

    emphatically opposed a demarcation between ethical and scientific ideas and 
    that he also resisted the breakdown of the common intellectual <em>milieu </em>with 
    his own unified world-view. He endeavoured to combine notions of value with 
    his scientific theory of evolution, particularly in relation to man. British 
    biologists in the first half of the nineteenth century characteristically analysed 
    their data in terms of the teleological framework of Natural Theology. Evolutionary 
    theory supposedly demolished this framework. Nevertheless, Wallace incorporated 
    a fundamental teleology into all his theories. He considered that he had thereby

  of organization; while many have declared the passage from matter to mind to 
  be inconceivable'. While other biologists tended to avoid this question, Wallace 
  believed in a spiritual purpose behind the phenomenon of consciousness. It was 
  not clear to him that conscious actions could have any biological utility if 
  they were merely parallel, or epiphenomenal, to automatic physiological actions. 
  In particular, he believed that it was not possible to assign utility to the 
  consciousness of volition if this consciousness was deceptive . . . --Roger

    and creation of species. The intermittent process was available in the fortuitous 
    nature of the circumstances favorable for the preservation of fossil remains. 
    Wallace on the other hand had for some years been attempting to validate the 
    hypothesis of gradual species transformation. Although he had been examining 
    the relationships between geographical distribution and affinity within affinity 
    groups (general, families), there is no evidence that he had given any thought 
    to the question of the origin of discontinuities within such groups until a 
    few months before he wrote the 1855 essay. During that brief period several 
    quite unexpected patterns of distribution and affinity came to his attention. 
    Soon thereafter grew the appreciation that extinction, interacting with species 
    transformation, could give rise to all known patterns of organic discontinuities

  &quot;all gaps between species, genera, or larger groups are the result of extinctions 
  of species during former epochs of the world's history&quot; that this statement 
  seems nothing unusual. It is only when it is clearly understood that this statement

  his life and the life of any descendants born in his lifetime, or in failure of such, for the life of anyone nominated by
  the landlord. He calls this full compensation, but of course it is only partial compensation; the State would
  confiscate, independently of any rise in its inherent value, the reversion of this inherent value some years hence. If
  we put the probable duration of the lives at forty years, this is equal to an immediate confiscation of 30 per cent of
  the inherent value, if we take interest at 3 per cent, or a confiscation of 20 percent if we take interest at 4 per cent.

    but it would seem that Darwin tended to concentrate on the effects of different dispersal mechanisms on patterns of
    distribution, Wallace more on the influence of barriers in restricting faunas conceived of as units. Thus, Wallace
    was more orientated toward historical explanation for classes of phenomena, Darwin toward reasoning from the
    effects of the properties of individuals upon the overall pattern of distribution . . . --Michael T. Ghiselin, 1969. In

  of natural selection through a process of &quot;retroduction&quot;: that is, they were 
  aware of a phenomenon, and successfully sought out an explanation in superficially 
  unconnected processes. The method through which this insight was obtained would 
  seem to have been orderly and rational . . . --Michael T. Ghiselin, 1969. In

    regions according to what he believed to be the five major races of mankind; animal groups were likewise divided
    into fives. The divisions were mathematical, the reasons not only unknown but unknowable. But Wallace

    that all groups of animals are divided into the same number of types of forms or divisions&quot; . . . --Barbara G.

  of &quot;<em>the permanent disuse of an organ, arising from a change of habits,</em> [which caused] <em>a gradual shrinkage of ultimately the disappearance and even 
    extinction of that organ</em>.&quot; Wallace, like Chambers, thought that rudimentary 
  organs showed relationships, but he misinterpreted them, confusing vestigial 
  with nascent organs. He did, however, ask the right question: &quot;If each species 
  has been created independently, and without any necessary relations with pre-existing

  necessities before it came into existence? And how could it &quot;continue to exist unless its structure enabled it to
  obtain food? He thought that the arguments brought forward as proofs of design were absurd; not only were they
  insulting to the intelligence of a Supreme Being, but they also placed narrow limits on His power . . .Barbara G.

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Looking back, it is interesting that Wallace, in 1880, thought that enough information was already at hand
    to make further expeditions and collecting redundant. What was needed, he said, was intensive study of selected
    islands, and since Britain owned most of the world's islands, the government should post naturalists on some of
    them to make such studies. Wallace's suggestion was good, though naturally nothing came of it, but his major
    premise was wrong. We still need to know a great deal more than we do about the species that make up island
    biotas, not merely for the sake of naming and cataloguing them, but because knowledge of the identities,
    relationships, distribution, behavior, and ecological roles and requirements of the species is essential for
    understanding both the evolution of the island biotas and the evolution and functioning of the island ecosystems . . .

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hypothesis 
    of a secondary and supplementary process of selection for reproductive isolation, 
    considered as an advantageous situation in its own right for the species concerned, 
    was advanced in the early period of evolutionary biology by Wallace (1889), 
    who tried unsuccessfully to convince Darwin. It seems fitting and desirable 
    to designate the process of selection for reproductive isolation as <em>the 
      Wallace effect</em>. The Wallace hypothesis was proposed again in the modern 
    period by Fisher (1930), Dobzhansky (1941; 1951), and Huxley (1943). The subject 
    has been reviewed recently by Mayr (1963) and Grant (1963). It is argued that 
    the individuals of two sympatric species populations which produce inviable 
    or sterile hybrids will contribute fewer offspring to future generations than 
    will sister individuals in the same parental populations which do not hybridize. 
    Consequently the genetic factors determining some block or aversion to hybridization 
    will tend to increase in frequency within each species over the course of generations. 
    This process of selection is expected to lead to a reinforcement of the reproductive 
    isolation which had developed as a by-product of divergence . . . --Verne Grant,

    to three different families, have a common modification in the shape of their

    unrelated species. Modern speciation theory predicts that closely related species when sympatric will diverge in
    appearance, habits, and season due to rigorous selection for the two main speciation sequelae: anti-hybridization
    mechanisms and niche diversification (anti-competition). Wallace's M&uuml;llerian extension explains an important
    deviant. He also suggested the possibility of a still different sort of mimicry, in which A SCARCE EDIBLE

    aroused attention because of the difficulties involved in transporting such forms to small and widely scattered
    islands. Suggested dispersal agents have included land connections, drifting vegetation, typhoons and migratory
    birds. The use of islands as stepping stones, including those now buried beneath the sea, was suggested by Wallace
    in 1881. In Wallace's time there was little geological evidence to support the idea of submerged islands. As late as
    1950 it was pointed out that complete proof for island distribution was &quot;hopelessly buried in the geological past.&quot; . .

    beyond doubt the most remarkable geomorphic phenomenon of the Aru Islands. Numerous branch channels are also
    encountered. There are several theories concerning the genesis of these channels. Wallace (1857, 1869) tried to
    explain them as the remainders of the Pleistocene lower courses of New Guinea rivers preserved here by subsequent
    uparching of the Aru region, whereas elsewhere the river courses gradually disappeared during the transgression of

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfred Russel Wallace had lived for many years in tropical regions, first in the Amazon basin and later in the
    East Indies, where he had been especially impressed by the phenomena of animal distribution. He thus had a
    broader and more direct and intimate acquaintance with the subject than any other naturalist traveller of his century.
    He was continually at work on this subject from 1860 until 1876, the date of publication of his two volumes on <em>The
      Geographical Distribution of Animals</em>. He somewhat modestly refers to this work as an extension and amplification
    of the two chapters on the subject in the <em>Origin of Species</em>, comparing it with Darwin's own two-volume expansion
    of the chapters on animals and plants under domestication. The two principal sections of Wallace's work on
    contrasted as &quot;zoological geography,&quot; a descriptive discussion of the land animals of the different zoogeographic
    regions, and &quot;geographical zoology,&quot; a review of the distribution of vertebrates and certain invertebrates, group by
    group. Whatever their fate in a reclassification of regions and subregions, Wallace's scheme and nomenclature are
    the ones that appear most widely in zoological literature . . . --Karl Patterson Schmidt, December 1954. <em>The

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Dr J. Rae, the most notable contribution to the Gesture Theory came from Charles Darwin's rival, Dr
    Alfred Russel Wallace, who in 1895 pointed out, in <em>Fortnightly Review</em>, that, in English speech, it is common to
    produce words by an appropriate gesture of the tongue, lips or jaw, so as 'to bring sense and sound into unison'.
    Thus, in UP, the jaw makes an upward movement, while in DOWN, the jaw moves down. Continuing consonants,
    such as F, L, M, N, etc., symbolize continuing motions, such as fly, run, swim, move. On the other hand, words for
    abrupt motions end with a stopped consonant--e.g., B, D, G, K, P, T, in stop, hop, pat, stab, kick, etc. Dr Wallace
    considered it in the highest degree probable that the pantomimic use of the various parts of the mouth constitute 'a
    fundamental principle which has always been at work, both in the origin and in the successive modifications of
    human speech'. Dr Wallace did not recognize Dickens' observation of hand and mouth as exemplified by Sam
    Weller; but he was, I believe, the first to point out that the pantomimic principle may be still active in man's
    unconscious development of his spoken language, and that modern languages may be just as gestural as the older
    ones . . . --R. A. S. Paget, 1951. <em>Science News</em> (England) 20: 87.</font></p>

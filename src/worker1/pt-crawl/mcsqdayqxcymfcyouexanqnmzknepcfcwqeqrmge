<h3>Eli Marsden Wilson A.R.A., A.R.C.A. 1877 -<strong> </strong>1965</h3>
<h3><strong><img src="images/Eli Marsden Wilson.jpg" alt="Ele Marsden Wilson" width="200" height="274" hspace="8" vspace="4" border="0" align="right">Ossett Artist </strong></h3>
<p align="justify">Eli Marsden Wilson was  the only son of Alfred Wilson and Emma Marsden and was born on Midsummer&rsquo;s Day  in 1877 at Ossett.&nbsp; Alfred Wilson was one  of the sons of John Wilson (born 1819) who was part of the Wilson cloth making family who lived at West Wells, Ossett.</p>
<p align="justify">Alfred and Emma Wilson had six children, all born in  Ossett - five girls and one boy.&nbsp; Alfred  worked in the textile industry as a foreman beamer (at the 1881 and 1891  census) and lived in Headlands.&nbsp; The Wilson family was brought  up in a supportive atmosphere of learning. The children were encouraged to  take an interest in the arts and everyone played a musical instrument.&nbsp; Alfred Wilson himself played the cello, which  was an unusual choice for Victorian Ossett.&nbsp;  From this family background, the children would break out of the more  traditional Ossett occupations of engineering and textile manufacture.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Eli Marsden Wilson</strong> attended Wakefield College of Art before moving to the Royal College of Art in London where he became a  pupil of Sir Frank Short, an eminent painter and etcher.&nbsp; At the turn of the century, there was a  revival in the art of etching, and by the early 1900s it was a profitable art  form.&nbsp; Eli Marsden Wilson returned to his  roots for his first commercial etching, which was a scene showing Ossett Market,  and a version of this etching can be seen today at Wakefield   Art Gallery  where it can be viewed by prior arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>Below:</strong> The Market, Ossett an etching by Eli Marsden Wilson (exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1905) and the first of seventeen pictures by Wilson exhibited at the R.A. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ossett_market_place_eli_marsden_wilson.jpg" alt="Ossett Market Place" width="450" height="275"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Sir Frank Short: 1857  to 1945</strong> <br>
Frank Short was a master etcher, engraver and lithographer  who had a major influence on his contemporaries and pupils at the Royal College  of Art. He revived the techniques of mezzotint and aquatint and it was his  inspiration which was responsible for the technical excellence of British  print-making between the first and second world wars. James McNeil Whistler was  an admirer of Frank Short's etchings</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Hilda Mary Pemberton: 1871-1957</strong> <br>
  <strong><img src="images/Hilda Mary Pemberton.jpg" alt="Hilda Mary Pemberton" width="158" height="171" hspace="8" vspace="6" border="0" align="left"></strong>After his time at the Royal College of Art, Eli Marsden  Wilson settled in London.&nbsp; He lived at first in Chelsea  but then moved to Acton,  which was close to the thriving Bohemian art community in Ealing. 
<p align="justify">Eli married a  lady called Hilda Mary Pemberton born on the 28th December 1871 in London. Hilda was the daughter of Frederick Blake  Pemberton, a noted civil engineer and his wife Lucy.&nbsp; Hilda was also the grand-daughter of a Major Pemberton who had  served, with distinction, in India  with the British Army.&nbsp;The couple were married in the June quarter of 1905  in the Wandsworth Registration District of London when Hilda was 33 and Eli was  28.&nbsp; Sadly, the couple didn&rsquo;t have  children.&nbsp;  It is assumed that Eli met Hilda because she was also an artist with a strong interest in etching as an art form and she was very successful in her own right.
<p align="justify"><strong>Quaker</strong><br>
  From his family roots in Ossett as a Wesleyan  Methodist, Eli Marsden Wilson became a Quaker and a pacifist.&nbsp; He was also a vegetarian, which must have  been very rare in the early 1900s.&nbsp; It is  possible that his religious beliefs may have caused him to move to a vegetarian  diet.&nbsp;  </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>The White Feather</strong><br>
    The symbol of  cowardice and failing one&rsquo;s country was handed out scornfully, usually by young women, to those who  refused to fight during the First World War. Eli Marsden Wilson  became an absolutist conscientious objector during WW1, refusing to do anything at all to help the war effort. This stance his caused him to be imprisoned  for two years between 1917 and 1919.&nbsp; 
    <p align="justify">The Military Service Act of January and May 1916 introduced conscription for the first time in WW1 and the extension to the act in May 1916 deemed that all men aged between 18 and 41 years were eligible to be called up for military service. There were four clauses in the Act for exemption, one being the conscientious objection to the undertaking of combatant service. A system of Local  and Central Tribunals was arranged.                Each registration district as  would have a Local Tribunal or Tribunals, consisting of                between 5 and 25 members each.  Any person                aggrieved by the decision of a Local Tribunal could make an appeal. Eli Marsden Wilson was married and aged 38 when the Military Service Act was introduced and no doubt to his horror, he was conscripted into the army in late 1916 when he was living in Acton. Although Wilson appealed to the local tribunal for exemption on the grounds that at some time he had converted to the Quaker religion and was a pacifist, he was refused and he then took the dangerous line of becoming an<em> 'absolutist'</em> conscientious objector.
 <p align="justify">Absolutists were opposed to conscription as well as war and refused to engage in any form of war work, regardless of the penalty. They would refuse to wear army uniform or even answer call-up papers and inevitably, they were court-martialled and imprisoned. The army created the Non-Combatant Corps to try and find an acceptable niche for the less hard-line conscientious objectors and about 3,500 COs accepted this concession. However, this still did not satisfy the conscience of absolutists like Wilson. He was arrested, taken to the local barracks and ordered to put on a uniform, which he refused to do. This led to his court martial and then imprisonment, first in Wormwood Scrubs and then at Dartmoor, where conditions were less harsh. He was to spend just over two years in prison from February 1917 to March 1919, when he was finally released. </p>
    <p align="justify">About 50 'absolutists' were sent to France, where they all refused to accept military discipline. As a result between 30 and 34 of them were sentenced to death for failing to accept military orders in a theatre of war. Their death sentences were immediately commuted to 10 years imprisonment in a civilian gaol and at least one of these 'absolutists' was held at Wakefield Prison.
    <p align="justify">Conscientious Objectors (COs) were largely viewed with disdain by the general public. It is known that there were at least four Ossett-based conscientious objectors who appeared before tribunals: Joshua Fox Taylor who lived on Runtlings, a man called Ellis and a man called Clapham who lived in High Street, Gawthorpe were three of them. However, Eli Marsden Wilson had left his home town of Ossett some years before WW1 to live in London. Because of his stance as a conscientious objector, Wilson was not seen in a good light by his extended family back in Ossett, many of whom fought  in WW1, but made no such moral distinction. 
    <p align="justify">In all, during WW1 there were more than 16,000  recorded British conscientious objectors; 6,312 were  arrested; 5,970 were court-martialled and sent to prison, where they endured  privations both mental and physical (819 spent over two years in prison, including Eli Marsden Wilson). At  least 73 COs died because of the harsh  treatment they received; a number suffered long-term physical or mental  illness.&nbsp; 1,330 &ldquo;absolutists&rdquo; refused to  do any kind of alternative war work, but never won exemption for this  principled stand. Some agreed to join the Home Office Scheme, which allowed COs out of prison to to take up places at Work Camps where they carried out menial tasks such as farm work, construction and forestry. Some of the  COs found this kind of work not much to their liking, so changed  their minds and went back to prison. A few 'absolutists' volunteered for the Home Office Scheme, but were kept separate from the other COs. </p>
    <p align="justify">And after the Armistice?&nbsp; No one was in a  hurry to release the COs; certainly not until  the surviving soldiers were brought back from the front, which took months. Some  COs went on hunger strike in protest at their  continued detention: 130 were forcibly fed through tubes (as suffragettes had  been), so forcibly that many were injured by the treatment and had to be  temporarily released. Others went on work strikes and were brutally punished  for it. In May 1919 the longest-serving prisoners began to be released; the  last CO left prison in August of 1919. Many found that no one wanted to employ them.  Those who hadn't done alternative or non-combatant service were deprived of their  votes for five years (though this wasn't always strictly enforced).</p>
    <p align="justify">A surprising number of conscientious objectors subsequently went on to become Labour MPs after WW1. Herbert Morrison, Labour MP for South Hackney and later Lewisham, became the Home Secretary and a member of Churchill's War Cabinet in WWII, but was a conscientious objector in WWI. Fenner Brockway, a prominent conscientious objector during WW1, became the Labour MP for Slough in 1950, serving until 1964. Another CO, Ness Edwards was the Labour MP for Caerphilly between 1939 and 1968. </p>
    <p align="justify">After being released from prison, Eli Marsden Wilson  slowly began to rebuild his career and in 1922, HRH Princess Mary Louise commissioned him to produce an etching for Queen Mary's dolls house, which can be seen today at Windsor Castle.&nbsp; Clearly, his stance as a pacifist during WW1  had been forgiven, by the Royals at least. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Margate Harbour.jpg" alt="Margate Harbour" width="300" height="224"></p>
<p><strong>Above:</strong> Margate Harbour, an etching produced by Wilson for Queen Mary's Dolls House. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>The 1920s </strong><br>
  By the time of the Wall Street  Crash in the 1920s, etchings had become almost like currency and people bought  and sold them like they do stocks and shares or even gold.&nbsp; Wilson  had enjoyed the boom in the popularity of etchings as one of the British school  of painter-etchers of the time.&nbsp; However,  the Wall Street Crash changed everything and the market disappeared completely  for etchings.&nbsp; The fashion was no longer  fashionable.&nbsp; Wilson had to adapt to the changing market and so concentrated more on painting rather than print making.&nbsp; He went to Italy in the  1920s to develop his knowledge and devised some new painting methods.&nbsp; Landscapes were his favourite - painted in  the traditional way.&nbsp; City scenes of  places like Oxford or York, with dreaming spires or fine  architecture were also much favoured.

<p align="left"><strong>Above:</strong> Another view of Ossett by E.M. Wilson, believed to be Bank Street in the background as viewed from a side street. 

<p align="justify">Fortunately for Eli Marsden  Wilson, he was commissioned in the late 1920s to paint four large wall panels at  the Natural History Museum in London.&nbsp; These were in the Geological  Museum and depicted prehistoric Britain &ndash; ferns, trees and dinosaurs, like a  predecessor to the scenes in Jurassic   Park.&nbsp; This was a very respectable piece of work for  Wilson and he  finally cast off the stigma of his enforced stay in prison as a result of his  religious beliefs.&nbsp; The panels that Wilson painted can still  be seen at the Natural History Museum today.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/NHM_Wilson.jpg" alt="Natura History Museum" width="480" height="181"></p>

<p align="justify">Eli and Hilda bought a  cottage in a place called Blewbury in Berkshire  (now in Oxfordshire).&nbsp; Here they enjoyed  a rural, idyllic lifestyle, which was quite different to their time at Acton in London.&nbsp; Set in the foothills  of the Berkshire Downs, this beautiful village is full of attractive thatched  and timber-framed houses. During the 19th century, Blewbury was popular with  artists and writers seeking peace, quiet and inspiration. One of them was  Kenneth Grahame, author of <em>The Wind in the Willows, </em>and the Tudor-brick  house in which he lived from 1910 to 1924 is still to be seen here. Eli  was in good company among the other &ldquo;Blewbury Artists&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">During the early 1930&rsquo;s  Hilda Mary made an extensive tour of South Africa.&nbsp; Her studies of The Cape are particularly memorable.&nbsp;  This  was at a time when Wilson himself was supplementing his income by tutoring  pupils and presumably he had now moved back to live in London full-time.&nbsp; One of his pupils was Mary Cockburn, who was  some 30 years younger than Wilson  and like his wife, was from a well-to-do military background.&nbsp;After the death of Wilson's wife Hilda in 1957, Mary Cockburn became Wilson's live-in companion. She was a talented  watercolour painter in her own right and had her work successfully exhibited at the Royal Academy. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/EMWilson_Mary_Cockburn.jpg" alt="E.M. Wilson with his companion Mary Cockburn" width="373" height="497"></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Above:</strong> Wilson in much older age with his companion and former pupil Mary Cockburn circa 1958. </p>
<p align="justify">Eli Marsden Wilson was a  complex man with many interests and skills.&nbsp;  He died at the age of 88 on the 13th November 1965 at his home at 9 Faraday Road, Acton, London.&nbsp;  His long-term friend, Mary Cockburn passed on many of Wilson&rsquo;s possessions,  including letters and photographs to Andrew Wilson Clay the great-grandson of his  sister, Annie Lois Wilson.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">Andrew Wilson Clay has provided much  of the information in this chapter.&nbsp; He has been researching the life and work&nbsp; of Eli Marsden Wilson for over 20 years and is  currently writing a comprehensive study of the artist.&nbsp; Andrew is also a great great grandson of Mark Senior (1862-1927),  another famous Ossett artist.&nbsp; Senior&rsquo;s  work can been seen at Wakefield City Art Gallery and Leeds City Art Gallery.&nbsp; Coincidentally, Senior acted for many years  as an artistic advisor to the Ossett born worsted manufacturer, Sam Wilson, a  cousin of Eli Marsden Wilson&rsquo;s father - See also <a href="toleeds.html">the Ossett Wilsons to Leeds</a> for more details about Sam Wilson. </p>
<p align="justify"> Dr Robin M.  Pelteret, Cape Town, South Africa also kindly provided some of the information in this chapter about Hilda Mary Pemberton.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">Wilson's wife <strong>Hilda Mary Pemberton </strong>was a decorative designer, painter and etcher in her own right.&nbsp; She was educated at Goldsmith&rsquo;s College in London and as a student  received silver and bronze medals from the Royal College of Art in recognition  of her talents.&nbsp; She was a skilful and  prolific artist who attracted a wide audience of admirers.&nbsp; Her favourite method of expression was &ldquo;dry  point&rdquo; a form of etching.&nbsp; She exhibited  in the Royal Academy  between 1897 and 1940 on 10 occasions as well as the Royal  Cambrian Academy,  Royal Scottish Academy  and the Society of Women Artists. Wide public recognition resulted in her  election as an Associate of the Royal Cambrian Society and the Society of Women  Artists in 1922.&nbsp; </p>
<p>She visited Cape Town in South Africa during 1931/32.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Cape  Times&rdquo; noted that her works, inspired  by the beauty that is the Cape were to be exhibited at the Royal Academy  in 1931.&nbsp; Her last known works are dated  1955.

    <!--- right column end -->
</p>
<p>The subject of her art was diverse: scenic and vernacular architecture of the United Kingdom, Capetown and environs; portraits, in which indigenous South African people were to feature; flowers, bookplates, stained glass and tapestry works for the British market. Her work was always executed to the highest standards and persistently attracted a substantial clientele. There is today a strong collector's market for the work of Hilda Pemberton, especially her South African work.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Obituary of Eli Marsden Wilson</strong><br>
The son of Ossett textile worker who became famous in the world of art, Mr. Eli Marsden Wilson, died at his home 9, Faraday Road, Acton, London, on Saturday, aged 88.</p>
<p align="left">Son of Mr. Alfred Wilson, who was the foreman manager at Mark Oldroyd's mill, Dewsbury, Mr. Wilson went to seek fame and fortune in London during his early manhood and became a professional artist specialising in etchings and earning considerable repute. </p>
<p align="left">He became an Associate of the Royal Society of Painters - Etchers and Engravers, and exhibited on many occasions in the Royal Academy and at international exhibitions. He executed many important works, one of which, a frieze depicting prehistoric England is in the Geological Museum at South Kensington.</p>
<p align="left">One of his proudest achievements was a tiny etching, the size of a postage stamp, which he was specially invited to make for the late Queen Mary's Doll's House.</p>
<p align="left">His wife, by whom he was predeceased about eight years ago, was an artist in water colours and had many of her works exhibited in art galleries throughout Britain. They celebrated their golden wedding in 1955.</p>
<p align="left">One of Mr. Wilson's etchings that was exhibited by the Royal Academy, and which became famous, depicted Ossett Market Place 60 years ago with gas flares on the stalls and the women wearing shawls. A more recent commission was a number of scenes in Lundy Island, carried out at the request of the owner.</p>
<p align="left">In the exhibition of the Royal Society of Painter - Etchers and Engravers held in London in 1933, Mr. Wilson had an etching of West Wells, Ossett with a pair of aproned housewives gossiping on the doorsteps.</p>
<p align="left">One or two of his pictures are in Wakefield Museum, and in the recent exhibition of local art at Ossett Town Hall, a couple of his works were entered by his nephew, Mr. Edward Wilson Clay of Ossett, whom he had frequently visited in recent years.</p>
<p align="left">Mr. and Mrs. Wilson had no children. Mr. Wilson was an elder in the Quaker movement. He was cremated yesterday at Mortlake, London.</p>

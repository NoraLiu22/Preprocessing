/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

          had a real talent for provocative, lucid exposition. The great American 
          philosopher Charles Peirce once said of him that &quot;he believes in all 
          that he believes down to the very soles of his boots,&quot; and how in his 
          opinion he &quot;never wrote a dull line in his life, and couldn't if he 
          tried.&quot; In the following selections, arranged chronologically, the reader 
          can sample some of what Peirce was talking about. To link directly to

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [concerning the colors of rivers in the Amazon region 
          . . .] <i>&quot;These various-coloured waters may, we believe, readily be 
          accounted for by the nature of the country the stream flows through. 
          The fact that the most purely black-water rivers flow through districts 
          of dense forest, and have granite beds, seems to show that it is the 
          percolation of the water through decaying vegetable matter which gives 
          it its peculiar colour. Should the stream, however, flow through any 
          extent of alluvial country, or through any districts where it can gather 
          much light-coloured sedimentary matter, it will change its aspect, and 
          we shall have the phenomenon of alternating white and black water rivers. 
          The Rio Branco and most of its tributaries rise in an open, rocky country, 
          and the water there is pure and uncoloured; it must, therefore, be in 
          the lower part of its course that it obtains the sediment that gives 
          it so remarkably light a colour; and it is worthy of note, that all 
          the other white-water tributaries of the Rio Negro run parallel to the 
          Rio Branco, and, therefore, probably obtain their sediment from a continuation 
          of the same deposits; only as they flow entirely through a forest district 
          producing brown water, the result is not such a strikingly light tint 
          as in the case of that river.&quot;</i>
      </p><p>--from <a href="S011.htm">'On the Rio Negro,'</a> 1853, <i>Journal 
          of the Royal Geographical Society</i> 23: 212-217, on page 213.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on adaptations . . .] <i>&quot;In all works on Natural 
          History, we constantly find details of the marvellous adaptation of 
          animals to their food, their habits, and the localities in which they 
          are found. But naturalists are now beginning to look beyond this, and 
          to see that there must be some other principle regulating the infinitely 
          varied forms of animal life. It must strike every one, that the numbers 
          of birds and insects of different groups, having scarcely any resemblance 
          to each other, which yet feed on the same food and inhabit the same 
          localities, cannot have been so differently constructed and adorned 
          for that purpose alone. Thus the goat-suckers, the swallows, the tyrant 
          fly-catchers, and the jacamars, all use the same kind of food, and procure 
          it in the same manner: they all capture insects on the wing, yet how 
          entirely different is the structure and the whole appearance of these 
          birds! . . . What birds can have their bills more peculiarly formed 
          than the ibis, the spoonbill, and the heron? Yet they may be seen side 
          by side, picking up the same food from the shallow water on the beach; 
          and on opening their stomachs, we find the same little crustacea and 
          shell-fish in them all. Then among the fruit-eating birds, there are 
          pigeons, parrots, toucans, and chatterers--families as distinct and 
          widely separated as possible,--which yet may be often seen feeding all 
          together on the same tree; for in the forests of South America, certain 
          fruits are favourites with almost every kind of fruit-eating bird. It 
          has been assumed by some writers on Natural History, that every wild 
          fruit is the food of some bird or animal, and that the varied forms 
          and structure of their mouths may be necessitated by the peculiar character 
          of the fruits they are to feed on; but there is more of imagination 
          than fact in this statement: the number of wild fruits furnishing food 
          for birds is very limited, and birds of the most varied structure and 
          of every size will be found visiting the same tree.&quot;</i>

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on insect collecting in Borneo . . .] <i>&quot;To give 
          English entomologists some idea of the collecting here, I will give 
          a sketch of one good day's work. Till breakfast I am occupied ticketing 
          and noting the captures of the previous day, examining boxes for ants, 
          putting out drying-boxes and setting the insects of any caught by lamp-light. 
          About 10 o'clock I am ready to start. My equipment is, a rug-net, large 
          collecting-box hung by a strap over my shoulder, a pair of pliers for 
          Hymenoptera, two bottles with spirits, one large and wide-mouthed for 
          average Coleoptera, &amp;c., the other very small for minute and active 
          insects, which are often lost by attempting to drop them into a large 
          mouthed bottle. These bottles are carried in pockets in my hunting-shirt, 
          and are attached by strings round my neck; the corks are each secured 
          to the bottle by a short string. The morning is fine, and thus equipped 
          I first walk to some dead trees close to the house frequented by Buprestidae. 
          As I approach I see the bright golden back of one, as he moves in sideway 
          jerks along a prostrate trunk,--I approach with caution, but before 
          I can reach him, whizz!--he is off, and flies humming round my head. 
          After one or two circuits he settles again in a place rendered impassable 
          by sticks and bushes, and when he leaves it, it is to fly off to some 
          remote spot in the jungle. I then walk off into the swamp along the 
          path of logs and tree-trunks, picking my way cautiously, now glancing 
          right and left on the foliage, and then surveying carefully the surface 
          of the smooth round log I am walking on. The first insect I catch is 
          a pretty little long-necked Apoderus sitting partly upon a leaf: a few 
          paces further, I come to a place where some Curculionidae, of the genus 
          Mecopus, are always seated on a dry sun-shiny log. A sweep of my net 
          captures one or two, and I go on, as I have already enough specimens 
          of them. The beautiful Papilios, Evemon and Agamemnon, fly by me, but 
          the footing is too uncertain to capture them, and at the same moment 
          a small beetle flies across and settles on a leaf near me--I move cautiously 
          but quickly on--see it is a pretty Glenea, and by a sharp stroke of 
          the net capture it, for they are so active that the slightest hesitation 
          is sure to lose the specimen. I now come to a bridge of logs across 
          a little stream; this is another favourite station of the Buprestidae, 
          particularly of the elegant Belionota sumptuosa. One of these is now 
          on the bridge,--he rises as I approach,-- flies with the rapidity of 
          lightning around me, and settles on the handle of my net! I watch him 
          with quiet admiration,--to attempt to catch him then is absurd; in a 
          moment he is off again, and then settles within a yard of me; I strike 
          with all my force, he rises at the same moment, and is now buzzing in 
          my net, and in another instant is transferred in safety to my bottle: 
          I wait a few minutes here in hopes that another may be heard or seen, 
          and then go on; I pass some fallen trees, under which are always found 
          some Curculionidae, species of Alcides and Otops,--these I sweep carefully 
          with my net and get two or three specimens, one new to me. I now come 
          to a large Boletus growing on a stump,--I push my net under it, two 
          Thyreopterae run on to the top, I knock one with my hand into my net, 
          while the other has instantly escaped into a crack in the stump and 
          is safe for this day, but his time will come. In some distance now I 
          walk on, looking out carefully for whatever may appear; for near half-a-mile 
          I see not an insect worth capturing; then suddenly flies across the 
          path a fine Longicorn, new to me, and settles on a trunk a few yards 
          off. I survey the soft brown mud between us, look anxiously for some 
          root to set my foot on, and then cautiously advance towards him: one 
          more step and I have him, but alas! My foot slips off the root, down 
          I go into the bog and the treasure escapes, perhaps a species I may 
          never obtain again. Returning to the path, another hum salutes my ear, 
          and the fine Cetonia, Macronota Diardi, settles on a leaf near me, and 
          is immediately secured: a little further, a yellow-powdered Buprestis 
          is caught in the same manner. Having reached the usual limits of my 
          walk in this direction, I turn back . . .&quot;</i>

          Durian grows on a large and lofty forest-tree, something resembling 
          an Elm in character, but with a more smooth and scaly bark. The fruit 
          is round or slightly oval, about the size of a small melon, of a green 
          colour, and covered with strong spines, the bases of which touch each 
          other, and are consequently somewhat hexagonal, while the points are 
          very strong and sharp. It is so completely armed that if the stalk is 
          broken off it is a difficult matter to lift one from the ground. The 
          outer rind is so thick and tough that from whatever height it may fall 
          it is never broken. From the base to the apex five very faint lines 
          may be traced, over which the spines somewhat curve and approximate; 
          these are the sutures of the carpels, and show where the fruit may be 
          opened with a heavy knife and a strong hand. The five cells are silky-white 
          within, and are filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing 
          about three seeds each. This pulp is the eatable part, and its consistence 
          and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with 
          almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional 
          wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, 
          and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness 
          in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. 
          It is neither acid nor sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these 
          qualities, for it is in itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other 
          bad effect, and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to 
          stop. In fact, to eat Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the 
          East to experience. . . . as producing a food of the most exquisite 
          flavour it is unsurpassed. If I had to fix on two only as representing 
          . . . perfection . . . I should certainly choose the Durian and the 
          Orange as the king and queen of fruits.&quot;</i>

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Wallace, writing from the field to his brother-in-law 
          Thomas Sims in 1861 on the subject of belief . . .] <i>&quot;. . . You intimate 
          that the happiness to be enjoyed in a future state will depend upon, 
          and be a reward for, our belief in certain doctrines which you believe 
          to constitute the essence of true religion. You must think, therefore, 
          that belief is </i>voluntary<i> and also that it is </i>meritorious<i>. 
          But I think that a little consideration will show you that belief is 
          quite independent of our will, and our common expressions show it. We 
          say, 'I wish I could believe him innocent, but the evidence is too clear'; 
          or, 'Whatever people may say, I can never believe he can do such a mean 
          action.' Now, suppose in any similar case the evidence on both sides 
          leads you to a certain belief or disbelief, and then a reward is offered 
          you for changing your opinion. Can you really change your opinion and 
          belief, for the hope of reward or the fear of punishment? Will you not 
          say, 'As the matter stands I can't change my belief. You must give me 
          proofs that I am wrong or show that the evidence I have heard is false, 
          and then I may change my belief'? It may be that you do get more and 
          do change your belief. But this change is not voluntary on your part. 
          It depends upon the force of evidence upon your individual mind, and 
          the evidence remaining the same and your mental faculties remaining 
          unimpaired--you cannot believe otherwise any more than you can fly.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Belief, then is not voluntary. How, then, can 
          it be meritorious? When a jury try a case, all hear the same evidence, 
          but nine say 'Guilty' and three 'Not guilty,' according to the honest 
          belief of each. Are either of these more worthy of reward on that account 
          than the others? Certainly you will say No! But suppose beforehand they 
          all know or suspect that those who say 'Not guilty' will be punished 
          and the rest rewarded: what is likely to be the result? Why, perhaps 
          six will say 'Guilty' honestly believing it, and glad they can with 
          a clear conscience escape punishment; three will say 'Not guilty' boldly, 
          and rather bear the punishment than be false or dishonest; the other 
          three, fearful of being convinced against their will, will carefully 
          stop their ears while the witnesses for the defence are being examined, 
          and delude themselves with the idea they give an honest verdict because 
          they have heard only one side of the evidence. If any out of the dozen 
          deserve punishment, you will surely agree with me it is these. Belief 
          or disbelief is therefore not meritorious, and when founded on an unfair 
          balance of evidence is blameable.</i> 
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to apply the principles to my own case. In 
          my early youth I heard, as ninety-nine-hundredths of the world do, only 
          the evidence on one side, and became impressed with a veneration for 
          religion which has left some traces even to this day. I have since heard 
          and read much on both sides, and pondered much upon the matter in all 
          its bearings. I spent, as you know, a year and a half in a clergyman's 
          family and heard almost every Tuesday the very best, most earnest and 
          most impressive preacher it has ever been my fortune to meet with, but 
          it produced no effect whatever on my mind. I have since wandered among 
          men of many races and many religions. I have studied man and nature 
          in all its aspects, and I have sought after truth. In my solitude I 
          have pondered much on the incomprehensible subjects of space, eternity, 
          life and death. I think I have fairly heard and fairly weighed the evidence 
          on both sides, and I remain an </i>utter disbeliever<i> 
          in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass 
          over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics 
          shut out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality 
          of Christianity. You I know will not believe that in my case, and <u>I</u> 
          know its falsehood as a general rule. I only ask, Do you think I can 
          change the self-formed convictions of twenty-five years, and could you 
          think such a change would have anything in it to merit </i>reward<i> 
          from</i> justice<i>? I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. 
          To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether 
          there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal 
          soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no 
          fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for 
          truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who 
          have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and 
          which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.&quot;</i>

And it must be remembered that the naturalist is rarely likely to err on the side of imputing greater indefiniteness to species than really exists. There is a completeness and satisfaction to the mind in defining and limiting and naming a species, which leads us all to do so whenever we conscientiously can, and which we know has led many collectors to reject vague intermediate forms as destroying the symmetry of their cabinets. We must therefore consider these cases of excessive variation and instability as being thoroughly well established; and to the objection that, after all, these cases are but few compared with those in which species can be limited and defined, and are therefore merely exceptions to a general rule, I reply that a true law embraces all apparent exceptions, and that to the great laws of nature there are no real exceptions&mdash;that what appear to be such are equally results of law, and are often (perhaps indeed always) those very results which are most important as revealing the true nature and action of the law.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on some fundamentals of geodesy . . .] <i>&quot;The 
          fact (universally stated in works on astronomy and geodesy) that degrees 
          of the meridian </i>increase<i> in length towards the poles, on account 
          of the earth's </i>compression<i> at the poles, is, indeed, one well 
          calculated to mystify a mere mathematician, though it is clear enough 
          to anyone who reflects on the various conditions involved in the problem. 
          If we look at the diagram of a sphere, and the space from the equator 
          to the pole be divided into equal parts subtending angles of one degree 
          each at the centre, and we then flatten the poles by cutting off a portion 
          with a curve of greater radius, it is evident that the distance from 
          the pole to the centre of the sphere will be shorter than before, and 
          therefore, that degrees of latitude, </i>measured angularly from that 
          centre<i>, would really diminish in length from the equator towards 
          the poles.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in our actual rotating globe, the unequally 
          curved surface is one of equilibrium, owing to the varying centrifugal 
          force at different latitudes; and, as degrees of a meridian can only 
          be measured upon the surface by </i>tangents<i> or </i>perpendiculars 
          to it<i> (obtained by the </i>spirit-level<i> or the </i>plumb-line<i>), 
          it follows that a degree at the pole, measured by an angular instrument 
          from the earth's centre, would not represent a degree of latitude, because 
          the curvature of the polar regions has its centre much further off than 
          the earth's centre of gravity, and a degree measured on the surface 
          would therefore be longer. The </i>centre of curvature<i> of the earth's 
          surface rarely coincides with the centre of gravity, and a plumb-line 
          will therefore not always point directly to that centre. It will do 
          so only at the equator and the pole. Everywhere else adjacent plumb-lines 
          will meet at points within or beyond the centre, according as the curvature 
          of the surface is less or greater than the mean curvature of the globe. 
          The flattened polar regions are, for the geometer, portions of a larger 
          sphere; the protuberant equator (as far as latitude is concerned) is 
          part of a smaller one; and degrees of the meridian measured on these 
          parts must be respectively longer and shorter than what would be due 
          to the mean curvature of the globe . . .&quot;</i>

Now, although we have progressed vastly beyond the savage state in intellectual achievements, we have not advanced equally in morals. It is true that among those classes who have no wants that can not be easily supplied, and among whom public opinion has great influence, the rights of others are fully respected. It is true, also, that we have vastly extended the sphere of those rights, and include within them all the brotherhood of man. But it is not too much to say, that the mass of our populations have not at all advanced beyond the savage code of morals, and have in many cases sunk below it.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [concerning the relation of matter to force . . 
          .]<i> &quot;. . . To say that mind is a product or function of protoplasm, 
          or of its molecular changes, is to use words to which we can attach 
          no clear conception. You cannot have, in the whole, what does not exist 
          in any of the parts; and those who argue thus should put forth a definite 
          conception of matter, with clearly enunciated properties, and show, 
          that the necessary result of a certain complex arrangement of the elements 
          or atoms of that matter, will be the production of self-consciousness. 
          There is no escape from this dilemma--either all matter is conscious, 
          or consciousness is something distinct from matter, and in the latter 
          case, its presence in material forms is a proof of the existence of 
          conscious beings, outside of, and independent of, what we term matter.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foregoing considerations lead us to the very 
          important conclusion, that matter is essentially force, and nothing 
          but force; that matter, as popularly understood, does not exist, and 
          is, in fact, philosophically inconceivable. When we touch matter, we 
          only really experience sensations of resistance, implying repulsive 
          force; and no other sense can give us such apparently solid proofs of 
          the reality of matter, as touch does. This conclusion, if kept constantly 
          present in the mind, will be found to have a most important bearing 
          on almost every high scientific and philosophical problem, and especially 
          on such as relate to our own conscious existence.&quot;</i>

          and, because Mr. Darwin says that we are profoundly ignorant of these 
          (although he himself has done so much to elucidate them), maintains 
          that we cannot really know anything of the origin of species. As well 
          might it be said that, because we are ignorant of the laws by which 
          metals are produced and trees developed, we cannot know anything of 
          the origin of steamships and railways. Spontaneous &quot;variations&quot; are 
          but the materials out of which &quot;species&quot; are formed, and we do not require 
          to know how the former are produced in order to learn the origin of 
          the latter. But though we may not know the laws which determine each 
          variation in detail, the general causes which lead to variation are 
          not difficult to perceive. We do not know all the laws and causes that 
          have given their peculiar form to each mountain or each valley, but 
          we know a good deal of the general causes which have produced them, 
          and we can perceive that the reason no two are exactly alike is, the 
          number and complexity of the causes and the endless variety of conditions 
          under which these causes have acted. In the far more complex operations 
          of the development and growth of organisms, affected as we know they 
          are by almost infinitely numerous and ever varying external and internal 
          causes, it would be a much greater mystery if there were no variations,

          pain, as the condition of all progress, whether physical or mental,

          the presence of certain types of plants or animals in one island rather

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on natural selection and evolution . . .]<i> 
          &quot;. . . 'At first sight it would seem that such feelings as those of abstract justice and benevolence could never have been so acquired, because they are incompatible with the law of the strongest, which is the essence of natural selection. But this is, I think, an erroneous view, because we must look not to individuals but to societies; and justice and benevolence, exercised towards members of the same tribe, would certainly tend to strengthen that tribe, and give it a superiority over another in which the right of the strongest prevailed, and where consequently the weak and the sickly were left to perish and the few strong ruthlessly destroyed the many who were weaker.' Here, then, I fully recognise the power of natural selection to develop some mental faculties; but I go on to show that there are others, as well as some physical characters, which could not have been so developed, and I thence conclude that man was not developed exclusively by natural selection even if animals were so developed, but that in his case 'some higher law' has intervened. This is very different from 'barring' evolution in the case of man, as your reviewer says I do. Mr. Darwin himself admits that natural selection 'has been the main, but not the exclusive means of the modification of organisms,' and I have given reasons why this is still more emphatically true in the case of man; and these reasons have, so far as I know, never been satisfactorily confuted. As to the hypothetical mode by which I suggested that the difficulty might be got over, it remains a mere suggestion, the correctness of which I am by no means anxious to maintain; but that the difficulties I have stated are real difficulties, and as regards natural selection alone insuperable ones, I am as much convinced as ever. Evolution, however, is a very different thing, and I can hardly imagine any mode or origin of man or his faculties which would not be in accordance with that great principle, which is, essentially, the principle of gradual modification under the action of laws, however complex or obscure those laws may be.&quot;</i>

          man. In a perfect and harmonious world, perfect beings might possibly

          objections to each of the proposals here noticed, there is a general 
          and fundamental objection. They all attempt to deal at once, and by 
          direct legislative enactment, with the most important and most vital 
          of all human relations, regardless of the fact that our present phase 
          of social development is not only extremely imperfect but vicious and 
          rotten at the core. How can it be possible to determine and settle the 
          relations of women to men which shall be best alike for individuals 
          and for the race, in a society in which a very large proportion of women 
          are obliged to work long hours daily for the barest subsistence, while 
          another large proportion are forced into more or less uncongenial marriages 
          as the only means of securing some amount of personal independence or 
          physical well-being. . . .Can any thoughtful person admit for a moment 
          that, in a society so constituted that these overwhelming contrasts 
          of luxury and privation are looked upon as necessities, and are treated 
          by the Legislature as matters with which it has practically nothing 
          to do, there is the smallest probability that we can deal successfully 
          with such tremendous social problems as those which involve the marriage 
          tie and the family relation as a means of promoting the physical and 
          moral advancement of the race? What a mockery to still further whiten 
          the sepulchre of modern society, in which is hidden 'all manner of corruption,' 
          with schemes for the moral and physical advancement of the race!&quot;</i>

Some of us can only be influenced by ideas or impressions, which we think are altogether the product of our own minds. Others can be so strongly acted on that they feel an inexplicable emotion, leading to action beneficial to themselves or to others.

          . . .] <i>&quot;It will be necessary to make a few preliminary observations 
          on the nature of capital, what it is and what it is not. And first, 
          money is not capital. A man may have a houseful of money, but it is 
          not capital till it is converted into tools or raw materials, and even 
          then it will not be productive capital unless it can command both labor 
          and intelligence to utilise it. We often hear the threat that if workmen 
          strike for higher wages capital will go out of the country. That is 
          an idle threat. True capital--railroads, factories, mills, &amp;c., 
          will not pay to carry away; and as for rich people taking money out 
          of the country, that would hurt no one even now, and if we had possession 
          of the land it would be an absolute benefit to us.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, few persons realise how perishable and 
          fugitive is capital. It wants constant looking after and constant renewal. 
          Every few years new and improved machinery replaces the old, and even 
          buildings have to be constantly repaired, and at longer or shorter intervals 
          to be altogether re-built. We see how comparatively unimportant is the 
          value of capital existing at any one time, when we observe the rapid 
          renewal of that which has been destroyed by a great fire, like that 
          of Chicago, or by a foreign invasion like that of France by Germany. 
          In a very few years everything is replaced and everybody seems as well 
          off as before. We also see how rapidly capital is created by the fact 
          that so many wealthy men who now own mills and houses by the score began 
          life with nothing. Capital, like all wealth, is created and grows solely 
          by means of labor and intelligence applied to land or to the products 
          of the land. It is one of the misleading errors of political economists 
          that the three factors of wealth are land, labor and capital. The true 
          factors, as long ago pointed out by our vice-president, Mr. Volckman, 
          are land, labor, and intelligence. These existed before capital was 
          created; and had capital been a </i>necessary<i> factor in the production 
          of capital, then it could never have come into existence at all. It 
          follows that, when the workers have free access to the </i>land<i>, 
          and as the </i>labor<i> is certainly all their own, they only need the 
          </i>intelligence<i> to produce in a very short time all the capital 
          that is needed . . .&quot;</i>

          . No! What we need are not prohibitory marriage laws, but a reformed

          in these matters. And it is to the women of the future that I look for 
          the needed reformation. Educate and train women so that they are rendered 
          independent of marriage as a means of gaining a home and a living, and 
          you will bring about natural selection in marriage, which will operate 
          most beneficially upon humanity. When all women are placed in a position

          others, until they encounter the man of their ideal. I want to see women 
          the selective agents in marriage; as things are, they have practically 
          little choice. The only basis for marriage should be a disinterested 
          love. I believe that the unfit will be gradually eliminated from the 
          race, and human progress secured, by giving to the pure instincts of 
          women the selective power in marriage. You can never have that so long

          . . .] <i>&quot;A few words are here necessary as to the very common misconception 
          that extreme Darwinians do not recognise the importance of the organism 
          itself and of its laws of growth and development, in the process of 
          evolution. For myself, I may say that no one can be more profoundly 
          impressed by the vast range, by the complexity, by the mystery, by the 
          marvellous power of the laws and properties of organised matter, which 
          constitute the very foundation of all life, and which alone render possible 
          its countless manifestations in the animal and vegetable worlds; while 
          those who have read Weismann's account of the complex processes of development 
          of sperm and germ cells, in his volume on </i>The Germ Plasm<i>, must 
          feel sure that he, at all events, can have no inadequate conception 
          of their importance.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Darwinians deny is--as I understand the 
          question--that these laws themselves serve to keep the completed organism 
          in close adaptation to the fluctuating environment, instead of merely 
          furnishing the material which is required for that adaptation. In our 
          view, the fundamental laws of growth and development, through the agency 
          of rapid multiplication and constant variability, provide the material 
          on which natural selection acts, and by means of which it is enabled 
          to keep up the adaptation to the environment (which alone renders continuous 
          life and reproduction possible) during the constant, though slow changes, 
          whether inorganic or organic, by which, in the course of ages, the effective 
          environment of each species becomes more or less profoundly modified. 
          Thus, and thus alone, we believe, are new species produced in strict 
          adaptation to the new environment. So far as rendering possible and 
          actually leading to growth, reproduction, and variation, the fundamental 
          laws are supreme. In securing the development of new forms in adaptation 
          to the new environment, natural selection is supreme. Hence arises the 
          real distinction--though we may not always be able to distinguish them--between 
          specific and non-specific or developmental characters. The former are 
          those definite, though slight modifications, through which each new 
          species actually became adapted to its changed environment. They are, 
          therefore, in their very nature, useful. The latter are due to the laws 
          which determine the growth and development of the organism, and therefore 
          they rarely coincide exactly with the limits of a species. The more 
          important of these latter characters are common to much larger groups, 
          as families, orders, or classes, while others, depending partly on complex 
          and fluctuating influences, are variable even within the limits of a 
          species. Of this kind are the finger-prints, which, like many other 
          minute details of form or structure, vary from individual to individual.&quot;</i>

          difficulty of conceiving the actual operation of the theory of Pangenesis 
          may be best illustrated by an example. Taking a bird, such as a peacock, 
          the theory implies that not only every cell and fibre of bone, muscle, 
          skin, and all internal organs gives off gemmules which all find their 
          way into every one of the cells constituting the sperm or reproductive 
          fluid, but that every one of the feathers also sends gemmules from each 
          of the cells that build up its wonderfully complex structure, not only 
          in the adult stage, but in the condition they assume in the young and 
          adolescent birds; and further, that every detail of varying colour of 
          the barbs of these feathers send off their gemmules, and that all this 
          inconceivable number of gemmules must travel through the whole structure 
          of the quill, and through all the tissues of the body, till they reach 
          the reproductive organs, and every one of these gemmules must reach 
          all or most of the sperm-cells, failing which there would be a corresponding 
          deficiency in the offspring. But as important deficiencies of feathers, 
          or of colour on the various feathers, which produce the beautiful patterns 
          and ornaments of a bird's plumage only rarely occur, we must assume 
          that the passage of the millions of gemmules from the ends of the feathers 
          of a peacock's train through the whole length of the shaft, and then 
          to the sperm-cells, is almost always successfully accomplished. In addition 
          to the enormous difficulty, on any theory, of conceiving the processes 
          of growth and development of the complex parts of living organisms, 
          we have, on this theory, an equal or greater difficulty in the reverse 
          process, by which the gemmules from every cell get back again to the 
          sperm and germ cells. Without asserting that this process is impossible 
          or inconceivable, it is well to endeavour to realise what it really 
          is and its almost incredible complexity.&quot;</i>

          like growth or definite change from form to form under the action of 
          unchangeable laws.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point especially to be noted here is, that 
          evolution, even if it is essentially a true and complete theory of the 
          universe, can only explain the existing conditions of nature by showing 
          that it has been derived from some preexisting condition through the 
          action of known forces and laws. It may also show the high probability 
          of a similar derivation from a still earlier condition; but the farther 
          back we go the more uncertain must be our conclusions, while we can 
          never make any real approach to the absolute beginnings of things. Herbert 
          Spencer, and many other thinkers before him, have shown that if we try 
          to realize the absolute nature of the simplest phenomena, we are inevitably 
          landed either in a contradiction or in some unthinkable proposition. 
          Thus, suppose we ask--is matter infinitely divisible or is it not? If 
          we say it is, we cannot think it out, since all infinity, however it 
          may be stated in words, is really unthinkable.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we say there is a limit--the ultimate atom--then, 
          as all size is comparative, we can imagine a being to whom this atom 
          seems as large as an apple or even a house does to us; and we then find 
          it quite unthinkable that this mass of matter should be in its nature 
          absolutely indivisible even by an infinite force. It follows that all 
          explanations of phenomena can only be partial explanations. They can 
          inform us of the last change or the last series of changes which brought 
          about the actual conditions now existing, and they can often enable 
          us to predict future changes to a limited extent; but both the infinite 
          past and the remote future are alike beyond our powers. Yet the explanations 
          that the theory of evolution gives us are none the less real and none 
          the less important, especially when we compare its teachings with the 
          wild guesses or the total ignorance of the thinkers of earlier ages.&quot;</i>

          Powers. We still continue grabbing all we can. In disputes with the 
          powerful we often give way; with the weak and helpless, or those we 
          think so, we are--allowing for advance in civilisation--bloody, bold, 
          and ruthless as any conqueror of the Middle Ages. And with it all we 
          are sanctimonious. We profess religion. We claim to be more moral than 
          other nations, and to conquer and govern and tax and plunder weaker 
          peoples for </i>their <i>good! While robbing them we actually claim 
          to be benefactors! And then we wonder, or profess to wonder, why other 
          Governments hate us! Are they not fully justified in hating us? Is it 
          surprising that they seek every means to annoy us, that they struggle 
          to get navies to compete with us, and look forward to a time when some 
          two or three of them may combine together and thoroughly humble and 
          cripple us? And who can deny that any just Being, looking at all the 
          nations of the earth with impartiality and thorough knowledge, would 
          decide that we deserve to be humbled, and that it might do us good?&quot;</i>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on our treatment of others . . .]<i> &quot;In </i>The Independent Review<i> (April, 1904), it is pointed out that
the universal practice of "saving the face" of any kind of
opponent rests upon the fundamental idea of the right of
every individual to be treated with personal respect. With
them this principle is taught from childhood, and pervades
every class of society, while with us it is only recognized by
the higher classes, and by them is rarely extended to inferiors
or to children. The feeling that demands this recognition is
certainly strong in many children, and those who have
suffered under the failure of their elders to respect it, can
well appreciate the agony of shame endured by the more
civilized Eastern peoples, whose feelings are so often outraged by the total absence of all respect shown them by
their European masters or conquerors. In thus recognizing
the sanctity of this deepest of human feelings these people
manifest a truer phase of civilization than we have attained
to. Even savages often surpass us in this respect.&quot;</i>

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on Wallace's powers of reasoning . . .]<i> &quot;This 
          rather long digression may be considered to be out of place, but it 
          is given in order to illustrate the steps by which I gradually acquired 
          confidence in my own judgment, so that in dealing with any body of facts 
          bearing upon a question in dispute, if I clearly understood the nature 
          of the facts and gave the necessary attention to them, I would always 
          draw my own inferences from them, even though I had men of far greater 
          and more varied knowledge against me. Thus I have never hesitated to 
          differ from Lyell, Darwin, and even Spencer, and, so far as I can judge, 
          in all the cases in which I have so differed, the weight of scientific 
          opinion is gradually turning in my direction. In reasoning power upon 
          the general phenomena of nature or of society, I feel able to hold my 
          own with them; my inferiority consists in my limited knowledge, and 
          perhaps also in my smaller power of concentration for long periods of 
          time.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Huxley also I felt quite on an equality 
          when dealing with problems arising out of facts equally well known to 
          both of us; but wherever the structure or functions of animals were 
          concerned, he had the command of a body of facts so extensive and so 
          complex that no one who had not devoted years to their practical study 
          could safely attempt to make use of them. I therefore never ventured 
          to infringe in any way on his special departments of study, though I 
          occasionally made use of some of the results which he so lucidly explained.&quot;</i>

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Wallace, recalling a dinner engagement . . .] <i>&quot;. 
          . . The conversation turned somehow upon the existence and nature of 
          God. Mr. </i>[George]<i> Grote seemed inclined to accept the ordinary 
          idea of an eternal, omniscient, and benevolent existence, because anything 
          else was almost unthinkable. To which </i>[Mr. John Stuart]<i> Mill 
          replied, that whoever considered the folly, misery, and badness of the 
          bulk of mankind, such a belief was unthinkable, because it would imply 
          that God </i>could<i> have made man good and happy, have abolished evil, 
          and has not done so. I ventured to suggest that what we call evil may 
          be essential to the ultimate development of the highest good for all; 
          but he would not listen to it or argue the question at all, but repeated, 
          dogmatically, that an omnipotent God might have made man wise, good, 
          and happy, and as He had not chosen to do so it was absurd for us to 
          believe in such a being and call </i>Him<i> almighty and good. He then 
          turned the conversation as if he did not wish to discuss the matter 
          further.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one point in connection with this problem 
          which I do not think has ever been much considered or discussed. It 
          is, the undoubted benefit to all the members of a society of</i> the 
          greatest possible diversity of character<i>, as a means both towards 
          the greatest enjoyment and interest of association, and to the highest 
          ultimate development of the race. If we are to suppose that man might 
          have been created or developed with none of those extremes of character 
          which now often result in what we call wickedness, vice, or crime, there 
          would certainly have been a greater monotony in human nature which would, 
          perhaps, have led to less beneficial results than the variety which 
          actually exists may lead to. We are more and more getting to see that 
          very much, perhaps all, the vice, crime, and misery that exists in the 
          world is the result, not of the wickedness of individuals, but of the 
          entire absence of sympathetic training from infancy onwards. . . . It 
          is therefore quite possible that </i>all<i> the evil in the world is 
          directly due to man, not to God, and that when we once realize this 
          to its full extent we shall be able, not only to eliminate almost completely 
          what we now term evil, but shall then clearly perceive that all those 
          propensities and passions that under bad conditions of society inevitably 
          led to it, will under good conditions add to the variety and the capacities 
          of human nature, the enjoyment of life by all, and at the same time 
          greatly increase the possibilities of development of the whole race. 
          I myself feel confident that this is really the case, and that such 
          considerations, when followed out to their ultimate issues, afford a 
          complete solution of the great problem of the ages--the origin of evil.&quot;</i>

          years I travelled and lived mostly among uncivilised or completely savage 
          races, and I became convinced that they all possessed good qualities, 
          some of them in a very remarkable degree, and that in all the great 
          characteristics of humanity they are wonderfully like ourselves. Some, 
          indeed, among the brown Polynesians especially, are declared by numerous 
          independent and unprejudiced observers, to be physically, mentally, 
          and intellectually our equals, if not our superiors; and it has always 
          seemed to me one of the disgraces of our civilisation that these fine 
          people have not in a single case been protected from contamination by 
          the vices and follies of our more degraded classes, and allowed to develope 
          their own social and political organism under the advice of some of 
          our best and wisest</i> <i>men and the protection of our world-wide 
          power. That would have been indeed a worthy trophy of our civilisation. 
          What we have actually done, and left undone, resulting in the degradation 
          and lingering extermination of so fine a people, is one of the most

          suffrage. None of the arguments for or against have any weight with 
          me, except the broad one, which may be thus stated:-- 'All the human 
          inhabitants of any one country should have equal rights and liberties 
          before the law; women are human beings; therefore they should have votes 
          as well as men.' It matters not to me whether ten millions or only ten 
          claim it--the right and the liberty should exist, even if they do not 
          use it. The term 'Liberal' does not apply to those who refuse this natural

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on eugenics . . .]<i> &quot;. . . The theory propounded 
          by Malthus is the greatest of all delusions. As man develops towards 
          a higher type; as he becomes more refined and more civilised, so his 
          fecundity decreases. Low down in the scale of life, birth is only limited 
          by available sustenance. But the higher grows the type, the less is 
          the fecundity. This is true, not only of ascending types in the evolutionary 
          scale, but it is also true of ascending man. The fecundity of the slums 
          is much greater than that of Mayfair. As man progresses in comfort and 
          refinement, he tends to have fewer progeny; as witness the millions 
          of India and China, compared with the almost stationary population of 
          England, and the declining native population of France. Besides, if 
          young people continued at school until the age of twenty-five, early 
          marriages would be discountenanced, for public opinion would not tolerate 
          marriage during the educational period.</i>
        </p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you must not dream that I approve of any 
          of the modern eugenic heresies that are now being advocated. I feel 
          a little sore on this point because in a popular scientific publication 
          that has just been sent to me, I am referred to as spending the evening 
          of my days in furthering the teaching of eugenics. Wherever did I advocate 
          any such preposterous theories? Not a reference to any of my writings; 
          not a word is quoted in justification of this scientific libel. Where 
          can they put their finger on any statement of mine that as much as lends 
          colour to such an assertion? Why, never by word or deed have I given 
          the slightest countenance to eugenics. Segregation of the unfit, indeed! 
          It is a mere excuse for establishing a medical tyranny. And we have 
          enough of this kind of tyranny already . . .&quot;</i>

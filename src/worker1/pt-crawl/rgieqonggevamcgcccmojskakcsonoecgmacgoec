<p class="lq">And  then  there  was  by  far  the  most  important  and 
valuable  draughtsman  of  the  quartette [of early <span class="lqperiodical">Punch</span> cartoonists] — William  Newman. He  had  a  greater  sense  of  beauty 
and  a  more  refined  touch  than  most  of  his  colleagues; 
and  though  he  did  not  shine  as  a  satirist,  he  was  always 
well  in  the  spirit  of  <span class="lqperiodical">Punch</span>. - Marion Spielmann, p. 413</p>

<p class="lq">His cartooning style was
going out of fashion in Britain, where periodicals were becoming more
dignified as they adapted to the tastes of a growing middle-class. During the winter of 1860, however, underemployed but with a wife and,by now, seven children all under the age of 15, he was thrown a lifeline. He was offered the position of chief cartoonist for a new humor magazine, to be called <span class="lqperiodical">Momus</span> [and published in America]. - Jane E. Brown and Richard Samuel West, p. 158</p>

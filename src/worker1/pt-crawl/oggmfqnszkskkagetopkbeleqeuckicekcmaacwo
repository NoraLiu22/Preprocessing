                            Zentralblatt MATH (zbMATH&nbsp;Open) is the world’s most comprehensive and

                            applied mathematics. For general information on the database and
                            its history see our <a href="/about/">About page</a> and in

                            zbMATH&nbsp;Open is much more than a common search engine.<br>
                            First of all, its functionalities and algorithms are strictly
                            focused on mathematics and its applications, allowing for
                            systematic queries yielding higher precision, accuracy and
                            integrity while searching for mathematical content. zbMATH&nbsp;Open offers
                            various filters, cross-links and special search fields relevant for
                            mathematics, e.g. for formulae.<br>
                            Secondly, zbMATH&nbsp;Open provides additional reviews summarising and
                            evaluating the content and the quality of an article or book from a
                            neutral point of view. We also provide additional descriptors such
                            as the matching MSC (Mathematics Subject Classification)
                            categories and suitable keywords for every document.<br>
                            Thirdly, errata and retracted articles remain in the database
                            making it possible to track the development of scientific
                            debates.<br>
                            Therefore you will find only scientifically relevant, peer-reviewed
                            mathematical content (including bibliographic data for material not
                            available online), making zbMATH&nbsp;Open the most comprehensive
                            mathematical database in the world. For documents available online
                            we provide full-text linking.

                            The zbMATH&nbsp;Open database contains around 5&nbsp;million bibliographic
                            entries from all areas of
                            pure mathematics as well as applications, in particular to the
                            natural sciences, computer science, economics and engineering.<br>
                            A paper or book is relevant to zbMATH&nbsp;Open if it either contributes to
                            mathematical theory, deals with mathematical problems, or applies
                            advanced mathematical techniques.<br>
                            The coverage starts in 1826 and is complete from 1868 to the
                            present by the integration of the
                            <a href="/?db=jfm">“Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik” database</a>.
                            Since 2024 preprints from a subset of the arXiv are displayed on zbMATH&nbsp;Open,

                            zbMATH&nbsp;Open is updated daily with new bibliographic data and abstracts.
                            New issues of major journals are included at the latest within 3
                            months after publication and regularly even sooner.<br>
                            Reviews are also updated on a daily basis after initial editorial
                            work has been carried out. The final editorial work on reviews and
                            abstracts is subsequently done as quickly as possible.

                            Journals to be indexed, either cover-to-cover or in parts, are
                            selected by the editor-in-chief, together with the
                            <a href="/about/#id_2">editorial board</a>.
                            Publishers who would like their journals to be indexed in zbMATH&nbsp;Open
                            are encouraged to contact our journal administration using our
                            <a href="/contact/">Contact Form</a>.
                            Provided that the suggested journal falls within the
                            <a href="/about/#id_1_1">scope of zbMATH&nbsp;Open</a>, our staff will
                            contact the publisher for the arrangement of a suitable data
                            delivery procedure.<br>
                            Since a journal's scope and content may evolve, there is of course a
                            possibility that a reconsideration may uncover new aspects and lead to
                            different results. Hence we regularly review previous positive indexing
                            decisions as well as reconsider indexing requests for journals that were
                            declined in the past.<br>
                            However, experience teaches us that significant changes only happen
                            during longer time periods, usually related to developments in the
                            journal's policy, community, and/or editorial board. Hence, in case
                            a journal was not accepted for indexing in the past, a resubmission
                            after a short time does not appear reasonable, and we may choose not
                            to answer every single request in the case of frequent resubmissions,
                            but reserve the right to internally define a more appropriate period
                            for reconsideration.<br>

                            The zbMATH&nbsp;Open database is the consequent
                            transition of the printed
                            <strong>Zentralblatt für Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete</strong>
                            into the digital age. In 1996 we started to offer
                            all services online under the name zbMATH in
                            addition to the printed edition. Since then we
                            worked also on the digitisation and incorporation
                            of the printed volumes in the database now dating
                            back to 1826.<br>
                            The production of the printed volumes was finally
                            discontinued in 2013 reflecting the altered demands
                            of the mathematical community and in order to
                            concentrate on the enhancement of our online
                            services.<br>
                            Since January 2021, the database is available open
                            access under the name zbMATH&nbsp;Open. Please see also

                            Simply start searching zbMATH&nbsp;Open using the one-line search and filter
                            the results afterwards using the drop-down menus. If you want to
                            clear the search field, just click on the chosen search tab
                            again. For an explanation of the possible search fields and
                            operators you can always refer to the Help Summary available by
                            clicking the <strong>Help</strong> button or to the
                            <a href="/general-help/">general help page</a>.<br>
                            Alternatively, you may employ the <strong>Structured
                            Search</strong> which offers a convenient query mask combining
                            all benefits of the one-line search and the formula search.

                            To quickly identify the Zbl number of publications, e.g., from a
                            list of references, the
                            <a href="https://zbmath.org/citationmatching/">citation matching tool zbMATcH</a>
                            is the easiest way. Apart from classical queries using author,
                            title, and other fields, one also has the option to just put a raw
                            reference string (possibly also containing typos and unusual
                            reference formats) into the first field. A fuzzy search will return
                            the zbMATH&nbsp;Open result closest to the input, if a minimum score of
                            similarity is achieved. For bibtex snippets or files you may use
                            the <a href="https://zbmath.org/citationmatching/bibtex">BibTeX interface</a>.

                            At zbMATH&nbsp;Open we pursue two parallel strategies to improve the unambiguous identification of authors. We apply an algorithm mainly based on the analysis of co-author collaboration and the pattern of publishing activity.<br>
                            Since 2015, an integration of several related services, such as the Mathematics Genealogy Project (MGP), Wikidata or ORCID, allows our algorithm to improve the time consistency of the authorship assignments.<br>
                            Additionally, since 2014 we offer an easy-to-use author disambiguation interface. This tool allows you to edit any author profile and to correct and/or complete the authorship assignments performed by the algorithm. We are constantly working on improvements of the algorithm and the revision of the legacy data.

Please help us to improve zbMATH&nbsp;Open by confirming or excluding documents from an author profile, merging two or more author profiles into one, including author identifiers like ORCID etc. or writing further suggestions to our author disambiguation team.<br>
                            Editing an author profile requires nothing but a valid email address. You may use the Author Disambiguation Interface which you reach via the Edit Profile button on each profile page. Every user request will be thoroughly checked by our team.

                            there are two main factors for a paper's delayed addition to the database.
                            There might be a delay in delivery of bibliographic data by the publisher.
                            The selection process for sources which contain only a fraction of
                            mathematical documents may also require additional time.<br>
                            An arXiv entry might be missing because it is not in one of the
                            subcategories which are displayed at zbMATH&nbsp;Open. Furthermore, arXiv preprints
                            are assigned to author profiles using our author disambiguation
                            framework. However, due to a larger number of errors in their metadata
                            compared to the published corpus, the assignments are less accurate
                            than for published articles.<br>
                            However, if you can not find your latest article
                            even though it matches the criteria of zbMATH&nbsp;Open

                            For the articles in about 600 journals, lists of references are delivered, with links to their zbMATH&nbsp;Open entries as well as their electronic versions via Document Object Identifier (DOI).<br>
                            It is one of our current main projects to improve and broaden the inclusion of references. Currently more than 1.75&nbsp;million entries contain references.

                            Citation counts in zbMATH&nbsp;Open are sometimes lower than those provided by other services. Firstly, zbMATH&nbsp;Open is focused on peer-reviewed, mathematical research contributions only, so references from journals outside our scope or from preprints are not counted. Secondly, the author disambiguation excludes falsely contributed documents from the analysis.<br>
                            Due to this high data quality and the comprehensive coverage of the world's mathematical literature the citation numbers provided by zbMATH&nbsp;Open very reliably reflect the specific impact of your research within the mathematical community.<br>
                            Moreover, our reference recognition is continuously being improved. Currently zbMATH&nbsp;Open has more than 22&nbsp;million linked references.

                        To determine the Erdős number of an author, or the collaboration distance between any two authors, use the link "Co-Author Distance" available in every author profile. You can also use the <a href="/collaboration-distance/">direct link to the Collaboration Distance interface</a>.

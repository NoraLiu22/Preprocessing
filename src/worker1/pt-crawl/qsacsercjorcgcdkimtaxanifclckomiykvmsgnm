</span></p>

<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">According to her son, there were two acts to
the life of Anita Pallenberg, but only one of them, apparently, is worth
discussing in any depth. That's the takeaway of <i>Catching Fire: The Story of
Anita Pallenberg</i>, which dissects the more famous/infamous, wild, and
dramatic part of Pallenberg's life in meticulous, sometimes gossipy detail. The
second part, which isn't nearly as sensationalistic, registers as an
afterthought here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">That's disappointing, if to be expected, since
people are generally more fascinated by what celebrities get up to in their
private lives when it's not the mundane things of everyday life. Some famous
folks can transcend that morbid curiosity with matters like love affairs, drug
use, and running from the law. If the unpublished autobiography that serves as
the foundation of this movie is any indication, Pallenberg, who died in 2017 at
the age of 75, might have been such a candidate. One doesn't write such a tome
without some distance, a lot of self-reflection, and good amount of
self-awareness of how far one has come.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The strangest element of this documentary,
though, is how directors Alexis Bloom and Svetlana Zill don't seem to fully
trust their subject's own words about, perspective of, and outlook on her own
life. It's all there, apparently, in that manuscript, which was found by
Pallenberg's children following her death among various documents. The content
of the text is certainly enough reason to hire Scarlett Johansson to recite
Pallenberg's words, offering a first-person perspective on her life as a muse to
the Rolling Stones and a romantic partner to two of the band's founding members.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">One of them is Keith Richards, who's still
alive and kicking and performing (At one point, Pallenberg notes that the
guitarist told her he believes he'll die on stage). The lead six-stringer of the
Stones is the father of three children with Pallenberg, and two of them are
still alive. Richards and those children, both adults and clearly still
wrestling with their upbringing to rock-and-roll parents, are narrators here,
too. The kids appear on camera, but Richards only shows up by way of his voice
and plenty of archival footage. Based on the testimony of the children and
Pallenberg, that's appropriate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Does the movie need them? That's a question it
shouldn't have to answer, because all of these accounts should provide some idea
of who Pallenberg was, what she did, and why she's still a figure of some
notoriety and a bit of mystery within this particular realm of pop culture. They
do, to be sure, but considering the fact that the documentary lingers so long on
the particulars of the subject's tumultuous life during the 1960s and '70s, the
multiple narrators start to feel like a way of getting as many juicy details as
possible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Obviously, there are a lot of those details.
Pallenberg's childhood, for example, passes by in a breeze, as the rebellious
child of a well-to-do family, who was born during World War II, dropped out of
high school and left home to pursue a modeling and acting career, and, after
spending some time among the New York City art scene, ended up in close
proximity to the Stones.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">At first, she was with Brian Jones, who
officially started the rock band, and while the two of them seemed in love,
drugs and his violent tendencies pushed Pallenberg away and toward Richards,
while it resulted in his death in 1969 at the sinisterly legendary age of 27.
Pallenberg herself offers one view, while Richards and singer Marianne Faithfull,
who was dating Stones frontman Mick Jagger at the time, have another. They're
all pretty much the same, really, and the filmmakers don't seem realize that the
same story told over and over again doesn't gain some power in the repetition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">That's essentially the problem with the whole
documentary, which becomes redundant in its anecdotes. It's not entirely the
filmmakers' fault, since much of Pallenberg's life during this period amounted
to difficult (to put it mildly) relationships, rumors and gossip (especially
after she starred in a movie with Jagger that involved plenty of sex and
nudity), drug use, attempted sobriety, and, after the band gets in trouble for
drugs and tax questions, basically living on the lam. The children's perspective
is unique, at least, once they're able to discuss the effects of such a
lifestyle on their own lives, but eventually, Pallenberg's own words fall away
to other people explaining or supposing what things must have been like for her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It all feels salacious in a way that doesn't
offer much insight and definitely bypasses the bulk of Pallenberg's life as soon
as, after seeing too many people die and blaming herself for those deaths in
some way, she did change her lifestyle. <i>Catching Fire: The Story of Anita
Pallenberg</i> treats that second act of her life as an epilogue of sorts,
instead of a key component of her biography and who she might have been
following the rock-and-roll days. We have to imagine that, because the movie
doesn't seem interested.</font>

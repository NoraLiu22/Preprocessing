    <td colspan="2">The idea of pairing Jet Li and Jason Statham together in an action movie sounds fantastic.&nbsp; <em>War</em> is just the opposite.&nbsp; It is dull, cliched, stupid, and takes itself so seriously that it falls into parody.&nbsp; The main problem (saying a lot with this film) is in its two principals.&nbsp; They are playing the wrong characters.&nbsp; Li (<a href="jet_lis_fearless.html"><em>Fearless</em></a>, <a href="unleashed.html"><em>Unleashed</em></a>) is Rogue, the world's best assassin, who is caught in the middle of a war in San Francisco between the Yakuza and the Triads (for those who don't know, that's Japanese organized crime versus Chinese organized crime).&nbsp; Statham (<a href="crank.html"><em>Crank</em></a>, <a href="pink_panther.html"><em>The Pink Panther</em></a>) is Jack Crawford, a FBI Agent trying to track Rogue down for personal reasons.&nbsp; Li is the bad guy, and Statham is the good guy.&nbsp; Li always played the good guy in his Chinese movies.&nbsp; When he made his play at being an American star, he tried branching out.&nbsp; This has not worked, as he typically does not make a convincing antagonist.&nbsp; The only time he did was in <em>Lethal Weapon 4</em>.&nbsp; Worse, he claims that he retired from making martial arts movies, so <em>War</em> has very few martial arts action sequences.&nbsp; Li has always been a better fighter than an actor, which leaves the audience watching a bad actor play an unconvincing villain.&nbsp; Statham fares a bit better.&nbsp; He works best as a bad guy, or as a good guy with some bad streaks.&nbsp; He is more along the lines of the latter here, but the lines and backstory given to his character are so loopy that he too is unconvincing. <br>
<br>
The concept of a war amongst Asian organized crime is fantastic, but again, the idea falters.&nbsp; Director Philip G. Atwell and writers Lee Anthony Smith and Gregory J. Bradley choose to tell this story through the Caldwell character.&nbsp; In an extended prologue that takes place three years ago, Caldwell and his partner nearly catch Rogue.&nbsp; Days later, as an act of retribution, Rogue murders his partner and his partner's family.&nbsp; This severely affects Caldwell, who now dedicates most of his passion towards finding and killing Rogue.&nbsp; Lucky for him that suddenly reappears.&nbsp; He has forsaken the Yakuza and is now working for Chang (John Lone, <em>Paper Moon</em>, <em>Bamboo Shoot</em>), leader of the Triad in San Francisco.&nbsp; Rogue is actually playing both sides, inciting some of the more volatile underlings to fight and kill off each other.&nbsp; Caldwell mopes a lot and tries to get into Rogues head, but Rogue always manages to stay two steps ahead of him.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<em>War</em> soon descends into action movie dim-wittedness.&nbsp; It is pretty pathetic when the most memorable scene in the film is one of completely gratuitous nudity (that's Meghan Flather, by the way).&nbsp; Everything else is dumb and forgettable.&nbsp; For the world's best assassin, Rogue sure is sloppy.&nbsp; A plot twist late in the film tries to explain away the film and provide a eureka moment to filmgoers, but does just the opposite.&nbsp; It muddles the film even further.&nbsp; Atwell spends most of the movie setting up a final explosive confrontation between Rogue and Caldwell, and when it finally happens, it's a huge let down.&nbsp;</td>

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.1">1</A> There are many indications that the Octavian family was in days of old a distinguished one at Velitrae; for not only was a street in the most frequented part of town long ago called Octavian, but an altar was shown there besides, consecrated by an Octavius. This man was leader in a war with a neighbouring town, and when news of a sudden onset of the enemy was brought to him just as he chanced to be sacrificing to Mars, he snatched the inwards of the victim from the fire and offered them up half raw; and thus he went forth to battle, and returned victorious. There was, besides, a decree of the people on record, providing that for the future too the inwards should be offered to Mars in the same way, and the rest of the victims be handed over to the Octavii.

For it is recorded in the proceedings of the senate, that when Gaius Laetorius, a young man of patrician family, was pleading for a milder punishment for adultery because of his youth and position, he further urged upon the senators that he was the possessor and as it were the warden of the spot which the deified Augustus first touched at his birth, begged that he be pardoned for the sake of what might be called his own special god. Whereupon it was decreed that that part of his house should be consecrated.

For when a new owner, either by chance or to test the matter, went to bed in that room, it came to pass that, after a very few hours of the night, he was thrown out by a sudden mysterious force, and was found bedclothes and all half-dead before the door.

When his uncle presently went to Spain to engage the sons of Pompey, although Augustus had hardly yet recovered his strength after a severe illness, he followed over roads beset by the enemy with only a very few companions, and that too after suffering shipwreck, and thereby greatly endeared himself to Caesar, who soon formed a high opinion of his character over and above the energy with which he had made the journey.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.2">2</A> When Caesar, after recovering the Spanish provinces, planned an expedition against the Dacians and then against the Parthians, Augustus, who had been sent on in advance to Apollonia, devoted his leisure to study. As soon as he learned that his uncle had been slain and that he was his heir, he was in doubt for some time whether to appeal to the nearest legions, but gave up the idea as hasty and premature. He did, however, return to the city and enter upon his inheritance, in spite of the doubts of his mother and the strong opposition of his stepfather, the <SPAN CLASS="whole">ex-consul</SPAN> Marcius Philippus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.3">3</A> Then he levied armies and henceforth ruled the State, at first with Marcus Antonius and Marcus Lepidus, then with Antony alone for nearly twelve years, and finally by himself for <SPAN CLASS="whole">forty-four</SPAN>.

As Hirtius lost his life in battle during this war, and Pansa shortly afterwards from a wound, the rumour spread that he had caused the death of both, in order that after Antony had been put to flight and the state bereft of its consuls, he might gain sole control of the victorious armies. The circumstances of Pansa's death in particular were so mysterious, that the physician Glyco was imprisoned on the charge of having applied poison to his wound. Aquilius Niger adds to this that Augustus himself slew the other consul Hirtius amid the confusion of the battle.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.1">1</A> The Sicilian war was among the first that he began, but it was long drawn out by many interruptions, now for the purpose of rebuilding his fleets, which he twice lost by shipwreck due to storms, and that, too, in the summer; and again by making peace at the demand of the people, when supplies were cut off and there was a severe famine. Finally, after new ships had been built and twenty thousand slaves set free and trained as oarsmen, he made the Julian harbour at Baiae by letting the sea into the Lucrine lake and lake Avernus. After drilling his forces there all winter, he defeated Pompey between Mylae and Naulochus, though just before the battle he was suddenly held fast by so deep a sleep that his friends had to awaken him to give the signal. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.2">2</A> And it was this, I think, that gave Antony opportunity for the taunt: "He could not even look with steady eyes at the fleet when it was ready for battle, but lay in a stupor on his back, looking up at the sky, and did not rise or appear before the soldiers until the enemy's ships had been put to flight by Marcus Agrippa." Some censured an act and saying of his, declaring that when his fleets were lost in the storm, he cried out, "I will have the victory spite of<!-- sic: and this is in fact good usage, if antiquated --> Neptune," and that on the day when games in the Circus next occurred, he removed the statue of the god from the sacred procession. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.3">3</A> And it is safe to say that in none of his wars did he encounter more dangers or greater ones. For when he had transported an army to Sicily and was on his way back to the rest of his forces on the mainland, he was surprised by Pompey's admirals Demochares and Apollophanes and barely escaped with but a single ship. Again, as he was going on foot to Regium by


<A ID="p145"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p145 </SPAN></A>way of Locri, he saw some of Pompey's biremes coasting along the shore, and taking them for his own ships and going down to the beach, narrowly escaped capture. At that same time, too, as he was making his escape by narrow bypaths, a slave of his companion Aemilius Paulus, nursing a grudge because Augustus had proscribed his master's father some time before, and thinking that he had an opportunity for revenge, attempted to slay him.

In both places a part of his galleys were sunk, while the rigging of the ship in which he was sailing was carried away and its rudder broken. He delayed at Brundisium only <SPAN CLASS="whole">twenty-seven</SPAN> days — just long enough to satisfy all the demands of the soldiers — and then went to Egypt by a roundabout way through Asia and Syria, laid siege to Alexandria, where Antony had taken refuge with Cleopatra, and soon took the city. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.4">4</A> Although Antony tried to make terms at the eleventh hour, Augustus forced him to commit suicide, and viewed his corpse. He greatly desired to save Cleopatra alive for his triumph, and even had Psylli brought to her, to suck the poison from her wound, since it was thought that she had died from the bite of an asp. He allowed them both the honour of burial, and in the same tomb, giving orders that the mausoleum which they had begun should be finished. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.5">5</A> The young Antony, the elder of Fulvia's two sons, he dragged from the image of the Deified Julius, to which he had fled after many vain entreaties, and slew him. Caesarion, too, whom Cleopatra fathered on Caesar, he overtook in his flight, brought back, and put to death. But he spared the rest of the offspring of Antony and Cleopatra, and afterwards maintained and reared them according to their several positions, as carefully as if they were his own kin.

At this the guests appeared in the guise of gods and goddesses, while he himself was made up to represent Apollo, as was charged not merely in letters of Antony, who spitefully gives the names of all the guests, but also in these anonymous lines, which everyone knows:

He was criticized too as over fond of costly furniture and Corinthian bronzes and as given to gaming. Indeed, as early as the time of the proscriptions there was written on his statue —

The 23rd of September was Augustus's birthdate in the calendar of the time. It was, however, out of whack with the seasons, as is proved by the frequent statement in ancient authors that his birth sign was Capricorn; some modern writers state that Capricorn was the sign under which he was conceived.

This note received from Prof. John D. Morgan at the University of Delaware:

<DIV CLASS="prose">
	<P>
There's a foolish error in the Loeb translation of Suetonius, D. Aug. 19.1:

<DIV CLASS="prose">

also Asinius Epicadus, a half-breed of Parthian descent, . . .
</DIV>

	<P CLASS="justify">
The corresponding Latin is

<DIV CLASS="Latin prose">
	<P>
item Asini Epicadi ex gente Parthina hybridae, . . .

	<P CLASS="justify">
'<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">Parthina</SPAN>' means not 'Parthian' but 'of the Parthini', the Illyrian tribe over which Asinius Pollio had celebrated his triumph in 39 <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN>

	<P CLASS="justify">
This is a bad enough mistake that you might want to violate your usual policy of not correcting errors in your sources.
</DIV>

	<P CLASS="justify">
This mistake is probably not one I would have caught on my own — and when putting up translations I don't check them systematically against the original — but Loeb translations are often not the best and do fall into just this kind of foolish error, and the Lewis &amp; Short so defines <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">Parthinus</SPAN> (although it too, like all of us, falls into the occasional error) so I've gratefully incorporated Dr. Morgan's correction.

It wasn't much of a confusion, nor consequently of a restoration. There had been a communication problem, a translation error between the Greek astronomer who had done the calculations, and the bureaucrats who implemented it: "every fourth year" for the leap years had been understood by the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Latin-speakers</SPAN> as meaning "every third year", since Latin counts inclusively but Greek, as we do today, exclusively. If continued, this would have put the calendar off by a cumulative systematic error of one day every twelve years.

Augustus ordered that the intercalation be set right to one day every fourth year, and that some leap years be skipped to make up for the extra days since 45 <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN> Historians looking for exact dates in Augustus' reign thus need to take into account this slippage and its correction; their task is complicated by our not knowing exactly when the error was caught: see Chris Bennett's very probable solution in

Crucifixions, which appear to have been quite frequent, were carried out along the public roads into the city; the connection, very likely, is not so much one of participating in the prince's mercy, but a cosmetic desire that his eyes should not see these brutal executions. (I cannot avoid being reminded of the firm custom, in the area around Assisi, of not hunting on the feast day of St. Francis.)

<H2>Red Dragon (2002)</H2>

<P>D: Brett Ratner<BR>
S: Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton</P>

<P>...and hello again, Hannibal.</P>

<P>A terrific cast buoys a basic rendering of Thomas Harris' novel. This
is the second time out for this story, filmed previously in 1986 as <I>Manhunter</I>.
This version comes in the cinematic wake of <I>Silence of the Lambs</I>
and <A HREF="h.htm"><I>Hannibal</I> </A>though, so its selling point is
not Harris' twisted journey through the psychological congruences between
pursuer and pursued, but the return of Anthony Hopkins to his Oscar-winning
role as Hannibal Lecter. In <I>Manhunter</I>, Brian Cox played the good
doctor as a spiteful character framed by a clinical environment which contained
and seemed to oppress him with its whiteness. In keeping with the design
conceits established by <I>Silence of the Lambs</I>, Hopkins appears in
his familiar neo-medieval dungeon, and the actor more or less retreads his
steps from the previous two movies (with maybe a small edge to it suggesting
a less serene and controlled character).</P>

<P>Already the problem with the film should be obvious from the structure
of this review. The story of this film involves retired FBI agent Edward
Norton (<I><A HREF="fclub.htm">Fight Club</A></I>) tracking down sicko Ralph
Fiennes (<I><A HREF="eng.htm">The English Patient</A></I>) by attempting
to understand how he thinks. The subtle slippage of identity and the sense
of a growing contradictory feeling of revulsion and sympathy in our own
identification with both hero and villain is what makes it disturbing, and
what sold both the book and the first filmic adaptation. This story element
is given further weight by the addition of a most unusual supporting character,
a love interest for the villain, in this film a blind photolab technician
played by Emily Watson. Even as he is being pursued, the killer may be about
to stop what he is doing because he seems to have found kindness and compassion
strong enough to overcome his psychosis. There are many interesting elements
here, but the problem is that even the first paragraph of this review was
focused on Hannibal Lecter, and that is where the attention of the audience
is forcibly drawn by scriptwriter Ted Tally (<I>Silence of the Lambs</I>)
and director Brett Ratner (<I><A HREF="rh.htm">Rush Hour</A></I>).</P>

<P>Lecter has become a bogeyman figure of Freddy Kruger-like dimensions
by now, especially when portrayed by Hopkins. His Oscar for Best Actor (for
what was essentially a supporting role) triggered the wacky sequel (in which
even Harris seemed to treat the character with self-parodic contempt), and
has now reflected back upon this redraft of the original story. Inserting
a couple of additional Lecter scenes, most notably a prelude and coda, Tally
essentially shifts the focus away from its central characters and onto the
crowd-pleasing antics of the real moneyspinner. Lecter is now the epitome
of contemporary evil, an erudite, educated man whose contempt for humanity
runs so deep that he eats his victims. Of course we see almost none of that,
not this time. The audience is instead treated to teasing gags and patrician
<I>bon mots</I> though which they get to share his 'superiority' for a brief
while. Red Dragon gives the audience what they want, plenty of Lecter; more
of him than there really should be. The misdirection hurts the storytelling,
and it is testament to the skill of the cast that the film works as well
as it does on a genre level. </P>

<P>Norton is very good in the role of the tortured FBI man driven by his
own brilliant mind into places he would much rather not inhabit, even temporarily.
His sunken looks and precise, no-nonsense delivery of by now too familiar
jargonesque dialogue carry the character a long way, although he is hamstrung
by the script. Amazingly for an actor of his calibre, Norton does not erase
the memory of William Petersen in <I>Manhunter</I>, whose torment seemed
more vivid perhaps because in that case the director was telling the story
more or less as written. Hopkins, as noted, does a slight variant on his
original characterisation, but in his case the direction seems to sell him
short. Unsure of whether to be Jonathan Demme or Ridley Scott, Ratner hovers
between them. He tries to emulate Demme's disturbing use of mid shot and
POV in Silence of the <I>Lambs</I>, but also tries for the florid aestheticism
of Scott's coldly luxuriant camera work in <I>Hannibal</I>.</P>

<P>The film is not so much without style as without a coherent style, and
it fares worst when it pushes hardest (such as a tracking shot into Fiennes'
cavernous Norman Bates style mansion accompanied by Danny Elfman's unsuitably
bombastic score, or a series of rapid cutaways to gruesome images intended
to shock but usually just breaking the tension generated by the actors).
Philip Seymour Hoffman is particularly hard done by in the role of a sleazy
journalist called upon to 'bear witness' to the killer's fantasy. Hoffman's
performance is undone by camera work which barely allows the audience to
see what he is doing.</P>

<P>Watson (<I><A HREF="haj.htm">Hilary and Jackie</A></I>) is also good
in support, making a believable stab at showing her character's tentative
courtship of the man she thinks is just a little quiet and misunderstood.
Again though, with the audience presumed to be restless without Lecter action,
the film insists on cutting away to miscellaneous scenes featuring Hopkins
which do nothing to advance the portrayal of this all-important relationship.
The film is further weakened by the lack of chemistry between Watson and
Fiennes. For his part, Fiennes seems a little too stiff to suggest change
of any kind, and not just from loner to nutcase, but the more subversive
suggestion of change from nutcase to relative normalcy (his psychosis given).
When an actor immerses themselves in subtlety to a point where nothing registers
at all, there is only the superficial to hang onto. On this level, he makes
a fairly formidable killer, but without the necessary support from the script
which the character warrants, he cannot withstand the Lecter factor. Harvey
Kietel rounds out the major cast with a solid performance (Frankie Faison
gets to play a part again (not Barney, funnily enough), but he's barely
there). Anthony Heald gets to reprise his role as Lecter's 'old friend',
Dr. Chilton.</P>

<P><I>Red Dragon</I> is not without interesting elements. Tally can tell
a meaningful story and Ratner can render it with serviceable pictures. But
the bowing and scraping to audience expectation that has evidently informed
this reworking of the novel has not done anyone involved very much of a
service, even Hopkins. It is a pleasure to see such a strong cast working
hard, but the imbalances and disconnections in the script add up, culminating
in the abrupt climax which is anticlimactic precisely because the film has
not shown enough interest in the characters involved in it. The coda is
amusing in a 'nod and a wink' kind of way, but doesn't really make much
sense from the point of view of chronology and merely drives home the final
nail in the conviction that this film is a tease for a better film which
has already been made and didn't need any more advertising. I suppose in
Hollywood's terms, you can never have enough advertising though, so here
you have it, a feature length pre-sell for a product already in the market.
Hmmm. Scary. The scariest thing about it though is that because this is
now the 'latest' Lecter adventure, the franchise has been reactivated. The
peculiarities of <I>Hannibal</I> might have been enough to 'kill off' the
character had they been allowed to stand. This more routine adventure might
prove a prelude not just to features already made, but packages already
in pitch. </P>

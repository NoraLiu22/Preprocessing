<p>The Gallery team has decided to take a step back from actively maintaining this project. Truth be told, most of the core team got busy with their lives over the past few years and we haven't had the time to really actively maintain the project in a long time. The forums have continued to be lively and helpful and there is still plenty of good conversation there - but no new code has been written in the past 6 months and that's not likely to change.</p>
<p>So after over 14 years, 3 major revisions of the project, many tens of releases, hundreds of contributors, tens of thousands of lines of code, almost a hundred thousand forum topics and almost four hundred thousand comments, it's time for us to shutter up shop.</p>
<p>Why not just leave the site up and operational? Unfortunately - it takes time to actively maintain and police our site. The Gallery website is constantly under attack by spammers and our servers require maintenance. We've been doing that for years, but it's time to call it quits.</p>
<p>So what's next? Sometime soon we'll make the website read only. All the forum posts and topics will still be there, but we'll stop letting people log in and add new content. This will greatly prevent the spread of spam through the site while still allowing search engines to find useful content. Then we'll put the whole site into a very low-overhead maintenance mode until we run out of money to keep it up. Then we'll shut the site down.</p>
<p>While the site is hibernating, some systems will continue to work. You'll be able to download translations for Gallery 3, for example. But at some point we'll stop accepting translation uploads. And when we run out of money, translations will go away. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>It's been a great ride. I'm glad that you could join us with it. But now it's time to move on.</p>
<p>regards,<br />
Bharat</p>
<p>PS: If you're interested in taking over the project - email me and we can talk. You need to be serious about it though because I'm not handing this over to somebody who just wants to use it for SEO purposes. My email address is easy to find. Also, I won't be reading private messages.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it takes more than just money to keep a project like this going. There is a really big time commitment as well.  I've been working on the project for 13 years, and can tell you that life just starts tossing too many balls into the air, and it's impossible to juggle them all. I think what Gallery needs more than money (it needs that too, for colo costs, etc), is an infusion of fresh, young blood; folks who are familiar not only with the application itself, but all the behind the scenes stuff, coding standards, etc that go along with it. And, most importantly, folks that are able and willing to make the not insignificant time commitment to keep the project rolling. </p>
<p>This project was a great one, introduced me to great people that I've had the pleasure of meeting in person, and taught me to dust off the old programming side of my brain, too. </p>

<p>If you are willing and able to take up the project, by all means, contact Bharat.  None of us were paid for our efforts, it was done on our free time, which for most of us, has disappeared (families, kids, etc).  </p>
<p>I understand your concern over security.  I don't think that there is any good answer to that which would satisfy all involved, but I don't want to put words in other developers mouths. </p>
<p>Enjoy Gallery for what it is: A great, roll-your-own photo gallery, with loads of modules and plug-ins, that is extremely customizable, developed and maintained by donated time from a group of developers who wanted something just a little bit better than what was available. </p>

    <p>Since he said there has been no new code written in 6 months I doubt 3.1 was close to release.  If it were close than I think they would of found a way to get it done.  3.1 was also suppose to have CMS integration at one point as well.</p>

    <p>Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!<br />
I have long been looking for a photo gallery, which may be exactly what Galllery3 can. I have been taking all what else is so, Joomla, WordPress, Drupal, Typo3, nothing similar found. Gallery3 is uniquely good for photo galleries. It's the best!<br />
Why did this idea to close it and do not offer? Perhaps you would find new ones. It is known to few believe how strong Gallery3 on the market. In Gallery3 puts a lot of power. Not everything is timely perfect as for smartphones, but otherwise it's very good. I would say it is unbeatable in the field CMS for photo galleries.</p>
<p>I have seen many Gallery3 and almost no one has the potential fully exploited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've encountered only in autumn 2013 Gallery3. Previously I had a pure HTML gallery with over 3000 photos, for over 5 years. This HTML gallery I had now set within half a year on Gallery3. Now she has over 7000 photos. I have very detailed description of the photos and albums. I have adapted very much in the Gallery3 manually, using the very good forum here. I have invested a lot of time in my Gallery3. And now the end? Fuuuuu ....<br />
Please do not!</p>

    <p>Oh no! Always been a big fan of Gallery. Thanks for the project and the effort over the years. I totally understand the time constraints and need to move on. Hopefully the project will be picked up by another competent team of coders with more time right now. There's nothing currently out there that provides the slick niche that Gallery 3 does... at least for me. I'd be really sorry to see it not wake up from hibernation. Someone poke the bear!</p>

    <p>Unfortunate but understandable.<br />
I was not putting much work myself lately into my code here so I can relate</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone involved in the project and wish them the best.<br />
Life goes on and without fresh blood in any project, things would die out</p>
<p>I will be trying Zenphoto and Piwigo to see if I should migrate my content and theme to one or another.</p>
<p>PS: I do understand the feeling but we need to realize that G3 has been stagnant (effectively in hibernation mode) for some time already - we are on an old Kohana core and not much of modern stuff was introduced in recent years etc.</p>
<p>While G3 is great and I have put a lot of time into it myself, a rewrite of the G3 core may not be doable at all.</p>
<p>If someone decides to pick it up and run with it, there would need to be some serious thinking put in up front or else, it would be just merely be another round of maintenance work and nothing new.</p>

    <p>I do have an available server to host a solution on. Although I've never delved into Drupal - I'm sure I could host a read only version to keep the old forums live, and maybe setup a new forum solution for new community interaction.<br />
We could host all files &amp; bug reporting on GIT and volunteers can handle fixing issues.</p>
<p>I'm still a G2 fanboy, and have minimal experience w/ G3, but if we can get a few dedicated enthusiasts I think this route would work.</p>

    <p>Man, I just suggested people sign up on Gallery based photo hosting websites and also pointed them here only to find out this might be the end of the greatest (no offense to the others!) of it's kind! I'm really hoping that some people come and pick it up. I can't imagine that this won't be continued or forked. Hopefully at least someone comes in and picks up any bug, security and compatibility maintenance for a long while. :/</p>
<p>This is one of those times I wish I could just throw money(pref. BTC) at something and that would make everything better. Haha. Especially considering I just began donating to my G2 based photo hosting site a few months ago. </p>

    <p>As a G1 -&gt; G2 -&gt; G3 user, this is disappointing but not a surprise - anyone who has peeked at the github repositories I'm sure could see the writing on the wall (and I had in fact anti-recommended G3 to a couple of people for this reason).</p>
<p>I'm sure everyone would be interested to hear tales, succesful or otherwise, of attempts to migrate to other software (piwigo, zenphoto, coppermine are some of the competitors that come to mind.  In particular, any tools people develop to move comments, tags, etc. would probably be appreciated.  Hopefully the forums and websites can limp along for a few more months at least.</p>

<p>Indeed, times have changed. the creator of PHP - Rasmus Lerdorf used Gallery. The founder developer of WordPress - Matt Mullenweg also used Gallery - both have since moved on. </p>
<p>I wonder if any core developers will continue using Gallery - or will be left to the community to keep alive.</p>
<p>Gallery 2.x still works with PHP 5.4.x - I guess I'll migrate all of my hosted multisites to something else once the hibernation kicks in, and nobody picks up the project.</p>

    <p>Well, you should be more accurate and simply state that you are terminating the gallery project and leaving downloads available until they become incompatible with future generation OSes and components, at which point users will have to find an alternate image hosting package.</p>

    <p>Of course people can use picasa, flickr and so on but there is a consideration to keep in mind - much like facebook, when you put your personal images on picasa or flickr they are no longer private, someone else has posession of them now. In days gone by you kept your photo albums on a shelf, it was yours and private - that is a benefit of gallery, install it on a server, place your images there, lock out browsing from strangers and once again it can keep your things private. There are pros and cons to gallery vs picasa/flickr etc.</p>

    <p>It's been a fun ride! I owe immeasurable gratitude to everyone on the G1 team for making me into a real software developer. I'd drifted away lately from maintaining my own Gallery as other social networks improved their photo support. It's the twilight of a glorious era.</p>

    <p>You can all blame me for this...</p>
<p>Whenever I find a product in a store and incorporate it into my life, loving it, wondering how I ever got along without it - it gets discontinued.  This ALWAYS happens...</p>
<p>There have been hints for many months, heck, maybe even longer to some degree that this eventuality would come to pass.  I just hoped I'd be wrong.  Kinda' wished I'd have kept those static HTML pages I used to work so hard at but abandoned for the ease and magic of Gallery.</p>
<p>As others have said, thanks for the efforts over the years.  But all good things must end.</p>

    <p>C'mon we have a large enough group of supporters to get the funding ball rolling.<br />
Lets pull it together, donate a little $ and possibly a Kickstarter or other crowd funded campaign.</p>
<p>Anyone in?</p>

    <p>@bwagner; I don't think you understand.  Money  is not the issue here.  Qualified developers that are willing to work on the project is what is lacking.  Money has never been a motivator to any of the previous contributors, including myself.</p>

<p>you would need to contact the owners of keithandnancyrose.com<br />
Although their site is running gallery software, we have no control over their site.</p>

    <p>I want to thank the whole team for this very very good gallery. My current account is allready more than 11,5 years old, and using gallery even longer..... While my systems from my web server where changing, gallery was always a hard condition that it would run on it. Currently it is running on a Synology. I understand the reason but......... As long if there is no good reason I will not leaving G3 and hoping someone will start it up again and go on with the good work........</p>
<p>PS the many hours which was spend in Gallery has reduced the time for ALL user for using it...... thnx thnx thnx thnx</p>

    <p>Thank you for the last 11 years in which I was a Gallery user.  Before y'all disappear, will someone recommend where we should all go?  Maybe someone make a big matrix of all the different photo programs--from your expert perspective?  Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_photo_gallery_software" class="bb-url" rel="nofollow">this wikipedia page</a>, but with the authority I project onto you guys?!</p>

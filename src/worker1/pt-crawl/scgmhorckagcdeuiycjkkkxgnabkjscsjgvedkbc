<p>
The <a href="/">British and Irish Legal Information
Institute</a> (BAILII) provides access to the most comprehensive set of
British and Irish primary legal materials that are available for free and in
one place on the internet. In
August 2019,
BAILII included
102 databases covering 10 jurisdictions
The system contains around
169 gigabytes
of legal materials and around
1,001,463
searchable documents.
<P>
BAILII is legally constituted in the UK as a company limited by
guarantee (No 4131252) and as a <A HREF="personnel.html#trustees">charitable 
trust</A> (registered charity no 1084803) and has been supported by a number of 
<A HREF="/bailii/donors.html">major donors</A> and is assisted by many
<A HREF="/support/others.html">other organisations and individuals</A>.
BAILII is hosted in the UK and Ireland by the Institute of Advanced Legal
Studies, London and the Law Faculty, University College Cork.
<P>
The databases on BAILII are derived from a number of sources. 
Some of the data comes from existing free to air sites. Most of the databases
are based on published and unpublished CD-ROMs or rely upon direct and indirect 
feeds by relevant courts,
government departments and other organisations.
All of the data have been converted into a consistent
format and a generalised set of search and hypertext facilities have been added. Further details as to where databases come from are provided on the database home pages. 
<P>
The software and approaches that are used on BAILII have been provided with the 
assistance of 
<A HREF="http://www.austlii.edu.au">AustLII</A> (the Australasian Legal Information Institute). 
<P>
<P>BAILII makes its website available on a subscription-free basis for the benefit of the public, including pro bono organisations, neighbourhood law centres, students and users in developing countries.  BAILII incurs substantial running costs in maintaining its database and website, and is dependent on a continuing flow of donations in order to remain in operation.  Commercial users of BAILII (including legal or other professionals, and publishers) and educational institutions are requested to make annual donations to BAILII in order to assist BAILII in meeting its running costs.  Ways to donate to BAILII, including online giving, are detailed at <a href="/bailii/appeal.html">the Appeal page</a>. BAILII's donors are listed here: <a href="/bailii/donors.html"> Major Donors </a>.</P>

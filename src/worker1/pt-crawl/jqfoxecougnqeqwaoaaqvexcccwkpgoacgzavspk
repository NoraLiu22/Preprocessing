<h2 align="center">WOMEN in Early Modern European SCIENCE:</h2>
<h2>Maria Agnesi, Laura Bassi, Caroline Herschel, Mary Winkelmann Kirch, and
Emilie du Chatelet.</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of time, women have played a vital role in the
understanding of scientific processes. It is scientific women through out the
centuries that have shaped our understanding of scientific technology.
Approximately half of the human race, being women, has been important to the
development of religion, agriculture and medicine. Even though the one way for
women scientists to make it into other fields was through the scientific
field of botany. A common theme I noticed in my research is that the historians
were beginning to acknowledge that women were capable of doing more than gender
defined activities, such as domestic duties and child rearing. Another
similarity among these scientific women was that they each had published an
important or famous work.</p>
<p>For four thousand years, women have worked side by side with the men in their
great quest for scientific knowledge and recognition. For example, these women
of the past should be included in the discussion of the present and the
future. The strength of this arguement depends on recognition of women such as
Maria Agnesi, Laura Bassi, Caroline Herschel, Mary Winkelmann Kirch, and Emilie
du Chatelet.</p>
<p>Maria Agnesi was a child prodigy who mastered Latin, Hebrew, and Greek by the
age of nine. She is by far the most important and extraordinary figure in
mathematics during the eighteenth century. She earned the chair for mathematics
early in her lifetime. Her most important work <u>Analytical Institutions</u>,
was meant only for her brother's use, however, ended up being the most clarified
authority on the subject of calculus.</p>
<p>Laura Bassi earned a degree, a lectureship, and a membership into the academy
in Italy because of her extensive work in the subject of physics. She made use
of the rewards and carved out a position for herself in the scientific community
of Bologna in Italy. She also strived to become the head chair- person of
Physics there as well. A great honor for this extraordinary female of science.
Another fascinating woman was Caroline Herschel. She was honored in every corner
of the European continent. One of her landmark achievements was that she became
the first woman recognized for her scientific contributions by a king. Her
importance to the field of astronomy was that she was the first woman to catalog
the existence of nebulae. Despite her mathematical deficiencies, she was a able
perform advanced calculations and publish the results. Another big break through
was when she discovered a comet. Another prestigious woman scientist to
accomplish this feat was Mary Winkelmann Kirch. She accomplished this feat in
1702.</p>
<p>The final prominent woman scientist that will be discussed is Emilie du
Chatelet. Like other mathematicians of this time she was a truly unique woman scholar and used her own algebraic formulas and commentaries in her
studies. Her most famous work is <u>Institutions de Physique</u>. She also
translated Newton's book,<u> Principia</u>, into the French language for her
community. Her contributions have helped shape the course of mathematics.</p>
<p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a number of women have
contributed enormously to the field of astronomy, mathematics, and physics. It
is only now that these women are gaining the respect and notoriety that they
deserve. If it was not for these scientific women there would not be college
courses devoted to the study of these women in science.</p>

<p>Abir-Am Pnina G. and Dorinda Outram. <i>Uneasy careers and Intimate Lives:
Douglass Series on Women's Lives and Meaning of Gender: Women in Science.</i>
New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1987.</p>
<p>This book develops the science from 1789-1979. The one field of science
concentrated on most is the field of botany. This is where many women scientists
got their start in science. Women have used this as a stepping stone into other
fields of science as well. A special emphasis is also put on the role in
educational field of science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ashby Ruth and Deborah Gore Ohrn. <i>Women Who Changed the World.</i> New
York: Penguin Books USA Inc., 1995.</p>
<p>This book really takes an in depth look at how women's roles have changed in
all types of work, including science. A special interest is paid in particular
to women scientists on the over all field. There are women of later times
mentioned here in the field of science as well including Maria Mitchell,
Florence Nightingale, and other women who helped shape the significant role
women play in science today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohen, H. Floris. <u><i>The Scientific Revolution A Historiographical
Inquiry.</i> </u>Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994.</p>
<p>This book deals with all the scientists mentioned in the paper.
However, it also talks about other fields that they have looked into and also
talks in depth about the books they each have published on their significant
discovery in the field of science. The book explores things in excellent order
and clarity and is a useful source for anything you need to know about women in
the field of science.</p>

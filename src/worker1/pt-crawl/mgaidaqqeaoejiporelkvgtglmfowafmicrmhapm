<h3>Charles Green's Artistic Output: 1862-1898</h3>
 
<p class="one">Charles Green was a leading member of the group of book illustrators who 
were then collectively known as "The New Men of the Sixties." He was also a noted 
water-colourist who became a member of the 
<a href="../../architecture/london/36.html">Royal Institute</a> in 1864 and a full member 
three years later, and the younger brother of illustrator 
<a href="../townleygreen/index.html">H. Towneley Green</a> (1836-99). By the time that 
Charles Green died at the age of fifty-eight in the artists' village of 
<a href="../../../places/cities/hampstead/index.html">Hampstead</a>, he had completed 
most of the lithographs for the Pears Centenary Edition of Dickens's 
<a href="../../../authors/dickens/xmas/index.html"><span class="book">The Christmas 
Books</span></a> (1843-48), well ahead of the publication of the five-volume series in 
1912. He seems to have died with the commission incomplete, leaving the volume <span 
class="book">The Cricket on the Hearth</span> unattempted; the publisher subsequently 
enlisted a foreign illustrator, Luigi Rossi, to provide the final twenty-two lithographs 
for the centenary project.</p>

<a href="../cricket/tpcricket.jpg">
<img src="../cricket/tpcricket.jpg" height="240" class="floatright"/></a>
<p>Green had established himself as a commercial illustrator after his early training at 
<a href="../../institutions/leigh.html">Heatherley's</a>. Green from the first proved 
himself a talented draughtsman, and worked alongside the lead artist, Whymper, at the 
illustrated London magazine <a href="../../../periodicals/onceaweek.html"><span 
class="book">Once a Week</span></a>. Green's illustrations appeared in such other 
popular, large-circulation periodicals as <span class="book">Cassel's</span> and 
<a href="../../../periodicals/graphic/graphic.html"><span class="book">The 
Graphic</span></a>. He is now chiefly remembered as a Dickens illustrator, having 
completed full programs for 
<a href="../../../authors/dickens/curiosityshopov.html"><span class="book">The Old 
Curiosity Shop</span></a> (1876: thirty-two wood-engravings), the Gadshill edition of 
<span class="book">Great Expectations</span> (1898: ten lithographs), <span 
class="book">A Christmas Carol</span> (1892: twenty-seven lithographs), <span 
class="book">The Battle of Life</span> (1893: twenty-nine lithographs), <span 
class="book">The Chimes</span> (1894: thirty lithographs), and <span class="book">The 
Haunted Man</span> (1895: thirty lithographs). Largely forgotten are his illustrations 
for the Rev. John Cumming's <span class="book">Life and Lessons of Our Lord: Unfolded and 
Illustrated</span> (1864), Isaac Watts' <span class="book">Divine and Moral Songs for 
Children</span>, and Walter Thornbury's <span class="book">Historical and Legendary 
Ballads and Songs</span> (1877), but still reproduced are such paintings in his "Scenes 
from Dickens" as <span class="illustration">Little Nell and Her Grandfather at the 
Races</span>, <span class="illustration">Barnaby Rudge and the Rioters</span>, and <span 
class="illustration">The Pickwick Club</span>. During his stay in London during the 
1870s, Impressionist painter Vincent Van Gogh expressed his admiration for the work of 
Charles Green above all other contemporary English illustrators. Christie's Auction House 
staged a final sale of the works of the Green brothers on 13 January 1900. </p>

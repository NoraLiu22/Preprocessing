<em>Working with MediaWiki</em> is the most up-to-date guide to <strong>MediaWiki</strong>, the world's most popular wiki software. MediaWiki is best known for running Wikipedia, but it's also used by organizations and communities of every type and size, from fans of television shows to major companies storing vital corporate data.
</p>
<p><em>Working with MediaWiki</em> was written by Yaron Koren, a longtime MediaWiki developer, administrator and consultant, and founder of the MediaWiki consulting company <a href="http://wikiworks.com">WikiWorks</a>. In around 300 pages (in printed form), and accompanied by dozens of diagrams and examples, the book clarifies how to use MediaWiki effectively, from the basics like wiki syntax to topics like creating data structures, controlling spam and improving search.
</p>
<p><em>Working with MediaWiki</em> places a special emphasis on two extensions, Page Forms and Cargo, which together transform MediaWiki into something more like a full-fledged database, with the capability to have forms for users to enter and edit data, as well as all sorts of aggregation of the data, including maps and calendars.
</p>
<p>
This book was first published in 2012, and was then updated in 2014, 2017 (the 2nd edition) and 2020. This latest update came out in November 2022, and features extensive changes to the content and images, covering all the latest functionality. Since 2017, the book has been available <a href="book">for free to read online</a>.

<H2>Disco Pigs (2001)</H2>

<P>D: Kirsten Sheridan<BR>
S: Cillian Murphy, Elaine Cassidy</P>

<P>There is a rawness and energy in the performances of the young co-stars
of <I>Disco Pigs</I> that goes a long way toward overcoming the shortfalls
its script. Director Kirsten Sheridan evinces a level of visual style and
imagistic richness comparable with Neil Jordan or Pat Murphy, and this too
helps. Neither quite saves the film from its asinine, adolescent screenplay
though, adapted from Enda Walsh's acclaimed stageplay by the playwright
himself. </P>

<P>The basic story is something of an ersatz Irish <I><A HREF="nbk.htm">Natural
Born Killers</A></I>, or arguably simply another variant on the age-old
'couple on the run' formula. Teenagers Elaine Cassidy and Cillian Murphy
were born on the same day, lived in houses beside one another for almost
seventeen years now, and are deeply and completely intertwined with one
another's lives. As they face their seventeenth birthday, Cassidy (whose
character is mostly referred to as 'Runt') has begun to see that there might
be more to life than Murphy (known as 'Pig'). This threatens the fabric
of their lives, disturbingly so for Murphy, who begins to become even more
unstable and violent. When Cassidy is taken away into residential care in
order to save her from joining Murphy on his descent into madness, their
bond is tested for really the first time in their lives.</P>

<P>Much too easily understood within the frames of reference of the 'no
one understands me' genre (<I><A HREF="vs.htm">The Virgin Suicides</A></I>)
of teenage angst, <I>Disco Pigs</I> has no great sense of a wider social
context to frame its action like the classics (<I><A HREF="olvi.htm">Los
Olvidados</A></I>, <I>Rebel Without a Cause</I>). This is not the intention,
of course, so it seems pointless to criticise it from that point of view.
Yet for all its sledgehammer excess, even <I>Natural Born Killers</I> was
able to make the killers' rampage about more than just an internal monologue.
Walsh's stage version was able to use the monologue format to explore the
complexities of the characters' inner world through language. Murphy does
a great job with the stunted English spoken by his character, hinting at
a dissatisfaction with conventional language and communication which befits
his psychological make-up. Yet these kinds of conceits are best suited to
the stage, and sometimes stageplays need significant adaptation or they
fail entirely (<I>Dancing at Lughnasa</I>). Mercifully, there are only one
or two brief scenes where Sheridan lets the camera sit still and focus on
snippets of the monologues, and they stand out as the most frighteningly
uninteresting parts of the movie. Thank the stars she had wit enough to
ditch the rest.</P>

<P>Sheridan invests considerable emotional energy into the film with the
judicious selection of surreal and/or absurdist imagery. It begins with
the thoughts and reflections of a foetus in the womb, accompanied by appropriate
scenes inside a woman's body. It is the promise of the opening scene of
<I>Hush-a-Bye-Baby</I> come to life and it is an exciting opening. From
there the film continues to create a convincingly skewed world in which
these characters live. Though not as fantastical (or terrifying) as that
created by Peter Jackson for his disturbed teens in <I>Heavenly Creatures</I>,
it is just left of centre enough to suggest spatial and psychological unease.
The largely unfamiliar setting in Cork is also a help here, and adds to
the palette of contemporary Irish urban and rural imagery. Most of the film
is directed with clarity, energy, and an almost tactile sense of the world
as seen by these characters. She has done a marvellous job in matching form
to content.</P>

<P>It is therefore all the more pity that the content simply is not inventive
enough to make it all worthwhile. The primal scream teen dramas at the base
of the story are still bogstandard melodrama, and it is no longer 1955:
&quot;you're tearing me apart&quot; just won't wash anymore. In a sense
the film needed a greater connection with contemporary Irish society to
make it relevant, as these psychological and emotional schisms are internalised
to a degree which makes them meaningless for anyone other than an equally
angst-ridden teen. </P>

<P>Murphy and Cassidy are very good in the part though. Both of them manage
to make their angst interesting. Cassidy's wide-eyed disconnection is believable
and sympathetic. Her strong face and curiously dark eyes are entrancing,
and Sheridan makes excellent use of her physicality. The actress registers
an ethereal quality which makes the character work, and she throws in enough
of a sense of her increasing awareness that something is wrong with how
they are together to keep the characterisation moving. Murphy is generally
delirious throughout the film, with happiness, sorrow, or anger. His general
physical deportment suggests a prowling menace which comes to pay off at
the climax (predictably, unfortunately), and his tired, haggard appearance
contrasts with the energy the character displays. It is one of those Anthony
Perkins type characterisations which may forever etch the actor in people's
minds as a really good psychopath.</P>

<P>On the whole, <I>Disco Pigs</I> is worth seeing. As an Irish film it
is remarkable for several reasons, including being Sheridan's feature debut
(after years of making a name for herself in the short film circuit and
emerging from the shadow of her father, Jim (<I><A HREF="box.htm">The Boxer</A></I>)).
It marks the emergence of what promises to be a distinctive cinematic talent,
the first significant female director since Pat Murphy. It is also notable
in subject matter insofar as the last major 'teen' movie to come out of
Ireland was probably <I>Clash of the Ash</I> (or, arguably, <I><A HREF="crud.htm">Drinking Crude</A></I>), although, curiously, the trials of adolescence
theme was also featured in the almost simultaneously released <I>On the
Edge</I> which also starred Murphy. But it does beg the question of when
we draw the line and begin to look at Irish films just as films, or if that
is possible at all. Were a film like this to emerge from Hollywood, we would
condemn it for its moronic script and story and probably not bother with
it at all. Yet in terms of contemporary Irish cinema, even in the wake of
groundbreaking work like <A HREF="bb.htm"><I>The Butcher Boy</I> </A>(which
this faintly resembles in many respects) or <I><A HREF="abad.htm">About
Adam</A></I>, we are still thinking parochially. Be that as it may, there
is much to admire here and enough that is positive to at least suggest a
bright future for its director, and perhaps its stars. </P>

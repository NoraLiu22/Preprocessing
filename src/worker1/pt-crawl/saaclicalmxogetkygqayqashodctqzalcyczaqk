      &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      Jonathan Myrick Daniels was born in Keene, New Hampshire in 1939, one of 
      two offspring of a Congregationalist physician. When in high school, he 
      had a bad fall which put him in the hospital for about a month. It was a 
      time of reflection. Soon after, he joined the Episcopal Church and also 
      began to take his studies seriously, and to consider the possibility of 
      entering the priesthood. After high school, he enrolled at Virginia Military 
      Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia, where at first he seemed a misfit, 
      but managed to stick it out, and was elected Valedictorian of his graduating 
      class. During his sophomore year at VMI, however, he began to experience 
      uncertainties about his religious faith and his vocation to the&nbsp;priesthood 
      that continued for several years, and were probably influenced by the death 
      of his father and the prolonged illness of his younger sister Emily. In 
      the fall of 1961 he entered Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
      near Boston, to study English literature, and in the spring of 1962, while 
      attending Easter services at the Church of the Advent in Boston, he underwent 
      a conversion experience and renewal of grace. Soon after, he made a definite 
      decision to study for the priesthood, and after a year of work to repair 
      the family finances, he enrolled at Episcopal&nbsp; Theological Seminary 
      in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1963, expecting to graduate 
      in the spring of 1966.&nbsp; 
      <P>In March 1965 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, asked students and others
to join him in Selma, Alabama, for a march to the state capital in Montgomery
demonstrating support for his civil rights program. News of the request
reached the campus of ETS on Monday 8 March (my sources are a bit confused
on the chronology of that week, but I think this is correct), and during
Evening Prayer at the chapel, Jon Daniels decided that he ought to go.
Later he wrote:&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>"My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced
in God my Saviour." I had come to Evening Prayer as usual that evening,
and as usual I was singing the Magnificat with the special love and reverence
I have always felt for Mary's glad song. "He hath showed strength with
his arm." As the lovely hymn of the God-bearer continued, I found myself
peculiarly alert, suddenly straining toward the decisive, luminous, Spirit-filled
"moment" that would, in retrospect, remind me of others--particularly one
at Easter three years ago. Then it came. "He hath put down the mighty from
their seat, and hath exalted the humble and meek. He hath filled the hungry
with good things." I knew then that I must go to Selma. The Virgin's song
was to grow more and more dear in the weeks ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p align="center"><img src="jdaniels&kids.jpg" width="266" height="189" alt="Jonathan Daniels &amp; kids"></p>
      <p>He and others left on Thursday for Selma, intending to stay only that 
        weekend; but he and a friend missed the bus back, and began to reflect 
        on how an in-and-out visit like theirs looked to those living in Selma, 
        and decided that they must stay longer. They went home to request permission 
        to spend the rest of the term in Selma, studying on their own and returning 
        to take their examinations. In Selma, many proposed marches were blocked 
        by rows of policemen. Jon describes one such meeting (ellipses not marked).&nbsp; 
      </p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>After a week-long, rain-soaked vigil, we still stood face to
face with the Selma police. I stood, for a change, in the front rank, ankle-deep
in an enormous puddle. To my immediate right were high school students,
for the most part, and further to the right were a swarm of clergymen.
My end of the line surged forward at one point, led by a militant Episcopal
priest whose temper (as usual) was at combustion-point. Thus I found myself
only inches from a young policeman. The air crackled with tension and open
hostility. Emma Jean, a sophomore in the Negro high school, called my name
from behind. I reached back for her hand to bring her up to the front rank,
but she did not see. Again she asked me to come back. My determination
had become infectiously savage, and I insisted that she come forward--I
would not retreat! Again I reached for her hand and pulled her forward.
The young policeman spoke: "You're dragging her through the puddle. You
ought to be ashamed for treating a girl like that." Flushing--I had forgotten
the puddle--I snarled something at him about whose-fault-it-really-was,
that managed to be both defensive and self-righteous. We matched baleful
glances and then both looked away. And then came a moment of shattering
internal quiet, in which I felt shame, indeed, and a kind of reluctant
love for the young policeman. I apologized to Emma Jean. And then it occurred
to me to apologize to <I>him</I> and to thank him. Though he looked away
in contempt--I was not altogether sure I blamed him--I had received a blessing
I would not forget. Before long the kids were singing, "I love ---." One
of my friends asked [the young policeman] for his name. His name was Charlie.
When we sang for him, he blushed and then smiled in a truly sacramental
mixture of embarrassment and pleasure and shyness. Soon the young policeman
looked relaxed, we all lit cigarettes (in a couple of instances, from a
common match, and small groups of kids and policemen clustered to joke
or talk cautiously about the situation. It was thus a shock later to look
across the rank at the clergymen and their opposites, who glared across
a still unbroken "Wall" in what appeared to be silent hatred. Had I been
freely arranging the order for Evening Prayer that night, I think I might
have followed the General Confession directly with the General Thanksgiving--or
perhaps the Te Deum.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;Jon devoted many of his Sundays in Selma to bringing small groups
of Negroes, mostly high school students, to church with him in an effort
to integrate the local Episcopal church. They were seated but scowled at.
Many parishioners openly resented their presence, and put their pastor
squarely in the middle. (He was integrationist enough to risk his job by
accommodating Jon's group as far as he did, but not integrationist enough
to satisfy Jon.)&nbsp;

<P>In May, Jon went back to ETS to take examinations and complete other
requirements, and in July he returned to Alabama, where he helped to produce
a listing of local, state, and federal agencies and other resources legally
available to persons in need of assistance. On Friday 13 August Jon and
others went to the town of Fort Deposit to join in picketing three local
businesses. On Saturday they were arrested and held in the county jail
in Hayneville for six days until they were bailed out. (They had agreed
that none would accept bail until there was bail money for all.) After
their release on Friday 20 August, four of them undertook to enter a local
shop, and were met at the door by a man with a shotgun who told them to
leave or be shot. After a brief confrontation, he aimed the gun at a young
girl in the party, and Jon pushed her out of the way and took the blast
of the shotgun himself. (Whether he stepped between her and the shotgun
is not clear.) He was killed instantly. Not long before his death he wrote:&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>I lost fear in the black belt when I began to know in my bones
and sinews that I had been truly baptized into the Lord's death and Resurrection,
that in the only sense that really matters I am already dead, and my life
is hid with Christ in God. I began to lose self-righteousness when I discovered
the extent to which my behavior was motivated by worldly desires and by
the self-seeking messianism of Yankee deliverance! The point is simply,
of course, that one's motives are usually mixed, and one had better know
it. As Judy and I said the daily offices day by day, we became more and
more aware of the living reality of the invisible "communion of saints"--of
the beloved comunity in Cambridge who were saying the offices too, of the
ones gathered around a near-distant throne in heaven--who blend with theirs
our faltering songs of prayer and praise. With them, with black men and
white men, with all of life, in Him Whose Name is above all the names that
the races and nations shout, whose Name is Itself the Song Which fulfils
and "ends" all songs, we are indelibly, unspeakably ONE.</BLOCKQUOTE>
(NOTE: Much of Alabama has brick-red clayey soil. The region where the
soil is black loam is called "the black belt." The term has no racial referent,
although Yankees often assume that it does.)&nbsp;

      <P>(NOTE: Because Bernard of Clairvaux is remembered on 20 August,&nbsp; Jonathan 
        Daniels is remembered on the day of his arrest, 14 August.)&nbsp;

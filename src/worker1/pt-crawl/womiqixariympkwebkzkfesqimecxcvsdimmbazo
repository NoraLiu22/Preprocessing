<p class="comment">The fifth illustration is John Leech's introduction to literature of
that "pre-Father Christmas" figure, the Spirit of Christmas Present, not quite sitting on
a "couch" or "kind of throne" (77), but decidedly "a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who
[bears] a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's horn" (77). [Commentary continued

<h3>Passage Illustrated (facing the engraving)</h3>

<p class="lq">"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present," said the Spirit. "Look upon me!"</p>

<p class="lq">Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or
mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its
capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice.
Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its
head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining
icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling
eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air.
Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient
sheath was eaten up with rust. [Stave Three, "The Second of the three Spirits," p. 78]</p>

<h3>Commentary Continued</h3>

<p class="one">With its wainscoting, fireplace, and fireside chair, this is the same
room in which (in Scrooge's dream vision) on the previous night Scrooge encountered
Jacob Marley's Ghost — but how changed are both the room, formerly dark, cold, and
forbidding, and its equally forbidding occupant, Ebenezer Scrooge.</p>

<p>As Jane Rabb Cohen has remarked of all eight original Leech illustrations, this
full-page, hand-coloured steel engraving for Dickens's <span class="book">A Christmas
Carol</span>, <span class="drawing">Scrooge's third Visitor</span>, elegantly and uniquely
combines "the ideal, real, and supernatural" (142) with pathos, whimsy, and humour. The
"transcendental but secular spirit" (143) of the entire series is evident in the vivid
accumulation of realistic details (the puddings, oysters, and punch bowls) and the
expressions of the genial Spirit and the amazed Scrooge. The abundance of comestibles
implies an overflowing of the spirit of generosity and the joys of the domestic hearth,
aspects of social relationships entirely lacking in Scrooge's life for so many years.
Throughout the Leech composition one finds ample evidence of what the reviewer for <span
class="book">The Illustrated London News</span> for 23 December 1843 described as "the
delicacy of fine etchings" (411); indeed, many of the subtle effects of the hand-coloured
original have been lost in the blurry black-and-white reproductions such as those in the
Penguin and Oxford Illustrated Dickens, so that it may be instructive to investigate the
extent to which Leech realised in the most minute particulars the text that Dickens
provided him, but also added thoughtful touches that make this illustration a highly
informed and sensitive interpretation of Dickens's text read in draft, before anyone else
had had the opportunity to read Dickens's six-week wonder.</p>

<p>The oft-reproduced and copied <span class="drawing">Spirit of Christmas Present</span>
celebrates the evergreen nature of a holiday redolent with childhood memories as the
green-clad Spirit (a Green Man for the nineteenth century, here perhaps representing the
possibility of a social and spiritual rather than just a physical renewal of quality of
life) recalls Scrooge to the joys of a season and a festival that he has roundly
pronounced "humbug." The yuletide greenery (cedar or fir rather than the acanthus
traditionally associated with the Green Man) spills out from above the mantelpiece and
surges across the room, connecting the enormous, holly-wreathed head of the gigantic and
virile Spirit and the night-capped head of the diminutive Scrooge, wearing an almost
feminine night-gown that reaches to his ankles and tiny, slipper-clad feet. The
bare-footed, bare-chested, exuberant, bearded epitome of December 25th appears to be
sitting, although the "throne" of poultry, meats, and fruits which Dickens enumerates in
loving detail is not evident in Leech's delicately engraved and subtly coloured plate. In
his right hand, the genial Spirit holds the concord-producing torch which suggests in
emblematic fashion Christ as The Light of the World; with his left, his hand open in
welcome, he gestures to another kind of welcoming spirit in a steaming, golden bowl. That
the object leaning against his left knee is an empty scabbard (signifying universal peace)
is not immediately apparent in black-and-white reprints of this engraving, but the
colouration of the original makes it clearer that this is the "ancient sheath . . . eaten
up with rust" (78) which Dickens describes on the facing page. Although an amazed Scrooge
attempts to smile at all he observes, his gesture is a closed one, as if he is trying to
gird himself against so much conspicuous consumption. Prominent in the foreground is a
huge version of the type of Christmas pudding that Mrs. Cratchit makes for her family.
The oysters, a small pie, and a single dead hare represent the abundant game spread out
on what had been mere barren floorboards fifty pages earlier.</p>

<p>Although Leech has included two bowls of punch and a barrel (containing oysters, one
assumes, rather than spirits), he has omitted the sausages, fruits (except the "juicy
oranges" at the base of the scabbard), and "great joints of meat" (77). The only object
that could be a great Twelfth Cake is serving as the Spirit's footstool. Leech, then, is
selective in his depiction of the bounty that accompanies Scrooge's third Visitor,
avoiding an impression of clutter while suggesting the richness of the Christmas feast
laid in the formerly spartan room.</p>

<p>Paralleling the abundance of food is the warmth that now invests the formerly chilly
room, as the flames leap up in the brazier, illuminating the biblically-themed tiles in
the fireplace, so that the roaring flames become an extension of the Spirit's torch which,
we later learn, dispenses forbearance and good will as a kind of benediction. The coal
grate, tiles, and mantelpiece establish that this is the very room in which in Stave one
Scrooge encountered his ex-partner's ghost: he was seated approximately where now the
Spirit holds court, and Marley stood where Scrooge now stands, right. But Leech has
foreshortened the floor-boards to move the viewer closer, inviting the miser (and the
reader) to participate with all his senses, not merely that of sight. The frightened
candle flame separating the mortal from the shade in <a href="../carol/2.html"><span
class="drawing">Marley's Ghost</span></a> has been replaced as a vertical divider by the
rusted sheath, the outward and visible sign of the Spirit's message to Scrooge in
particular and humanity in general this Christmas Eve of 1843, when hunger stalks the
mean streets of the metropolis and the workhouses reach full their complement.</p>

<p>In the series of four multi-coloured, full-page etchings and four less-than-full-page
wood-engravings Leech exploits early Victorian nostalgia for the man-master relationship
of pre-industrial England implicit in <a href="../carol/1.html"><span class="drawing">Mr.
Fezziwig's Ball</span></a>, in which the decorated warehouse has replaced the manor house
and the office party the traditional entertainment that the landowner provided for his
agricultural labourers. Leech exploits the general longing for the simpler world of two
generations earlier, making Fezziwig's employees an extended family, and the Fezziwigs
surrogate parents. He also exploits the contemporary addiction for the <span
class="book">Blackwood's</span> tale of the supernatural — as seen in <a
href="../carol/2.html"><span class="drawing">Marley's Ghost</span></a>, <a
href="../carol/3.html"><span class="drawing">The Phantoms (Ghosts of Departed
Usurers)</span></a>, and <a href="../carol/7.html"><span class="drawing">The Last of the
Spirits</span></a>, and the characteristically Victorian yearning for a satisfying 
closure, as seen in the final tailpiece, <a href="../carol/8.html"><span 
class="drawing">The Christmas Bowl [Scrooge and Bob Cratchit]</span></a>.</p>

<p>But there is one further element, drawn from the contemporary social ills of the
nation, that ripples like a leitmotif through all of these illustrations and dominates
one in particular, <a href="../carol/6.html"><span class="drawing">Ignorance and
Want</span></a>, at 8.6 cm by 7 cm the largest of the wood-engravings, but not quite a
full-page illustration. In the third illustration, Leech had touched upon this theme of
social inequality in the figure of the poor woman, in despair trying to warm her infant
as the pair are freezing in the street opposite the miser's house.</p>

<p>Significantly, it is not the terrifying Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come, but the
genial Spirit of Christmas Present in his second appearance who delivers a stern rebuke
to Scrooge and his fellow members of the business class about the dangers of denying that
there even <em>is</em> a problem with poverty, hunger, and lack of educational
opportunities among the marginalised labouring classes whom Scrooge had previously
dismissed with the Malthusian phrase "the surplus population" (14):</p>

<p class ="lq">"Spirit, are they yours?" Scrooge could say no more.</p>

<p class ="lq">"They are Man's," said the Spirit, looking down upon them. "And they
cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want.
Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his
brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!" cried the
Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. "Slander those who tell it ye. Admit it
for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And abide the end." [Stave Three, "The
Second of the three Spirits," p. 119]</p>

<p>This Jeremiad, with its emphatic and parallel series of insistent imperatives, appears
immediately above the scene of Scrooge, the Spirit, the shivering children, and the
factory backdrop that closes Stave Three. No other spirit appears twice in the Leech
sequence, suggesting that present ills rather than nostalgia for a former era or even
the whimsy evident in Scrooge's suppressing his own bitter-sweet memories in <a
href="../carol/4.html"><span class="drawing">The end of the First Spirit</span></a>
are Leech's chief concern. Indeed, the only character to occur more than twice in the
entire series is Ebenezer Scrooge himself — he is the visual thread between the
images is present in six of the eight.</p>

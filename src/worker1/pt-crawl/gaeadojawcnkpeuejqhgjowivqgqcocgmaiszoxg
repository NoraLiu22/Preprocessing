It is now generally agreed that it cannot have been written by him; but it has often been combined with the <A HREF="https://archive.org/details/aurelius-victor-h.-w.-bird-de-caesaribus-1994-liverpool/page/n7/mode/1up">De Caesaribus</A> to create a brief summary of all ancient Roman history.</I>

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="1">[1]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../latin/illustribus.html#1"> L</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/procas.html#1">Procas,</A> king of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alba.html#1">Albans,</A> left his kingdom to his two sons,<B> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/amulius.html#1">Amulius</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/numitor.html#1">Numitor</A> </B>, on the condition that they would reign alternately, each for one year. Numitor's turn having come, Amulius refused to cede the throne to him; and, to deprive him of the hope of having descendants, he appointed <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhea.html#2">Rhea</A> Sylvia, his daughter, to be a priestess of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/v/vesta.html#1">Vesta.</A> This role obliged her to maintain perpetual virginity, but she was impregnated by the god <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mars.html#1">Mars,</A> and gave birth to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/romulus.html#1">Romulus</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/remus.html#1">Remus.</A> At this news, Amulius had her imprisoned, and ordered that her two children be thrown into the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tiber.html#1">Tiber.</A> But the river retreated and left the babies dry on the shore. A she-wolf ran to their cries and fed them with her teats. Shortly afterwards, the shepherd <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faustulus">Faustulus</A> picked them up and took them to his wife <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acca_Larentia">Acca Laurentia,</A> so that she could raise them.

<P> Afterwards these two brothers put Amulius to death, and restored Numitor, their grandfather, to the throne. They then gathered together a large number of herdsmen, and founded a city, which Romulus named Rome; he had priority, because in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augury">augury</A> Remus saw six vultures, and Romulus saw twelve vultures. In order to protect the city by laws before fortifying it with walls, Romulus forbade all his subjects to cross a rampart that he had built. After Remus mocked this defence by jumping over it, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion">centurion</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celer_(builder)">Celer</A> is said to have killed him with a hoe.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="2">[2]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../latin/illustribus.html#2"> L</A> &nbsp; <B> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/romulus.html#1">Romulus</A> </B>offered asylum to all foreigners who wanted to come to him. He soon had formed a considerable army; but, seeing that his soldiers lacked women, he sent envoys to ask for them from neighbouring states. Upon their refusal, he pretended to hold games in honour of <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consus">Consus.</A> When a multitude of men and women flocked there, Romulus gave a signal to his men, and they kidnapped the girls. Among them, there was one of great beauty; when everyone admired her as she was being led away, the response was given that she was being taken to <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talasius">Talassius.</A> Because the union of this couple was very happy, the custom was introduced of pronouncing the name of Talassius at all weddings.

<P> The men of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caenina.html#1">Caenina</A> were the first to take up arms against the Romans to avenge the rape of the neighbouring peoples' women. Romulus marched against them and defeated them; he killed Acron, their leader, in single combat, and consecrated the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spolia_opima">spolia opima</A> to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jupiter.html#1">Jupiter</A> Feretrius on the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/capitol.html#1">Capitol.</A> For the same reason, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sabines.html#1">Sabines</A> made war on the Romans. As they approached Rome, they met a young girl, named <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpeia">Tarpeia,</A> who had come down to draw the water necessary for the sacrifices. Titus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tatius.html#1">Tatius</A> promised her the reward she would ask for, if she introduced her troops into the citadel. She asked him for what his soldiers wore on their left arms, meaning their rings and bracelets. After Tatius deceitfully promised this to her, she led the Sabines into the citadel. Then Tatius ordered that they crush her with their shields, which they also carried on their left arms. After Tatius had occupied the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarpeian.html#1">Tarpeian</A> hill, Romulus advanced against him, and joined battle with him, in the very place where the Roman forum is now located. There <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostus_Hostilius">Hostus Hostilius</A> perished, fighting with the greatest valour. Dismayed by his death, the Romans began to flee. At this moment, Romulus vowed to build a temple to <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Jupiter_Stator_(3rd_century_BC)">Jupiter Stator.</A> His troops stood their ground, either by chance or by divine inspiration. It was then that the women kidnapped by the Romans, advancing on the battlefield, implored their fathers on one side and their husbands on the other to make peace. Romulus agreed to a treaty with the Sabines, and received them into the city. He gave the combined people the name of <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirites">Quirites,</A> from <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cures,_Sabinum">Cures,</A> a city of the Sabines. He then created a senate of a hundred men, to whom he gave the name of fathers, because of their piety. He also instituted three <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuria">centuries</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equites">knights</A>, which he called Ramnes after his name; and Tatienses from the name of Titus Tatius; and the third Luceres from the grove {<FONT CLASS="exotic">lucus</FONT>} that they shared. Finally, he divided the people into thirty <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia">curiae</A>, to each of which he gave the name of one <I>of the Sabine women</I> who had been kidnapped. One day when Romulus was reviewing his army near the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palus_Caprae">Palus Capreae,</A> he disappeared and could not be found. When this led to dissension between the people and the senators, Julius Proculus, an illustrious man, came forward in the assembly, and declared with an oath that Romulus had appeared to him on the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/q/quirinal.html#1">Quirinal</A> hill - with a more august appearance, since he had gone to join the immortal gods. Romulus had ordered him to advise the Romans to abstain from all sedition, and to practice virtue; in which case they would become the masters of all nations. The authority <I>of Proculus</I> swayed the people. A temple to Romulus was built on the Quirinal hill, and he was worshipped as a god under the name of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/q/quirinus.html#1">Quirinus.</A>

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3">[3]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../latin/illustribus.html#3"> L</A> &nbsp; After the deification of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/romulus.html#1">Romulus,</A> there was a long interregnum, accompanied by seditions. <B> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/numa.html#1">Numa</A> Pompilius </B>, the son of Pomponius, was summoned from the city of <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cures,_Sabinum">Cures</A> in the land of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sabines.html#1">Sabines,</A> and came with the favourable omens of birds. Numa wanted to soften through religion the ferocity of his people, and instituted many sacred ceremonies. He built a temple to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/v/vesta.html#1">Vesta,</A> and chose some <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/v/vestal.html#1">Vestal</A> Virgins. He also chose three <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamen">flamens</A>, who were called Dialis, Martialis, and Quirinalis. He appointed twelve <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/salii.html#1">Salii</A> as priests of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mars.html#1">Mars,</A> and gave the first priest the name of <FONT CLASS="exotic">praesul</FONT>. He created a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_Maximus">pontifex maximus</A>, and built the gates of two-faced <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/janus.html#1">Janus.</A> He divided the year into twelve months, with the addition of January and February. He made a large number of good laws, pretending that everything he did was on the instruction of the nymph <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/egeria.html#1">Egeria,</A> who was his wife. Because of his great love for justice, no one made war against him. He died from an illness, and was buried on the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/janiculum.html#1">Janiculum,</A> where, many years after his death, a certain Terentius dug up a chest which contained some books. As these books contained only some unimportant details of sacred rites, they were burned by order of the senate.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="4">[4]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../latin/illustribus.html#4"> L</A> &nbsp; <B> Tullus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hostilius.html#1">Hostilius</A> </B>, because of his distinguished service in the war against the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sabines.html#1">Sabines,</A> was chosen as the next king. He declared a war against the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alba.html#1">Albans,</A> which ended with a combat between two sets of three brothers. He destroyed the city of Alba, after <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mettius.html#1">Mettius</A> Fufetius had been found guilty of treason, and forced the inhabitants to move to Rome. He built the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_Hostilia">Curia Hostilia</A> {<I>senate house</I>}. He included the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caelian.html#1">Caelian</A> hill within the bounds of the city. He followed the examples of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/numa.html#1">Numa</A> Pompilius in the sacrifices he offered, but he was unable to make a propitious sacrifice to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jupiter.html#1">Jupiter</A> Elicius; <I>therefore</I> he was struck by lightning and was burnt up together with his palace.

<P> When war arose between the Romans and the Albans, their leaders Hostilius and Fufetius decided to end it by the combat of a small number of men. On the side of the Romans, three brothers, named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/horatii.html#1">Horatii</A> and on the side of the Albans, three other brothers, named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/curiatii.html#1">Curiatii,</A> were chosen by agreement. In the first encounter two Romans were killed, and the three Albans were injured. The last Horatius, seeing himself unable to defend himself against three, although he had not received any wounds, pretended to flee. The Curiatii pursued him at unequal intervals, as much as the pain of their wounds allowed; and one after the other, they were killed by him. As he returned laden with their spoils, he met his sister on the way, and she recognised the military cloak of one of the Curiatii, to whom she was engaged. When she began to cry, her brother killed her. For this he was condemned by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duumviri">duumvirs</A>, but he appealed to the people. His father's tears obtained his pardon, but on condition that he would pass under a yoke. This yoke is still in place on the street, and it is called the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sororium_Tigillum">Sororium</A> {"sister's yoke"}.

<P> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mettius.html#1">Mettius</A> Fufetius, the leader of the Albans, saw that he had incurred their hatred because he had agreed to end the war with the combat between two sets of three brothers. To rectify this fault, he incited the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/v/veii.html#1">Veientes</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/f/fidenae.html#1">Fidenates</A> against the Romans. When Mettius was summoned by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hostilius.html#1">Tullus</A> as an ally, he kept his troops on the slope of a hill to await the result of the battle. Tullus perceived his intentions, and cried out in a loud voice that Mettius had taken up this position by his order. These words so frightened the enemies, that they they were defeated. The next day, Mettius went to congratulate Tullus; but the king ordered that he be tied between four-horse chariots, and torn apart.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="5">[5]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../latin/illustribus.html#5"> L</A> &nbsp; <B> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ancus.html#1">Ancus</A> Marcius </B>, the grandson of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/numa.html#1">Numa</A> Pompilius through his daughter, was similar to his grandfather in fairness and religious devotion, and subdued the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/latium.html#1">Latins</A> in war. He added the (?) <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murcia_(deity)">Murcian</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/janiculum.html#1">Janiculan</A> hills to the city, and surrounded the town with new walls. He provided public forests for the use of ships. He instituted the tax on saltworks. He built the first prison. He established the colony of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/ostia.html#1">Ostia,</A> convenient for maritime trade at the mouth of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tiber.html#1">Tiber.</A> He brought in the law of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetial">fetiales</A>, which envoys used for reclaiming property, from the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aequi.html#1">Aequiculi;</A> it is said Rhesus was the first to devise it. After accomplishing these things, he was taken away by a premature death after a few days' illness, which prevented him from fulfilling the promise of being a great king.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="6">[6]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../latin/illustribus.html#6"> L</A> &nbsp; <B>Lucius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarquinius.html#1">Tarquinius</A> Priscus</B> <I>was</I> the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demaratus_of_Corinth">Demaratus</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/corinth.html#1">Corinth,</A> who, escaping from the tyranny of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cypselus.html#1">Cypselus,</A> migrated to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/etruria.html#1">Etruria.</A> He himself was called Lucumo. He set out from the city of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarquinii.html#1">Tarquinii</A> and came to Rome. When he arrived, an eagle snatched his cap and, after flying up high, then replaced it. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tanaquil.html#1">Tanaquil,</A> his wife, who was skilled in <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augury">augury</A>, interpreted this as a sign of his future kingship. Tarquinius, through wealth and diligence, acquired high status and even gained familiarity with King <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ancus.html#1">Ancus.</A> When Ancus died, he left Tarquinius as the guardian of his children, but he seized the throne and governed as if he had obtained it through right. He appointed one hundred 'fathers' to the senate , who were called the lesser <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gens">gentes</A>. He doubled the number of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuria">centuries</A> of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equites">knights</A>, but he could not change their names due to the authority of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur">augur</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attus_Navius">Attus Navius,</A> who confirmed the validity of his craft with his razor and whetstone. He subjugated the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/latium.html#1">Latins</A> in war. He built the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/circus.html#1">Circus</A> Maximus and established the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludi_Romani">Ludi Magni.</A> He triumphed over the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sabines.html#1">Sabines</A> and the ancient Latins. He surrounded the city with a stone wall. He bestowed upon his thirteen-year-old son, who had slain an enemy in battle, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toga">toga praetexta</A> and the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulla_(amulet)">bulla</A>, from which these became the insignia of freeborn boys. Afterwards the sons of Ancus secretly sent men to kill him; he was brought out of the palace and killed.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7">[7]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../latin/illustribus.html#7"> L</A> &nbsp; <B>Servius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tullius.html#1">Tullius</A> </B>, the son of Tullius Corniculanus and Ocresia the captive, was being raised in the house of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarquinius.html#1">Tarquinius</A> Priscus, when his head was encircled by the appearance of a flame. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tanaquil.html#1">Tanaquil</A> saw this and realised that it portended great authority for him. She persuaded her husband to raise him as their own child. When he grew up, he was adopted as a son-in-law by Tarquinius, and after the king was killed, Tanaquil, looking down at the people from an eminence, said that Priscus had received a grave but not a fatal wound, and that in the meantime, while he was recovering, they should obey Servius Tullius. Servius Tullius began to rule somewhat precariously, but he governed the realm justly. He frequently defeated the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/etruria.html#1">Etruscans;</A> he added the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/q/quirinal.html#1">Quirinal,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viminal_Hill">Viminal,</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/esquiline.html#1">Esquiline</A> hills to the city; and he built ramparts and ditches. He divided the people into four tribes and distributed grain to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebs">plebs</A>. He established measures, weights, <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class_in_ancient_Rome#Property-based_classes">classes</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuria">centuries</A>. He persuaded the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/latium.html#1">Latin</A> peoples that, following the example of those who had built a shrine to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/diana.html#1">Diana</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/ephesus.html#1">Ephesus,</A> they themselves should construct a temple to Diana on the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aventine.html#1">Aventine.</A> After this was done, a heifer of marvellous size was born to one of the Latins, and through a prophetic message given in a dream it was foretold that the people, whose citizen sacrificed that heifer to Diana, would hold the highest power. The Latin man drove the heifer to the Aventine and explained the matter to a Roman priest. The priest craftily said that he must wash his hands with the running water of the river first. While the Latin man went down to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tiber.html#1">Tiber,</A> the priest sacrificed the heifer. Thus, through this cunning action, he obtained power for the citizens <I>of Rome</I> and glory for himself.

<P> Servius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tullius.html#1">Tullius</A> had two daughters, one fierce and the other mild, and when he saw that the sons of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarquinius.html#1">Tarquinius</A> had similar dispositions, he married the fierce daughter to the mild one and the mild daughter to the fierce one, in order to soften the minds of them all through the diversity of their characters. However, whether by chance or by treachery, the mild ones died, and the similarity of their characters united the fierce ones. Immediately <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarquinius.html#2">Tarquinius</A> Superbus, incited by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tullia.html#2">Tullia,</A> summoned the senate and began to claim the royal power that had belonged to his father. Upon hearing this, Servius hurried to the senate, but he was thrown down the steps by order of Tarquinius, and while he sought refuge at home, he was killed. Tullia immediately rushed to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum">forum</A>, and she was the first to greet her husband as king. He told her to withdraw from the crowd, and while she was returning home, she ordered the muleteer to drive over her father's body although he was trying to avoid it; hence, that street became known as the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0054:id=clivus-orbius">Vicus Sceleratus</A> {"Wicked Way"}. Afterwards, Tullia was driven into exile with her husband.

After assassinating Servius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tullius.html#1">Tullius,</A> he wickedly seized the throne. However, he vigorously conquered the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/latium.html#1">Latins</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sabines.html#1">Sabines</A> in war; he seized <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suessa_Pometia">Suessa Pometia</A> from the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/etruria.html#1">Etruscans;</A> he brought <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gabii.html#1">Gabii</A> under his control through a pretended defection by his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarquinius.html#3">Sextus;</A> and established the first <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/latin.html#1">Latin</A> Festival. He held games in the circus and constructed the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca_Maxima">Cloaca Maxima,</A> in which he made use of the entire strength of the people; hence those ditches are called the Fossae Quiritium {"ditches of the Roman citizens"}. When he was building the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/capitol.html#1">Capitol,</A> he discovered the head of a man, from which it was recognised that this city would be the head of the nations. After his son had violated <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lucretia.html#1">Lucretia</A> during the siege of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ardea.html#1">Ardea,</A> he was driven into exile along with his son. He took refuge with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/porsenna.html#1">Porsenna,</A> the king of Etruria, by whose help he attempted to regain the throne; but he was repelled, and withdrew to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cumae.html#1">Cumae,</A> where he spent the remainder of his life in the utmost ignominy.

It happened that, while they were praising their wives at a rather unrestrained banquet, they decided to put the wives to the test. So they set out for Rome on horseback. There they found the wives of the royal family in revelry and luxury. Then they went to <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatia">Collatia.</A> They found<B> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lucretia.html#1">Lucretia</A> </B> among the her handmaids in the weaving room; and therefore she was judged to be most chaste.

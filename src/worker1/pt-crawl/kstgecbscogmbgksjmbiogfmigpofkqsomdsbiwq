It seems many people need to know where to look for Highland
clothing. The kilt was worn in all the gaelic speaking areas, from Cork 
up to the top of the Outer Hebrides. In my opinion, one of the best
outfitter to be found is

<dt>Geoffrey Tailor Highland Crafts Ltd
<dt>57-59 High Street (2 doors up from John Knox's house)
<dt>Royal Mile
<dt>Edinburgh
<dt>EH1 1SR
<dt>Tel: 031 557 0256
<p>
The propriator's name is Geoffrey Nicholsby and it is a family run
operation with a satellite store in San Francisco and a van that
hits many Highland Games in North America. Tell Geoffrey you heard about
him here so that he will believe in the power of the net! He also has
a sail boat called <em>Haggis Basher</em>.
<p>
Kilt wearers note! Women in Scotland <b>do not</b> wear kilts unless
they are pipers or highland dancers! They wear kilted skirts. Men 
do not wear kilted skirts unless they are trying to look like women!-)

The <b>Breacan</b> <em>Tartan</em> is no doubt one of the most
easily recognized celtic icons, a style of weaving which was
identified as being worn by the celts by the earliest roman
historical contacts. Although easily recognized, it is
amazing how many myths exist about it and how misled
the public perception of this mode of weaving has become.Click

 to go to a nifty collection of tartans and
to learn some truth about the tartan, made available by
<em><b>Stephen Watson</em></b>. Another great site for tartans

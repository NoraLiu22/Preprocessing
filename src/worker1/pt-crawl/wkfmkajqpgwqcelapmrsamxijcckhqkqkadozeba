I have done research on Meucci since I retired, inNovember 1989, for eleven years now. Before that, I have doneresearch in telecommunications for about forty years. However, I didnot confine my research on Antonio Meucci to mere scientific aspects.In fact, I soon realized that it was necessary to consider the largercultural environment in the three areas where Meucci lived, i.e.Florence, Havana and New York, as well as its evolution during thenineteenth century.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the beginning of my research, I found in theavailable literature many contradictions, misinterpretations andmistakes on Antonio Meucci. Therefore, I decided not to rely onsecond-hand information but to begin my research from scratch, i.e.based on original documents. To this end, I searched with great caremany archives in Italy, Cuba and United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">I could fix a number of dates, places, namesand occurrences, such as the exact dates of Meucci's transfer fromFlorence to Havana and from Havana to New York, which occurred 150years ago. I decided to write a book, supporting any statement withthe quotation or the reproduction of the original document. Ofcourse, it turned out to be very big, as you can see from my firsttwo volumes here.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">My presentation of today will deal with a fewtopics connected with Meucci's priority in the invention of thetelephone. I will follow the order in which my research progressed,i.e. : The Bell vs. Globe Trial; The US vs. Bell Trial; TheScientific Proofs.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial">The Bell vs. Globe trial</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial">You know already that the Bell people use topublicize Judge Wallace's decision issued in New York on 19 July1887, which ruled in favor of Bell and against the Globe TelephoneCompany and Meucci for patent infringement. The records of this trialare available from several sources. In particular, the Deposition ofAntonio Meucci is available in print in many public libraries, suchas the New York Public Library and the Library of Congress.Therefore, anyone can read how the Bell lawyers defeated the GlobeCompany and Meucci.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Bell people, however, forget to say that,long before the Bell Company had sued the Globe Company and Meuccifor patent infringement, the US Government had sued the Bell Companyand Graham Bell for fraud, collusion and deception in theirobtainment. Moreover, the US Government set out to prove that Meucci-- not Bell -- had discovered the electromagnetic telephone and thatthe German Philipp Reis had discovered the variable resistancetransmitter, later called "microphone." In other words, whereas inNew York the Bell Company claimed that Bell, not Meucci, was theinventor of the telephone, in Washington the Government claimed theopposite. Here is a brief chronology of what had happened inWashington, before the commencement of the Bell vs. Globetrial:</FONT></P><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On 31 August 1885, the US Solicitor General   consented to petitions from several parties and authorized the US   Attorney for Western Tennessee to institute a suit in the name of   the Government to annul the Bell patents.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On 9 September, a bill of complaint against   the Bell Company and Graham Bell was filed.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On 29 September, the Globe Company filed a   petition with the Department of Justice, supporting the action of   the Government and upholding Meucci's priority.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On 9 October, the US Solicitor General   suspended the proceedings, in order to allow the Secretary of the   Interior, doing a preliminary investigation, to forward his   recommendations to the Department of Justice.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On 9 November, the Secretary commenced   public hearings, during which he allowed all interested parties to   express their views, with the aim of determining if there was   ground for a government suit against Bell. The hearings ended on   14 November.</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Two months afterwards, the Secretary wrote tothe Solicitor General recommending the institution of a suit againstGraham Bell and the Bell Company, in the name and on behalf of theGovernment of the United States. He accompanied his letter with allreports, arguments and exhibits put ahead at the hearings.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now, while the Secretary was holding saidhearings, the Bell Company filed its bill of complaint against theGlobe Company and Meucci in the Circuit Court for the SouthernDistrict of New York. Judge Wallace, who had already ruled four timesin favor of Bell for patent infringement in other cases, presidedover this court. It was, therefore, evident that the Bell move wasmore a maneuver to counteract the attack of the Government, than tosue the Globe Company for an (otherwise non-existent) infringement,as claimed in their bill. The Bell Company was confident to winquickly in New York, also to create a situation of <I>resadjudicata</I> in an eventual trial with the Government and to hamperthe action in favor of Meucci in Washington. The Secretary negativelycommented the Bell move in New York, as we will see shortly. Inaddition, Dr. Seth R. Beckwith, general manager of the Globe Company,publicly deplored the Bell move, during his conclusive argumentbefore the Secretary, as follows:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I>Dr. Beckwith'sargument</I></B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>During this hearing   it </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;the Bell   Company&#93; </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>has   shown disrespect to your Honors, for on the 3d day of your sitting   a suit has been entered against Antonio Meucci.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I>Meucci's Answer to Bill ofComplaint</I></B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . . That . . .   . in the recent proceedings before the Interior Department . . . .   the complainants had read and knew the fact that the deponent was   the original inventor . . . .<BR>   And further . . . . it was expressly stated that no attempt to   introduce said Meucci's inventions into public use would be made   until the priority, utility, and practicability of his invention   had been fully established by law. . . . . </I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">Furthermore, Meucci, in his answer to theBill of Complaint filed by the Bell Company in New York, remarkedthat the scheme by the Bell Company was shaped after the hearings inWashington, as shown above.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The trial in New York against Globe and Meucciwent on swiftly, as expected by the Bell Company, and it came to adecision in about one and a half years. On the contrary, the actionof the Government, hampered by the obstructionism of the Belllawyers, dragged for twelve years, up to the end of 1897, when it wasdiscontinued -- without setting the underlying question of who hadpriority to the invention of the telephone. Moreover, the record ofthis trial was never printed and is now only available, withdifficulty, from the National Archives, mostly in typescript ormanuscript, and spread among different record groups andcities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">We must point out that, in the Bell vs. Globetrial, the counsel for Globe, David Humphreys, unlearned on thetechnical side, provided a poor defense to Meucci. He filed only nineout of the about fifty affidavits that were exhibited in favor ofMeucci and elucidated by Dr. Beckwith in Washington, before theInterior Secretary. Mr. Humphreys' main concern was to prove thatGlobe did not infringe the Bell patents, not having sold nor operatedany telephones. In his final argument before Judge Wallace, Mr.Humphreys did not insist on Meucci's priority, unlike Dr. Beckwith,who often objected. Judge Wallace, in his decision, punctuallyremarked the lack of commitment by the Globe Company in favor ofMeucci, as opposed to Dr. Beckwith's "great zeal." Here are hisprecise words:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . The defense,   so far as it rests upon the priority of invention by Meucci, may   be briefly disposed of. The circumstance that this defense is not   relied upon by the Globe Company in its answer, and that its   counsel has insisted in his argument that it should not be   considered because not satisfactorily presented by the proofs,   although indicating that the principal defendant has no confidence   in the asserted priority of invention by Meucci, ought not to   prejudice the position of the defendant Beckwith, who relies upon   this defense, has urged it with great zeal, and is evidently   convinced of its truth . . . . </I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Notwithstanding this lack of commitment byGlobe, Judge Wallace could not ignore the many witnesses that hadtestified to have successfully spoken through various Meucci'stelephones. He thus resorted to a trick that had worked well inanother patent infringement case, the Drawbaugh case, that he haddecided three years before. The trick was to dispose of all suchwitnesses by ruling that the spoken words that they had heard werefrom a string telephone, not an electric telephone. As you know, the"string telephone" is a toy used by kids to talk with the aid of twocans and a rope or wire pulled stout between the cans. By ruling thatway, Judge Wallace also discredited Meucci as having fooled himself,adding insult to injury. This is the relevant passage of hisdecision:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . There is no   reason to doubt that for many years prior to 1865, and from that   year until he applied for the caveat, he had been experimenting   with telephonic and electrical apparatus with a view of   transmitting speech, and during this time had convinced himself   that he had made interesting discoveries, which might eventually   become useful ones. To this extent he is corroborated by the   testimony of a number of witnesses. But the proofs fail to show   that he had reached any practical result beyond that of conveying   speech mechanically by means of a wire telephone. . . . .   </I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The thesis of Meucci's telephone being a stringtelephone was advanced in a previous affidavit sworn by one Prof.Charles R. Cross from MIT -- incidentally, a good friend of Bell.Prof. Cross stated that he had carefully studied Meucci's deposition,in order to reproduce faithfully Meucci's layouts in his PhysicsLaboratory. However, I discovered that Prof. Cross had omitted tomention in his affidavit a reel of wire that Meucci always insertedin circuit to simulate a long distance. There are three drawings andfive different answers in Meucci's deposition where this reel of wirewas clearly shown or quoted. Therefore, Prof. Cross may havepurposely omitted it. If he had inserted a reel of wire in hislayout, the sound could by no means mechanically traverse the sameand reach the receiver. It could only be electrically transmitted. Ifany expert would have raised that objection, Prof. Cross and JudgeWallace's thesis of the string telephone would fall to pieces. Globe,of course, being short of money or short of interest on this subject,did not call any expert to counteract Prof. Cross's affidavit, thusfacilitating Judge Wallace's chore.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Another obstacle to be surmounted by the Belllawyers, and then by Judge Wallace, was Meucci's caveat "SoundTelegraph." This caveat was filed in the Patent Office on 28 December1871, many years before the first Bell patent. Though having expiredon December 1874, Meucci not being able any more to pay the $10annual fee, it was a clear and convincing proof of Meucci's priorityof invention. Prof. Cross testified that the caveat "plainly and welldescribes what is known as a lover's telegraph or string telephone."This time, however, the Globe Company called as their witness ThomasStetson, the patent lawyer who had prepared Meucci's caveat. But herecomes the funny thing: Mr. Stetson's testimony was largely in linewith Prof. Cross's. This completely upset Meucci's claims, since Mr.Stetson had released an affidavit, five years before, which was apaean for Meucci as the true inventor of the telephone.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">I took the trouble of comparing Mr. Stetson'saffidavit of July 1880 with his testimony, rendered between December1885 and January 1886. As shown below, his testimony was in sharpcontrast with his affidavit and constituted a hard blow on Meuccidefense. The few sentences reported here below give you only a faintidea of what can be termed, without hesitation, "Mr. Stetson'svolte-face."<BR></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I>Stetson's affidavit of 21 July1880</I></B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . . I acted as   his patent attorney . . . . to caveat in the United States Patent   Office Mr. Meucci's invention of what is now known as the   telephone; and that from his verbal explanation and the   description contained in the caveat I verily believe him to be the   first and original inventor thereof. . . . .<BR>   </I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I>Stetson's testimony of 24 December1885</I></B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . . I sincerely   believe that he </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&#91;Meucci&#93;   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>did not communicate   to me the idea of a battery or batteries in connection with the   insulated wire or wires. Also that he did not communicate to me   any idea of a ground connection, or of diaphragms, or of permanent   magnets, or electro-magnets, or adjustments. . . . . This wire was   adapted to conduct sound on the principle which is now sometimes   called The Lover's Telephone. . . . . </I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Of course, Mr. Stetson's statements could havebeen disproved by the written description that Meucci had handed tohim to prepare the caveat. But Mr. Stetson testified that he had lostit, together with some important letters on the same subject thatMeucci had written to him. He also testified that he did not rememberany drawing illustrating Meucci's invention and accompanying Meucci'sdescription. Conversely, he exhibited a mysterious letter -- that hesaid he had dictated but not sent to the Globe Company -- containinghis (quite recent) detraction of Meucci's caveat. He thus enabledJudge Wallace to rule that Meucci's pretensions </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"areoverthrown by his own description of the invention at a time when hedeemed it in a condition to patent, and by the evidence of Mr.Stetson."</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here is what happened with some other witnessesin (or connected with) the Bell vs. Globe trial:</FONT></P><OL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The Secretary of the Globe Company, though   being one of the defendants, testified for the Bell   Company.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A potential witness for Meucci, Edward B.   Grant, Vice President of the American District Telegraph Company,   died suddenly of heart attack on 7 October 1884. Meucci had   repeatedly asked him, from 1872 to 1874, to test his telephones on   the company's lines and left with him documents and prototypes.   Shortly before his death, Mr. Grant had told one Mr. Bertolino, a   friend of Meucci, that he had found supporters for Meucci's   invention. Moreover, his death propitiously occurred one day after   the ex superintendent of the company had offered his services to   the Bell Company. One month later he was hired by the Bell   Company, and appointed Vice President and General Manager of their   Missouri Branch. He then testified against Meucci, distorting the   facts and calling Meucci "a crank."</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Domenico Mariani, a witness for the Globe   Company and a good friend of Meucci since 1846, testified that,   about one month before his testimony, he was offered $10,000   (about $200,000 of today) to return to Italy.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Major Zenas Fisk Wilber, the Chief Examiner   of the US Patent Office, who had examined both the Bell patents   and Meucci's caveat, had released affidavits, between July and   August 1885, alleging frauds in the grant of Bell   patents.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Two Italians, Frederico Garlanda and John   Citarotto, testified for the Bell Company that they owned a quite   complete collection of L'Eco d'Italia, an Italian newspaper of New   York, running from 1857 down to 1881. However, they stated that   their collection lacked the issues from 1 December 1860 to the   whole 1863. We must recall that Meucci's invention was reported as   having been published in L'Eco d'Italia between the end of 1860   and the beginning of 1861. If retrieved, it would have rendered   null the Bell patents. That precious issue of L'Eco d'Italia that   lacked from said collection, now lacks from all main libraries in   the United States, whereas the files in the Office of L'Eco   d'Italia had been destroyed by a mysterious fire.</FONT></LI></OL><P><FONT FACE="Arial">All the above incidents greatly facilitated thedecision by Judge Wallace. This notwithstanding, he added somenegative statements of his own against Meucci. In fact, the closingparagraph of his decision read as follows:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . . The   evidence leaves the impression that his speaking telegraph would   never have been offered to the public as an invention if he had   not been led by his necessities to trade on the credulity of his   friends; that he intended to induce the three persons of small   means and little business experience, who became his associates   under the agreement of December 12, 1871, to invest in an   invention which he would not offer to &#91;knowledgeable&#93; men   . . . . ; and that this was done in the hope of obtaining such   loans and assistance from them as he would temporarily   require.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Of course, any Judge has the privilege ofassigning his own weight to the evidence presented at trial; however,he chose to neglect the following evidence:</FONT></P><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>First</I>, Meucci's invention was   offered, in 1861, to the Telegraphs of Naples, who refused the   offer. This is no wonder because, sixteen years afterwards,   Western Union refused to buy the Bell patents.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Second</I>, Meucci offered his invention   in 1872 to the American District Telegraph Company.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Third</I>, the partners of the agreement   signed on December 12, 1871, shortly before the filing of Meucci's   caveat, were: Sereno Breguglia, lessee of the Cigar Stand of the   Hoffman Caf&eacute; in Wall Street, Angelo Zilio Grandi, Secretary   of the Italian Consulate in New York and Angelo Antonio   Tremeschin, a contractor for civil constructions. Where is the   difference with the like agreement that Graham Bell stipulated on   February 27, 1875, with Thomas Sanders, a leather merchant, and   Gardiner Greene Hubbard, an ex patent lawyer and ex railway   businessman? In addition, we must remark that Meucci's agreement,   instituting the </FONT><A HREF="telettrofono_co.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">Telettrofono   Company</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">, was an event of great   historical importance. It recited that the company aimed   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"to secure patent for   &#91;Meucci's invention&#93; in any State of Europe, or other part   of the world, to form copartnerships, to raise companies, to sell   or assign, in part, the rights of such   invention."</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> It proved, as you will   see shortly, that Meucci's invention, unlike Bell's, was ripe to   the point that, in 1871, he had envisaged a worldwide development   of the telephone.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Fourth</I>, no proof whatsoever is found   in the record about Meucci having traded on the credulity of his   friends to cope with the necessities of life, as stated by Judge   Wallace.</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial">From all the above, we can appropriatelyconclude this first part of my presentation by recalling GiovanniSchiavo's definition of Judge Wallace's decision as:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . .   unquestionably one of the most glaring miscarriages in the annals   of American justice," as well as "one of the most dishonest legal   decisions in the annals of America. It is not only dishonest, but   also outrageously offensive.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">We now go on to the second part of mycontribution.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial">The US vs. Bell trial</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Globe Company and Meucci were veryconfident on the action of the Government in Washington and thereforethought that, in the end, it would render worthless the Bell vs.Globe trial in New York. This may explain in part the lack ofcommitment by the Globe Company in defense of Meucci'spriority.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In fact, just when Meucci was ending hisdeposition in New York, the Interior Secretary in Washington waswriting to the Solicitor General, recommending the institution of asuit against Graham Bell and the Bell Company. He attached to hisletter three reports on the hearings, drafted by his two AssistantSecretaries and by the Commissioner of Patents, as well as allarguments and exhibits presented during the hearings. He stigmatizedin his letter the inadequacy of private suits involving the BellCompany, like the one in New York, as follows:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . . It appears   that many suits have been pending and many are now pending between   the corporation claiming this patent and others that assail it. In   none of these cases has there been or can there be, as I think,   such thorough investigation and full adjudication as to the   alleged frauds or mistakes occurring in the Patent Office in the   issuance of the patent, as could be had in a proceeding instituted   and carried on by the Government itself. . . . .<BR>   In my opinion the proceeding should be in the name of and wholly   by the Government, not on the relation or for the benefit of all   or any of the petitioners, but in the interest of the Government   and the people, and wholly at the expense and under the conduct   and control of the Government. . . . . </I></FONT>      <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Please, note that the Secretary'srecommendation was to investigate also on the behavior of the PatentOffice, which was under his own administration, though the allegedfrauds had happened nine years before his appointment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Let me read you the following passages, takenfrom some of the attachments, as they reveal the essential roleplayed by Meucci in determining the Secretary's recommendation toproceed against Bell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">We read in the <B><I>report by AssistantSecretary Jenks</I></B>:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . .

Up to 1871, . . . . although much of the time   very poor, he constructed several different instruments with which   in his own house, he conversed with his wife, and others . . . . .   His testimony is corroborated by his wife, and by affidavits of a   very large number of witnesses. He claims that in 1872, he went to   Mr. Grant, Vice President of the New York District Telegraph   Company, explained his invention, and tried repeatedly to have it   tried on the wires of the Company. This, it is claimed, was used   by the telegraph company, and was the basis of the contract   between the Western Union Telegraph Company and the Bell Telephone   Company, dated November 10, 1879. . . . . </I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Let us now read two passages from the<B><I>report by Assistant Secretary Muldrow</I></B>:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>. . . . So many   witnesses having sworn that the inventions of Meucci, Reis, and   others antedated those of Bell in the speaking telephone . . . . I   therefore believe it to be the duty of the Government to   judicially inquire whether these facts do not warrant the   institution of a suit to cancel the patent of March 7,1876, which   bears the seal of the Government, and which confers upon him a   monopoly of the use of one of the forces of nature at the expense   of whole communities. . . . . </I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Please note that Mr. Muldrow only quotedAntonio Meucci and Philipp Reis, not Elisha Gray, Amos Dolbear,Daniel Drawbaugh or any other of the scores of inventors that claimedto have preceded Bell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, from the argument made by the Globelawyer before the Secretary of the Interior, I shall read some of thestatements by the already mentioned Chief Examiner of the PatentOffice who filed two more affidavits.

However, if we take intoaccount that the Reis transmitter was very difficult to operate, asit was conceived as a make-and-break device, we may gather that themain point of force of the Government's action was AntonioMeucci.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">I have already pointed out in my introductionthat the US vs. Bell trial dragged for twelve years, after which itwas discontinued by consent, following expiration of Bell's patentsin 1893. Before going on to the next topic, I wish to summarize themain events of this proceeding:</FONT></P><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On March 23, 1886, following the Secretary   of the Interior's recommendation, the Government filed its bill of   complaint against Bell and the Bell Company in the District Court   of South Ohio.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On December 7, 1886, the case in Ohio was   closed, following a motion by the Bell lawyers objecting to the   jurisdiction of the Court.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On January 13, 1887, the Government filed a   new bill of complaint in Boston, Massachusetts, where the Bell   Company had its headquarters.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On November 26, 1887 the judges sustained a   demurrer by the Bell lawyers to the bill. The Government   immediately appealed to the Supreme Court of   Washington.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On November 12, 1888, the Supreme Court   reversed the verdict of judges, finding a meritorious claim and   viable issue, rejected the Bell Company's objections to the frauds   and misrepresentation charges, and remanded the case for   trial.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">On December 6, 1889, after many other legal   squabbles, the depositions began. Meucci, however, was deceased on   18 October of the same year.</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial">When Bell's second patent expired, on January30, 1893, the Government prosecutor refused to close the trialfollowing a motion by the Bell lawyers. He maintained that a decisionon the case would provide a reference point for issues of fundamentalimportance to the Country. Unfortunately, though, he died inSeptember 1896 and, with his death, the effort of the Governmentquickly lost impetus.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">On November 30, 1897, a new Attorney Generalannounced that for all effects and purposes, the lawsuit between theGovernment and American Bell was to be considered moot. The trial wasthereupon discontinued without ever reaching the underlying issue ofwho had primacy to the telephone and entitlement to itspatent(s).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In conclusion, the case was not decided.Consequently, the Bell Company could not claim, from the outcome ofthis trial, that Antonio Meucci was not the inventor of thetelephone, or that it was Bell. It could only exult by the astutenessof its lawyers, who were able to defer so long the decision of thecase, until the question of the patent(s) became moot when theyexpired.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Let me now go on to the third part of mycontribution.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial">The scientific proofs</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Among the exhibits at the hearings before theSecretary of the Interior, I found an affidavit, sworn on 28September 1885 by Michael Lemmi, a friend and lawyer of Meucci, whichgreatly increased my assessment of Meucci's merits. At a first sight,it had seemed to me another translation into English of Meucci'slaboratory notebook, known as <I>Meucci's Memorandum Book</I>, onlylimited to his telephonic experiments. I was a little suspiciousbecause, when reading a former translation of the same, which wasmade and exhibited at the Bell vs. Globe trial by the Globe Company,I could hardly understand it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, I soon realized that Lemmi'stranslation was far better than Globe's. Moreover, Lemmi, unlikeGlobe, included in his translation the reproduction of all Meucci'soriginal drawings accompanying his notes. None of these was exhibitedin the first trial. In this slide you can see one of these drawings,attached to Meucci's note dated 27 September 1870.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/lemmi_drw.gif" WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=282 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>Meucci's drawingdated 27 September 1870, as reported in Lemmi'saffidavit</B></FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">You need not to be an engineer to understandthat layout no. 1 represents a long distance telephone link with aground return. Note the label "long distance" and the schematizedelectromagnetic telephones at both ends of the line. You may alsonote that layouts no. 2 and no. 3 differ from no. 1 by the insertionmidway of a coil, with either a horseshoe core (layout no. 2) or acylindrical core (layout no. 3). Telecommunication engineers knowvery well the technique illustrated in these two layouts. It iscalled the "inductive loading" of telephone lines and it allows togreatly increase the maximum distance as well as to improve thequality of speech. This technique, however, is generally attributedto Michael Idvorsky Pupin, an American of Yugoslav origin, whopatented it in 1900. He then sold his two patents to the BellCompany, who successfully applied this technique in its lines formany decades. I was profoundly astonished to see that Meucci haddiscovered it in 1870.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">My stupefaction, however, increased when I readin Lemmi's translation of Meucci's notebook an entry, dated 20 May1862: </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"At the midpointof the wire, a strongly magnetized iron inside a coil. Do not needany battery at all, and is a good conductor of thesound."</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> I could not believe it: Meuccihad discovered the effectiveness of the inductive load since 1862, tothe point that he could eliminate the battery! Thus, the main noveltyin his experiment of 27 September 1870 was that shown in layout no. 4of this drawing, where the inductive load was split into two parts,one before the transmitter and one after the receiver. We know well,today, that this contrivance allows to further improving theperformance of the line, and, indeed, it was suggested by Pupin inhis patents of 1900.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">If anyone had any doubts about the invention ofthe telephone by Antonio Meucci, this affidavit by Michael Lemmidefinitely dispels them. It not only proves that Meucci invented thetelephone, but that he was well ahead of his times for what concernsthe conception of the system. It disproves, once more, JudgeWallace's statement in the first trial of Meucci's telephones havingeither been string telephones or copied from Bell. In fact, whereasthe inductor inserted midway along the line greatly improves theelectrical transmission of speech, it would have worsened or hamperedthe mechanical transmission of the same, a fact Prof. Crossconveniently did not include in his testimony for Bell. Lemmi'saffidavit also allows to reverse the thesis of Meucci having drawnhis ideas from Bell, since he should have drawn the idea of theinductive load thirty-eight years before Bell was even aware of it.For much the same reason, Lemmi's affidavit also disproves Belllawyers' allegation that Meucci's Memorandum Book was a forgery. Onthe contrary, it shows that this notebook contained valuableinventions that the Bell people could not even imagine at the time ofthe Bell vs. Globe trial or for many years following.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The retrieval of Lemmi's affidavit, in additionto being enlightening to me, also marked the beginning of a new phaseof my research. I thought that I could further contribute to thecause of vindication of Antonio Meucci, by searching in the availabledocumentation for any other statements or drawings that might concealany of "not-yet-invented" techniques. In the affirmative, I was quiteconfident that I would find them free of manipulation by the Belllawyers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was lucky in my endeavor, since I found fourmore techniques of that kind, which I deem of paramount importance. Ihave summarized them in the following table together with theaforementioned inductive loading.<BR></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000099">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF3300"><B><I>Innovations</I></B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF3300"><B><I>Year(s) of         introduction<BR>         by Antonio Meucci</I></B></FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF3300"><B><I>Year(s) of         introduction<BR>         by American Bell Telephone Co.</I></B></FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Anti-sidetone         circuit</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1857-1858</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">ca. 1900,         1918</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Call         signaling</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">(1854),         1871</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1877-1878</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Structure of the line         conductor</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1862, 1870,         1871</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1878,         1881-1884</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Inductive load of         long-distance line</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1862, 1870</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">ca. 1900 </FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Quietness of the         environment</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1871</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1877, 1883</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As you can see, Meucci discovered thesetechniques from six to forty-two years before the Bell Company. I amnot going to explain these latter techniques in much detail. If youwish, you can read all details in my paper "Four Firsts inTelephony," of which you have here a few reprints. However, it may beworth examining another important drawing, made in 1858, thatencompasses both the second and third technique in this table.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">This drawing is known as the <I>Corradi'sdrawing</I>, because it was made by Nestore Corradi, a painter byprofession, after a sketch made by Antonio Meucci. In this drawing,we notice two labels: </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"Lineof several miles"</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> and</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"electric current fromthe inductor pipe,"</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> which latter hadalways been a mystery to me until I got hold of Lemmi's affidavit.Thanks to it, I could easily understand that in this drawing Meucciimplied that his long-distance line was inductively loaded.<BR></FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/corradi_drw.gif" WIDTH=555 HEIGHT=306 ALIGN=bottom></FONT><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000"><B>Meucci's layoutfor long-distance communication ("Corradi's drawing,"1858)</B></FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In this drawing we see two persons, eachholding two instruments, one for transmitting, the other forreceiving speech. The user at the right end of the drawing isspeaking, whereas the one at the left is listening. You may note thatthere is a complete separation of the two directions of transmission(indicated by arrows), unlike Meucci's previous layouts, in which hehad inserted all four instruments in series in the same circuit. Thepresent two-circuit layout was aimed to counteract the so-called"side-tone," that is, the hearing of the echo of the speaker's ownvoice in his own receiver, as well as any background noise picked upby his transmitter. This layout is known today as the "four-wirecircuit" and it is one of the several anti side-tone circuits thatthe Bell Company was to adopt after the year 1900. You, as I, may beastonished that Meucci had conceived it 42 years before.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Another technique shown in this drawing is thatof <I>call signaling</I>, that is required to alert the distantsubscriber to an incoming call. Meucci conceived an effective andinexpensive method to accomplish this task. As is shown, he used aMorse key, attached to each end of the line, momentarilyshort-circuiting the local transmitter. In this way, strong pulses ofcurrent were sent along the line, and the distant receiver would emitintermittent ticks, much louder than the ordinary speech, thusalerting the distant user. Meucci's caveat specification of 1871 wasfully consistent with this drawing, as it recited:</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"To call attention, theparty at the other end of the line may be warned by an electrictelegraph signal or a series of them."</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">Incidentally, this and other sentences in the caveat unmistakablyprove that the caveat specification was written having this drawingin front, contrary to Mr. Stetson's ambiguous testimony.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">There was nothing said in the Bell patents onany method of call signaling, and no call signaling was provided in1877 to the first Bell subscribers. They used to make the call byeither thumping on the diaphragm with a pencil or by shouting intoit, unlike the elegant solution suggested by Meucci since 1858.Meucci, unlike Bell, was well aware of the need of a call signaling.In fact, in 1854 he provided his wife with a means of signaling thatshe wanted to speak through the telephone link that he hadestablished between her bedroom and his laboratory.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As for the <I>structure of the telephoneline</I>, Meucci soon realized that the telephone signal was muchmore demanding than the telegraph signal. He, therefore, recommendedfor the telephone line a better material, such as copper instead ofiron, a larger cross section of the wire, as well as a number ofspecific structures of the line conductor. In fact, in his caveat of1871, Meucci stated: </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"Ibelieve that some metals will serve better than others, but proposeto try all kinds of metals. . . . . I believe it preferable to havethe wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electrictelegraph . . . . ."</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, we find, in his Memorandum Book, anumber of entries relating to his experiments to counteract what wenow call the "skin effect." He suggested to chemically orelectrochemically treat the conductor, in order to increase theconductivity of its outer layer. The first entry of this kind inMeucci's Memorandum Book dates 7 March 1862. He obtained, however,his best results on 17 August 1870, by subdividing the line wire intomany smaller insulated wires with the same overall cross-section ofthe single wire, i.e. by using a plait of insulated copper wires.Today, you can buy a similar wire from many suppliers, such asRadioShack: it is called "Monster Speaker-Cable," as it featuresexceptionally good response at both low and high frequencies of theaudio range. Meucci jotted down in his notebook on 17 August 1870,when he experimented with this wire: </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>"bythis means I have obtained a distance of about onemile."</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As for the Bell Company, they went on usingiron wires up to 1884, when they inaugurated their first copper linebetween New York and Boston. Therefore, once more, Meucci was aheadof times by at least thirteen years.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">The last technique of this table,<I>quietness of the environment</I>, is of paramount importance, alsogiven the low efficiency of the electromagnetic transmitter andreceiver of the time. Indeed, some of you may remember peopleshouting in the telephone soundproof booths of the past century.Again, the wording of the caveat is enlightening, as itrecites:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#FF0099">&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>.   . . . When my sound telegraph is in operation, the parties should   remain alone in their re-spective rooms, and every practicable   precaution should be taken to have the surroundings per-fectly   quiet.</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp; <FONT FACE="Arial">On the Bell side, the need for a quietenvironment was first recognized by Thomas Watson, the assistant ofBell, in 1877, six years after Meucci's 1871 caveat.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">From all the achievements shown in theabove table, we can conclude that when, in 1871, Meucci had foundedthe <I>Telettrofono Company </I>and had filed his caveat, he hadalready invented everything that was needed to start a high-qualitypublic service. This is why, in 1872, he asked the American DistrictTelegraph Company to test his system on their lines. This is why herenewed his caveat up to December 1874. This is why, after Bellobtained his first patent because Meucci could no longer pay the feeto keep up his caveat, Meucci repeatedly claimed that the telephonewas his invention, not Bell's.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial">Conclusions</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As long as my research progressed, as I haveconcisely represented to you, Antonio Meucci's stature as a man ofscience has gradually risen in my mind to that of a giant. It istherefore imperative that his achievements be made known as broadlyas possible in both the scientific and the legal fields. On my part,I have obtained a few recognitions, that, however, I considerinsufficient to the scope.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In Italy, though the predisposition of thepublic towards Antonio Meucci is very good, there are still a numberof Bell supporters. My many papers in the official magazine of theItalian Electrical Association (AEI) have substantially improved thesituation, but not enough. AEI has a Virtual Historical Museum inInternet, where the "Meucci Hall" has been one of thefirst.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/museum_aei.gif" ALT="AEI Virtual Museum" WIDTH=237 HEIGHT=308 ALIGN=middle></FONT><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Entrance to AEIVirtual Museum, linking to "Antonio MeucciHall"</B></FONT></P></CENTER><P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">In Europe, my already mentioned paper"Four Firsts in Telephony," invited by the <I>European Transactionson Telecommunications</I>, has introduced Meucci, otherwise unknownthere. It is only a first step, of course.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In Havana, we have obtained a complete success(see </FONT><A HREF="havana1.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">Havana'sExhibition</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"> of 1999).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the United States, there is still a markedhostility towards Meucci. I have only succeeded in publishing atwo-page paper in <I>Antenna</I>, the telecommunication branch of<I>Society for the History of Technology</I>. The <I>SmithsonianInstitution</I> appears more open, but there is still some effort tobe done in order to improve their present attitude of "wait and see".In addition, I have recently drafted a dozen entries for the<I>Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia</I>, Italian version, dealing withMeucci, Bell and the telephone. This ensued after an importantdecision by the Microsoft Corporation, following the praising wordson Meucci pronounced by its president, Bill Gates a few years ago. Iwas told that my entries would also be considered for the US versionof <I>Encarta</I>. If this will happen, it will be a great leapforward.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, I have a put a dozen pages on Meucci(in English) on Internet, getting some responses from museums andsome private visitors, now amounting to about 2000.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">All this, however, is a drop in the ocean. Ihope that young scientists will do more in the future, in order tobestow on Meucci the broad recognition that he deserves. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As for the legal actions, Hon. Massaro'scommitment to bring greater light to the unprinted record of the USvs. Bell trial and the promotion of a Congressional Resolutionacknowledging Meucci's priority is undoubtedly the way to go. Ipresume that much effort in this direction is required, as it hasbeen and will be expended by the distinguished </FONT><A HREF="am_committee.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>150thAnniversary Antonio Meucci MemorialCommittee</I></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">, which has made possiblemy visit to New York.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is comforting to all to be aware that thistime we have solid arguments in both the legal and the scientificfields. In the end, the truth must prevail. Better, I should say, "wemust win," because our cause is just, not only for the glory ofItaly, who gave birth to one of its most illustrious sons, not onlyfor the honor of the United States, of which Meucci was a worthycitizen. We must win for the dignity of mankind, which cannot affordto perpetuate so much an injustice, to pay tribute to the wrongperson, for having greatly fostered the communication among peoples.Antonio Meucci is first to deserve that merit.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thank you.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><HR><IMG SRC="immagini/claris_logo.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=middle></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000">made with</FONT><A HREF="http://www.filemaker.com/"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC">FileMakerHome Page</FONT></A></P><UL>   <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000">Date last   modified: </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#CC0000">7 May   2003</FONT></LI></UL><CENTER><A HREF="lecture_ny_university.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC">Topof Page</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">||</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC"></FONT><A HREF="curriculum.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC">MyCurriculum</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"> ||</FONT><A HREF="meucci.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC">AntonioMeucci</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">|<U>|</U></FONT><A HREF="physics.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC">Physics/Information/Bible</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000CC"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">|<U>|</U></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/stmo_bar.gif" WIDTH=514 HEIGHT=19 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P></CENTER><P>&nbsp;</P><P></P></BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 55 http://www.chezbasilio.org:80/lecture_ny_university.htm responseCode 3 200

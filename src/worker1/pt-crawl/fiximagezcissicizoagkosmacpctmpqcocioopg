<P>One of the most overlooked philosophers of her time, Harriet Hardy Taylor Mill is perhaps one of the most influential writers of her time 
which contributed greatly to the utilitarian movement.&nbsp; Harriet and her 
second husband, John Stuart Mill significantly contributed to the social, 
economic, and political issues of the early part of the ninetieth century by 
their writings.&nbsp; Harriet, who had moved into increasingly radical circles 
at her utilitarian church, focused her writing on women’s rights, sexuality, and 
politics.&nbsp; After her marriage to John Taylor ended in 1833, Harriet met her 
future husband, philosopher John Stuart Mill.&nbsp; Among Harriet's many 
accomplishments include her essay and book on women's suffrage movement this 
includes her works, <I>Enfranchisement of Women </I>and "The Subjection of 
Women."&nbsp; One of the prevailing controversies during her life was her 
relationship with John Mill.&nbsp; The main controversy surrounds the theory 
that Harriet and Mill had sexual relations before they became married.&nbsp; It 
is theorized that Harriet contracted syphilis from her former husband because 
she became sick at the time of her second marriage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Harriet was fiercely independent who wrote about issues 
before her time.&nbsp; One of her books that she was working on when she died in 
France in November of 1858 was titled "The Subjection of Women."&nbsp; The 
women’s rights movement would not start until the early 1920’s but Harriet’s 
writings seem to supercede to a time when no one else was thinking about the 
issue.&nbsp; Harriet may have been interested in Mill because he was the first 
person who treated her as an intellectual equal.&nbsp; Their relationship was so 
strong, that Mill contributes much of his writing to her. John Mill and Harriet 
Taylor were married two years after the death of her former husband.&nbsp; Among 
some of Harriet’s many accomplishments were her political advances for 
women.&nbsp; Being an original member of the Kensington Society, Harriet was 
instrumental in the passing of 1870 Education Act, which allowed her to serve as 
a member of the London School Board.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>During Harriet’s first marriage, to John Taylor, Harriet bore 
a total of three children.&nbsp; It was after her last child that she started to 
show signs of sickness.&nbsp; John Taylor would later die of cancer in 
1849.&nbsp; Her illnesses would travel with Harriet throughout her life.&nbsp; 
Born on October 8, 1807 Harriet would be crippled from the affects of 
syphilis.&nbsp; Later in life she would contract and die from tuberculosis in 
France.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Perhaps the most important person during the early part of 
the nineteenth century, Harriet did much to shape the future of the women’s 
suffrage movement. &nbsp;Among her most famous and important essays was 
published in 1851 called, <I>Enfranchisement of Women.</I><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp; </SPAN>This important piece of literature was 
instrumental in the early days of women’s suffrage movement because for the 
first time her writings were backed by men in key political positions.&nbsp; 
Within one year it was being published both in Europe and in America.&nbsp; Much 
of what Mill and Harriet wrote has been combined together over the last 
century.&nbsp; Harriet’s work was vitally important to the early suffrage 
movement.&nbsp; In life, Harriet was held back only by her poor health, and the 
sexual controversy surrounding her second husband.</P>

</B>In dictionary format, this work focuses on two primary 
elements of Harriet Mill’s life.&nbsp; The two elements which are focused on is 
the relationship she had with her second and the literature the two came up 
with.&nbsp; A strong emphasis is placed on her intelligence and her contribution 
to the world of philosophy.&nbsp; This is a good resource for quick, like facts 
about her life.&nbsp; Although this is technically considered an encyclopedia, 
the scope of the work is narrow enough to consider this a legitimate and 
valuable source of work.&nbsp; A sizable section of the book is dedicated to the 
life and work of Harriet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>

On which account <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/euripides.html#1">Euripides</A> says, in the first edition of his <I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/autolycus.html#1">Autolycus</A></I>-
<BR> &nbsp; For when there are ten thousand ills in Greece,
<BR> &nbsp; There's none that's worse than the whole race of athletes.
<BR> &nbsp; For, first of all, they learn not to live well,
<BR> &nbsp; Nor could they do so; for could any man
<BR> &nbsp; Being a slave to his own jaws and appetite
<BR> &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../dd.gif">Acquire wealth beyond his father's riches!
<BR> &nbsp; How could a man like that increase his substance?
<BR> &nbsp; Nor yet can they put up with poverty,
<BR> &nbsp; Or ever accommodate themselves to fortune;
<BR> &nbsp; And so being unaccustomed to good habits,
<BR> &nbsp; They quickly fall into severe distress.
<BR> &nbsp; In youth they walk about in fine attire,
<BR> &nbsp; And think themselves a credit to the city;
<BR> &nbsp; But when old age in all its bitterness
<BR> &nbsp; Overtakes their steps, they roam about the streets,
<BR> &nbsp; Like ragged cloaks whose nap is all worn off.
<BR> &nbsp; And much I blame the present fashions, too,
<BR> &nbsp; Which now in Greece prevail; where many a feast
<BR> &nbsp; Is made to pay great honour to such men,
<BR> &nbsp; And to show false respect to vain amusements.
<BR> &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../ee.gif">For though a man may wrestle well, or run,
<BR> &nbsp; Or throw a discus, or strike a heavy blow,
<BR> &nbsp; Still where's the good his country can expect
<BR> &nbsp; From all his victories and crowns and prizes?
<BR> &nbsp; Will they fight with their country's enemies
<BR> &nbsp; With discus in hand? Or will their speed assist
<BR> &nbsp; To make the hostile bands retreat before them ?
<BR> &nbsp; When men stand face to face with the hostile sword
<BR> &nbsp; They think no more of all these fooleries.
<BR> &nbsp; It were better to adorn good men and wise
<BR> &nbsp; With these victorious wreaths; they are the due
<BR> &nbsp; Of those who govern states with wisdom sound,
<BR> &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../ff.gif">And practise justice, faith, and temperance;
<BR> &nbsp; Who by their prudent language ward off evils,
<BR> &nbsp; Banishing wars and factions. These are the men,
<BR> &nbsp; Who're not alone a grace and ornament
<BR> &nbsp; To their own land, but to the whole of Greece.

<BR> &nbsp; And well he does deserve the honours due
<BR> &nbsp; Of a front seat at games and festivals,
<BR> &nbsp; And at the public cost to be maintained;
<BR> &nbsp; And to receive a public gift of honour,
<BR> &nbsp; Which shall become an heirloom to his children.
<BR> &nbsp; And such shall be his honours, even if
<BR> &nbsp; He wins by horses, not by his own strength.
<BR> &nbsp; And still I think he does not equal me;
<BR> &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../bb.gif">For wisdom far exceeds in real value
<BR> &nbsp; The bodily strength of man, or horses' speed;
<BR> &nbsp; But the mob judges of such things at random;
<BR> &nbsp; Though 'tis not right to prefer strength to sense:
<BR> &nbsp; For though a man may a good boxer be,
<BR> &nbsp; Or pentathlete, or unconquered wrestler,
<BR> &nbsp; Or if he vanquish all in speed of foot-
<BR> &nbsp; Which is the most important of all contests-
<BR> &nbsp; Still for all this his city will enjoy
<BR> &nbsp; No better laws through his great strength or speed;
<BR> &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../cc.gif">And 'tis small cause for any lasting joy,
<BR> &nbsp; That one of all her citizens should gain
<BR> &nbsp; A prize on <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pisa.html#2">Pisa</A>'s banks: for such achievements
<BR> &nbsp; Fill not the country's granaries with corn.

<P> And Xenophanes contends at great length, and with great earnestness and variety of argument, in favour of the superior advantage of his own wisdom, running down athletic exercises as useless and unprofitable. And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/achaeus.html#2">Achaeus</A> the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eretria.html#1">Eretrian</A>, speaking of the good constitution of the athletes, says-

<BR> &nbsp; And move along exulting in their youth,
<BR> &nbsp; Their valiant shoulders swelling in their prime
<BR> &nbsp; Of health and strength; while they anoint with oil
<BR> &nbsp; Their chests and feet and limbs abundantly,
<BR> &nbsp; As being used to luxury at home.

<P> And Alcimus the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sicily.html#1">Sicilian</A>, in that book of his which is entitled the Italian History, says that all the women in Italy avoid drinking wine on this account: "When <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heracles.html#1">Heracles</A> was in the district of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/croton.html#1">Croton</A>, he one day was very thirsty, and came to a certain house by the wayside and asked for something to drink; and it happened that the wife of the master of the house had secretly opened a cask of wine, and therefore she said to her husband that it would be a shameful thing for him to open this cask for a stranger; and so she told him to give Heracles some water. <IMG SRC="../bb.gif">But Heracles, who was standing at the door, and heard all this, praised her husband very much, but advised him to go indoors himself and look at the cask.

<BR> &nbsp; First, as the nurse of youths, I must receive
<BR> &nbsp; A vigorous cheesecake, and a pregnant mealcake,
<BR> &nbsp; And sixteen thrushes whole, well smeared with honey,
<BR> &nbsp; Twelve hares, all taken when the moon was full;
<BR> &nbsp; But all the other things may be got cheaply.
<BR> &nbsp; Now listen. Three half-measures of fine onions;
<BR> &nbsp; These for Orthannes. For Conisalus
<BR> &nbsp; And his two mates, a plate of myrtleberries,
<BR> &nbsp; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="442">[442]</A> Plucked with the hand: for the great Gods above
<BR> &nbsp; Dislike the smell of lamps.  You must offer

<BR> &nbsp; Three <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obolus">obols</A>; for the mighty hero Celes,
<BR> &nbsp; Some hides and incense. Now if you bring
<BR> &nbsp; These things, you'll certainly obtain admittance;
<BR> &nbsp; But if you don't, you'll knock in vain, and long

<P> And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/axionicus.html#1">Axionicus</A> says, in his <I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philinna.html#1">Philinna</A></I>-

And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/ctesias.html#1">Ctesias</A> tells the same story, in his book <I>Concerning the Revenues in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#2">Asia</A></I>.

On which account once, when they were attacked by the enemy, and could not endure the labour of defending their walls, Leonidas, their general, ordered the innkeepers' booths to be erected as tents upon the walls, and even then it was with difficulty that they were stopped from deserting, as Damon tells us, in his book on Byzantium. But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menander.html#3">Menander</A>, in his play called the <I>Woman carrying the Peplos of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athena.html#1">Athena</A></I>, or the <I>Female Flute-player</I>, says-

<BR> &nbsp; On your account we drank the whole night long,
<BR> &nbsp; And right strong wine too, as it seems to me,-
<BR> &nbsp; At least I got up with four heads, I think.

<P> And the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/argos.html#1">Argives</A> too are ridiculed by the comic poets as addicted to drunkenness; and so are the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tiryns.html#1">Tirynthians</A> by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/ephippus.html#1">Ephippus</A>, in his <I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/busiris.html#1">Busiris</A></I>.

<BR> &nbsp; Do you not know me, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiro">Tirynthian</A> Argive?
<BR> &nbsp; That race fights all its battles when it's drunk.
<BR> &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../ee.gif">(B) &nbsp; And that is why they always run away.

<P> And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eubulus.html#1">Eubulus</A>, in his <I>Man Glued</I>, says that the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/miletus.html#1">Milesians</A> are very insolent when they are drunk.

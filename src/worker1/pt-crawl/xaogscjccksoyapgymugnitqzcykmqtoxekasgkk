<p>Born as the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza in 1462, Caterina Sforza
became a unique women for her time. Caterina left her home for Rome after her
father's death.&nbsp; She began her life fulfilling her duties as wife and
mother of eight but than she began to fulfill roles usually reserved to men.
With her husband, Catarina seized control of Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome during
the turmoils of 1484.&nbsp; In Forli it was Caterina who issued justice,
especially after the revolt in 1487 in which her husband failed to do
anything.&nbsp; Caterina was also involved in a plot and tried to poison Pope
Alexander VI.&nbsp; Caterina was then captured and imprisoned in Castel Sant'
Angelo for one year.&nbsp; Catarina died in 1509 at the age of 46. Renaissance
men referred to Caterina as
&quot;the Virago,&quot; or women warrior, for all her accomplishments. </p>

</b>This website is very informative about the life of Caterina,
however, in does not go into much detail.&nbsp; It is a good guideline for
learning more about her life broadly.&nbsp; It speaks very little of her
childhood or her family.&nbsp; It mainly focuses on her life and accomplishments
after the death of her husband.&nbsp; There is also mention of her time in
capture at the Vatican.&nbsp; This is recommended for a person who has previous
knowledge of Caterina Sforza.&nbsp;</p>

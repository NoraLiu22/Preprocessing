		<a name="Angkor"><strong>Angkor</strong></a> is a temple complex in northwestern 
		Cambodia, near the town of Siem Reap. Angkor Wat is a major temple within 
		this group. Angkor flourished between the 9th century and the 13th century. 
		Besides being a religious center, it was also a royal residence and administrative 
		center for the area from Vietnam to the Bay of Bengal, and north to Yunnan 
		(in China). Originally based on the Hindu religion, it became more Buddhist 
		influenced. Angkor was a symbolic universe, with a central mountain or pyramid 
		temple, and waterways to represent the central ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible had the <a name="Cathedral_of_St._Basil">
		<strong>Cathedral of St. Basil</strong></a><strong> the Blessed</strong> 
		in 1554-1560 to commemorate military victories over the Tartars. On Red 
		Square in Moscow, it is a beautiful building with ten domes, each a different 
		size and color.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		<a name="Cliff_Dwellings"><strong>Cliff Dwellings</strong></a> built by 
		Native Americans are found in the southwestern United States, in Arizona, 
		Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. Found in dry areas, they are often tucked 
		under cliffs, and situated so that they can be easily defended. Garments 
		of cotton and leather, pottery and wood utensils have been found in these 
		&quot;apartment houses&quot; carved out of the sandstone rock. The larger buildings 
		have room for dozens of families. They were abandoned about 1300; no one 
		knows why.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		<a name="Easter_Island"><strong>Easter Island</strong></a> in the Pacific 
		Ocean, 2300 miles (3700 km) from the western coast of South America, has 
		over 600 statues, the largest of which is 37 feet tall. There are unfinished 
		statues that are even larger. Carved of native stone, most of these huge 
		statues depict faces. Tradition on the island say that the statues represent 
		important people who have been deified after death, and memorialized by 
		the statues. It was an amazing engineering feat for people without machinery 
		to transport and raise statues of that size.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">
		Back</a><br />
		<br />
		<strong>The </strong><a name="Eiffel_Tower"><strong>Eiffel Tower</strong></a>, 
		in Paris, France, is built of wrought iron in an open lattice pattern. It 
		was commissioned for the Centennial Exposition to commemorate the French 
		Revolution. Designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel, the 984 foot tower (300 
		meters) astonished people by the speed at which it was built. Erected in 
		1889, for many years it was the tallest structure in the world. Incidentally, 
		Monsieur Eiffel also designed the framework for the Statue of Liberty; he 
		is the only person to have designed two of the monuments in this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Forbidden_City"><strong>Forbidden City</strong></a> lies within 
		the Inner City of Beijing, China. Surrounded by a 35 foot (11 meter) wall, 
		it originally contained many palaces, including those of the emperor and 
		his family (1421-1911 AD). Now it serves as museums and parks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Golden_Pavilion"><strong>Golden Pavilion</strong></a> is a 
		Buddhist shrine in Japan. The temple is set in a garden, with a reflecting 
		lake. Built of wood, the temple has been rebuilt exactly as it was, at intervals 
		of a specific number of years. The current Golden Pavilion is identical 
		to the original.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Great_Buddha"><strong>Great Buddha</strong></a> (the Daibutsu), 
		at a shrine at Kamakura, Japan, is 42 feet high. Built in 1252, the bronze 
		statue shows a serene, seated Buddha, meditating.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		Mali's king Mansa Musa ordered the building of the
		<a name="Great_Mosque"><strong>Great Mosque</strong></a><strong> of Timbuktu</strong> 
		after his pilgrimage to Mecca. It was started in 1324, and completed in 
		about 1332, after Musa had died.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Great_Wall"><strong>Great Wall</strong></a><strong> of China</strong>, 
		built along the along the northern border of the empire, runs for over 4,000 
		miles (6,437 km), and is perhaps the largest man-made structure in the world. 
		The authoritarian emperor Shih Huang Ti ordered the building of the wall 
		in 214 BC, which in places involved connecting pieces of earlier walls, 
		some of which date to the 4th century BC. The work involved the forced labor 
		of huge numbers of peasants, of whom many thousands died during its construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Great_Zimbabwe"><strong>Great Zimbabwe</strong></a>, in the 
		African nation of Zimbabwe, between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, is a 
		series of stone enclosures, seemingly built as a political and religious 
		center in the 1200's. The walls of the enclosure are up to 30 feet high 
		(9.15 meters) high, built without mortar, some of them with elaborate patterns 
		in the stonework. Because there are no written records, we can only surmise 
		the purpose and uses of the Great Zimbabwe, and its passageways, stairs, 
		and walls inside of walls. It seems certain that part of it was used as 
		a residence for a chief, probably of the Shona tribe. The Great Zimbabwe 
		complex was abandoned, very likely because the land around it had become 
		less fertile.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		<a name="Machu_Pichu"><strong>Machu Pichu</strong></a> is an ancient fortress 
		city of the Incas in the high Andes of Peru. Re-discovered in 1911 by Hiram 
		Bingham, this &quot;lost city&quot; is believed to have been built as an escape by 
		the Incas from the Spanish conquerors. Eight thousand feet up in the mountains, 
		the city contains a temple, citadel, terraced gardens and irrigation system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		<a name="Mayan_Temple"><strong>Mayan Temple</strong></a>s are found in the 
		Yucatan peninsula (the piece that sticks out to the east, dividing the Gulf 
		of Mexico from the Caribbean) of Mexico, and south into Central America. 
		The Mayans made accurate astronomical observations, invented zero, made 
		a sophisticated calendar, and wrote in a hieroglyphic language. Unfortunately, 
		the Spanish burned almost all the Mayan books, so our knowledge of the Mayan 
		civilization is limited. The cities containing the elaborately carved Mayan 
		temples were abandoned about 800 AD, and the temples were covered up by 
		the surrounding jungle.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The huge <a name="Minaret"><strong>Minaret</strong></a><strong> of the Great 
		Mosque of Samarra</strong> was built in the 800's under the Abbasid caliphs. 
		It was built when the capital of the Muslim empire shifted to Iraq, and 
		the Muslim religion was no longer specifically Arab. Samarra is just north 
		of Baghdad, in Iraq.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a> <br />
		<br />
		<a name="Notre_Dame"><strong>Notre Dame</strong></a> is located on the Ile 
		de la Cit�, an island in the Seine, in Paris, France. It was started in 
		1163 and mostly finished by 1240 (two spires which were in the original 
		design have never been built.) With its pointed arches and light-filled 
		construction, it is considered a masterpiece of the High Middle Ages. It 
		has the original 13th century stained glass in its three rose windows. Notre 
		Dame de Paris means Our Lady of Paris. It was built as a Christian cathedral 
		to honor the Virgin Mary, mother of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Parthenon"><strong>Parthenon</strong></a>, on the Acropolis 
		at Athens, Greece, was the chief temple of Athena. Built at the direction 
		of Pericles, it was completed in 432 BC. Originally it contained a huge 
		statue of Athena, as well as the sculptures on the outside, all supervised 
		by Phidias. Built in the Doric style, out of white marble, most of the sculpture 
		is now gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Pyramids"><strong>Pyramids</strong></a> are the only one of 
		the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World still in existence. Built about 2500 
		BC, the pyramids are older than any of the other man-made monuments. Located 
		on the west side of the Nile Valley, the pyramid of Khufu (Cheops, in Greek) 
		was 481 feet tall, and 775 feet on each side of its base. Stone has been 
		removed over the years, including the finished stone on the exterior, so 
		it is somewhat smaller now. Built as a tomb for the pharaoh, it is joined 
		by other, smaller pyramids built for other pharaohs, and members of the 
		royal family.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a> <br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Roman_Coliseum"><strong>Roman Coliseum</strong></a> is an ancient 
		amphitheater built around 80 AD to hold 50,000 people or more. It had four 
		tiers of marble seats surrounding the arena, with rooms, ramps, and elevators 
		below the arena floor for men and animals waiting to go into the arena. 
		Once the wooden arena floor was removed, and the arena filled with water, 
		for a mock sea battle. It is 615 feet long (190 meters), 157 feet high, 
		made of concrete, bricks and stone. When the Romans used it, there was an 
		enormous canvas canopy to shield spectators from the sun. The Romans staged 
		cruel spectacles in the Coliseum, where men fought animals and each other 
		to the death.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Statue_of_Christ"><strong>Statue of Christ</strong></a><strong> 
		the Redeemer</strong> on Corcovado Mt. stands over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
		The one hundred foot (30 meter) concrete statue, designed by Paul Landowski, 
		was finished in 1931. When lighted at night, the statue appears to be a 
		giant cross guarding the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Statue_of_Liberty"><strong>Statue of Liberty</strong></a> (originally 
		named Liberty Enlightening the World) is 305 feet (93 meters) tall from 
		base to the top of the torch. Showing a woman holding a tablet and lifting 
		a torch aloft, it was sculpted of copper hammered over steel by Frederic-Auguste 
		Bartholdi, with a framework made by Eiffel. It was a gift from France to 
		the United States in 1884. Visitors can go up to the crown, and see a panoramic 
		view of the New York harbor.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		<a name="Stonehenge"><strong>Stonehenge</strong></a> was built in the late 
		Neolithic (&quot;new stone&quot;) Age/Early Bronze Age, about 1800-1400 BC. Located 
		on the Salisbury plain, west of London, England, it consists of gigantic 
		standing stones, arranged roughly in two concentric circles. Some of the 
		stones are Bluestones, a form of igneous rock that comes from southern Wales. 
		The effort to get these stones to Stonehenge must have been enormous. Some 
		of the pairs of stones have lintel stones across them, and some are arranged 
		as if to mark the sun's position on the horizon for the Summer solstice. 
		Stonehenge must have been religious in intent, but the meaning of the stones' 
		arrangement remains unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Sydney_Opera_House"><strong>Sydney Opera House</strong></a> 
		was completed in 1973 from the design by Jorn Utzon. The highest shell roof 
		stands 221 feet high above the Sydney harbor; complicated computer calculations 
		were required to build it and the white ceramic tiles to cover it. Made 
		of concrete and glass, the building was designed to offer spectacular views 
		from inside, and also to be itself part of a spectacular view of the harbor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		The <a name="Taj_Mahal"><strong>Taj Mahal</strong></a>, in Agra, India, 
		was built by Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz-I-Mahal. It was started 
		in 1632, after she died in childbirth, and finished in 1653. The exterior 
		is white marble, set with jade, turquoise, lapis lazuli, chrysolite and 
		mother-of-pearl. It has four minarets, each 133 feet high, and reflecting 
		pools to mirror the beauty of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
		<a name="Tower_Bridge"><strong>Tower Bridge</strong></a> across the Thames 
		River in London, England is often confused with London Bridge. Construction 
		of Tower Bridge was begun in 1886 and finished in 1894. London Bridge was 
		built in 1831, replacing a 12th century stone bridge which had replaced 
		a 10th century wooden bridge. The last are the bridges of the song &quot;London 
		Bridge is falling down . . .&quot; In 1968 the 1831 London Bridge was dismantled 
		and sold to a developer who reassembled it in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. 
		Tower Bridge is built primarily from steel with a cover of stone to imitate 
		the Gothic Style that Parliament demanded for a major structure next to 
		the Tower of London. The towers contain machinery to raise the central drawbridges 
		and to run elevators to take pedestrians to the upper walkway so they could 
		cross while the drawbridge was raised.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />
		<br />
      <a name="Ayers_Rock"><strong>Uluru / Ayers Rock</strong></a> Once considered to 
		be the world's largest 
		monolith, rising 1143 feet (348 meters) above the desert. (A monolith is 
		a single piece of rock) It is 4 miles long by 1 mile wide. It is called 
		Uluru by the native Australians, who consider it to be sacred. Varying with 
		the time of day and the weather, the rock appears to change color.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#Map">Back</a><br />

<p class="comment">The door was opened by a Porter. Such a Porter! Not of Toby’s order. 
Quite another thing. His place was the ticket though; not Toby’s. ["The Second Quarter,"

<h3>Passage Illustrated: Two Scenes in One — The officious Porter and the smug Sir Joseph</h3>

<p class="one">This Porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak; having 
breathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair, without first taking time to 
think about it and compose his mind.  When he had found his voice — which it took him a 
long time to do, for it was a long way off, and hidden under a load of meat — he said in 
a fat whisper,</p>

<p>"Who’s it from?"</p>

<p>Toby told him.</p>

<p>"You’re to take it in, yourself," said the Porter, pointing to a room at the end of a 
long passage, opening from the hall. "Everything goes straight in, on this day of the 
year. You’re not a bit too soon; for the carriage is at the door now, and they have only 
come to town for a couple of hours, a’ purpose."</p>

<p>Toby wiped his feet (which were quite dry already) with great care, and took the way 
pointed out to him; observing as he went that it was an awfully grand house, but hushed 
and covered up, as if the family were in the country.  Knocking at the room-door, he was 
told to enter from within; and doing so found himself in a spacious library, where, at a 
table strewn with files and papers, were a stately lady in a bonnet; and a not very 
stately gentleman in black who wrote from her dictation; while another, and an older, and 
a much statelier gentleman, whose hat and cane were on the table, walked up and down,
with one hand in his breast, and looked complacently from time to time at his own picture
— a full length; a very full length — hanging over the fireplace.</p>

<p>"What is this?" said the last-named gentleman. "Mr. Fish, will you have the goodness 
to attend?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fish begged pardon, and taking the letter from Toby, handed it, with great 
respect.</p>

<p>"From Alderman Cute, Sir Joseph."</p>

<p>"Is this all? Have you nothing else, Porter?" inquired Sir Joseph.</p>

<p>Toby replied in the negative. ["The Second Quarter," pp. 53-56]</p>

<h3>Commentary: Meeting those above his station</h3>

<p class="one">Simultaneously in Leech's cartoon-like double image of Trotty's arrival at 
Bowley Hall, and prior to the dream vision, on New Year's Eve, during the course of his 
deliveries Trotty meets a number of social leaders. Having already encountered the 
ranting Tory, Alderman Cute and the political economist Mr. Filer, Trotty now delivers a 
message to the aristocratic land-owner and Member of Parliament Sir Joseph Bowley, an 
apoplectic, red-faced gentleman in a white waistcoat. These none-too-bright "authorities" 
reinforce the establishmentarian views of the poor that Trotty has imbibed from the daily 
newspapers, namely that the working class in general is born bad and destined to go 
wrong.</p>

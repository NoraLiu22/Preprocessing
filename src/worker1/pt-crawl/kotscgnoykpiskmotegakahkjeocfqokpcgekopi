<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p class="one">Leech's whimsical style, although it may be described as caricature
verging at times on cartoon, was more rigorously realistic and less emblematic than
<a href="../phiz/index.html">Browne's</a>; perhaps the finest example of his work in this 
vein for Dickens is "Ignorance and Want" in <span class="book">A Christmas Carol</span>. 
The street urchins, although symbols of the forces unleashed by the factory system and 
the new capitalistic applications of <a href="../../../economics/essay.html">Malthusian 
population theories</a>, are shockingly real, while the desiccated trees and smoking 
factory chimneys in the background constitute a heightened realism amounting to visual 
commentary on Dickens's scene to reveal Scrooge as the exemplar of the entire 
upper-middle class.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, along with <a href="../walker/index.html">Fred Walker</a>, an illustrator
working in the manner of Daniel Vierge and other French illustrators of the mid-century,
Leech was instrumental in shaping the new "Sixties'" style, of which
<a href="../dumaurier/index.html">George Du Maurier</a>, 
<a href="../mstone/index.html">Marcus Stone</a>, and <a href="../barnard/index.html">Fred 
Barnard</a> were the leading exponents. As Michael Steig remarks in <span 
class="book">Dickens and Phiz</span> (1978),</p>

<p class="lq">Leech was never really comfortable in 
<a href="../phiz/index.html">Browne</a>'s and
<a href="../cruikshank/index.html">Cruikshank</a>'s favorite technique, etching. He
became known primarily as the designer of straightforward, humorous, wood-engraved
cartoons — in our modern sense — for <span class="book">Punch</span>. In
turn, Leech's art influenced <span class="book">Punch</span> artists and illustrators
including <a href="../tenniel/index.html">Tenniel</a>, Du Maurier, and 
<a href="../keene/index.html">Keene, while simultaneously the dominant mode of book
illustration by these artists and such others as Marcus Stone, Fred Walker, and
<a href="../millais/index.html">John Everett Millais</a> became by the 1860s almost
totally divorced from Browne's mode. Thus, wood engraving replaced etching, a
quasi-caricatural way of drawing characters became a blander, rather idealized style, and 
emblem and allusion disappeared almost totally. It is not insignificant that some of 
these younger artists had pretensions to high art, nor that Millais in particular may 
have been slumming (though for very good pay) when he did illustrations for Trollope and 
others. [10-11] </p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../periodicals/punch/index.html"><span class="book">Punch</span></a> 
satirical picture 
<a href="../leech/101.html"><span class="illustration">Cartoon, No. 1 — Substance and 
Shadow</span></a> (15 July 1843), Leech had criticized artists for ignoring social issues 
such as the homelessness, unemployment, starvation, and grinding poverty of Scrooge's
<a href="../../../mt/adaptations/stirling3.html">Surplus Population</a>. One may assume 
that his depiction of the allegorical but intensely realised figures of Ignorance and 
Want in <span class="book">A Christmas Carol</span> (1843) is a graphic exemplar of how 
the artist with a social conscience may address such contentious issues. Resident artist 
at <span class="book">Punch</span>, <a href="../leech/index.html">John Leech</a> perhaps 
had insufficient leisure to illustrate full-length Dickens novels; furthermore, he always 
had so many irons in the fire, so to speak, that he was notoriously unreliable when it 
came to delivering his drawing on time to publisher, a fact that may have deterred Phiz 
from agreeing to work with him on the illustrations for <span class="book">Martin 
Chuzzlewit</span> (1843-44).</p>

<h3>A Note on the Industrial Backdrop</h3>

<p class="one">The question of whether the buildings in the background of "Ignorance and 
Want" are nineteenth-century factories with tall smokestacks or prisons and workhouses
surrealistically grouped together is an interesting one since the backdrop may suggest 
that Leech felt empowered to extend the scene beyond its textual equivalent to deliver a 
visual indictment of capitalism and industrialism. In reality, such buildings as 
<a href="../../../history/poorlaw/index.html">workhouses</a> and prisons would 
not have been adjacent to one another in an urban setting.</p>

<p>Parenthetically, the blackened trees in "Ignorance and Want" may be "leafless" because 
the backdrop is a December scene, but they look blighted, withered, and dessicated, and
to the smoke from the factory smokestack drifts down the right-hand margin of the 
vignetted edge towards the tree (plural), whose condition, like the condition of the 
children, is therefore a direct byproduct of the industrial factory, which contaminates 
society, implies the illustrator, as it does the environment.</p>

<p>Certainly the big blocks of building behind Scrooge and the Spirit of Christmas
Present might be one of the 1830s Poor Law's "new" workhouses such as that at
<a href="../../../history/poorlaw/south1.html">Southwell</a>. However, even the rather
rudimentary workhouse or <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/christmas/5.html">refuge depicted
in the <span class="book">Illustrated London News</span></a> for December, 1843, would not
have had the sort of industrial smokestack that Leech has made prominent in <span 
class="drawing">Ignorance and Want</span>. Textually it would make sense that the picture 
should reinforce the Spirit's rhetorical strategy of casting Scrooge's own words about 
prisons and workhouses back at him when he asks about what "resources" society is 
providing for the <a href="../../../authors/dickens/xmas/scrooge.html">destitute 
children</a>. One can discern a very slender chimney emanating from a stove used for 
heating the women's ward in a <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/christmas/5b.html">Refuge 
for the Destitute — Ward for Females</a> from the 
<a href="../../../periodicals/iln/intro.html"><span class="book">Illustrated London 
News</span></a> for 23 December 1843, but it looks nothing like Leech's chimney. Although 
the buildings in Leech's background look a bit like the new 
<a href="../../../periodicals/iln/11.html">Pentonville Prison</a>, the guard tower
(the only structure that breaks the roofline of Pentonville) looks nothing like the
factory chimneys in <a href="../pennell/3.html">Pennel's sketch</a>, or the factory 
chimney still standing at <a href="../../architecture/industrial/1.html">Chipping
Norton</a>, or that at the <a href="../../architecture/industrial/4g.html">pump-house, 
Albert Dock</a>. The typical Victorian factory not only had the enormous chimney for 
discharging smoke well away from the precincts, but was also well lit by a great many 
windows as in the <a href="../../architecture/sheffield/13.html">Butcher Works, 
Sheffield</a>.</p>

<p>In Preston, Lancashire, an industrial town noted for its numerous smokestacks of the
type seen in Leech's illustration, the <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/38b.html">workers
rioted</a> and were attacked by the army just the year before Dickens wrote <span
class="book">A Christmas Carol</span>. The industrial smokestacks of a Preston factory
in the background of Harry French's illustration of Gradgrind's <a
href="../french/1.html">Coketown</a> (Preston) office in <span class="book">Hard
Times</span> suggest an industrial complex like that in Leech's illustration or the mill
complex such at <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/38d.html">Salford</a>. For the 
Chartists, industrial mills or factories were flashpoints for revolution because of their 
long hours and tedious, unsafe working conditions; they were using the boycott strategy 
to force the government into adopting the principles of the 
<a href="../../../history/hist3.html">Charter</a> for parliamentary reform. In consequence, 
the appearance of industrial smokestacks in Leech's plate would have constituted a 
topical allusion that many of Dickens's readers would have immediately recognized.</p>

<p>Some twenty-five years later, the theme of the deleterious societal effects of
<a href="../eytinge/42.html">"Want and Ignorance"</a> struck realist illustrator Sol
Eytinge, Junior, as timely in post-Civil War America, as he posited that substandard
housing and urban blight (as suggested by the backdrop of his rendition of this narrative
moment) were the direct concomitants of societal neglect of the poverty-stricken underclass
represented by the two children in his wood-engraving. In place of Leech's blighted tree,
emblematic of the consequences of the factory system, Eytinge has a bird of ill-omen
haloed by the setting moon. In keeping with the serious subject of the illustration, 
Eytinge has given us a sombre Druid rather than "a jolly Giant, glorious to see." The 
implied movement of the 1868 "dark" plate is entirely upward and downward, with the 
pillar-like tenement blocks in the background complementing the pillar-like figures of 
Scrooge and his spirit-guide. Finally, as the chimes strike midnight, Leech's Spirit of 
Christmas Present is fading, even though the text does not so specify; rather, he 
vanishes utterly at the moment that the church-bell strikes twelve, presumably on the 
night of the last of twelve days of Christmas. In contrast, Eytinge's leaden spirit 
clasps his collar with his left hand against the chill; his holly and berry head-dress, 
however, seems to have wilted if we compare it to its rendering in Eytinge's 
<span class="drawing">The Spirit of Christmas Present</span> five plates earlier, and in 
the <a href="../eytinge/19.html">frontispiece</a>, in which the crown is more luxuriant 
and the figure both more nimble, youthful, jolly, vigorous, and benign.</p>

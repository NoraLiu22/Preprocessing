<H2>When Brendan Met Trudy (2001)</H2>

<P>D: Kieron J. Walsh<BR>
S: Peter MacDonald, Flora Montgomery</P>

<P>A Dublin teacher who loves movies and has nothing else in his life meets
a freespirited young girl whose anarchic energy changes his world in more
ways than one. But is it all for the better? After all, she goes out at
night all dressed in black and has unusual utensils in her kitchen drawers
including bolt cutters and crowbars. Life may be boring, but sometimes excitement
comes at a high cost, especially when your girlfriend is a professional
thief whose idea of good craic is robbing warehouses on the docklands. Well,
it makes a change from choir practice.</P>

<P>Like <I><A HREF="sov.htm">Shadow of the Vampire</A></I>, <I>When Brendan
Met Trudy</I> is a film designed to appeal to film buffs, which can be a
tricky proposition. On one hand you run the risk of alienating those not
in on the joke. On the other hand you're setting yourself up for an anorak's
reaction as devotees begin sorting out the references and drawing inevitable
comparisons between your film and those you cite or pay homage to. The film
is jam-packed with such references, and makes them central to its style
and structure. From the opening which apes <I>Sunset Boulevard</I> to the
many references to <I>A Bout de Souffle</I> (and one hilarious poke at <I>Alphaville</I>),
Kieron J. Walsh's film is canny to a fault about the wealth of cinema history
which brings itself to bear on any film made at the outset of the twenty-first
century. Walsh emulates, recreates, parodies, and otherwise incorporates
the surface style of a broad range of movies. The script, written by Roddy
Doyle, describes the scenes in the first place of course, and seems eager
to ensure that all of these in-jokes are framed by a story about the temporary
insanity of romantic love. The hope presumably is that this will allow less
savvy viewers to understand that all of this wacky action can be understood
as part of a surrealistic trip which reflects the general craziness and
abandon of the couple's relationship. On the whole it works. Though one
sometimes feels a bit worn down by the self-referentiality, it keeps up
a good pace, has a reasonable quota of good gags, and boasts of solid comic
performances from its leads.</P>

<P>IFTA award winner Peter MacDonald (<I><A HREF="saltw.htm">Saltwater</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="iwd.htm">I Went Down</A></I>) is good as the teacher. He makes
a sympathetic everyman/loser as always, but this time he adds physical mannerisms
to his performance drawn from the various movies the character watches.
He affects certain kinds of postures, gestures, and walks, and drops lines
and vocal styles from Hollywood and French movies, all of which add to the
fun. He even makes a fairly convincing stab at emulating Jean-Paul Belmondo
in <I>A Bout de Souffle</I> in the film's latter stages (a performance which
in itself was also self-referential about its basis in other movies). Flora
Montgomery is also convincing as the wild young woman (the character isn't
believable, but that's not really the point), though her accent is a bizarre
mixture of oirish movie brogue and a genuine regional accent (the actor
is a native of Northern Ireland). Her wide, bright eyes and precise, quick
movements capture the character's restless energy. Though it is difficult
to believe in her the way you initially respond to MacDonald, you accept
the character within the frames of reference set by the movie (as another
of its in-jokes: in this case a reference to the classic screwball comedies
of the 1930s).</P>

<P>Essentially, <I>When Brendan Met Trudy</I> is intentionally empty and
is designed to appeal to a broad audience. It does occasionally segue into
serious material though, such as the ongoing refugee situation in contemporary
Ireland, and it indulges in a little bit of bourgeois-bashing from time
to time (mostly centred on Pauline McLynn and Don Wycherley as MacDonald's
sister and brother-in-law). These moments are less effective because the
film is generally so lightweight and unrealistic that you find them hard
to accept. The film is always at its best when it is being eccentric. Its
energy comes primarily from the dynamic between Montgomery and MacDonald,
which is along standard lines (stiff boring guy reacts to crazy girl, learns
about life, finds love), but is successful nonetheless. The in-jokes and
stylistic references to other movies have their own life too, and Walsh
does a nice job of making the film visually interesting (even if it is derivative
by design). Watch out also for the <I>Airplane</I>-esque ersatz news reports
which take place on TV sets in the background, including one depicting a
nun running amok with a machine gun. The film ends with a series of false
sign-offs derived from (guess what) well-known movies, followed by a series
of 'what happened next' gags which invite you to leave the theatre with
a smile.</P>

<P><I>When Brendan Met Trudy</I> joins the ranks of recent Irish films which
have begun to emerge from the shadow of Irish film history and embrace a
universal sense of cinema. Its nearest equivalent is the recent <I><A HREF="abad.htm">About Adam</A></I>, but it is different enough in style to have
an identity of its own (such as it is). Added to <I><A HREF="flick.htm">Flick</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="cheat.htm">How to Cheat in the Leaving Certificate</A></I>,
and deconstructive classics such as <I><A HREF="bb.htm">The Butcher Boy</A></I>,
it is quite an exciting time to be watching Irish films (dross like <A HREF="wn.htm"><I>Waking Ned</I> </A>aside), not least of all because they
are less obsessed with being Irish than ever before and simply are what
they are. <I>When Brendan Met Trudy</I> has a good sense of both itself
and cinema in general as a playground rather than an arena, which is most
welcome. And how can you dislike a film which uses scenes from <I>The Producers</I>?</P>

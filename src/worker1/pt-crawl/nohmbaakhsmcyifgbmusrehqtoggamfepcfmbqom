The Text on LacusCurtius
	</H3>

	<P CLASS="justify">
The English translation is by J. C. Rolfe, printed in the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1939‑1950: I followed my usual method and retyped it rather than scanning it; not only to minimize errors prior to proofreading, but as an opportunity for me to become intimately familiar with the work, an exercise which I heartily recommend. (<SPAN CLASS="whole">Well-meaning</SPAN> attempts to get me to scan text, if <SPAN CLASS="whole">success</SPAN>&shy;ful, would merely turn me into some kind of machine: gambit declined.)

	<P CLASS="a0 justify">
The Latin text on this site, however, requires a few words of explanation, since I did not follow my usual method. It first came onsite by way of rescue, since it had disappeared offline from David Camden's Forum Romanum. A week later, that site went back online, but after that close brush with Web-wide oblivion, it seemed a good idea to keep it here, especially since during the course of my rescue, I discovered that it (and the two copies of it elsewhere online) was not quite up to snuff: for example, the long inscription on the Vatican obelisk, which Ammian gives us in Hermapion's Greek translation, was omitted; I've restored it of course in my own transcription

(XVII.4.18‑23)</A>.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
<!-- DATEDTEXT -->Except for that one passage, however, as of writing (early February 2008), the Latin text is still that of the unspecified edition on Forum Romanum, only a few errors being corrected, although I've already added most of the local links for chapters and sections — and all the snippets of Greek, uniformly garbled in the Forum Romanum transcription, have been restored. The text therefore is complete, but not yet put in my usual format, nor (as far as I am concerned) proofread, nor cross-linked to the translation. The next step is to make it conform to some suitable print edition; after some hesitation between the texts of Gardthausen (1874) and Clark (1910‑1916), both of which I examined, I adopted the simplest option, the text printed in the same Loeb edition, which is Clark's with a few further emendations.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">

Ask someone who had nothing to do with the book, however, and you can get some pretty stiff answers. I regret that copyright makes it impossible for me to reproduce onsite the three reviews by G[eoffrey] B[ernard] A[bbott] Fletcher<!-- † 1995 ▸ © thru 2065 -->, the annotator of Tacitus, but if you have access to JSTOR, you can read them yourself; they're humdingers. At the same time of course, it does seem clear that, cavilling aside, he corrects a few egregious errors, due no doubt to haste (Vol. I:

			<P CLASS="justify" ID="Preface.1">
Some of the reviews of my previous contributions to the <I>LCL</I> make it advisable to say that this is a translation and not a critical edition. Every serious student of the text must use the standard edition of C. U. Clark (Berlin, vol. <SPAN CLASS="small">I</SPAN>, 1910; vol. <SPAN CLASS="small">II</SPAN>, Berlin, 1910‑1915). The translator has<SPAN CLASS="emend">,</SPAN><!-- Loeb has no comma here --> however, attempted to examine all the available critical material, and has deviated in a number of instances from Clark's text, always with hesitation, except in the way of filling out lacunae. To shorten and simplify the critical notes (which are still perhaps too numerous) all instances have been omitted in which the earlier editions have made corrections of Codex <SPAN CLASS="manuscript">V</SPAN> which are generally accepted.
			<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify" ID="Preface.2">
Clark's punctuation according to the metrical <I>clausulae</I> (see
			<A HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/Introduction*.html#clausulae
			"TARGET="princeps"
onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,1,WIDTH,165)"
onMouseOut="nd();">
Introd., p. xxii)
			</A>
is regarded by Novák (<I>Wiener Studien</I> 33, p293) as no less important in establishing the text than the discovery of a new and valuable manuscript. Although this punctuation differs from the usual system, especially in the case of some relative clauses and in a more abundant use of commas, it has seemed best to follow it except in a few instances, where it might be misleading. It frequently throws light on the writer's meaning.
			<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify" ID="Preface.3">
My obligations to Professor Clark are not confined to the use of his edition. He generously placed at


<A ID="pviii"></A><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p. viii </SPAN>my disposal the first draft of his translation of Books <SPAN CLASS="small">XIV‑XVII</SPAN>.11.4, which has been of great service. My translation, however, must not be supposed to reflect his final version. He also lent me his copy of the somewhat rare translation of Holland.
			<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify" ID="Preface.4">
Anyone who is at all familiar with the constant problems presented by the text of Ammianus, and by his Latinity, will view with indulgence an attempt to render him into English and to retain so far as possible something of the flavour of the original.

Book 25:
			</A>
The Persian war ends badly: the Persians attack constantly, the Romans have no food, the emperor Julian is killed, a new emperor Jovian is almost accidentally chosen in a panic, who immediately gives away five provinces including the city of Nisibis and retires to Asia Minor, where he dies suddenly.

Notes to the English Translation

J. C. Rolfe's translation includes many notes, designed to elucidate the text for a general reader. For the Web, they are both overkill and not enough: so while of my own initiative I wouldn't have put most of them online, given that they're there, I've often linked them to more detailed and specific sources. In the print edition, some notes are merely referred to a note elsewhere in the History; I found it simpler to do the same, although sometimes that previous note is not thoroughly satisfactory: still, the diligent reader will probably not begrudge me the shortcut — and the superficial reader will never notice.

Without psychoanalyzing the diptych too much, I hope, I find it simultaneously hieratic and awkward: even an emperor is essentially captive in the confusion of his age, and his only hope is to escape this world by death.

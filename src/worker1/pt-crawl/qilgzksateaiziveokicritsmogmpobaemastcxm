The <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/chicago-bulls\">Bulls</a> have secured the top seed in the league and Rose has become the unquestioned leader of the team. But one question I have is: Is his win a manifestation of the LeBron James-hate brigade, or would he have won regardless of the controversial \"Decision\" broadcast that turned the entire voting poll against James this year?"},"content_type":"paragraph","id":93666161},{"content":{"html":"When critics defend Rose they will acknowledge that his statistics are technically not better than James', and they won't argue that he is as dominant a force as Dwight Howard. But they say that he led his team to the East's top seed despite injuries to two \"All-Star Caliber\" bigs, while the <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/miami-heat\">Heat</a> wound up only the second seed, and Howard's <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/orlando-magic\">Magic</a> were fourth."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":61070316},{"content":{"html":"These things are true, but in defense of Howard and James, both players had to make bigger adjustments and sacrifices to their games throughout the regular season than Rose did. James was playing for a different team, in a new role with half the country rooting for him to fail. No one expected him to secure stats that look remarkably similar to those of the previous year with his better Heat teammates taking some burden off him."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":46903543},{"content":{"html":"He came into the league with the most pressure to preform and did so admirably as the Heat led the East in road wins, despite every game having a playoff atmosphere. It was a testament to James' great play. "},"content_type":"paragraph","id":127983668},{"content":{"html":"As for Howard, he started the season with one team and would end the season with a totally different team. Yet, he has proven time-and-time again that he can make the team a playoff contender and top defensive team just by his mere presence. Not too many teams can have their supporting cast change early in the season, yet still maintain their defensive identity despite the turnover. That equates to a valuable player in my book."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":58557736},{"content":{"html":"Additionally, there is a question over whether the Bulls success derives more from Tom Thibodeau's system or Rose's play. If you put <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/deron-williams\">Deron Williams</a> on the Bulls instead of Derrick Rose could they win 60-games under Thibs defensive philosophy? Maybe."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":83531674},{"content":{"html":"Can you put any other center in the league on the Magic and have a No. 4 seed considering the struggles of everyone on the team? Unlikely. If you take James off and replace him with any other small forward in the game, could they get the same intangibles they get from James? No."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":61840525},{"content":{"html":"So while I acknowledge that I agree with the pick of Rose, I don't think it is as open and shut as has been reported."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":8518107}],"id":1850157,"slide_number":4,"title":"4. 2011: Derrick Rose"},{"content_type":"slide","elements":[{"content":{"caption":"1990: Magic Johnson #32 of the Los Angeles Lakers makes a lay-up during a game against the Orlando Magic.

Curiously, even though Magic Johnson won the award and Johnson's team won a league best 63 games (the league's only 60-win team that year) and Barkley's club only won 53 games, Barkley received more first place votes (38-27)."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":118803296},{"content":{"html":"Magic Johnson had a spectacular year in 1990. It was his first full season without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and he maintained a sustained level of excellence for the <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-lakers\">Lakers</a> despite the retirement of the team's hall-of-fame center. It also benefited Johnson that he added a new weapon to his arsenal this season (3-point shooting), which the voters appreciated."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":14013075},{"content":{"html":"But the knock against Johnson this season, similarly to those leveled at the Big Three in Miami this year, he still had more help than Barkley. Can he be the most valuable player if his team has more talent and experience than the team of another MVP contender?"},"content_type":"paragraph","id":85416973},{"content":{"html":"Johnson was without Jabbar, but he still had James Worthy, A.C. Green, Byron Scott and a young Vlade Divac. That's not that bad a supporting cast. Barkley, on the other hand, won only 10 fewer games than Magic with teammates like Mike Gminski, Johnny Dawkins, Ron Anderson and Derek Smith. No, I never heard of them either. Hersey Hawkins provided a bit of scoring, but Barkley clearly had less talent to work with."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":56349088},{"content":{"html":"Stats-wise Johnson and Barkley's numbers were both very strong: Barkley averaged 25.2 ppg, 11.5 rpg, while Johnson averaged 22.3 ppg and 11.5 apg. But since the evaluation is \"most valuable player\" rather than best player (which Jordan had on lockdown with his 33.6 ppg and 2.77 steals, both tops in the NBA), one could say that Barkley's team wouldn't have even made the playoffs without him."},"content_type":"paragraph","id":122614219}],"id":19223418,"slide_number":5,"title":"5. 1990: Magic Johnson"},{"content_type":"slide","elements":[{"content":{"caption":"SACRAMENTO, CA - DECEMBER 16:  Steve Nash #13 of the Phoenix Suns stands on the court during the NBA game against the Sacramento Kings at Arco Arena on December 16, 2006 in Sacramento, California.

href="http://bleacherreport.com/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a> game earlier in the season, commentators Steve Kerr and Marv Albert got in a heated discussion about the MVP race.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Kerr asserted that voters are less inclined to vote for the same player three years in a row and may choose to "spread the wealth" of the award around instead of rewarding a player for a third time. He was referring to <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>' chances of securing the award again, but Albert, who is on the voting committee, took umbrage at the insinuation that voters consciously freeze out players and refuse to vote for them three years in a row.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Kerr, whose former teammate Michael Jordan was denied an MVP 3-peat twice in 1993 and 1997 is the most obvious example of when a player should have won the award but didn't due to reasons not readily accepted by the general public.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Their conversation certainly brings to mind a few times in <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nba">NBA</a> history that the winner of the MVP award drew complaints rather than applause from some not directly connected to the committee.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">So here they are, the eight most controversial MVP winners.</p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide1"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-573923-1" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>1. 1999: Karl Malone</h2><div class="slideData">1 of 8</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="4 Dec 1999: Karl Malone #32 of the Utah Jazz walks back onto the court after the game against the Golden State Warriors at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California.

Although, if the race was won by a nose, the MVP voters completely misread the evidence on the photo.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Mourning had the best season of his career in 1999. He averaged 20.1 ppg and 11.0 rpg, while leading the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a> to the No. 1 seed in the East for the first time in franchise history. Tim Duncan led his <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/san-antonio-spurs">Spurs</a> to the best record in the West (by virtue of a tie-breaker with the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/utah-jazz">Utah Jazz</a>) and Duncan performed brilliantly, posting 21.7 ppg and 11.4 rpg. His Spurs began the season a disappointing 6-8, but since their rough start he led them to a 31-5 record afterward and established himself as the leader of the Spurs, despite David Robinson's presence.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The Utah Jazz were tied with the Spurs for the best record, but they led the league in wins for most of the season before slumping in the final month. Generally, slumps by teams heading into the playoffs hurt MVP candidates, but it did not effect Malone's candidacy in the minds of voters.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">To be sure, Malone had a great season. He posted 23.8 ppg and 9.4 rpg, while leading his team to a tie for the league's best record. But as strong as those number may seem, they represent one of Malone's worst statistical seasons since his rookie year. Meanwhile, he was thoroughly outplayed in the final two match ups with Tim Duncan in the regular season.

Rick Barry was not a particularly popular player around the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nba">NBA</a>. Meanwhile, McAdoo was fairly well liked across the NBA.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">This popularity skewed the results against Barry, as he would finish a distant fourth in the voting behind McAdoo, Dave Cowens, and Elvin Hayes.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">First of all, I find it a bit curious the fact that Berry finished behind Cowens in MVP voting, yet Cowens didn't even make the All-NBA First Team that year while Berry did.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">McAdoo led the league in scoring this season with 34.5 ppg and that played a large role in his win, but his scoring was only slightly higher than Berry's 30.6 ppg. McAdoo's Buffalo Braves (later to become the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a>) won 49 games in his MVP year, which was good for only the third best record in the conference.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Meanwhile, Barry's team, while winning the same number of games, led Golden State to the best record in the West.

The <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/chicago-bulls">Bulls</a> have secured the top seed in the league and Rose has become the unquestioned leader of the team. But one question I have is: Is his win a manifestation of the LeBron James-hate brigade, or would he have won regardless of the controversial "Decision" broadcast that turned the entire voting poll against James this year?</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">When critics defend Rose they will acknowledge that his statistics are technically not better than James', and they won't argue that he is as dominant a force as Dwight Howard. But they say that he led his team to the East's top seed despite injuries to two "All-Star Caliber" bigs, while the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/miami-heat">Heat</a> wound up only the second seed, and Howard's <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/orlando-magic">Magic</a> were fourth.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">These things are true, but in defense of Howard and James, both players had to make bigger adjustments and sacrifices to their games throughout the regular season than Rose did. James was playing for a different team, in a new role with half the country rooting for him to fail. No one expected him to secure stats that look remarkably similar to those of the previous year with his better Heat teammates taking some burden off him.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">He came into the league with the most pressure to preform and did so admirably as the Heat led the East in road wins, despite every game having a playoff atmosphere. It was a testament to James' great play. </p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">As for Howard, he started the season with one team and would end the season with a totally different team. Yet, he has proven time-and-time again that he can make the team a playoff contender and top defensive team just by his mere presence. Not too many teams can have their supporting cast change early in the season, yet still maintain their defensive identity despite the turnover. That equates to a valuable player in my book.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Additionally, there is a question over whether the Bulls success derives more from Tom Thibodeau's system or Rose's play. If you put <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/deron-williams">Deron Williams</a> on the Bulls instead of Derrick Rose could they win 60-games under Thibs defensive philosophy? Maybe.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Can you put any other center in the league on the Magic and have a No. 4 seed considering the struggles of everyone on the team? Unlikely. If you take James off and replace him with any other small forward in the game, could they get the same intangibles they get from James? No.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">So while I acknowledge that I agree with the pick of Rose, I don't think it is as open and shut as has been reported.</p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide5"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-573923-5" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>5. 1990: Magic Johnson</h2><div class="slideData">5 of 8</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="1990: Magic Johnson #32 of the Los Angeles Lakers makes a lay-up during a game against the Orlando Magic.

Curiously, even though Magic Johnson won the award and Johnson's team won a league best 63 games (the league's only 60-win team that year) and Barkley's club only won 53 games, Barkley received more first place votes (38-27).</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Magic Johnson had a spectacular year in 1990. It was his first full season without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and he maintained a sustained level of excellence for the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a> despite the retirement of the team's hall-of-fame center. It also benefited Johnson that he added a new weapon to his arsenal this season (3-point shooting), which the voters appreciated.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">But the knock against Johnson this season, similarly to those leveled at the Big Three in Miami this year, he still had more help than Barkley. Can he be the most valuable player if his team has more talent and experience than the team of another MVP contender?</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Johnson was without Jabbar, but he still had James Worthy, A.C. Green, Byron Scott and a young Vlade Divac. That's not that bad a supporting cast. Barkley, on the other hand, won only 10 fewer games than Magic with teammates like Mike Gminski, Johnny Dawkins, Ron Anderson and Derek Smith. No, I never heard of them either. Hersey Hawkins provided a bit of scoring, but Barkley clearly had less talent to work with.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Stats-wise Johnson and Barkley's numbers were both very strong: Barkley averaged 25.2 ppg, 11.5 rpg, while Johnson averaged 22.3 ppg and 11.5 apg. But since the evaluation is "most valuable player" rather than best player (which Jordan had on lockdown with his 33.6 ppg and 2.77 steals, both tops in the NBA), one could say that Barkley's team wouldn't have even made the playoffs without him.</p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide6"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-573923-6" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>6. 2005: Steve Nash</h2><div class="slideData">6 of 8</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="SACRAMENTO, CA - DECEMBER 16:  Steve Nash #13 of the Phoenix Suns stands on the court during the NBA game against the Sacramento Kings at Arco Arena on December 16, 2006 in Sacramento, California.

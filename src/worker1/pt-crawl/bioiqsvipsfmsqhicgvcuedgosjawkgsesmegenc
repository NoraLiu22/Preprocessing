<H2>Puckoon (2003)</H2>

<P>D: Terence Ryan<BR>
S: Sean Hughes, Griff Rhys Jones</P>

<P>Literature continues to take centre stage in the hierarchy of Irish high
culture. Over time there has been a strain of satirical writing which leans
towards the surreal, seen in the writings of Flann O'Brien, James Joyce,
and of course Spike Milligan. <I>Puckoon</I> is the latest attempt to film
an 'unfilmable' Irish novel, an adaptation of Milligan's political comedy
set in 1924. The plot is set in motion when the infamous Boundary Commission
draws up the border which will split the island of Ireland into two states.
The village of &quot;Puckoon&quot; is smack in the middle of the imaginary
line which is about to become real. When it does, the lives of the residents
are thrown into the proverbial turmoil, with absurd comic results. Written
with more care in the prose than the wackiness of it all would suggest,
this book seemed an ideal choice for adaptation, particularly in the climate
of an Irish cinema reaching out for new material and new style in the wake
of the boom of the 1990s.</P>

<P>To be fair to it, writer and director Terence Ryan's film tries to be
faithful to Milligan's style and spirit. It is actually pretty close to
the book in some respects, and tries hard to find a visual equivalent of
the tongue-in-cheek sidelong glances characteristic of the spiritual father
of Monty Python. However, there is a slippery, subtle level of artistry
in writing of this kind which it takes great cinematic skill to render.
Luis Bu&ntilde;uel might have done it, or maybe Jean-Luc Goddard on a good
day, but it is a task beyond this filmmaker. In spite of what are evidently
the best of intentions and even with the participation of a talented cast
of performers, Ryan ends up presenting a superficial fantasia of paddywhackery
which will amuse only those who find ceramic Leprechauns genuinely charming.</P>

<P>The problems begin with the film's leading man. Belatedly cast in the
central role, mild comedian Sean Hughes lacks the big screen charisma to
hold together an already teetering structure. As the graveyard maintenance
man who finds his place of work turning into a literal battleground, Hughes
radiates an affable but vacuous small-screen charm which relies heavily
on the 'nod and a wink' school of acting to elicit sympathy. As the madness
around him escalates, the actor is swamped by it, and not in a manner that
he can stand above (or below) the chaos and observe it wryly like an omniscient
narrator. In fact, the film plays games with the idea of narration, featuring
none other than Sir Richard Attenborough as the storyteller who interacts
with his frequently frustrated and rebellious characters, a conceit again
linked to the political subtext on a level the film is able only to suggest
and never to explore.</P>

<P><I>Puckoon</I> never develops a steady rhythm though it more or less
consistently strives for a tone of broad burlesque caricature which will
carry it though. This succeeds in some respects and in small moments and
asides, but there is often something painfully forced about it which makes
the film less easy to watch than it should be. Griff Rhys Jones is a prime
example of this problem in the role of the stuffy British commander who
tries to enforce a checkpoint in the middle of the graveyard but whose stiff-upper-lip
characterisation is completely one-note and eventually tiresome. Milo O'Shea
and David Kelly fare better in small supporting roles, as does a surprising
Elliot Gould. Indeed, the smaller the role the better, because once these
characters remain on screen for any longer than the initial gag, the lack
of depth becomes obvious. Ryan is unable to draw the strands of story, satire,
and characterisation through the film, and when the narrative deliberately
spins off into postmodern deconstruction, it seems like he has lost control
rather than taken the surrealism to the next level.</P>

<P>There is a rash of evident good intentions behind this project, plus
masses of goodwill directed towards the late, great Milligan himself which
spurred the participation of such an array of actors. Primarily produced
within Northern Ireland, but with money drawn from the Republic as well,
there was a very real chance that <I>Puckoon</I> could not only have been
very funny, it might have had something to say on a subject admittedly over
exposed in general terms throughout the history of Irish cinema on the whole.
As is though, it is a painfully unfunny mess which draws its few mild smiles
from fleeting moments. That said, undemanding Hibernophiles with a religious
respect for <I>The Quiet Man</I> and an unreconstructed lowbrow sense of
humour will probably enjoy it on a whole other level. Though not as offensive
or cynical as <I><A HREF="wn.htm">Waking Ned</A></I>, it lacks many ineffable
qualities including charm, irony, and subtlety, all of which were sorely
needed to make the film work.</P>

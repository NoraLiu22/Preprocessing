          </b></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
          history of wildfire in Yellowstone is long and varied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Even&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before written records of fire with the advent of
          Yellowstone National Park in 1872 we see evidence of fire in soil
          profiles, lake sediments, land slides, and in old-growth trees that
          have been scarred by fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
          is clear that wildfire has had a role in the dynamics of
          Yellowstone’s ecosystems for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>thousands
          of years.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Although many fires were caused by
          human activities, most ignitions were undoubtedly natural. The term
          ‘natural ignition’ is nearly synonymous with a lightning strike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Afternoon thunderstorms occur frequently in the Northern
          Rockies but release little precipitation, a condition known as dry
          lightning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a typical
          season there are thousands of lightning strikes in Yellowstone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Lightning strikes are powerful enough to rip strips of bark off
          of a tree in a shower of sparks, and blow the pieces up to 30 meters
          (100') away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However most
          lightning strikes never result in a wildfire because fuels are not in
          a combustible state.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Fuels are typically wood, foliage or grass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Fuels may be fine, such as twigs and needles, or heavy, such as
          logs, branches and whole trees that have blown down in a storm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Fuels may also be living such as an understory layer of tree
          regeneration or a layer of shrubs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In order for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>an ignition to take place, the fuels must be dry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>As spring advances into summer, temperatures increase and the
          relative humidity decreases-- factors which dry fuels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>On average in Yellowstone, fuels dry out enough to ignite the
          first wildland fire of the year about the middle of June.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Young forests generally do not have the fuel load that mature and old-growth forests do.&nbsp; Many young stands
          of&nbsp; trees are regenerating old burns and consequently haven't had
          time to accumulate fuel.&nbsp; However, as a
          stand develops it accumulates fuel:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>needle-cast, fallen branches, lichens, and logs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>As the young trees grow they compete for light and other
          resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many don’t
          survive the competition, and remain in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>stand as standing dead snags which fall over and further
          contribute to the fuels on the forest floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>As trees grow they also ‘self-prune’ old branches that
          become shaded by new foliage at the top of the canopy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>These pruned branches eventually fall off the tree and
          accumulate as litter on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As the stand grows older and taller the canopy begins to
          break up, letting light reach the forest floor and allowing the establishment of an understory
          layer of shrubs and
          regenerating trees.&nbsp; This understory layer forms a ‘ladder’ of fuel that may allow a
          ground fire to ascend into the forest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>canopy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
          accumulation of fuel on the
          forest floor and the continuity of fuels between the ground,
          understory and overstory are factors that predispose older stands to
          ignition by a lightning strike.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Nearly all of Yellowstone’s plant communities
          have burned at one time or another.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Some plant communities ignite and carry fire more readily
          than others (Renkin and Despain 1992).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore
          the ‘fire regime’ of Yellowstone is as varied and complicated as
          the environments within the park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>It must be remembered that any forest will burn provided an
          ignition during periods of prolonged drought, high temperatures, low
          relativity humidity or high winds.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However each type of forest has certain characteristics that
          cause wildfires to behave differently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Some trees such as Douglas-fir have very thick bark that
          insulates the tree against heat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>bark protects
          the cambium (the water and nutrient conducting system between the bark
          and the wood) which will die if it is exposed to temperatures greater
          than 60°C (140°F) for longer than 1 minute (Agee 1993).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Thick bark ensures that wildfires seldom kill mature
          Douglas-fir trees.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Other species such as lodgepole pine, whitebark pine,
          Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir have thin bark but these species
          have other adaptations to fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          Some l</span>odgepole
          pines have cones that are serotinous; that is, they<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>are glued shut by resin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The heat of a wildfire is needed to melt the resin and allow
          the cone to open and disperse the seeds within. This adaptation
          ensures that the seeds of lodgepole pine will not disperse until
          wildfire creates conditions that favor the establishment of seedlings-- diminished litter
          on the forest floor and plenty of sunlight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Although whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce and
          subalpine fir are also thin-barked, they are adapted to fire by
          escaping.&nbsp; That is, they grow in habitats that are less susceptible to
          wildfire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whitebark pines
          grow in open, cold, high altitude habitats that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>accumulate fuel very slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The length of the growing season between snowmelt and snowfall,
          and the cooler temperatures leave a short seasonal window in which
          wildfires can ignite and carry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Engelmann
          spruce and subalpine fir grow in cool, moist habitats where conditions
          that enable wildfires to burn are infrequent.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Aspen also has thin bark and low tolerance to
          fire but it readily regenerates by
          sprouting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aspen clones
          are connected by a network of roots which survive even very hot fires
          because they are insulated underground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Although the above-ground stems may be killed by fire the roots
          send up a profusion of sprouts in the following years.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Fire ecologists use estimates of fire return
          intervals to better understand the role of fire in different forest
          types.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fire return
          intervals represent the average frequency of fire for an area or plant
          community type on the landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Natural, historical fire return intervals in Yellowstone range
          from 20-25 years for shrub and grasslands in the Northern Range (Houston 1973) to 300
          years or more for lodgepole pine forests on the central plateau (Romme
          1982, Romme and Despain 1989) and subalpine whitebark pine stands.<span style="mso-spacerun:

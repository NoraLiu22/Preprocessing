<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">In the fifth century AD, as the expense of festivals and spectacles
  increased, the circus factions began to take responsibility,
  not only for the races, but for other kinds of entertainment,
  including pantomimes and wild beast fights. The Blues and Greens
  came to predominate and, although this arrangement made organization
  easier, it also focused loyalty on these two factions alone,
  the Blues sitting opposite the imperial box (<I>kathisma</I>)
  near the starting gates of the Hippodrome and the Greens at the
  other end near the <I>sphendone</I>, a juxtaposition that no
  doubt contributed to a rivalry already made intense by the support
  of Justinian for the Blues. It was in the Hippodrome at Constantinople,
  as in the Circus at Rome, that the populace could express itself
  to the emperor and expect a response. And it was in the <A HREF="hippodrome.html">Hippodrome</A>
  that partisans acted out when their faction was defeated, as
  when Porphyrius the charioteer won at Antioch in AD 507.</span></P>
  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">The factions, too, were responsible for ensuring that the
  emperor was duly honored; indeed, the emperor could sponsor a
  faction and glorify its victories without having them reflect
  on any individual but himself. Like the gladiatorial and wild
  beast shows, chariot races were associated with the imperial
  cult and the munificence of the emperor, even though they may
  have been paid for by the praetor or consul. As these acclamations
  became more important, the anonymous crowd that chanted them
  became empowered, as well. By the end of the fifth century AD,
  beginning with the accession of Anastasius in AD 491, this new
  political power had become destabilizing. It further was aggravated
  when Anastasius abolished the <I>venationes</I> in AD 498 and
  pantomimes in AD 502, leaving the amphitheater and theaters empty.
  All the passions of the people now were directed to the races
  in the Hippodrome.</span></P>
  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">The Nika riot began on Tuesday, January 13, AD 532. Three
  days earlier, several members of the Blue and Green factions,
  who had been arrested for an earlier disturbance, were to be
  hanged. But the execution was botched and two men survived and
  found sanctuary in a church, which then was put under guard.
  During the races in the Hippodrome, the crowd called on Justinian
  to show them mercy, chanting until the twenty-second race (of
  twenty four). But there was no response. Then, unexpectedly,
  another exclamation was heard: &quot;Long live the merciful Blues
  and Greens!&quot; (Malalas, XVIII.474). That evening, with <I>Nika</I>
  (&quot;conquer,&quot; an exclamation used to encourage the charioteer)
  as their watchword, the two united factions demanded that the
  city prefect release the prisoners, setting fire to the Praetorium
  when he did not. The fire spread and others were set the next
  day, even though Justinian had announced additional races, a
  gesture that only emboldened the rioters, who set fire to the
  Hippodrome itself.</span></P>
  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">Now the resignation of three unpopular ministers was demanded,
  those who were perceived to be responsible for Justinian's refusal
  to release the prisoners, to which the emperor conceded. When
  this did not mollify the crowd, a force of Goths was dispatched,
  but the insurrection could not be surpressed and there were more
  fires, which spread throughout the city, including the church
  of St. Sophia, which &quot;collapsed entirely on all four sides&quot;
  (Theopanes, 6024). On Thursday, Probus, the youngest nephew of
  the late Anastasius, was acclaimed emperor but he, prudently,
  was not to be found, his palace being burned down in his absence.
  The incendiarism continued for the next two days, aggravated
  during the fighting with Thracian troops. Finally, on Sunday,
  January 18, Justinian went to the imperial box, Gospels in hand,
  and acknowledged his errors, promising to redress the grievances
  of the populace and pardon the rioters. But they were not to
  be pacified and acclaimed Hypatius, another nephew of Anastasius,
  as ruler.</span></P>
  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">As Justinian and his counselors deliberated over whether to
  leave the capital (if only to avoid the unpopularity of being
  present when the insurrection was put down), the empress <A 
  HREF="theodora.html">Theodora</A> counseled resolve, although
  the speech is likely a rhetorical set-piece.</span></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;My opinion then is that the present time, above all
    others, is inopportune for flight, even though it bring safety.
    For while it is impossible for a man who has seen the light not
    also to die, for one who has been an emperor it is unendurable
    to be a fugitive. May I never be separated from this purple,
    and may I not live that day on which those who meet me shall
    not address me as mistress.&quot;</span></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">Two of the emperor's best generals, Belisarius and Mundus
  entered the Hippodrome through separate entrances, trapping the
  mob inside; &quot;in the end not one of the citizens, either
  of the Greens or of the Blues, who were in the Hippodrome, survived&quot;
  (Theopanes). Of the populace that day more than thirty thousand
  perished (Procopius, I.24.54; Theophanes and the <I>Chronicon
  Paschale</I> say thirty-five thousand). Hypatius was executed
  and the estates of others who had collaborated, confiscated.
  Peace was restored, although &quot;the chariot races were not
  held for a long time&quot; (Theopanes).</span></P>

  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">In this tenth-century mosaic in the lunette of the vestibule
  gate of Hagia Sophia, Justinian on the left presents a model
  of the church to Mary, while Constantine offers one of the city.</span></P>
  <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">The palace of Lausus, which still have may contained the statue
  of Olympian Zeus, was destroyed in the riot (Theopanes), as was
  the church of St. Sophia (Holy Wisdom or Hagia Sophia). Six weeks
  later, work began on rebuilding the church, which was consecrated
  five years later. It is described by Procopius in <I>Buildings</I>
  (I.1).</span></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">&quot;So the whole church at that time lay a charred mass
    of ruins. But the Emperor Justinian built not long afterwards
    a church so finely shaped, that if anyone had enquired of the
    Christians before the burning if it would be their wish that
    the church should be destroyed and one like this should take
    its place, shewing them some sort of model of the building we
    now see, it seems to me that they would have prayed that they
    might see their church destroyed forthwith, in order that the
    building might be converted into its present form (22).</span></P>
    <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">So the church has become a spectacle of marvellous beauty,
    overwhelming to those who see it, but to those who know it by
    hearsay altogether incredible. For it soars to a height to match
    the sky, and as if surging up from amongst the other buildings
    it stands on high and looks down upon the remainder of the city,
    adorning it, because it is a part of it, but glorying in its
    own beauty, because, though a part of the city and dominating
    it, it at the same time towers above it to such a height that
    the whole city is viewed from there as from a watch-tower. Both
    its breadth and its length have been so carefully proportioned,
    that it may not improperly be said to be exceedingly long and
    at the same time unusually broad. And its exults in an indescribable
    beauty (27-28).</span></P>
    <P><span style="font-size: 16pt">All these details, fitted together with incredible skill in
    mid-air and floating off from each other and resting only on
    the parts next to them, produce a single and most extraordinary
    harmony in the work, and yet do not permit the spectator to linger
    much over the study of any one of them, but each detail attracts
    the eye and draws it on irresistibly to itself. So the vision
    constantly shifts suddenly, for the beholder is utterly unable
    to select which particular detail he should admire more than
    all the others. But even so, though they turn their attention
    to every side and look with contracted brows upon every detail,
    observers are still unable to understand the skilful craftsmanship,
    but they always depart from there overwhelmed by the bewildering
    sight&quot; (47-49).</span></P>

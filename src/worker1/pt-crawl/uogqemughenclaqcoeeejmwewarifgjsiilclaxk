<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The premise of <i>The Idea of You</i> may sound
like a thing of fantasy, but the makers of this film, about the romance between
an ordinary 40-year-old woman and a 24-year-old pop star, take the idea
seriously. There's a real sense of understanding for these two characters, both
of whom want more than what their respective lives have had to offer so far, and
it helps immensely that the connection between the actors feels sincere, too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">This story comes from a novel by Robinne Lee,
and without offering any direct opinion about the nature or quality of the book,
the setup certainly sounds like something that belongs in the mass-market
romance section a bookstore. Here's a good example of why one shouldn't judge a
movie based on the notion of what one imagines the source material's cover might
look like.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Yes, the means by which the story gets Solène
(Anne Hathaway) and Hayes (Nicholas Galitzine) to meet and fall for each other
are pretty ridiculous. By giving the characters room and time to breathe before
and after that fateful meeting, though, co-writers Michael Showalter, who also
directed, and Jennifer Westfeldt make them believable enough to overlook most of
the contrivances this narrative has to offer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">For example, Solène lives a mundane but hectic
suburban life as the divorced mother of teenaged daughter Izzy (Ella Rubin),
who's about to start her senior year of high school. Approaching her 40th
birthday, Solène might miss her daughter, but since she and her ex-husband
Daniel (Reid Scott) had the girl so young, she's also looking forward to being
more than mother, an ex-wife who was jilted by her husband for a younger woman,
and someone who never really had the time to figure out who she is. There's a
bit of uncomfortable honesty about such matters at her birthday party, where Solène
pretty much says all of that, everyone basically gets it, and, in terms of any
romantic prospects, all the men around her age are as boring as she probably
fears she has become.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The big change in her life arrives when Solène
has to cancel a solo camping trip at the last minute to bring Izzy and her
friends to a music festival (Daniel has an important work matter come up, and as
apparently is the case with this relationship, that takes priority). The teens
have backstage passes for and a meet-and-greet opportunity with their favorite
boy band in grade school, and in a meet-cute that's actually a genuinely cute
chance meeting, Solène ends up in Hayes' private trailer, believing it's a VIP
restroom. The chemistry between them is as immediate as the situation is
awkward.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">That vague but palpable notion we call
&quot;chemistry&quot; is one of the necessities of a good screen romance, so
that's taken care of here. It can only get such material so far, though, and
Showalter and Westfeldt clearly know that. Something else has to support that
feeling of attraction and tension, and in this case, it's the fact that these
two characters actually do talk to each other—not just about the unlikely
nature of their relationship, but also about who they are, where they've been,
and what they want to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">What's fascinating about the screenplay is the
way it cuts directly to how much Solène and Hayes have in common, despite how
improbable it may seem. What could a single mother who owns an art gallery have
in common with a British singer who has been internationally famous for almost
half of his young life? The fact that the film cares enough to ask that question
elevates it above any suspicion that the material exists as some kind of
fantastical wish fulfillment. That Showalter and Westfeldt actually have an
answer that both makes sense and gives the bond some weight raises the story
even higher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Despite their relative successes, both Solène
and Hayes are longing for something. We already know what that is for her, and
even if a whirlwind romance is sort of counter to Solène's desire to figure out
who she is as a person, who says that having the freedom to have a whirlwind
romance with a pop star doesn't get at the heart of what Solène wants for her
life in the first place?</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">After all, she's smart enough to know as much,
if her initial hesitation whenever the two are alone is any indication.
Hathaway's performance gets at that conflict, and there's something admirable
about how the eventually problems for this relationship have less to do with
matters of age or public scrutiny (Those come up, obviously, but only, notably,
when the romance is discovered) and everything to do with what she believes to
be best for herself and, later, her daughter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Solène is a solid character, in other words,
and it's intriguing to watch as Hayes, who starts as a charismatic figure of no
little desire for Solène (and countless other, of course), becomes one himself.
Here's a young man who, like Solène in certain respects, had his life decided
and planned out for him without him years ago without even realizing it. Hayes
might be something of an amusing joke early on (flashing around his wealth and
ordering only chicken fingers from room service), but there's a degree of
self-awareness and even wisdom behind that effortless charm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Sure, the plotting of <i>The Idea of You</i>
can be as contrived as the premise is gimmicky, but as a romance, it succeeds
quite well by knowing and providing the basics. It's two characters, whom we
come to know and get to like, talking about what matters to them and connecting
because of it.</font>

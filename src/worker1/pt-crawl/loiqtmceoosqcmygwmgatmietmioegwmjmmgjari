<p class="one">Helen Sheridan was a granddaughter of the playwright, Sheridan, and the younger sister of <a href="../../../authors/norton/biography.html">Caroline Sheridan, later Norton</a>. An "abundantly beautiful 
and clever" young woman (Dufferin 25), she was not a good match financially, and her first marriage to Commander Price Blackwood was for some time opposed by his parents. The couple spent their first two years together in Italy, where <a href="../../../sculpture/pomeroy/9b.html">their son</a> (destined to be the first Viceroy of India) was born. On return, and now having won over her in-laws, she passed easily into the very highest echelons of London society. But in 1847 her husband died tragically, of an accidental overdoe, and from then on she devoted herself to their son. "A trip up the Nile in his company led to the publication, in 1863, of <span class="book">Lispings from Low Latitudes, or, Extracts from the Journal of the Hon. Impulsia Gushington</span>, in which she made fun of the genre of travel writing" (Rae and Reynolds). She also had considerable success with her play, <span class="play">Finesse, or, A Busy Day in Messina</span>, which opened at the Haymarket in 1863. Like her ballads and verses, it was presented anonymously.</p>

<p>In 1862, Helen Dufferin remarried, though this marriage was a very brief one. Her second husband was George Hay, earl of Gifford (1822–1862) a long-time suitor whose health had just been shattered as he struggled to prevent a rock crushing some of his workmen. She looked after him till his death a couple of months later. She herself suffered greatly in her last years, enduring breast cancer with "fortitude and patience" (see Lyall 139). Her son remembered her as "one of the sweetest, most beautiful, most accomplished, wittiest, most loving, and lovable human beings that ever walked upon the earth. There was no quality wanting to her perfection" (qtd. in Lyall 139). — <a href="../../../misc/banerjee.html">Jacqueline Banerjee</a></p>

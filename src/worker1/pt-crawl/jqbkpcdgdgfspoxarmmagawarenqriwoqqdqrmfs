He   arrived in Havana on 17 December 1835.</FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">He left Havana on 23 April 1850, bound for   New York, where he arrived on 1 May 1850. After a few months, in   early October 1850, he moved to Clifton (Staten Island), NY, where   he lived up to 18 October 1889, when he died.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">He became a citizen of the United States of   America, his petition having been filed on 27 March   1854.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In conclusion, Meucci lived in Florence,   Italy, about 27 years; in Havana, Cuba, about 15 years; and in   Clifton, NY (USA), about 39 years.

Why did he leave Florencein 1835 and Havana in 1850?</B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">&#149; He left Florence, in 1835, for   two reasons:</FONT>      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">1. because, having taken part in      the conspiracies for the liberation of Italy, he was under      constant surveillance by the police of the Grand Duchy of      Tuscany (Hapsburg-Lorraine);</FONT>            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. because it happened that a Spanish      impresario residing in Havana, Cuba, came to Florence to      recruit opera singers and offered Meucci the job of Chief      Engineer and Meucci's wife, Esther, the job of Head of      costumers of his Tac&oacute;n Theater. The salary was twice as      that they gained in Florence. Therefore, the Meuccis readily      accepted.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">&#149; He left Havana, in 1850, basically   for the following reasons:</FONT></P>      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">1. because, in 1850, his      impresario, Don Francisco Mart&iacute; y Torrens, decided to      withdraw from the theater business (also given his bad      relations with the new Spanish Governor of Cuba) and therefore      advised the Meuccis that he would not renew, for the third      time, the 5-years contract with them.</FONT>            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. because the Cuban government, alarmed      by the separatist plots, did not trust Meucci, being a Mason      and a supporter of Garibaldi, the "liberator" of many Spanish      colonies.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">3. because Meucci thought that he could      better exploit his inventions in New York, as many of the new      technologies started to come from the USA, instead of      Europe.</FONT></P>            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">* Note that the reason, related by some      authors, according to which Meucci left Havana on account of a      fire that had broken out in the Teatro Tac&oacute;n, cannot be      true, as no fire actually took place, according to the records      of the theater.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<HR></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME=2></A><B>Q. How was Antonio Meucci as aperson?</B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">In his adult age, he was more than   1.80 meter (about 6-foot) tall, strong as an oak tree,and weighed   about two hundred pounds. He had a very large head with wide   forehead and wonderfully intelligent, bright and penetrating, gray   eyes (see </FONT><A HREF="curriculum.htm#amphoto85"><FONT FACE="Arial">photograph   of 1885</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">).

Are there descendants ofAntonio Meucci?</B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">No, there are not. An accurate   investigation was made by this author and it was found that he did   not have sons, even natural, as maintained by would-be children,   such as one Carlo Meucci and one Mathilda Grosch. The last   descendant of Antonio Meucci's brothers or sisters was Bianca D.   E. Meucci, the niece of Giuseppe Meucci, Antonio's brother. She   died in Florence, unmarried and without sons, on 20 January 1962,   thus extinguishing the whole branch of the family.

Even renowned   painters named "Antonio Meucci" are reported, one at "La Scala"   Theater of Milan, the other in Venezuela, who was the author of a   portrait of Simon Bolivar. Whoever bears the name "Meucci" or   claims some familiarity with Antonio Meucci, as handed down to   him/her from his/her ancestors should be proud of it.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<HR></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME=4></A><B>Q.

The   inventor filing a <I>caveat</I> had the right to be advised by the   US Patent Office in case any other inventor would file an   application on the same subject. This "notice to complete" would   allow the <I>caveator</I> to file, within three months from said   notice, a regular Patent application which, if passed by the   <I>examiner of interference</I>, would ensure his priority. The   <I>caveat</I> was to be maintained in secrecy by the Patent Office   and lasted one year, but it could be renewed by paying a fee of   $10 per year. The <I>caveat</I> was abolished in 1909.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<HR></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME=18></A><B>Q.

The patent   lawyer asked for a $250 fee, that Meucci was not able to pay (see   </FONT><A HREF="meucci_poverty.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">Meucci   poverty</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">). Therefore, Meucci opted   for a caveat, that only cost $20 ($10 for the Patent Office and   $10 for the lawyer's fee). Given the low fee received, the lawyer   dictated the caveat specification in half an hour and did not   include any drawings. He said that it assured enough protection as   was.</FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a consequence of the above the caveat   only included description of the acoustic interface, the means for   call signaling (not quoted in Bell's first telephone patent), the   requirements for quietness of the environment, and the continuity   of the line conductor. In addition, due to the lack of knowledge   of the patent lawyer and Meucci's limited knowledge of English,   the wording of the caveat was imperfect in some points.

Bendelari proposed   Meucci's <I>telettrofono</I> to Settimio Volpicelli, Deputy   Postmaster of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies<SUP>1</SUP>, who   declined the offer, also because in those days Garibaldi was at   the gates of Naples and the Bourbon's regime was about to fall. It   must be pointed out that the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies possessed   the more extended telegraph network in Italy and, after the   unification of Italy, the Director of Naples's Telegraphs was   named Director of the Telegraphs of Italy.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>1871, December 12</B> -- Meucci founds   in New York the <I>Telettrofono Company</I>, with three   distinguished Italian partners: Angelo Zilio Grandi, Secretary of   the Italian Consulate in New York, Angelo Antonio Tremeschin, a   contractor for civil constructions, and Sereno G.

The   latter passed away a few months afterwards, and, at about the same   time, Mr. Tremeschin moved his business to Italy. Meucci tried in   vain to replace them with other partners.</FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the summer of 1872, by no means   discouraged, Meucci, accompanied by his friend, Angelo Bertolino,   called to Mr. Edward B. Grant, Vice President of the <I>American   District Telegraph Co.</I> of New York, to get permission for   testing his telephone apparatus on the company's lines. To this   end, he provided Mr. Grant with detailed description and   prototypes of his telephone as well as a copy of his caveat. If   the tests were successful, Meucci hoped that the <I>American   District Telegraph Co.</I> or its parent company, the <I>Western   Union Telegraph Company</I> could exploit his   invention<SUP>2</SUP>. However, also this attempt turned out to be   unsuccessful, since after two years of repeated visits and various   excuses, Mr. Grant said that he could not fulfill the promise and,   moreover, that he had lost all the material received. The   suspicion was that he intended to exploit Meucci's invention on   his own, also given that Meucci, in very destitute conditions,   could not renew his caveat at the end of 1874.</FONT></P></LI></OL><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The above proves that Meucci did his best tobring his invention to the public, repeatedly, and trying to exploitall possibilities. The failure of his attempts can be attributed inpart to the lack of evaluation of the importance of the telephone bythe telegraph managers of the time (the same encountered by AlexanderGraham Bell many years afterward), and in part to the difficultiesencountered by non anglosaxon entrepreneurs in the Americanindustrial entourage of the eighteen century.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">__________________<BR><SUP>1</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><I>Affidavit ofEnrico Bendelari</I>, sworn January 13, 1880, National Archives andRecords Administration, College Park, MD, Records of the Departmentof Justice (RG60), File 6921-1885, Box 10, Folder 1.<BR><I><SUP>2</SUP>Affidavit of Angelo Bertolino</I>, sworn September 18,1885, National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, MD,Records of the Department of Justice (RG60), File 6921-1885, Box 10,Folder 1.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><HR></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME=9></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B>Q.Was Meucci's <I>Memorandum Book</I> "a forgery"?</B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Well, it was defined   "a forgery" by a lawyer of the opposing party.

In fact, when   adolescent, he had learned French in Florence, both because of the   Napoleonic occupation of Tuscany and because French was the main   language of arts and sciences, all over the nineteen century and   all over the world.

John Goode, acting Attorney   General, recommending that the Department of Justice institute a   suit to annul the two principal Bell patents on the telephone, on   the ground that they were fraudulently obtained. In their reports,   both G. A. Jenks and H. L. Muldrow positively commented on   Meucci's pioneering work on the telephone. Hon. Lamar attached to   his letter the three aforementioned reports as well as 60   documents exhibited during the public hearings held before him   between 9 and 15 November, 1885.

Prior to   that date, on September 26, 1887, the judges of said Circuit Court   had sustained a demurrer filed by the Bell Company's lawyers and   had dismissed the case. The Government immediately appealed to the   decision of the Court and the case was taken to the Supreme Court   in Washington. This court, on the aforementioned date of November   12, 1888, reversed the verdict of the Circuit Court and forced the   latter to reject the demurrer of the Bell Company and to resume   the trial, finding it meritorious because of the likelihood of   government success in nullifying the Bell patents.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This sentence (very much like Lamar's letter   mentioned above) lifted Meucci's spirits and was considered by his   supporters as a victory for him, though interlocutory, to the   point that, subsequently, they erroneously referred to it as a   "Supreme Court decision for Meucci." This was utterly incorrect,   also because, in the above sentence, Meucci was only mentioned as   one of the six principal inventors who had anticipated   Bell.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As known, Meucci died on October 18, 1889,   before he could find out the outcome of the government case.

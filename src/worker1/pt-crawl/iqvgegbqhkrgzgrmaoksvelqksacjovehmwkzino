<BR> <H1> ARCHIAS : EPIGRAMS</H1>

<P> <I><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Licinius_Archias">Archias</A>, who lived in the first half of the 1st century B.C., is one of the best-known poets included in the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Anthology">Greek Anthology</A>, because he was defended by Cicero in a court case of 62 B.C, and <A HREF="../cicero/archias.html">Cicero's speech</A> has survived.  However, it is likely that many of the epigrams attributed to him were not actually written by him.</I> 

<P> <I>All of his surviving epigrams are shown here, in the order that they appear scattered throughout the 
Greek Anthology.  The labels in <FONT CLASS="ref">red</FONT> at the start of each epigram are their numbers within the Anthology.  The labels in <FONT CLASS="green">green</FONT> are the numbers assigned to the epigrams in the edition by A.S.F.Gow &amp; D.L.Page, &quot;The Greek Anthology: The Garland of Philip and Some Contemporary Epigrams&quot;. </I>

<P> <I>The translations are taken from the edition by W.R.Paton (1916-18), but have been modified to remove some of the archaic language. The translator's notes are shown in <FONT CLASS="green">green</FONT>. &nbsp; Click on</I> <FONT CLASS="Latin"> G</FONT> <I>to go to the Greek text of each epigram. </I>

<P>  Looking at the cows and the jasper on my hand, you will fancy that the cows breathe and the jasper puts forth grass.

<P> Stranger, I, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/priapus.html#1">Priapus</A>, was set up on this sea-beaten rock to guard the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrace.html#1">Thracian</A> strait, <FONT CLASS="green">*</FONT> &nbsp; by the sailors, whom I had often rushed to help when they called upon me, bringing from astern the sweet <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zephyr.html#1">Zephyr</A>. Therefore, as is meet and right, you shall never see my altar lacking the fat of beasts or crowns in the spring, but ever smoking with incense and alight. Yet not ever a <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecatomb">hecatomb</A> is so pleasing to the gods as due honour.

<P> Little am I to look on, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/priapus.html#1">Priapus</A>, who dwell on this spur by the beach, companion of the gulls, denizens of land and sea, with a peaked head and no feet, just such as the sons of toiling fishermen would carve on the desert shore. But if any netsman or rod-fisher call on me for help, I come to him quicker than the wind. I see, too, the creatures that move under the water, and indeed the character of us gods is known rather from our actions than from our shapes.

<P> The fishermen dedicated me. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pan.html#1">Pan</A>, here on this holy cliff, Pan of the shore, the guardian of this secure haven. Sometimes I care for the fishing-baskets, and sometimes for the fishers who draw their seine on this beach. But, stranger, sail past, and in return for this kindness I will send a gentle south-west wind at your back.

<P> It is of bronze, but see what strength he contrived to show, the sculptor of the boar, moulding a living beast with the bristles standing up on its neck, with sharpened tusks, grunting and darting terrible light from its eyes, all its lips wet with foam. No longer do we marvel that it destroyed a chosen host of demi-gods.

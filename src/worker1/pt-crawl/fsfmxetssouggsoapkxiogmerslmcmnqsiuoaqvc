[The following passage comes from <span class="hnbook">The Life and Letters of John Everett Millais</span> —  <a href ="../../../../cv/gplbio.html">George P. Landow</a>]
</p>

Leech, the famous caricaturist of <span class="book">Punch</span>, . . . was a man of whom, if of anybody, one might say,
" I shall not look upon his like again." "The truest gentleman I ever met," was what was said of him by those who knew
him best -- by such judges of men as <a href="../../../authors/wmt/index.html">Thackeray</a>, <a href="../../../authors/trollope/index.html">Trollope</a>,
<a href="../../../painting/frith/index.html">Frith</a>, <a href="../dumaurier/index.html">Du Maurier</a>, Dean Hole, and others -- and no words
could better convey the sentiments of Millais himself. To
speak of him after his death was always more or less painful
to my father, though now and then, when sport was upper-most in his mind, he would talk enthusiastically of the happy days when they shot or rode together or rollicked about town as gay young bachelors bent on all the amusement they could find.
</p>

<p>
Hear what Du Maurier says of him in <span class="book">Harper's Magazine</span>: —" He was the most sympathetic and attractive person
I ever met; not funny at all in conversation, or ever wishing
to be, except now or then for a capital story, which he told
to perfection.
</p>

<p>
"The keynote of his character, socially, seemed to be
self-effacement, high-bred courtesy, never-failing considera-
tion for others. He was the most charming companion
conceivable, having intimately known so many important
and celebrated people, and liking to speak of them; but
one would never have guessed from anything he ever looked or said
that he had made a whole nation, male and female, gentle and simple,
old and young, laugh as it had never laughed before or since, for
 a quarter of a century.
</p>

<p>
He was tall, thin, and graceful, extremely handsome, of the higher
Irish type, with dark hair and whiskers and complexion, and very
light greyish-blue eyes; but the expression of his face was habitually
sad, even when he smiled.   In dress, bearing, manner, and aspect
 he was the very type of the well-bred English gentleman and man
of the world and good society. . . . Thackeray and Sir John Millais -- 
not bad judges, and men with many friends -- have both said that
they personally loved John Leech in better than any man they ever knew:"
</p>

<p>
This, I think, fairly sums up the
 character of the man whose name . . . figures so
often and so prominently in my father's correspondence. It
was in 1851 that they first met, and one of the first results
of the intimacy that then sprang up between them was Millais'
conversion to his friend's view of fox-hunting as one of the
finest sports in the world both for man and beast. Hitherto
he had insisted that, unlike shooting or fishing, at both of
which he was already an expert, hunting was "a barbarous
and uncivilised sport," and as such he would have nothing
to do with it. But Leech would not listen to this.
[I, 261-62]</p>

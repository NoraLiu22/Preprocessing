For Julia, a sister of Caesar's father, was the wife of Marius the Elder, and the mother of Marius the Younger, who was therefore Caesar's cousin. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.3">3</A> Moreover, Caesar was not satisfied to be <SPAN CLASS="whole">over&shy;looked</SPAN> at first by Sulla, who was busy with a multitude of proscriptions, but he came before the people as candidate for the priesthood, although he was not yet much more than a stripling. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.4">4</A> To this candidacy Sulla secretly opposed himself, and took measures to make Caesar fail in it, and when he was deliberating about putting him to death and some said there was no reason for killing a mere boy like him, he declared that they had no sense if they did not see in this boy many Mariuses.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="

<A ID="p445"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p445 </SPAN></A>were searching those regions and arresting the men in hiding there. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.7">7</A> Caesar gave their leader, Cornelius, two talents to set him free, and at once went down to the sea and sailed to King Nicomedes in Bithynia.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.1">1</A> To begin with, then, when the pirates demanded twenty talents for his ransom, he laughed at them for not knowing who their captive was, and of his own accord agreed to give them fifty. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.2">2</A> In the next place, after he had sent various followers to various cities to procure the money and was left with one friend and two attendants among Cilicians, most murderous of men, he held them in such disdain that whenever he lay down to sleep he would send and order them to stop talking. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.3">3</A> For eight and thirty days, as if the men were not his watchers, but his royal body-guard, he shared in their sports and exercises with great unconcern. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.4">4</A> He also wrote poems and sundry speeches which he read aloud to them, and those who did not admire these he would call to their faces illiterate Barbarians, and often laughingly threatened to hang them all. The pirates were delighted at this, and attributed his boldness of speech to a certain simplicity and boyish mirth. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.5">5</A> But after his ransom had come from Miletus and he had paid it and was set free, he immediately manned vessels and put to sea from the harbour


<A ID="p447"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p447 </SPAN></A>of Miletus against the robbers. He caught them, too, still lying at anchor off the island, and got most of them into his power. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.6">6</A> Their money he made his booty, but the men themselves he lodged in the prison at Pergamum, and then went in person to Junius, the governor of Asia, on the ground that it belonged to him, as praetor of the province, to punish the captives. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.7">7</A> But since the praetor cast longing eyes on their money, which was no small sum, and kept saying that he would consider the case of the captives at his leisure, Caesar left him to his own devices, went to Pergamum, took the robbers out of prison, and crucified them all, just as he had often warned them on the island that he would do, when they thought he was joking.

	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="3">3</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.1">1</A> After this, Sulla's power being now on the wane, and Caesar's friends at home inviting him to return, Caesar sailed to Rhodes&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="

<A ID="p449"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p449 </SPAN></A>orator who was gifted by nature and had plenty of leisure to pursue his studies.

<A ID="p451"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p451 </SPAN></A>the <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful character hidden beneath his kindly and cheerful exterior, namely Cicero, said that in most of Caesar's political plans and projects he saw a tyrannical purpose; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.9">9</A> "On the other hand," said he, "when I look at his hair, which is arranged with so much nicety, and see him scratching his head with one finger, I cannot think that this man would ever conceive of so great a crime as the overthrow of the Roman constitution." This, it is true, belongs to a later period.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.1">1</A> There were two parties in the city, that of Sulla, which had been all <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful since his day, and that of Marius, which at that time was in an altogether lowly state, being cowed and scattered.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.1">1</A> At the time of which I speak, Pompeia was celebrating this festival, and Clodius, who was still beardless and on this account thought to pass unnoticed, assumed the dress and implements of a lute-girl and went to the house, looking like a young woman. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.2">2</A> He found the door open, and was brought in safely by the <SPAN CLASS="whole">maid-servant</SPAN> there, who was in the secret; but after she had run on ahead to tell Pompeia and some time had elapsed, Clodius had not the patience to wait where he had been left, and so, as he was wandering about in the house (a large one) and trying to avoid the lights, an attendant of Aurelia came upon him and asked him to play with her, as one woman would another, and when he refused, she dragged him forward and asked who he was and whence he came. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.3">3</A> Clodius answered that he was waiting for Pompeia's Abra (this was the very name by which the maid was called), and his voice betrayed him.

For although it was not full ten years that he waged war in Gaul, he took by storm more than eight hundred cities, subdued three hundred nations, and fought pitched battles at different times with three million men, of whom he slew one million in hand to hand fighting and took as many more prisoners.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.6">6</A> Horsemanship, moreover, had been easy for him from boyhood; for he was wont to put his hands behind his back and, holding them closely there, to ride his horse at full speed. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.7">7</A> And in the Gallic campaigns he practised dictating letters on horseback and keeping two scribes at once busy, or, as Oppius says, even more. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.8">8</A> We are told, moreover, that Caesar was the first to devise intercourse with his friends by letter, since he could not wait for personal interviews on urgent matters owing to the multitude of his occupations and the great size of the city. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.9">9</A> Of his indifference in regard to his diet the following circumstance also is brought in proof. When the host who was entertaining him in Mediolanum, Valerius Leo, served up asparagus dressed with myrrh instead of olive oil, Caesar ate of it without ado, and rebuked his friends when they showed displeasure. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.10">10</A> "Surely," said he, "it were enough not to eat what you don't like; but he who finds fault with <SPAN CLASS="whole">ill-breeding</SPAN> like this is ill-bred himself." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.11">11</A> Once, too, upon a journey, he and his followers were driven by a storm into a poor man's hut, and when he found that it consisted of one room only, and that one barely able to accommodate a single person, he said to his friends that honours must be yielded to the strongest, but necessities to the weakest, and bade Oppius lie down there, while he himself with the rest of his company slept in the porch.

<A ID="p507"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p507 </SPAN></A>he had previously come, and by the vigour and speed of his passage in so severe a winter showed the Barbarians that an unconquered and invincible army was coming against them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="26.4">4</A> For where it was incredible that one of his messengers or <SPAN CLASS="whole">letter-carriers</SPAN> could make his way in a long time, there he was seen with his whole army, at once ravaging their lands and destroying their strongholds, subduing cities, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="26.5">5</A> and receiving those who came over to his side, until the nation of the Aedui also entered the war against him. These up to this time had called themselves brethren of the Romans and had been conspicuously honoured, but now, by joining the rebels, they caused great dejection in Caesar's army. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="26.6">6</A> In consequence of this Caesar removed from these parts and passed across the territory of the Lingones, wishing to reach the country of the Sequani, who were friends, and stood as a bulwark between Italy and the rest of Gaul. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="26.7">7</A> There the enemy fell upon him and surrounded him with many tens of thousands, so that he essayed to fight a decisive battle. In the main he got the best of the struggle, and after a long time and much slaughter <SPAN CLASS="whole">over&shy;powered</SPAN> the Barbarians; but it appears that at first he met with some reverse, and the Arverni show a short-sword hanging in a temple, which they say was captured from Caesar. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="26.8">8</A> When Caesar himself saw it, at a later time, he smiled, and though his friends urged him to have it taken down, he would not permit it, considering it sacred.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.1">1</A> However, the most of the Barbarians who escaped at that time took refuge with their king in the city of Alesia. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.2">2</A> And while Caesar was besieging


<A ID="p509"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p509 </SPAN></A>this city, which was thought to be impregnable by reason of the great size of its walls and the number of their defenders, there fell upon him from outside the city a peril too great for words to depict. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.3">3</A> For all that was mightiest among the nations of Gaul assembled and came in arms to Alesia, three hundred thousand strong; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.4">4</A> and the number of fighting men inside the city was not less than a hundred and <SPAN CLASS="whole">seventy</SPAN> thousand. Thus Caesar, caught between so large hostile forces and besieged there, was compelled to build two walls for his protection, one looking towards the city, and the other towards those who had come up to relieve it; he felt that if the two forces should unite his cause was wholly lost.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.5">5</A> For many reasons, then, and naturally, Caesar's peril at Alesia was famous, since it produced more deeds of skill and daring than any of his other struggles; but one must be amazed above all that he engaged and conquered so many tens of thousands outside the city without the knowledge of those inside, nay more, without the knowledge even of the Romans who were guarding the wall that faced the city. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.6">6</A> For these did not learn of the victory until the wailing of the men in Alesia and the lamentations of the women were heard, as they beheld in the quarters of the enemy many shields adorned with gold and silver, many corselets smeared with blood, and also drinking cups and tents of Gallic fashion carried by the Romans into their camp. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.7">7</A> So quickly did so great a force, like a phantom or a dream, disperse and vanish out of sight, the greater part of them having fallen in the battle. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.8">8</A> Those who held Alesia, too, after giving themselves and Caesar no small trouble, finally surrendered.

Accordingly, he wrote a treatise in which he got together countless charges against Cato; and the work is entitled "<SPAN CLASS="whole">Anti-Cato</SPAN>." Both treatises have many eager readers, as well on account of Caesar as of Cato.

This the Romans use down to the present time, and are thought to be less in error than other peoples as regards the inequality between the lunar and solar years. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.6">6</A> However, even this furnished occasion for blame to those who envied Caesar and disliked his power. At any rate, Cicero the orator, we are told, when some one remarked that Lyra would rise on the morrow, said: "Yes, by decree," implying that men were compelled to accept even this dispensation.

For the multitude this was a first cause of hatred, and for those who had long smothered their hate, a most specious pretext for it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.2">2</A> And yet those who were advocating this honour for Caesar actually spread abroad among the people a report that from the Sibylline books it appeared that Parthia could be taken if the Romans went up against it with a king,


<A ID="p583"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p583 </SPAN></A>but otherwise could not be assailed; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.3">3</A> and as Caesar was coming down from Alba into the city they ventured to hail him as king.

But afterwards he made his disease an excuse for his behaviour, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.7">7</A> saying that the senses of those who are thus afflicted do not usually remain steady when they address a multitude standing, but are speedily shaken and whirled about, bringing on giddiness and insensibility. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.8">8</A> However, what he said was not true; on the contrary, he was very desirous of rising to receive the senate; but one of his friends, as they say, or rather one of his flatterers, Cornelius Balbus, restrained him, saying: "Remember that thou art Caesar, and permit thyself to be courted as a superior."

<A ID="p591"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p591 </SPAN></A>that when Caesar himself was sacrificing, the heart of the victim was not to be found, and the prodigy caused fear, since in the course of nature, certainly, an animal without a heart could not exist. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.5">5</A> The following story, too, is told by many. A certain seer warned Caesar to be on his guard against a great peril on the day of the month of March which the Romans call the Ides; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.6">6</A> and when the day had come and Caesar was on his way to the <SPAN CLASS="whole">senate-house</SPAN>, he greeted the seer with a jest and said: "Well, the Ides of March are come," and the seer said to him softly: "Ay, they are come, but they are not gone." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.7">7</A> Moreover, on the day before, when Marcus Lepidus was entertaining him at supper, Caesar chanced to be signing letters, as his custom was, while reclining at table, and the discourse turned suddenly upon the question what sort of death was the best; before any one could answer Caesar cried out: "That which is unexpected." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.8">8</A> After this, while he was sleeping as usual by the side of his wife, all the windows and doors of the chamber flew open at once, and Caesar, confounded by the noise and the light of the moon shining down upon him, noticed that Calpurnia was in a deep slumber, but was uttering indistinct words and inarticulate groans in her sleep; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.9">9</A> for she dreamed, as it proved, that she was holding her murdered husband in her arms and bewailing him.

For never before had he perceived in Calpurnia any womanish superstition, but now he saw that she was in great distress. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.12">12</A> And when the seers also, after many sacrifices, told him that the omens were unfavourable, he resolved to send Antony and dismiss the senate.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.1">1</A> At the time of his death Caesar was fully <SPAN CLASS="whole">fifty-six</SPAN> years old, but he had survived Pompey not much more than four years, while of the power and dominion which he had sought all his life at so great risks, and barely achieved at last, of this he had reaped no fruit but the name of it only, and a glory which had awakened envy on the part of his fellow citizens. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.2">2</A> However, the great <SPAN CLASS="whole">guardian-genius</SPAN> of the man, whose help he had enjoyed through life, followed upon him even after death as an avenger of his murder, driving and tracking down his slayers over every land and sea until not one of them was left, but even those who in any way soever either put hand to the deed or took part in the plot were punished.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.3">3</A> Among events of man's ordering, the most amazing was that which befell Cassius; for after his defeat at Philippi he slew himself with that very dagger which he had used against Caesar; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.4">4</A> and among events of divine ordering, there was the great comet, which showed itself in great splendour for seven nights


<A ID="p607"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p607 </SPAN></A>after Caesar's murder, and then disappeared; also, the obscuration of the sun's rays. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.5">5</A> For during all that year its orb rose pale and without radiance, while the heat that came down from it was slight and ineffectual, so that the air in its circulation was dark and heavy owing to the feebleness of the warmth that penetrated it, and the fruits, imperfect and half ripe, withered away and shrivelled up on account of the coldness of the atmosphere. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.6">6</A> But more than anything else the phantom that appeared to Brutus showed that the murder of Caesar was not pleasing to the gods; and it was on this wise. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.7">7</A> As he was about to take his army across from Abydos to the other continent, he was lying down at night, as his custom was, in his tent, not sleeping, but thinking of the future; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.8">8</A> for it is said that of all generals Brutus was least given to sleep, and that he naturally remained awake a longer time than anybody else. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.9">9</A> And now he thought he heard a noise at the door, and looking towards the light of the lamp, which was slowly going out, he saw a fearful vision of a man of unnatural size and harsh aspect. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.10">10</A> At first he was terrified, but when he saw that the visitor neither did nor said anything, but stood in silence by his couch, he asked him who he was. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.11">11</A> Then the phantom answered him: "I am thy evil genius, Brutus, and thou shalt see me at Philippi." At the time, then, Brutus said courageously: "I shall see thee;" and the heavenly visitor at once went away. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.12">12</A> Subsequently, however, when arrayed against Antony and Caesar at Philippi, in the first battle he conquered the enemy in his front, routed and scattered them, and sacked the camp of Caesar; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.13">13</A> but as he was about to fight the second


<A ID="p609"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p609 </SPAN></A>battle, the same phantom visited him again at night, and though it said nothing to him, Brutus understood his fate, and plunged headlong into danger. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.14">14</A> He did not fall in battle, however, but after the rout retired to a crest of ground, put his naked sword to his breast (while a certain friend, as they say, helped to drive the blow home), and so died.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref112" HREF="

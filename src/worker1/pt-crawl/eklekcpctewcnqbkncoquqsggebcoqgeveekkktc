        <h3><strong>Have the British Been Meddling with the FRUS Retrospective Volume on 1953?</strong></h3>



        <h4>Foreign Office Worried over Very Embarrassing Revelations, Documents Show</h4>

    <p>

    The United Kingdom sought to expunge "very embarrassing" information about its role in the 1953 coup in Iran from the official U.S. history of the period,

    British documents confirm. The Foreign Office feared that a planned State Department publication would undermine U.K. standing in Iran, according to

    declassified records posted on the National Security Archive's Web site today.

</p>

<p>

    The British censorship attempt happened in 1978, but London's concerns may play a role even today in holding up the State Department's long-awaited history

    - even though U.S. law required its publication years ago.

</p>

<p>

    The declassified documents, from the Foreign Office (Foreign and Commonwealth Office since 1968), shed light on a protracted controversy over crucial gaps

    in the State Department's authoritative <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> (FRUS) series. The blank spots on Iran involve the CIA- and

    MI6-backed plot to overthrow the country's prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq. Six decades after his ouster, some signs point to the CIA as the culprit for

    refusing to allow basic details about the event to be incorporated into the FRUS compilation.<a

        href="#_ftn1a"

        name="_ftnref1a"

        title=""

    >[1]

    </a>

</p>

<p>

    Recently, the CIA has declassified a number of records relating to the 1953 coup, including a version of an internal history that specifically states the

    agency planned and helped implement the coup. (The National Security Archive obtained the documents through the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.) This

    suggests that ongoing CIA inflexibility over the FRUS volume is not so much a function of the agency's worries about its own role being exposed as a

    function of its desire to protect lingering British sensitivities about 1953 - especially regarding the activities of U.K. intelligence services. There is

    also evidence that State Department officials have been just as anxious to shield British interests over the years.

</p>

<p>

    Regardless of the reasons for this continued secrecy, an unfortunate consequence of withholding these materials is to guarantee that American (and world)

    public understanding of this pivotal episode will remain distorted. Another effect is to keep the issue alive in the political arena, where it is regularly

    exploited by circles in Iran opposed to constructive ties with the United States.

</p>

<p>

    <strong>Background on FRUS and the Mosaddeq Period</strong>

</p>

<p>

    By statute, the FRUS series is required to present "a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record" of American foreign policy.<a

        href="#_ftn2a"

        name="_ftnref2a"

        title=""

    >[2]</a>

    That law came about partly as a consequence of the failure of the original volume covering the Mosaddeq period (published in 1989) to mention the U.S. role

    in his overthrow. The reaction of the scholarly community and interested public was outrage. Prominent historian Bruce Kuniholm, a former member of State's

    Policy Planning Staff, called the volume "a fraud."<a

        href="#_ftn3a"

        name="_ftnref3a"

        title=""

    >[3]

    </a>

</p>

<p>

    The full story of the scandal has been detailed elsewhere,<a

        href="#_ftn4a"

        name="_ftnref4a"

        title=""

    >[4]</a>

    but most observers blamed the omission on the intelligence community (IC) for refusing to open its relevant files. In fact, the IC was not alone. Senior

    Department officials joined in opposing requests for access to particular classified records by the Historical Advisory Committee (HAC), the group of

    independent scholars charged with advising the Department's own Office of the Historian.<a

        href="#_ftn5a"

        name="_ftnref5a"

        title=""

    >[5]</a>

    The head of the HAC, Warren Cohen, resigned in protest in 1990 citing his inability to ensure the integrity of the FRUS series. Congress became involved

    and, in a display of bipartisanship that would be stunning today (Democratic Senator Daniel P. Moynihan getting Republican Jesse Helms to collaborate),

    lawmakers passed a bill to prevent similar historical distortions. As Cohen and others pointed out, while Moscow was disgorging its scandalous Cold War

    secrets, Washington was taking a distinctly Soviet approach to its own history.<a

        href="#_ftn6a"

        name="_ftnref6a"

        title=""

    >[6]

    </a>

</p>

<p>

    By 1998, State's historians and the HAC had decided to produce a "retrospective" volume on the Iran coup that would help to correct the record. They

    planned other volumes to cover additional previously airbrushed covert activities (in Guatemala, the Congo, etc.). It was a promising step, yet 15 years

    later, while a couple of publications have materialized, several others have not - including the Iran volume.<a

        href="#_ftn7a"

        name="_ftnref7a"

        title=""

</p>

<p>

    <strong>Institutional Delays</strong>

</p>

<p>

A review of the available minutes of <a href="http://history.state.gov/about/hac/meeting-notes">HAC meetings</a>  makes it apparent that over the past

    decade multiple policy, bureaucratic, and logistical hurdles have interfered with progress. Some of these are routine, even inevitable - from the

    complications of multi-agency coordination to frequent personnel changes. Others are more specific to the realm of intelligence, notably a deep-seated

    uneasiness in parts of the CIA over the notion of unveiling putative secrets.

</p>

<p>

    In the Fall of 2001, an ominous development for the HO gave a sense of where much of the power lay in its relationship with the CIA. According to notes of

    a public HAC meeting in October 2001, the CIA, on instructions from the Director of Central Intelligence, decided unilaterally "that there could be no new

    business" regarding FRUS until the two sides signed an MOU. Agency officials said the document would address legitimate IC concerns; HAC members worried it

    would mainly boost CIA control over the series. The agency specifically held up action on four volumes to make its point, while HAC historians countered

    that the volumes were being "held hostage" and the HO was being forced to work "under the threat of 'blackmail'."<a

        href="#_ftn8a"

        name="_ftnref8a"

        title=""

    >[8]

    </a>

</p>

<p>

    The CIA held firm and an agreement emerged in May 2002 that, at least from available information, appears to bend over backwards to give the IC

    extraordinary safeguards without offering much reassurance about key HO interests. For instance, the MOU states that the CIA must "meet HO's statutory

    requirement" - hardly something that seems necessary to spell out. At the same time, it allows the CIA to review materials not once, but again even after a

    manuscript has passed through formal declassification, and once more after it is otherwise in final form and ready for printing. In the context of the

    disputed Iran volume, HAC members worried about the "random" nature of these provisions which gave the agency "a second bite at the apple."<a

        href="#_ftn9a"

        name="_ftnref9a"

        title=""

    >[9]</a>

    The implication is that the CIA will feel little obligation to help meet the HO's legal requirement if it believes its own "equities" are at stake. (This

    of course may still affect the Iran volume, currently scheduled for 2014 publication.)

</p>

<p>

    <strong>Is It the British?</strong>

</p>

<p>

    As mentioned, the CIA has begun to release documentation in recent years making explicit its connection to the Mosaddeq overthrow. Even earlier, by 2002,

    the State Department and CIA jointly began compiling an Iran retrospective volume. These are not signs of a fundamental institutional unwillingness to

    publish American materials on the coup (although parts of the CIA continued to resist the notion). The HO even tried at least twice previously to organize

    a joint project with the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office on Iran, but the idea evidently went nowhere.<a

        href="#_ftn10a"

        name="_ftnref10a"

        title=""

    >[10]

    </a>

</p>

<p>

    In 2004, two years later, the State Department's designated historian finished compiling the volume. According to that historian, he included a number of

    records obtained from research at the then-Public Record Office in London. Among his findings was "material that documents the British role." He added that

    he had also located State Department records "that illustrate the British role."<a

        href="#_ftn11a"

        name="_ftnref11a"

        title=""

    >[11]</a>

    By no later than June 2006, the Iran volume had entered the declassification queue. At the June 2006 HAC session, CIA representatives said "they believed

    the committee would be satisfied with the [declassification] reviews."

</p>

<p>

    Up to that point, the agency's signals seemed generally positive about the prospects of making public previously closed materials. But in the six years

    since, no Iran volume has emerged. Even State's committee of historians apparently has never gotten a satisfactory explanation as to why.<a

        href="#_ftn12a"

        name="_ftnref12a"

        title=""

    >[12]

    </a>

</p>

<p>

    When the IC withholds records, "sources and methods" are often the excuse. The CIA is loath to release anything it believes would reveal how the agency

    conducts its activities. (For many years, the CIA kept secret the fact that it used balloons to drop leaflets over Eastern Europe during the Cold War, and

    would not confirm or deny whether it compiled biographical sketches of Communist leaders.) On the other hand, clandestine operations have been named in

    more than 20 other FRUS publications.<a

        href="#_ftn13a"

        name="_ftnref13a"

        title=""

    >[13]</a>

    One of these was the retrospective volume on PBSUCCESS, the controversial overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954. Furthermore, the agency has

    released troubling materials such as assassination manuals that demonstrate how to murder political opponents using anything from "edge weapons" to "bare

    hands." In 2007, in response to a 15-year-old National Security Archive FOIA request, the CIA finally released its file of "family jewels" detailing an

    assortment of infamous activities. from planning to poison foreign leaders to conducting illegal surveillance on American journalists.

</p>

<p>

    If the agency felt it could part with such high-profile sources and methods information, along with deeply embarrassing revelations about itself, why not

    in the Iran case? Perhaps the British are just saying no, and their American counterparts are quietly going along.

    <strong>State Department Early Warning - 1978</strong>

</p>

<p>

    The FCO documents in this posting (<a href="#britDocs">Documents 22-35</a>) strongly support this conclusion. Theytell a fascinating story of transatlantic cooperation and

    diplomatic concern at a turbulent time. It was a State Department official who first alerted the FCO to plans by the Department's historians to publish an

    official account of the 1953 coup period. The Department's Iran expert warned that the records could have "possibly damaging consequences" not only for

    London but for the Shah of Iran, who was fighting for survival as he had 25 years earlier (<a href="docs/Doc 22 - October 10-11.pdf">Document 22</a>). Two days later, FCO officials began to pass

    the message up the line that "very embarrassing things about the British" were likely to be in the upcoming FRUS compilation (<a href="docs/Doc 23 - October 12.pdf">Document 23</a>). FCO

    officials reported that officers on both the Iran and Britain desks at State were prepared to help keep those materials out of the public domain, at least

    for the time being (<a href="docs/Doc 33 - December 22.pdf">Document 33</a>). Almost 35 years later, those records are still inaccessible. </p>

<p>

    The British government's apparent unwillingness to acknowledge what the world already knows is difficult for most outsiders to understand. It becomes

    positively baffling when senior public figures who are fully aware of the history have already acknowledged London's role. In 2009, former Foreign

    Secretary Jack Straw publicly remarked on Britain's part in toppling Mosaddeq, which he categorized as one of many outside "interferences" in Iranian

    affairs in the last century.<a

    Yet, present indications are that the U.K. government is not prepared to release either its own files or evidently to approve the opening of American

    records that might help bring some degree of closure to this protracted historic - and historiographical - episode.

<h3>Do Allied Demands for Secrecy Undercut the U.S. Public Interest? </h3>

<p>The delays in publication of the Iran FRUS volume raise broader questions about U.S. government justifications for withholding records after so much time

  has elapsed. When it comes to foreign government information (known as FGI) U.S. agencies deny access for sometimes decades after the events they cover -

  six decades in the Iran case, and counting. Consulting with allies before declassifying documents is a long-standing practice, though what exactly that

  entails is not well understood. The intelligence community regularly invokes FGI and "foreign relations" as reasons to deny

  requests through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In response to a 1999 National Security Archive FOIA lawsuit, the CIA used both rationales in

  declining to release all but a single sentence from the 200-page internal history of the 1953 coup written by <a href="#doc1">Donald Wilber</a>.<a

        href="#_ftn1b"

        name="_ftnref1b"

        title=""

    >[1]</a></p>

<p>

    Although agencies often cite legal grounds for keeping information on relations with other governments classified, there is good reason to challenge the

    appropriateness of relying exclusively on those determinations. The following questions raise additional considerations. They make particular reference to

    the Iran 1953 case:

</p>

<ul>

  <li>

    <strong>Does disclosure of information about other governments always critically impair intelligence relationships?</strong>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    The CIA routinely argues that divulging FGI will weaken cooperation with other intelligence agencies or make it harder to recruit agents. But a spy

    organization as sophisticated as MI6 understands that secrets are perpetually vulnerable to disclosure through official inquiries, leaks to the media, or

    nowadays WikiLeaks, especially given the free-for-all of the American political scene. Although the agency's argument sounds plausible, it is extremely

    unlikely that allied intelligence entities could afford to cut back meaningfully or over the long haul on cooperation and information-sharing with the

    United States. (See March 2013 Senate testimony by then-CENTCOM Commander James Mattis extolling the increased appetite of regional allies to share

    intelligence with the U.S.<a

        href="#_ftn2b"

        name="_ftnref2b"

        title=""

    >[2]</a>) Furthermore, the force of the argument diminishes when the information being withheld is six decades old, and has been repeatedly confirmed in public

    through knowledgeable sources.</li>

    <br />

  <li>

    <strong>Even if CIA concerns are legitimate,</strong> <strong>should these factors always be paramount?</strong>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    The U.S. military does not have final authority in matters of war and peace; the Constitution grants that power to civilian leaders. In the same way, the

    intelligence community does not, and should not, have the last word on whether withholding or releasing certain information serves a higher national

    interest. This notion is already embodied in our legal system and in the creation of entities such as the Interagency Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP)

    at the National Archives and Records Administration. But the system continues to exhibit an ingrained tendency to accept uncritically whatever the

    intelligence community asserts (to grant "great deference," as courts put it), when there may be countervailing factors worth considering, such as the

    effects on broader U.S. policy or standing (see below).

  </li>

  <br/>

  <li>

    

    <strong>What happens when the desire to honor foreign government sensitivities risks undermining other U.S. policies or priorities?</strong>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    Protecting allied interests is in principle a reasonable policy. But there are sometimes undesirable consequences that should be considered. The most

    obvious result of the current standoff over the FRUS series is that it has prevented the State Department's Office of the Historian from fulfilling its

    legal obligation. This also damages the credibility of the U.S. government, and the CIA itself, on matters of accountability and transparency, both at home

    and abroad. Finally, there is the intangible cost of keeping the public in the dark about key aspects of the past and about the performance of its

    government. (When former CIA Director James Woolsey found out in 1997 that agency officials had destroyed most of the files on the coup in the early 1960s,

    he called it "a terrible breach of faith with the American people and their ability to understand their own history."<a

        href="#_ftn3b"

        name="_ftnref3b"

        title=""

    >[3]</a>)

  </li>

  <br/>

  <li>

    <strong>Can protecting sensitivities about clandestine activities be justified in perpetuity?</strong>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    Is it reasonable to argue that a 60-year-old covert action remains as sensitive as it was at the time of execution, especially when it is as widely

    acknowledged as the Iran coup? Other than specific imperatives such as protecting agent identities (something no-one is arguing against here), logic

    suggests that the justification for withholding basic facts about significant historical events degrades over time. Furthermore, as alluded to above, when

    an agency insists unreasonably on keeping information concealed it undermines the legitimacy of the entire secrecy system.

  </li>

<br/>

  <li>

    <strong>

      What exactly is the "foreign government information" being withheld?

      <br/>

      <br/>

      </strong>

    Do the CIA's criteria for protecting other governments cover only documents originated by that government, or something more? Do they broadly include    <em>information</em> about that government? Do they also cover U.S. documents, as the British records imply? What is the mechanism for ensuring that these

    criteria are both appropriate and properly applied?

  </li>

  <br/>

  <li>

  <strong>

      What are the British afraid of?</strong>

      <br/>

      <br/>

      

    Other than the general principle of wanting to keep their own intelligence operations under wraps, MI6 and the FCO presumably are worried that reconfirming

    old truths will give anti-Westerners in today's Islamic Republic fresh ammunition to use against British interests. This is a questionable assumption.

    Iranian bookstores have carried Persian translations of the unexpurgated 200-page Donald Wilber history for over a decade, along with pirated versions of

    every other published Western document or account. It is unlikely in the extreme that there are new facts in the materials still locked in American or

    British vaults that would even mildly surprise readers in the Islamic Republic. There is also no evidence that Iranian officials are impressed by the

    distinction between leaked and officially declassified history.

    <br/>

    <br/>

    Furthermore, Iranian reactions, particularly in 2000 to President Bill Clinton's and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's public acknowledgements of the

    U.S. role in the 1953 coup, were generally positive.<a

        href="#_ftn4b"

        name="_ftnref4b"

        title=""

    >[4]</a>

    Why should the response be different for Britain? Hard-liners who want to torpedo relations with London will never lack for pretexts - artificial or real.

    Withholding pseudo-secrets about the 1950s will hardly discourage them.

  </li>

  <br />

  <li>

    <strong>Has the CIA or any other U.S. agency ever challenged the British position?</strong>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    Presumably the National Clandestine Service (NCS), the agency's operational side and by most accounts the main obstacle to releasing the documents, would

    simply accept MI6 requests without quarrel. It is a priority for them to cooperate with allied agencies. But if the British are blocking the way, have

    other U.S. government components with different institutional priorities questioned the validity or impact of the British demands? Assuming there is a

    process to allow for this, has it been used? In either case, will the interested public ever hear what happened?

    <br/>

    <br/>

    It is worth recalling an infamous U.S. Supreme Court case-that-never-was. In 1999, the Court agreed to hear a case involving the classification of

    information on "foreign relations" grounds. The British government had asked the State Department to keep in confidence a letter relating to the

    extradition of two British subjects. Their attorney requested the letter under the FOIA but was turned down, the underlying rationale being to prevent

    "foreign relations harm." The subsequent lawsuit went all the way to the highest court before it was discovered that a British official had already turned

    over a similar letter to the attorney. The court took the extremely unusual course of canceling oral arguments. If nothing else, the case highlighted how

    subjective - and costly - a proposition withholding foreign government information can be.<a

        href="#_ftn5b"

        name="_ftnref5b"

        title=""

    >[5]</a>

  </li>

  <br />

  <li><strong>What are the implications of failing to resolve the Iran dilemma for the State Department's statutory obligations to the public?</strong>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    Publication of the FRUS retrospective volume on Iran is said to be imminent (by the first half of 2014). If its appearance continues to be delayed (the

    manuscript was completed in 2003 and first entered the declassification queue nine years ago), or if it fails to account appropriately for the British

    role, how will that affect the standing of this invaluable series? What will be the impact on subsequent attempts by State's Office of the Historian to

    present reliable accounts of other sensitive foreign operations?</li>

<br />

  <li><strong>If this standoff cannot be resolved at the agency level, at what point should the Congress or the President step in?</strong>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    How would Congress respond to the relegation of the FRUS statute to virtual irrelevance? What role has the so-called High-Level Panel, including

    representatives from State, CIA and the National Security Council staff, played so far? For the Obama administration, the episode to date is a blemish on

    its aspirations for open government and rational classification practices, but one that is well within White House powers to remove.

    <p><strong>Washington, D.C., August 19, 2013</strong>  &ndash;     

    Marking the sixtieth anniversary of the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, the National Security Archive is today posting recently

    declassified CIA documents on the United States' role in the controversial operation. American and British involvement in Mosaddeq's ouster has long been

    public knowledge, but today's posting includes what is believed to be the CIA's first formal acknowledgement that the agency helped to plan and execute the

    coup.



<p>

  The explicit reference to the CIA's role appears in a copy of an internal history, <em>The Battle for Iran</em>, dating from the mid-1970s. The agency

  released a heavily excised version of the account in 1981 in response to an ACLU lawsuit, but it blacked out all references to TPAJAX, the code name for

  the U.S.-led operation. Those references appear in the latest release. Additional CIA materials posted today include working files from Kermit Roosevelt,

  the senior CIA officer on the ground in Iran during the coup. They provide new specifics as well as insights into the intelligence agency's actions before

  and after the operation.

    The 1953 coup remains a topic of global interest because so much about it is still under intense debate. Even fundamental questions &mdash; who hatched the plot,

    who ultimately carried it out, who supported it inside Iran, and how did it succeed &mdash; are in dispute.<a

    </a>

</p>

<p>

    The issue is more than academic. Political partisans on all sides, including the Iranian government, regularly invoke the coup to argue whether Iran or

    foreign powers are primarily responsible for the country's historical trajectory, whether the United States can be trusted to respect Iran's sovereignty,

    or whether Washington needs to apologize for its prior interference before better relations can occur.

    Also, the public release of these materials is noteworthy because CIA documents about 1953 are rare. First of all, agency officials have stated that most

    of the records on the coup were either lost or destroyed in the early 1960s, allegedly because the record-holders' "safes were too full."<a

    Regarding public access to any remaining files (reportedly about one cubic foot of material), the intelligence community's standard procedure for decades

    has been to assert a blanket denial. This is in spite of commitments made two decades ago by three separate CIA directors. Robert M. Gates, R. James

    Woolsey, and John M. Deutch each vowed to open up agency historical files on a number of Cold War-era covert operations, including Iran, as a sign of the

    CIA's purported new policy of openness after the collapse of the USSR in 1991.<a

A clear sign that their pledge would not be honored in practice came after the National Security Archive <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/ciacase/index.html">filed a lawsuit</a> in 1999 for a well-known

    internal CIA narrative about the coup. One of the operation's planners, Donald N. Wilber, prepared the account less than a year later. The CIA agreed to

    release just a single sentence out of the 200-page report. </p>

<p>

    Despite the appearance of countless published accounts about the operation over the years - including Kermit Roosevelt's own detailed memoir, and the

    subsequent leak to <em>The New York Times</em> of the 200-page CIA narrative history<a

        href="#_ftn4"

        name="_ftnref4"

    &mdash; intelligence agencies typically refused to budge. They have insisted on making a distinction between publicly available information on U.S. activities

    from non-government sources and official acknowledgement of those activities, even several decades after the fact. </p>

<p>

    While the National Security Archive applauds the CIA's decision to make these materials available, today's posting shows clearly that these materials could

    have been safely declassified many years ago without risk of damage to the national security. (See sidebar, "Why is the Coup Still a Secret?")

</p>

<p>

    Archive Deputy Director Malcolm Byrne called for the U.S. intelligence community to make fully available the remaining records on the coup period. "There

    is no longer good reason to keep secrets about such a critical episode in our recent past. The basic facts are widely known to every school child in Iran.

    Suppressing the details only distorts the history, and feeds into myth-making on all sides."

</p>

<p>

    To supplement the recent CIA release, the National Security Archive is including two other, previously available internal accounts of the coup. One is the

narrative referred to above: a 1954 Clandestine Services History prepared by Donald N. Wilber, one of the operation's chief architects, which    <em>The New York Times</em> obtained by a leak and first posted on its site in April 2000.

</p>

<p>

    The other item is a heavily excised 1998 piece &mdash; "<em>Zendebad, Shah!</em>" &mdash; by an in-house CIA historian. (The Archive has asked the CIA to re-review the

    document's excessive deletions for future release.) </p>

<p>

    The posting also features an earlier declassification of <em>The Battle for Iran</em> for purposes of comparison with the latest release. The earlier

    version includes portions that were withheld in the later release. As often happens, government classification officials had quite different &mdash; sometimes

    seemingly arbitrary &mdash; views about what could and could not be safely made public. </p>

<p>

    Read together, the three histories offer fascinating variations in perspective &mdash; from an agency operative to two in-house historians (the last being the

    most dispassionate). Unfortunately, they still leave wide gaps in the history, including on some fundamental questions which may never be satisfactorily

    answered &mdash; such as how to apportion responsibility for planning and carrying out the coup among all the Iranian and outside actors involved. </p>

<p>

    But all 21 of the CIA items posted today (in addition to 14 previously unpublished British documents &mdash; see Sidebar), reinforce the conclusion that the

    United States, and the CIA in particular, devoted extensive resources and high-level policy attention toward bringing about Mosaddeq's overthrow, and

    smoothing over the aftermath. </p>

<p>

    <strong>Source: <em>The New York Times</em></strong></p>

<p>    Donald Wilber was a principal planner of the initial joint U.S.-U.K. coup attempt of August 1953. This 200-page account is one of the most valuable

    remaining records describing the event because Wilber wrote it within months of the overthrow and provided a great deal of detail. Like any historical

    document, it must be read with care, taking into account the author's personal perspective, purpose in writing it, and audience. The CIA routinely prepared

    histories of important operations for use by future operatives. They were not intended to be made public. </p>

<p>    This heavily excised summary was almost certainly prepared in connection with Donald Wilber's Clandestine Services History (Document 1). By all indications

    written not long after the coup (1953-54), it includes several of the phrases Wilber used &mdash; "quasi-legal," and "war of nerves," for example. The text

    clearly gives the impression that the author attributes the coup's eventual success to a combination of external and internal developments. Beginning by

    listing a number of specific steps taken by the U.S. under the heading "CIA ACTION," the document notes at the end (in a handwritten edit): "These actions

    resulted in literal revolt of the population, [1+ lines excised]. The military and security forces joined the populace, Radio Tehran was taken over, and

    Mossadeq was forced to flee on 17 [sic] Aug 53."

<p>    This posting provides two separate releases of the same document, declassified 30 years apart (1981 and 2011). Each version contains portions excised in

    the other. Though no date is given, judging from citations in the footnotes <em>The Battle for Iran</em> was written in or after 1974. It is marked

    "Administrative - Working Paper" and contains a number of handwritten edits. The author was a member of the CIA's History Staff who acknowledges "the

    enthusiastic cooperation" of the agency's Directorate of Operations. The author provides confirmation that most of the relevant files were destroyed in

    1962; therefore the account relies on the relatively few remaining records as well as on public sources. The vast majority of the covert action portion

    (Section III) remains classified, although the most recent declassification of the document leaves in some brief, but important, passages. An unexpected

    feature of the document (Appendix C) is the inclusion of a series of lengthy excerpts of published accounts of the overthrow designed, apparently, to

    underscore how poorly the public understood the episode at the time.

    currently undergoing re-review by the CIA), with virtually all paragraphs marked Confidential or higher omitted from the public version. Still, it is a

    useful account written by someone without a stake in the events and drawing on an array of U.S. government and published sources not available to the

<p>    Kermit Roosevelt conveys information about rapidly unfolding events in Tehran, including Mosaddeq's idea for a referendum on his remaining in office, the

    prospect of his closing the Majles, and most importantly the impact President Eisenhower's recent letter has had in turning society against the prime

    minister. The U.S. government publicized Eisenhower's undiplomatic letter turning down Mosaddeq's request for financial aid. The move was one of the ways

    Washington hoped to weaken his political standing. </p>

<p>    Responding to the resignation of Mosaddeq supporters from the Majles, Kermit Roosevelt fires off a plan to ensure that other Majles members keep the

    parliament functioning, the eventual goal being to engineer a no-confidence in Mosaddeq. The memo provides an interesting clue on the subject of whether

    CIA operatives ever bought votes in the Majles, about which other CIA sources are vague. Roosevelt urges that as many deputies as possible be "persuaded"

    to take <em>bast</em> in the parliament. "Recognize will be necessary expend money this purpose and determine precisely who does what." At the conclusion

    of the document he appears to tie this scheme into the previously elaborated &mdash; but clearly evolving &mdash; coup plan. </p>

<p>    Roosevelt reports on developing plans involving Fazlollah Zahedi, the man who has been chosen to replace Mosaddeq. CIA sources, including the Wilber

    history, indicate that the military aspects of the plan were to be largely Zahedi's responsibility. This memo supports that (even though many details are

    excised), but also provides some insight into the differences in expectations between the Americans and Zahedi. With some skepticism ("Zahedi claims ..."),

    Roosevelt spells out a series of events Zahedi envisions that presumably would bring him to the premiership, albeit in a very round-about way. His thinking

    is clearly prompted by his declared unwillingness to commit "'political suicide' by extra-legal move."

<p>    The CIA's Tehran station reports on the recent resignations of independent and opposition Majles members. The idea, an opposition deputy tells the station,

    was to avert Mosaddeq's planned public referendum. The memo gives a bit of insight into the fluidity and uncertainty of developments with each faction

    undoubtedly elaborating their own strategies and tactics to a certain degree. </p>

<p>    This draft text from the State Department appears to be a result of Roosevelt's request (Document 9) to have an official statement available for use after

<p>    A priority of the Zahedi government after the coup was to go after the Tudeh Party, which had been a mainstay of support for Mosaddeq, even if the

    Committee members, and planned fate of arrestees. The report claims with high specificity on Soviet assistance being provided to the Tudeh, including

    printing party newspapers at the embassy. Signs are reportedly mixed as to whether the party and pro-Mosaddeq elements will try to combine forces again. </p>

<p>    This appears to be an example of CIA propaganda aimed at undermining Mosaddeq's public standing, presumably prepared during Summer 1953. Like other

    examples in this posting, the CIA provided no description when it released the document. It certainly fits the pattern of what Donald Wilber and others

    after him have described about the nature of the CIA's efforts to plant damaging innuendo in local Iranian media. In this case, the authors extol the

    virtues of the Iranian character, particularly as admired by the outside world, then decry the descent into "hateful," "rough" and "rude" behavior Iranians

    have begun to exhibit "ever since the alliance between the dictator Mossadeq and the Tudeh Party."

<p>    This propaganda piece accuses the prime minister of pretending to be "the savior of Iran" and alleges that he has instead built up a vast spying apparatus

    which he has trained on virtually every sector of society, from the army to newspapers to political and religious leaders. Stirring up images of his

    purported alliance with "murderous Qashqai Khans" and the Bolsheviks, the authors charge: "Is this the way you save Iran, Mossadeq? We know what you want

    to save. You want to save Mossadeq's dictatorship in Iran!"

    </strong></p>

<p>    In October 1978, a delegation of British FCO officials traveled to Washington for two days of discussions and comparing of notes on the world situation

    with their State Department counterparts. The director of the Department's Policy Planning Staff, Anthony Lake (later to serve as President Bill Clinton's

    national security advisor), led the American side. Other participants were experts from various geographical and functional bureaus, including Henry

    Precht, the head of the Iran Desk. </p>

<p>

    Beginning in paragraph 22, Precht gives a dour summary of events in Iran: "the worst foreign policy disaster to hit the West for many years." In a

    fascinating back-and-forth about the Shah, Precht warns it is "difficult to see how the Shah could survive." The British politely disagree, voicing

    confidence that the monarchy will survive. Even his State Department colleagues "showed surprise at the depth of Mr. Precht's gloom."

</p>

<p>

    In the course of his presentation (paragraph 23), Precht notes almost in passing that the State Department is reviewing its records from 1952-1954 for

    eventual release. A British representative immediately comments that "if that were the case, he hoped HMG [Her Majesty's Government] would be consulted."

<p>    This memo recounts Precht's dramatic presentation on Iran two days earlier (see previous document). "His was essentially a policy of despair," the author

    writes. When the British follow up with the Americans about Precht's outlook of gloom, they find that State Department and National Security Council (NSC)

    staff were just as bewildered by his remarks. One NSC staff member calls them "bullshit." Policy Planning Director Lake laments the various "indiscreet and

    sensitive things" the Americans said at the meeting, and asks the British to "be very careful" how they handle them.

</p>

<p>

    "On a completely different subject," the minute continues, "Precht let out &#8230; that he was having to go through the records of the 1952/53 Mossadeq

    period with a view to their release under the Freedom of Information Act [sic]. He said that if released, there would be some very embarrassing things

    about the British in them." (Much of this passage is underlined for emphasis.) The note goes on: "I made a strong pitch that we should be consulted," but

    the author adds, "I imagine that it is American documents about the British rather than documents on which HMG have any lien which are involved." (This is

    a point that may still be at issue today since the question of discussing American documents with foreign governments is very different from negotiating

    over the use of foreign government records.)

<p>    An FCO official reports that Precht recently approached another British diplomat to say that "he hoped we had not been too shocked" by his recent

    presentation. He says Precht acknowledged being "over-pessimistic" and that in any event he had not been offering anyone's view but his own.<a

    According to the British, NSC staff members put more stock in the assessments of the U.K. ambassador to Tehran, Sir Anthony Parsons, than in Precht's. The

    writer adds that U.S. Ambassador to Iran William Sullivan also shares Parsons' judgment, and concludes, without indicating a source, that even "Henry

    Precht has now accepted Sullivan's view!"

    it is part of the FCO folder on the FRUS matter. The writer repeats the remark from State's Anthony Lake that "some of the comments" from the U.S. side on

<p>    Still more interest in the possible State Department release is reflected in this short note, now a month after the joint U.S.-U.K. talks. Here and

    elsewhere, the British notes erroneously report that the release will come under the Freedom of Information Act (or the Public Information Act, as given

    here); they are actually slated for inclusion in the <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> (FRUS) series.

  U.S. Embassy London, Letter, Ronald I. Spiers to Sir Thomas Brimelow, March 24, 1975 </strong></p>

<p>

    <strong>Source:

    </strong></p>

<p>    Three years before Precht's revelation to his British counterparts, the U.K. sought general guidance from the State Department about how the U.S. would

    handle "classified information received from Her Majesty's Government." The month before, robust amendments to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act had gone

    into effect. This letter from the number two official in London at the time, Ronald Spiers, offers a detailed response. Britain's awareness of the new

    amendments and anxiousness about their implications (including the fairly abstruse question of how secret documents would be handled in court cases) show

    how sensitive an issue the British considered protection of their information to be. The U.S. Charg&#233; is equally anxious to provide the necessary

    reassurances. (More than a decade later, Spiers would sharply oppose efforts by the State Department's Historical Advisory Committee to gain access to

    restricted documentation for the FRUS series.<a

<p>    The British embassy in Washington is alerted to the possibility of documents being released on the 1952-54 period. The FCO clearly expects that, as

    apparently has been the case in the past, "there should be no difficulty for the Americans in first removing &#8230; copies of any telegrams etc from us

    and US documents which record our views, even in the case of papers which are not strictly speaking 'official information furnished by a foreign

    government.'" (This raises important questions about how far U.S. officials typically go to accommodate allied sensibilities, including to the point of

    censoring U.S. documents.) "What is not clear," the letter continues, "is whether they could withhold American documents which referred to joint Anglo/US

    views about, say, the removal of Musaddiq in 1953."

    </strong></p>

<p>    This follow-up to Gorham's earlier request (Document 31) is another reflection of U.K. skittishness about the pending document release. The embassy officer

    reports that he has spoken to Henry Precht "several times" about it, and that the British Desk at the State Department is also looking into the matter on

    London's behalf. The objective is to persuade the Department to agree to withhold not only British documents but American ones, too.

<p>    The embassy updates the FCO on the status of the Iran records. Precht informs the embassy that he is prepared to "sit on the papers" to help postpone their

    publication. Precht's priority is the potential impact on current U.S. and U.K. policy toward Iran. Conversely, a historian at the State Department makes

    it clear that his office feels no obligation even to consult with the British about any non-U.K. documents being considered. The historian goes on to say

    "that he had in the past resisted requests from other governments for joint consultation and would resist very strongly any such request from us." But the

    same historian admits that the embassy might "be successful" if it approached the policy side of the Department directly.

    <br/>

    </p>

<p>The embassy letter ends with a "footnote" noting that State Department historians "have read the 1952-54 papers and find them a 'marvelous compilation.'"

  <br/>

  </p>

<p>Interestingly, a handwritten comment on the letter from another FCO official gives a different view about the likely consequences of the upcoming document

  publication: "As the revolution [in Iran] is upon us, the problem is no longer Anglo-American: the first revelations will be from the Iranian side." In

  other words, the revolution will bring its own damaging results, and the revolutionaries will not need any further ammunition from the West.

<p>    In a handwritten remark at the bottom of this cover note, an unidentified FCO official voices much less anxiety than some of his colleagues about the

    writer asks: "why should we be concerned about 'any other documents'?" The writer agrees with the cover note author's suggestion to "let this matter rest

    for a while," then continues: "I think we ought positively to seek the agreement of others interested to Y." ("Y" identifies the relevant passage on the

<p>    British Foreign Secretary David Owen chairs this FCO meeting on the unfolding crisis in Iran. It offers a window into London's assessment of the revolution

    and British concerns for the future (including giving "highest priority to getting paid for our major outstanding debts"). The document also shows that not

    everyone at the FCO believed significant harm would necessarily come to British interests from the FRUS revelations. Although he is speaking about events

    in 1978, I.T.M. Lucas' comment could apply just as forcefully to the impact of disclosing London's actions in 1953: "[I]t was commonly known in [the

    Iranian] Government who the British were talking to, and there was nothing we could do to disabuse public opinion of its notions about the British role in

    Iran." (p. 2)</p>

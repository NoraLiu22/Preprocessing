</span></p>

<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">A bit of introduction is required to the
premise of <i>Spy x Family Code: White</i>, which serves as a standalone film in
the world of the anime TV series &quot;Spy x Family.&quot; Then again, maybe no
introduction is necessary, considering the fact that a feature film version of
the show, as well as the manga series (by Tatsuya Endo) upon which it's based,
has arrived in the United States only two years after the television series
began airing in Japan. There's a built-in audience for material like this, but
even with that in mind, the turnaround from the show's debut to a feature-length
film seems pretty quick, indeed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Watching director Takashi Katagiri's big-screen
adaptation, one immediately gets both the appeal and, because there already is
this film, the obvious success of the series. It's fun and fast-paced, but the
real selling point is a central gimmick that's overtly familiar but given a few
layers of complication and humor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Basically, it's the story of a spy who uses his
family to hide his profession. The twist is that the man's wife is using him as
much as he is using her, because she's a professional assassin. Both of them are
using an orphaned girl to complete the illusion of a family, but there's a hitch
in that, too. The girl is a telepath, who can read minds and knows what her
parents are up to, and she's kind of using the adults to figure out how much of
her telepathic abilities she can display without anyone realizing she's capable
of reading minds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Oh, the family also has a dog, named Bond and
wearing a bowtie, that can see the future, but since the dog can only verbally
communicate in particularly pathetic barks, the only one who knows of the
canine's powers is the little girl. The screenplay by Ichiro Ohkouchi throws all
of this at us near the start, and that's definitely the right move. The conceit
is too delightfully convoluted to keep hidden for too long.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Also, it's sincerely sweet beneath the
deceptions and cover-ups. It's not as if, for example, Loid (voice of Takuya
Eguchi), the spy/husband/father, is a cold and callous man, taking advantage of
a woman and young girl just to be better at his job. At home, he's attentive to
his wife, even if their relationship is a sham, and treats the girl with the
affection and care of a legitimate parent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The same goes for Yor (voice of Saori Hayami),
the assassin/wife/mother, who finds herself worried that her phony husband might
have a previously established romance with another woman. She's worried about
the marriage collapsing, not only because it would ruin the cover story she has
established, but also because the two of them have an actual relationship based
in respect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Finally, there's Anya (voice of Atsumi Tanezaki),
the telepathic kid, who stands out among the cast of characters, in part because
she has the traditional design—all of those round, exaggerated facial
features—of a stereotypical anime child, compared to the sharper lines and
more &quot;realistic&quot; appearance of the adults. It's mainly, though,
because the kid's a hoot, looking all innocent and childishly curious but
getting into just as much trouble as her parents, if not more so, because she
knows more than the spy and the assassin could imagine and just in general.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Take how the plot of this adventure actually
starts. After being introduced to the parents (with Loid implementing multiple
disguises to steal missile codes and Yor showing off her skill with a blade), we
learn that Loid (who has dubbed his family the Forgers in a bit of showing off,
perhaps) might no longer be participating in the top-secret mission that
necessitated him forming a family in the first place. That mission requires him
to infiltrate an upcoming ball at his target's mansion, and Anya's success in
school could win the family tickets the event.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Forget all that, though, because Loid decides
to start an unsanctioned mission to prove his worth. It means Anya has to win a
dessert-baking competition in her class, and Loid believes the best chance for
her victory is to travel to the judge's hometown, sample its most famous
dessert, and re-create the recipe. The scheme is so silly, overly complicated,
and oddly specific that it just might work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It definitely puts us in the film's mindset,
which is all of those descriptors and also imaginative in the ways the
screenplay keeps upping the stakes, reveals the background of its world in the
middle of a cold war threatening to go hot, and finds some sense of purpose for
each of the family members in this mission. Loid has to contend with a military
intelligence official (voiced by Banj&#333; Ginga), who first dares to take
Anya's dessert and later has a plan to start armed hostilities. Yor has to
deduce if her husband is seeing another woman before battling a cyborg on a
dirigible engulfed in flames. Finally, Anya finds a treasured piece of chocolate
aboard the train en route to their family getaway, and the payoff to that has
the girl fighting against her digestive tract, lest the bad guys obtain what was
hidden inside the treat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">There's so much goofy charm to <i>Spy x Family
Code: White</i></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"><font face="Cambria" size="3"> that it's easy to understand why the
series has become successful enough to justify this film. If this is an
appropriate translation of the TV show, the film is certainly going make
newcomers—this critic included—seek it out.</font></span></p>

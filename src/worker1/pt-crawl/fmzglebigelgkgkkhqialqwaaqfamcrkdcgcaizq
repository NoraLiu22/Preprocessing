<p><b><font size=+2>PROLOGUE</font></b></p>
<p>(Spoken by head actor)</p>
<p>First, from the very outset, I wish myself and you, </p>
<p>dear spectators, a gracious welcome. </p>
<p>I bring you Plautus by the tongue, not the hand,</p>
<p>and I ask you to listen sympathetically.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll listen and pay attention, 						[5]</p>
<p>I'll bring you in as few words as possible, I promise, Plautus' play's premise.</p>
<p>Comic playwrights always say this: </p>
<p>“the whole play is set in Athens” </p>
<p>so that the play might seem more Greek to you.</p>
<p>I’ll only say where the plot is supposed to have happened. 					[10]</p>
<p>This play is certainly Greek-like;</p>
<p>although it’s not Athenian, it’s at least Sicilian.</p>
<p>This is the background of this play.</p>
<p>Now I’ll give you the plot itself, </p>
<p>not by the bushel or peck, but by the storehouse: 					[15]</p>
<p>there’s so much of interest in this play.</p>
<p>There was an elderly merchant from Syracuse </p>
<p>whose wife bore him twin sons. </p>
<p>They were so alike in appearance </p>
<p>that their wet nurse couldn’t distinguish between them 					[20]</p>
<p>nor could their own mother could tell them apart. </p>
<p>So said, at least, someone who saw them.</p>
<p>I didn’t every see them myself, in case you thought so.</p>
<p>When the boys were seven, </p>
<p>their father loaded up a ship with wares 						[25]</p>
<p>and put one of the boys on the ship </p>
<p>and sailed to Tarentum on a trading expedition. </p>
<p>He left the other at home with his mother.</p>
<p>When they got to Tarentum there happened to be a civic celebration.</p>
<p>The place was crowded on account of these games 					[30]</p>
<p>and the boy got lost in the crowd. </p>
<p>A certain Epidamnian merchant </p>
<p>found the boy and took him home to Epidamnus. </p>
<p>The child’s father realized the boy was missing</p>
<p>and fell into despair, and on account of his affliction 					[35]</p>
<p>he died a few days later in Tarentum.</p>
<p>Later a message came to Syracuse with news of these events:</p>
<p>the boys’ grandfather learned that the one twin was lost</p>
<p>and that their father was dead.</p>
<p>He changed the name of the remaining twin 						[40]</p>
<p>in honor of the other that had been lost:</p>
<p>the one at home got the name</p>
<p>Menaechmus, the same name as the other.</p>
<p>and of the grandfather himself.</p>
<p>For this reason I can easily remember his name: 						[45]</p>
<p>he owed someone money! </p>
<p>I’m telling you now, don’t confuse them:</p>
<p>both brothers have the same name.</p>
<p>Now let’s return by degrees Epidamnus,</p>
<p>so I can tell you precisely what happened. 						[50]</p>
<p>If anyone of you wishes to take care of anything</p>
<p>at Epidamnus, speak up now,</p>
<p>but do it so there is the means to take care of it.</p>
<p>He’s a fool who doesn’t pay up front;</p>
<p>he who does pay is a bigger fool. 							[55]</p>
<p>Anyway let me start from where I began:</p>
<p>The Epidamnian I mentioned above</p>
<p>the one who made off with the twin,</p>
<p>had no children, but a lot of money.</p>
<p>He adopted the kidnapped kid 							[60]</p>
<p>as his own son and married him to a wealthy women,</p>
<p>and made left him an inheritance when he died.</p>
<p>He died while going out to the country when it was raining,</p>
<p>having crossed a swollen river not far from town,</p>
<p>and the river knocked him off his feet 						[65]</p>
<p>and sent him to a painful death.</p>
<p>Thus the kidnapped twin has become wealthy</p>
<p>and is living in Epidamnus.</p>
<p>Now that-twin-who-lived-at-Syracuse-Menaechmus </p>
<p>has this day arrived in Epidamnus with his slave, 					[70]</p>
<p>continuing his lengthy search for his long-lost-brother-Menaechmus.</p>
<p>So, while this story is being told, this is the city of Epidamnus. </p>
<p>When another play is put on, the setting will be different, </p>
<p>just as actors change their parts.</p>
<p>Now you see a pimp, now a youth, now an old man, 					[75]</p>
<p>now a pauper, a beggar, a king, a sponger, a prophet…</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><font size=+2><b>ACT I</font></b></p>
<p><u>Scene 1</u></p>
<p>PEN: The young folk call me Peniculus </p>
<p>because when I come to dinner I sweep the table clean.</p>
<p>You know, people who throw prisoners into chains </p>
<p>or put leg irons on runaway slaves 							[80]</p>
<p>are pretty stupid in my opinion. Think about it. </p>
<p>Here you've got this poor slob, you're going to add insult to injury? </p>
<p>Of course he's going to want to run away and cause trouble! </p>
<p>He'll get out of those chains some way or another, </p>
<p>saw the leg irons off 								[85]</p>
<p>or smash the lock with a stone. That's nonsense! </p>
<p>If you want to keep him so he won't run away, </p>
<p>bind him to you with food and drink. </p>
<p>Just tie the guy's snout to a loaded table. </p>
<p>If you give him enough to eat and drink – 						[90]</p>
<p>what he thinks is enough - everyday, </p>
<p>by Pollux, he'll never run, not if his life depended on it. </p>
<p>Yes sir, use that kind of chain and you won't need to post a guard. </p>
<p>These food chains (so to speak) are mighty elastic: </p>
<p>the more you stretch them the tighter they bind. 					[95]</p>
<p>Take me for example. I've been coming to see Menaechmus here for some time now, </p>
<p>and he has me firmly under his thumb - and I love it. </p>
<p>You see, that guy doesn't just feed his guests, he refreshes them </p>
<p>and makes them reborn. Nobody can cure what ails you better! </p>
<p>That's just the kind of guy he is. He gives feasts fit for the gods. 				[100]</p>
<p>He'll heap those platters up so high on the table </p>
<p>that if you want something from off the top </p>
<p>you need a step ladder to get at it! </p>
<p>But I've been shut up at home </p>
<p>with my loved ones these past few days, 						[105]</p>
<p>a pantry full of tasty loved ones in fact. </p>
<p>But, alas, now my loved ones are running low, </p>
<p>so here I am, come to visit lunch ... I mean Menaechmus. </p>
<p>But wait, the door's opening. There's the man himself coming outside.</p>
<p><u>Scene 2</u></p>
<p>(Enter MEN-1 shouting into doorway)</p>
<p>MEN-1: If you weren't so evil, if you weren't so stupid, if you weren't so wild </p>
<p>		and had any control over your mind, 				[110]</p>
<p>you'd see the things your husband hates and you'd hate them too. </p>
<p>And I'll tell you something else! If you do such a thing to me ever again, </p>
<p>I'll see to it that we get a divorce and I'll pack you up and ship you off to your father. </p>
<p>Whenever I want to go out you hold me back. You keep nagging me; </p>
<p>where am I going? what am I doing? what business am I involved in? 				[115]</p>
<p>what have I done while I was out? </p>
<p>It's like living with a customs agent! </p>
<p>Is it that necessary for me to tell you everything I've done or am doing? </p>
<p>I've spoiled you for too long. Now let me tell you what I'm going to do. </p>
<p>Since I have furnished you quite well with maids, food, 					[120]</p>
<p>wool, gold, dresses, fancy ones at that, and whatever else you needed, </p>
<p>if you're wise you'll steer clear of trouble. You will stop monitoring your husband. </p>
<p>And furthermore, just so you don't think the time you've spent spying on me has been wasted, </p>
<p>today I'm going to go take a tart out to dinner. That's right! I have a date!</p>
<p>PEN: (to audience) That man thinks he's cursing his wife, </p>
<p>		but he's really cursing me. 					[125]</p>
<p>If he dines out it's me that he's hurting, not his wife.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Good, by Hercules! I finally got rid of my wife by this shouting match from the door. </p>
<p>Where is the delegation from the League of Cheating Husbands? They should be giving me an award </p>
<p>for having faced the enemy so bravely. </p>
<p>I just stole this gown from my wife. I'm taking it to my doxy. 					[130] </p>
<p>It's only right for me to deceive that evil prison guard of mine. </p>
<p>This deed is beautiful, excellent, slick, executed with panache. </p>
<p>I stole this from my evil wife, and I'll hear about it, but it will really be to her loss. </p>
<p>I snatched the loot from the enemy, with no casualties on our side.</p>
<p>PEN: Say, friend, anything in that little bundle there</p>
<p>		you'd like to share with me?					[135]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Oh-oh. I'm dead. I've fallen into a trap!</p>
<p>PEN: 		On the contrary! Into safety. Don't be afraid.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Who is it?</p>
<p>PEN: 		It's just me.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Oh my luck and my salvation! </p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>PEN: 		Good morning!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				What are you doing?</p>
<p>PEN: 						Holding the right hand of my guardian angel.</p>
<p>MEN-1: You couldn't have come at a better time. Perfect timing.</p>
<p>PEN: That's me alright. I have perfect timing down to a science. 				[140]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Do you want to see my splendid deed?</p>
<p>PEN: 		What cook cooked it? </p>
<p>I'll know soon enough whether he screwed it up, even from just inspecting leftovers.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Tell me, have you ever seen that painting </p>
<p>were an eagle snatches up Ganymede or where Venus grabs Adonis?</p>
<p>PEN: Lots of times, but what do those pictures have to do with me?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		C'mon now. Look at me. 					[145]</p>
<p>Do I look the part?</p>
<p>PEN: 		What in the world have you got on?!</p>
<p>MEN-1: Tell me I am gorgeous.</p>
<p>PEN: 		When do we eat?</p>
<p>MEN-1: Just say what I told you to say.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Alright. I'll say it. You look fabulous.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Dare to add anything of your own?</p>
<p>PEN: 		Absolutely fabulous, darling.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Keep going... </p>
<p>PEN: 		No way. I'm not going any further </p>
<p>				until I know what I'm going to get out of it. 		[150]</p>
<p>You've had a fight with your wife so I'm going to be very careful around you.</p>
<p>MEN-1: There's a place my wife doesn't know about where we can blow the entire day.</p>
<p>PEN: Sounds good to me! How soon can I start the fire? </p>
<p>The day's already half wasted you know. 						[154-155]</p>
<p>MEN-1: You're the one wasting with all your talk.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Well dig my eye out through the sole of my foot </p>
<p>if I utter even a single syllable ... unless you ask me to of course.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Come over here, away from the door. </p>
<p>PEN: 		OK.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				No, even further away.</p>
<p>PEN: 						Okey dokey.</p>
<p>MEN-1: No, walk boldly over here, away from the lioness' cave.</p>
<p>PEN: Hmmm, you know, I think you'd be a good chariot racer. 				[160]</p>
<p>MEN-1: What do you mean?</p>
<p>PEN: 		You keep looking back to see if your wife's caught up with you yet.</p>
<p>MEN-1: What do you mean?</p>
<p>PEN: 		Me? Just what you want to hear: "yes" if you want "yes", "no" if you want "no".</p>
<p>MEN-1: At any rate, could you make a guess about a scent </p>
<p>if you got a good whiff of something?</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>PEN: 		I have a degree in sniffology. 					[165]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Then get a whiff of this, Peniculus. What do you smell? Why the face?</p>
<p>PEN: The top part smells like a women's gown, </p>
<p>the bottom part reeks of a odor you couldn't wash out for love or money.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Then smell this part, Peniculus. My! How daintily you shrink back!</p>
<p>PEN: 		What did you expect?</p>
<p>MEN-1: What is it then? What smells? Tell me.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Theft. Whore. Lunch! 						[170]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>MEN-1: You can have anything you want. By Pollux you are absolutely correct. </p>
<p>I stole this gown from my wife, now I'm taking it to my girlfriend, the prostitute Erotium. </p>
<p>I'll order a nice lunch to be prepared for myself, for you, and for her.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Yes!</p>
<p>MEN-1: We'll drink until the morning star graces the eastern sky.</p>
<p>PEN: 		That's a pretty picture. 						[175]</p>
<p>Shall I knock now?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Yes, or, better yet, don't. </p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Hurry up! We're already a keg behind schedule!</p>
<p>MEN-1: Knock gently.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Why? Afraid the door's made of glass?</p>
<p>MEN-1: Wait! Wait! For Hercules' sake! There she is, she's coming out. 				[179-180]</p>
<p>Ah! See how the sun pales beside the brightness of her beauty?</p>
<p><u>Scene 3</u></p>
<p>EROT: Sweetie! Menaechmus! Good morning!</p>
<p>PEN: 		What about me?</p>
<p>EROT: 				You don't count as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>PEN: Don't count? Hey! I'm a real character in this play, not just some stupid extra!</p>
<p>MEN-1: Guess what? Know what I want at your house today? </p>
<p>		I'd like a big old battle royal. 					[184-185]</p>
<p>EROT: That's what you'll get today. </p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Each of us will drink in battle. </p>
<p>Whichever of us is the better warrior the wine jug will decide. </p>
<p>The winner is yours, you judge which one you'll spend the night with.</p>
<p>When I see you, my lovely, I hate my wife so much ...</p>
<p>EROT: ... that you can't help but slip into something of hers. 				[190]</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		A garment for you, Erotium, mon amour, a little something taken from my wife.</p>
<p>EROT: You always win me over so easily! You're much better to me than any of my other customers.</p>
<p>PEN: A floozie will flatter flatter flatter so long as she sees something she can grab. </p>
<p>(To EROT) </p>
<p>If you really loved him you'd have nipped his nose off with kisses by now. 			[194-195]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Hold this, Peniculus. I wish to offer what I have stolen for her as I promised I would.</p>
<p>PEN: Oh for God's sake give it here. Dance like this with the gown later on.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Me? Dance? You're crazy.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Am I crazier than you? </p>
<p>If you won't dance, take it off.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		I stole this today at great danger to my well-being.</p>
<p>With less courage, and even less risk 						[200]</p>
<p>Hercules stole the Amazon’s girdle.</p>
<p>Take this, a little gift just for you, since you alone care about me.</p>
<p>EROT: True lovers ought to be motivated by such virtue.</p>
<p>PEN: Especially lovers who are in a hurry to reduce themselves to poverty.</p>
<p>MEN-1: I bought that for four minas for my wife last year. 					[205]</p>
<p>PEN: That's four minas down the drain as your accountant can tell you.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Do you think that you can take care of what I want?</p>
<p>EROT: 		I know: I'll take care of whatever you have in mind.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Then order a lunch be prepared for the three of us at your house, </p>
<p>and that some fancy food be bought down at the forum. Let's see. </p>
<p>A delicate cut of pork, some bacon, a bit of ham, 					[210] </p>
<p>a half a head of hog or something along those lines, </p>
<p>something juicy that'll make me hungry as a horse when I see it on the table. </p>
<p>Snap to it!</p>
<p>EROT: 		By Castor, you've got it!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				We're going to the forum. </p>
<p>We'll be right back. We'll have a few drinks while lunch's in the oven.</p>
<p>EROT: Come back whenever you want; it'll be ready.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Just hurry! 							[215]</p>
<p>To PEN You, follow me.</p>
<p>PEN: 		By Hercules you'd better believe I'll follow you today, </p>
<p>and watch every move you make. I wouldn't lose you for all the art in Athens!</p>
<p>(MEN-1 and PEN exit toward forum)</p>
<p>EROT: Hey! Get the cook Cylindrus out here to me on the double! </p>
<p><u>Scene 4</u></p>
<p>(Enter CYL) </p>
<p>EROT. Take a basket and some cash. Here are six drachmas.</p>
<p>CYL: Got it.</p>
<p>EROT: 		Go and bring back groceries. Make sure you get enough for three.		[220]</p>
<p>Not too much, not too little.</p>
<p>CYL: 		Who's going to be here?</p>
<p>EROT: Me and Menaechmus and his moocher.</p>
<p>CYL: 		Well that makes ten. </p>
<p>His parasite will eat enough for eight.</p>
<p>EROT: I have listed all the guests. You take care of the rest.</p>
<p>CYL: 		OK. </p>
<p>Dinner's just about done. Tell' em to take their places.</p>
<p>EROT: 		Return soon.</p>
<p>CYL: 				Consider me back already! 			[225]</p>
<p><font size=+2><b>ACT II</font></b></p>
<p><u>Scene 1</u></p>
<p>MEN-2: Messenio, I don't think there's any bigger </p>
<p>or greater thrill for a sailor than when he's been out to sea for a while </p>
<p>and catches sight of land.</p>
<p>MESS: 		It's an even greater thrill, I'll tell you, </p>
<p>when the shore you're nearing is your own. </p>
<p>But I beg you, Menaechmus, why have we come to Epidamnus? 				[230]</p>
<p>Or are we just going around to all the islands in the sea?</p>
<p>MEN-2: We have to look for my brother -- my twin brother.</p>
<p>MESS: But when are you going to put an end to this quest? </p>
<p>This is the sixth year we've been at this. </p>
<p>We've sailed around to Istria, Spain, Marseilles, Illyria, 					[235]</p>
<p>the entire Adriatic, Sicily, southern Italy – </p>
<p>hell, all of Italy that you can get to by sea. </p>
<p>I think if you had been looking for a needle in a haystack </p>
<p>you would have found it a long time ago by now; if it existed. </p>
<p>We're chasing after a dead man among the living. 					[240]</p>
<p>We should have found him a long time before now if he were still alive.</p>
<p>MEN-2: That's why I'm looking, to see if I can at least find someone </p>
<p>who knows for sure. If someone says he knows for a fact my brother's dead, </p>
<p>then I won't keep looking. </p>
<p>But until then, I'm going to keep on looking. </p>
<p>You don't understand how much he means to me. 					[245]</p>
<p>MESS: Humph. You’re grasping at straws. Why don't we just go home from here, </p>
<p>unless we're going to write a travel guide.</p>
<p>MEN-2: You do what you're told, eat what you're given, and stay out of trouble! </p>
<p>And don't be a such pain. You are a slave, and it's about time you started acting like one.</p>
<p>MESS: 		Humph. 							[250]</p>
<p>(to audience) It's talk like that that reminds me that I'm a slave. </p>
<p>He couldn't have said that more plainly or concisely. </p>
<p>I should keep my mouth shut, but by Pollux I can't! </p>
<p>To MEN-2 Listen, Menaechmus, I just took a peek in our purse </p>
<p>and we seem to be traveling rather light. 						[255] </p>
<p>By Hercules, if you don't return home </p>
<p>you'll run out of money looking for your twin, then you'll be in a fine mess. </p>
<p>The folks here in Epidamnus are nothing </p>
<p>but pleasure seekers and lushes. </p>
<p>The only others who live here are cheats and boot-lickers. 					[260] </p>
<p>Then you've got the hookers here too, </p>
<p>and they're said to be the best anywhere. </p>
<p>The name of the city is Epidamnus for a reason; </p>
<p>almost no one stays here without being damned.</p>
<p>MEN-2: I'll worry about that. Just give me whatever cash we've still got. 				[265]</p>
<p>MESS: Why do you want it?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		I'm afraid of what you just said.</p>
<p>MESS: What's to be afraid of?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		That you'll get me damned in Epidamnus. </p>
<p>You are quite the ladies man, Messenio, </p>
<p>but I have a chronic short temper. </p>
<p>If I keep the cash I can watch out for both of us: 					[270]</p>
<p>you won't go off on a toot and I won't get mad at you.</p>
<p>MESS: Then take it and keep it. hands purse over Happy for you to have it.</p>
<p><u>Scene 2</u></p>

<p>CYL: I picked up some nice stuff at the market, if I may say so myself. </p>
<p>I'll be able to put on a nice lunch for the guests. </p>
<p>Uh-oh, I see Menaechmus. I'll get whipped for sure 					[275]</p>
<p>coming back from shopping </p>
<p>after the guests have arrived. I'd better go up and talk to him. </p>
<p>(To MEN-2) Hello Menaechmus!</p>

<p>MEN-2: What guests are you looking for?</p>

<p>		you're looking for? 						[285]</p>
<p>CYL: Peniculus, you know, old Whisk Broom.</p>
<p>CYL: You're a bit early for lunch, Menaechmus. </p>
<p>I just now got back from shopping.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		So tell me, </p>
<p>how much do pigs cost around here? Those pure white ones </p>
<p>like they use for sacrifices.</p>
<p>CYL: 		A couple drachmas apiece.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 				OK. Here's a two drachma coin, 			[290]</p>
<p>go get yourself purified on me. </p>

<p>MEN-2: I don't care if you're Cylindrus or Coriendrus, damn you either way! 			[295]</p>
<p>I don't know you and I have no desire to.</p>

<p>Your girlfriend Erotium! I'm her slave. 						[300]</p>

<p>Pity there's nothing around to smash this guy's head in with.</p>

<p>(To MEN-2) Hey, Menaechmus.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		What do you want?</p>
<p>CYL: 				If you ask me – 				[310]</p>

<p>you certainly can't be feeling that well, </p>
<p>Menaechmus, cursing your own house and all, </p>

<p>I bought enough for three of you, or should I go get more, 					[320]</p>
<p>for you and for the moocher and for the lady?</p>

<p>to pester this person?</p>
<p>CYL: 		(To MESS) What business is it of yours? </p>

<p>CYL: (to MEN-2) I'm going to go cook this stuff up now. It won't take long. </p>
<p>Don't go far from the house. </p>
<p>Did you want anything else?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Yes, for you to go to Hades.</p>

<p>while I go set this stuff by Vulcan's flame. 						[330]</p>

<p>judging from what that basket case that was just here said.</p>
<p>MEN-2: But I wonder how she knew my name.</p>
<p>MESS: By Hercules, nothing to wonder about there. You see, sirens have this gimmick: </p>
<p>they send their little slaves of both sexes down to the harbor. </p>
<p>If some ship comes in from abroad, 							[340]</p>
<p>they pick a guy out and ask around where he came from, what his name is, </p>

<p>Set the table! Light the incense! Elegance </p>

<p>Such loveliness is also a loss for a lover, but for us it's clear profit.</p>
<p>But where is that man? The cook said he was in front of the house. </p>
<p>Ah! There he is. I see him. He's my best customer and biggest source of profit. </p>
<p>Of course that makes him more than welcome anytime in my house. </p>
<p>I'll go up to him now and speak to him on my own. 					[360] </p>

<p>MEN-2: 		Yeah, you're probably right. 					[385]</p>
<p>Here, take this. (gives purse to MESS) Now I'll find out whether she's interested more in me or in my money.</p>
<p>EROT: Let's go inside. Let's have lunch.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p>EROT: Well, why did you order me to cook lunch for you a little while ago?</p>
<p>MEN-2: I ordered you to cook?</p>
<p>EROT: 		Certainly! For you and your moocher.</p>
<p>MEN-2: Damn! For what moocher? </p>
<p>		(to audience) This woman is obviously out of her mind! 			[390]</p>
<p>EROT: Peniculus. You know, old Whisk Broom.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		What Whisk Broom? The one you sweep up with?</p>
<p>EROT: Don't be stupid. The one who came by with you a little while ago, when you carried off my gown – </p>
<p>the one you stole from your wife.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		What?! </p>
<p>I gave you a gown I stole from my wife? Are you nuts? </p>
<p>(to MESS) This woman must be sleep walking! 						[395]</p>

<p>and from the day I was born I swear </p>
<p>		I've never set one jeweled foot in this town. 				[400]</p>
<p>Besides, I had lunch on the ship, before I came here and ran into you.</p>
<p>EROT: 		Damn! </p>
<p>What ship are you talking about now?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Oh, a wooden one, </p>
<p>it's been scraped a lot, repaired a lot, banged on a lot with a hammer. </p>
<p>Its patches are patched over with patches.</p>
<p>EROT: Now please, stop fooling around and come inside with me. 				[405]</p>
<p>MEN-2: I don't know who you're looking for lady, but it isn't me.</p>
<p>EROT: Don't I know you, Menaechmus? Son of Moschus. </p>
<p>You were born at Syracuse in Sicily, </p>
<p>when King Agathocles was ruler, who was followed by Phintia, 				[409-410]</p>
<p>then Liparo, who then handed the kingdom down to Hiero when he died, </p>

<p>We can go in now if you like. </p>

<p>I want to get some fine embroidery work put on it.</p>
<p>MEN-2: By Hercules, that's a great idea! It won't look the same, </p>
<p>so my wife wouldn't know that you have it if she sees you on the street.</p>
<p>EROT: Good. So take it with you when you go, would you?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Sure. 							[430]</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if they're bad or good, just so long as they're there.			 	[575]</p>
<p>Money's more important than any trustworthiness </p>
<p>they might have. </p>
<p>If a man is poor but beyond reproach, he is considered worthless; </p>
<p>but if he is rich and corrupt, then he is all the more desirable. </p>
<p>The ones who take no interest in law or fairness 					[580]</p>
<p>keep their patrons nervous. </p>
<p>But the ones who are greedy </p>
<p>litigious liars, </p>
<p>who made their money by loan sharking and perjury, </p>
<p>they're itching for a good court battle. 						[584a]</p>
<p>When their court date is set, the date is set for their patrons too, </p>
<p>since their patrons have to defend them </p>
<p>whether the suit is brought before the people, the magistrate, or the judge. </p>
<p>That's what kept me from taking care of my own business today. </p>
<p>One of my followers got into a bit of a mess, so he held me back to help him. </p>
<p>I plead his case among the magistrates for his many evil deeds. 				[590]</p>
<p>I proposed twisted and broken terms – </p>
<p>in other words, I did what I was supposed to do - I tried to plea bargain, </p>
<p>I even tried to settle out of court. What did he do? He almost didn't make bail. </p>
<p>I never saw a man caught redder-handed! </p>
<p>Three witnesses to his crimes were there, </p>
<p>		and they were really tough to discredit. 				[595]</p>
<p>To hell with him anyway! He ruined a beautiful day for himself, for me too. </p>
<p>He shot the whole day for me. I never did get where I was going. </p>
<p>I did order lunch, and my girlfriend's waiting for me I'm sure. </p>
<p>As soon as I could I ran from the forum. Now I'll bet she's angry with me. </p>
<p>Maybe that gown I stole from my wife today will placate her. 				[600]</p>
<p>PEN: (to MAT) So what do you think?</p>
<p>MAT: 		That I'm married to a wicked man.</p>
<p>PEN: 				Could you hear what he was saying over there?</p>
<p>MAT: I heard enough.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		If I'm smart I'll duck in here where I can have some fun.</p>
<p>PEN: 				Wait a minute, buster! You have some trouble coming first.</p>
<p>MAT: By Castor you'll give back what you took with interest!</p>
<p>PEN: 		Sic him!</p>
<p>MAT: Did you think you could get away with that, you sneak? 				[605]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Woman, what in Hades are you talking about?</p>
<p>MAT: 		You're asking me?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				What do you want me to ask you?</p>
<p>MAT: Don't try to kiss up to me.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Get it, girl!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Why are you </p>
<p>upset with me?</p>
<p>MAT: 		You ought to know.</p>
<p>PEN: 				He knows, the bastard's just playing dumb.</p>
<p>MEN-1: What are you talking about?</p>
<p>MAT: 		The gown.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				The gown?</p>
<p>MAT: 						Yes, a certain gown ...</p>
<p>PEN: 								What are you afraid of?</p>
<p>MEN-1: I don't have anything to be afraid of.</p>
<p>PEN: 		You forgot one thing - that gown sure made you turn pale </p>
<p>				just now.					[610]</p>
<p>And you shouldn't have eaten that lunch behind my back either. (to MAT) Finish him!</p>
<p>MEN-1: Will you shut up?</p>
<p>PEN: 		No, by Hercules, I will not shut up. (to MAT) He's nodding at me to get me to be quiet. </p>
<p>MEN-1: By Hercules, I am not nodding at you, or winking, or anything else. </p>
<p>PEN: You've got a lot of nerve to say </p>
<p>		that you didn't do anything when they </p>
<p>			(pointing to audience) saw you do it. 			[615]</p>
<p>MEN-1: I swear by Jupiter and all the gods, my wife, - is that enough for you? – </p>
<p>I didn't nod at him.</p>
<p>PEN: 		Alright. She believes you now on that point, so go back.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Go back where?</p>
<p>PEN: 		Well, back to the embroidery shop I suppose. Go and bring the gown back.</p>
<p>MEN-1: And what gown would that be?</p>
<p>PEN: 		I'm going to give up if she can't keep up her side of the fight.</p>
<p>MAT: Oh! I hate my horrible life!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		There, there. Why are you unhappy? You can tell me. 			[619a]</p>
<p>Are any of the slaves not working? Are your maids not doing what you want? 			[620]</p>
<p>Tell me. I'll see that they're punished.</p>
<p>MAT: 		You are a fool.</p>
<p>MEN-1: You're still upset. This does not please me at all.</p>
<p>MAT: 		You are a fool.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Certainly, you are angry at one of the slaves.</p>
<p>MAT: 		You are a fool.</p>
<p>MEN-1: You're not mad at me, are you?</p>
<p>MAT: 		Now you are not a fool.</p>
<p>MEN-1: By Pollux, I haven't done anything wrong.</p>
<p>MAT: 		Now you are a fool again. 					[625]</p>
<p>MEN-1: There, there, my dear wife. What's the matter?</p>
<p>PEN: 		He's trying to suck up to you.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Could you stop bothering me? Am I talking to you?</p>
<p>MAT: 		Don't you touch me!</p>
<p>PEN: Atta girl!! (to MEN-1) You snuck off and ate that lunch without me, </p>
<p>then you stumbled out of that house all drunk wearing that garland and made fun of me.</p>
<p>MEN-1: By Pollux I swear I did not have lunch at that house today. </p>
<p>		Never set a foot inside there. 					[630]</p>
<p>PEN: You deny it?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		By Hercules, of course I deny it!</p>
<p>PEN: 				You've got some nerve! </p>
<p>Didn't I see you just a little while ago right there in front of that house wearing that garland? </p>
<p>And didn't you say that you didn't think that the half a brain in my bony little head was fully functional </p>
<p>and that you didn't know me and that you were a tourist?</p>
<p>MEN-1: Yes, I did leave you a short time ago, and no, I didn't say that. </p>
<p>		I'm only returning home just now. 					[635]</p>
<p>PEN: Oh, I know your type. You thought you had me in the palm of your hand, didn't you? </p>
<p>Well I'm going to get the last laugh, by Hercules. I told your wife everything.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		What did you say?</p>
<p>PEN: 				Oh, I don't know. </p>
<p>Why don't you ask her yourself?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		What is this, my dear wife? What did this guy tell you? </p>
<p>(MAT turns away) </p>
<p>What is it? Why are you silent? Why don't you tell me what it is? 				[640]</p>
<p>MAT: You ask me as if you didn't know.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		If I knew, by Pollux, I wouldn't ask you at all.</p>
<p>PEN: 				Bravo! </p>
<p>This act should be enshrined in theater! You can't hide it; she knows exactly what you did. </p>
<p>By Hercules I told her everything.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		What is it?</p>
<p>MAT: 				Since you apparently have no shame </p>
<p>and wish to confess your sins, listen up. </p>
<p>I'll make sure you understand precisely why I'm sad and what this man told me. </p>
<p>One of the gowns was stolen from the house.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		One of my gowns was stolen? 					[645]</p>
<p>PEN: See how that bastard is trying to trick you? (to MEN-1) No, it was stolen from her, not from you. </p>
<p>If it had been stolen from you, it would be safe now.</p>
<p>MEN-1: (to PEN) I have nothing to say to you. (to MAT) But what are you saying to me?</p>
<p>MAT: 		I'm saying that a gown vanished from the house.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Who stole it?</p>
<p>MAT: 		(to PEN) By Pollux, he knows who stole it.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Who is this man?</p>
<p>MAT: 		A certain Menaechmus.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				That's incredible! 				[650]</p>
<p>Who is this Menaechmus?</p>
<p>MAT: 		It's you.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Me?</p>
<p>MAT: 						You.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 								Who accuses me?</p>
<p>MAT: I do.</p>
<p>PEN: 		I do too. And you gave it to your little dish, Erotium, over there.</p>
<p>MEN-1: I gave it?</p>
<p>MAT: 		You! You're the one!</p>
<p>Want me to go get an owl to say "you, you" for you? We're getting tired of this already!</p>
<p>MEN-1: I swear by Jupiter and all the gods, my wife,--is that enough for you?-–[655]</p>
<p>I didn't give...</p>
<p>MAT: 		Yes you did, dammit! Don't go swearing false oaths!</p>
<p>MEN-1: But I didn't give it to her as a gift, I only gave her the use of it.</p>
<p>MAT: By Castor, I didn't give "the use" of your best toga to anyone to use. </p>
<p>It's right for women to loan women's clothes out, </p>
<p>and men to loan men's. Why don't you bring the gown home? 				[660]</p>
<p>MEN-1: I'll see that it's returned.</p>
<p>MAT: 		That would be for the best, for your own sake, I think. </p>
<p>You will never enter this house again unless you have the gown with you at the same time. </p>
<p>I am going home.</p>
<p>PEN: 		(to MAT) So what do I get out of this? I did put a lot of work into this for you.</p>
<p>MAT: You'll be repaid when someone steals something from your house. </p>
<p>(exit MAT to MEN-1's house)</p>
<p>PEN: That'll be never. I don't have anything that anyone would want to steal. 			[665]</p>
<p>Well, may the immortals god put the pair of you on a fast track to ruin. I'll head to the forum: </p>
<p>I've obviously worn out my welcome at this house! (exit PEN toward forum)</p>
<p>MEN-1: My wife thinks she's punishing me since she's locked me out of the house. </p>
<p>As if I didn't have a better place I could go to. </p>
<p>If I displease you, wife, deal with it. I have pleased Erotium though. 				[670]</p>
<p>She won't lock me out, in fact she'll lock me in her house. </p>
<p>Now I'll go beg her to give back the gown I had given her earlier. </p>
<p>I'll buy something better for her. Hey, there! Isn't there any door-keeper? </p>
<p>Open up, someone, and call Erotium to the door.</p>
<p><u>Scene 3</u></p>
<p>EROT: Who is looking for me?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Someone who loves your youthfulness more than his own. 			[675]</p>
<p>EROT: My Menaechmus! What are you doing standing out front? Come inside!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		No, stay here. </p>
<p>Do you know why I've come to see you?</p>
<p>EROT: 		I know, you've come to get yourself some more loving from me.</p>
<p>MEN-1: No, by Pollux. It's that gown, the one I just gave you. </p>
<p>Please return it to me. My wife has found out everything that I had done. </p>
<p>I'll buy you any gown you want that's twice as expensive as that one. 				[680]</p>
<p>EROT: But I did give it back to you, to take to the embroiderer's shop just a minute ago; </p>
<p>I gave you a bracelet too, to take to the goldsmith to get it fixed.</p>
<p>MEN-1: You gave the gown and a bracelet to me? That can't be right. </p>
<p>After I gave it to you and went to the forum I went home, </p>
<p>and after that I came here and here I am.</p>
<p>EROT: 		Oh, I see what you're doing! 					[685]</p>
<p>Think you're clever, don't you? You're trying to cheat me!</p>
<p>MEN-1: No, no, no! By Pollux I didn't ask for it back for the sake of cheating you! </p>
<p>I'm telling you that my wife really found out!</p>
<p>EROT: 		I never asked you for that gown. </p>
<p>You brought it to me of your own free will; you gave it to me as a gift, </p>
<p>and now you demand the gift back. Fine. Be that way. Take it, keep it, shove it.[690]</p>
<p>You can wear it, your wife can wear it, you can lock it up in a trunk for all I care. </p>
<p>As of this moment you are no longer welcome here. </p>
<p>To think that after all I've given you for free you should treat me in such a despicable manner! </p>
<p>Well, the party's over, mister. No money, no honey. </p>
<p>Or better yet, go find someone else to push around. 					[695]</p>
<p>MEN-1: I've done it now, by Hercules. Now she's angry too. (EROT turns toward door) Hey! I'm talking to you! </p>
<p>Stay! Come back! (EROT slams door) Are you still there? Please come back, just for me? </p>
<p>She's gone. Locked the door too. Now I'm locked out of both places. </p>
<p>No one believes me at home, or even here at my girlfriend's house. </p>
<p>I'll go and talk to my friends about this mess, </p>
<p>		see what they think I should do.					[700]</p>

<p>He's probably passed out under a table in some dive by now.</p>
<p>(enter MAT from MEN-1's house unseen by MEN-2)</p>

<p>Ah! There he is! I see him now. Ha! I was right! </p>
<p>		He's bringing the gown with him.					[705]</p>

<p>MAT: You're asking me? You shameless, wicked man!</p>
<p>MEN-2: Lady, do you know why the Greeks </p>
<p>used to call Hecuba a bitch?</p>
<p>MAT: 		No, I do not. 						[715]</p>
<p>MEN-2: Because she used to act just like you're acting right now. </p>
<p>She would growl and snap at anyone she saw, </p>
<p>so they were right to start calling her a bitch.</p>
<p>MAT: Oh! I cannot tolerate such shamelessness! </p>
<p>I'd rather pass my life as a divorcée 							[720]</p>

<p>Running up to tourists and pouring your life stories out to them?</p>
<p>MAT: What stories? I will not tolerate any more of this. 					[725]</p>
<p>I will get a divorce before I put up with your evil ways any longer.</p>
<p>MEN-2: As far as I'm concerned you can live your life out </p>

<p>MAT: But you just denied that you had stolen this from me, </p>
<p>and now you stand there with it right before my eyes. Have you no shame? 			[730]</p>
<p>MEN-2: Whoa! Hold on now, lady! You're pretty rude and rambunctious, anyone ever tell you that? </p>
<p>You mean to say that someone had stolen this gown from you? Well, it wasn't me. </p>
<p>Some other lady gave me this to have some alterations done.</p>

<p>That's the whole unvarnished truth, isn't it?</p>
<p>MEN-2: Lady! You're out of control! How much would a man have to drink </p>

<p>I don't know who you think I am, but I must have met you </p>
<p>the same day I met Hercules' second wife's grandfather. 					[745]</p>
<p>MAT: You can mock me, but you can't him. </p>
<p>Here comes my father now. (SEN and slave enter from forum) Why don't you look behind you? </p>
<p>Don't you recognize him?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Oh yes, I met him the same day I met the prophet Calchas. </p>
<p>This is the first day I've ever seen either of you!</p>

<p>Not as spry as I used to be, no sir. No spring chicken here. </p>
<p>I drag my body around like a burden, </p>

<p>Bad business this old age thing. When it comes it brings all kinds of troubles. </p>
<p>I'd better not start counting them off. Makes my speech too long. 				[760]</p>
<p>But I'm pretty worried about this here crisis. </p>
<p>What could be going on? Why does my daughter </p>
<p>want me to come to her house so suddenly? </p>
<p>She didn't even tell me what this was all about, 						[763a]</p>
<p>what she wanted, why she wanted me to hurry over. </p>
<p>But I'll bet I could guess: 							[764a]</p>
<p>she's gotten herself into some sort of spat with her husband. 				[765]</p>
<p>That's the way women are. Always trying to make husbands into slaves, </p>
<p>and they think their dowry gives them the right! </p>
<p>And the men aren't much better. </p>
<p>But there's a limit to what a wife has to put up with. </p>
<p>But a daughter never invites her father to her house 					[770]</p>
<p>unless something's happened or she's had a fight. </p>
<p>But whatever it is, I'll find out soon enough; there she is </p>
<p>standing in front of her house, her husband too. </p>
<p>Look at her. What a puss! Just what I thought. </p>
<p>I'll call her over.</p>

<p>SEN: Are you alright? Did I get here in time? Why are you upset? </p>
<p>Why is he standing over there all angry? You two </p>
<p>have had some kind of little skirmish, haven't you? </p>
<p>Well, tell me who started it, but keep it short and to the point.</p>
<p>MAT: I never did anything wrong, </p>

<p>But I cannot live here nor endure that man another minute. </p>
<p>Please take me away from here!</p>

<p>MAT: 		By that man you married me off to.</p>
<p>SEN: (to audience) Bingo! (to MAT) How many times have I told you two </p>
<p>to make sure not to come to me with your nit-picking? 					[785]</p>
<p>MAT: But how could I have avoided this, father?</p>
<p>SEN: 		You're asking me?</p>
<p>MAT: Yes, you tell me, deferentially but not if you don't want to.</p>
<p>SEN: 		How many times have I explained to you that you need 			[787-788]</p>
<p>to obey your husband, and not watch his comings and goings or stick your nose in his business?</p>
<p>MAT: But he's ... you know ... with that slu- ... pros- ... woman next door.</p>
<p>SEN: 		Well, obviously he has good taste. 					[790]</p>
<p>And if you keep on nagging him about it, I guarantee he'll be over there even more!</p>
<p>MAT: And he drinks there.</p>
<p>SEN: 		Do you think he'll want to go out drinking any less </p>
<p>on account of you, whether he goes over there or someplace else? Don't you know your place? </p>
<p>Do you honestly think you can demand he not go out any more </p>
<p>than you can forbid his inviting people over to his own house? </p>
<p>		Do you expect husbands					[795]</p>
<p>to act like slaves? If so, just give him some daily chores </p>
<p>and order him to sit with the slave girls and card wool.</p>
<p>MAT: I didn't bring you here to defend him, but to defend me. </p>
<p>Whose side are you on anyway?</p>
<p>SEN: 		If he's done wrong </p>
<p>I'll get after him worse than I've gotten after you. 					[800]</p>
<p>Look, since he keeps you in nice clothes and jewelry, gives you slaves </p>
<p>and keeps the kitchen cupboards full, it would be better for you to keep a clear head over all this.</p>
<p>MAT: But he's been filching my clothes and my jewelry out of a chest in the house – </p>
<p>he's stealing stuff from me! - stealing and sneaking it out of the house and taking it all to those sluts!</p>
<p>SEN: Well if that's the case, he's in the wrong. But if he's not doing that, 			[805]</p>
<p>then it's you who are in the wrong for falsely accusing an innocent man.</p>
<p>MAT: 		No, father, I'm not making it up!  He's got the gown right now </p>
<p>and a bracelet too that he'd taken to her. He's bringing them back because I found out.</p>
<p>SEN: Alright, alright! I'll find out from him just what happened. Let me go and talk to the man. </p>
<p>(SEN walks over to MEN-2)</p>
<p>Tell me, Menaechmus, fill me in, what are you two fighting about? </p>
<p>Why the long face? What's she doing standing way over there all upset? 			[810]</p>
<p>MEN-2: Whoever you are, whatever your name is, old man, I swear </p>
<p>by almighty Jupiter and all the gods...</p>
<p>SEN: 		Whoa! What's all this swearing all of a sudden?! Swear? Swear to what?</p>
<p>MEN-2: That I've done nothing wrong to that lady over there, </p>
<p>the one that's accusing me of stealing this from her house.</p>
<p>May the gods make me the unhappiest man in the world 					[815-816]</p>
<p>if I've ever set foot in that house of hers.</p>
<p>SEN: Are you nuts calling a curse down on yourself like that? </p>
<p>You nutcase, you deny that you've ever set foot in your own house?</p>
<p>MEN-2: Old man, are you telling me that that is my house? 					[820]</p>
<p>SEN: Do you deny it?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Well of course I deny it!</p>
<p>SEN: 				Well of course you do not – </p>
<p>not unless you moved out last night! (to MAT) Daughter, come over here. </p>
<p>What do you say? You didn't move out of here, did you?</p>
<p>MAT: 		Why would we do that? Where would we go?</p>
<p>SEN: How should I know?</p>
<p>MAT: 		He's making a fool out of you - can't you see that?</p>
<p>SEN: OK, Menaechmus, you've had your fun. Now let's get down to business. 			[825]</p>

<p>He'll be sane again, I promise you.</p>

<p><u>Scene 5</u></p>
<p>MEN-1: By Pollux this has not been a good day for me. </p>
<p>Everything I thought I'd done in secret that damn moocher 					[900]</p>
<p>Peniculus made public. He's caused me nothing but trouble and then some. </p>
<p>My own private Ulysses, ready to ruin his master at a moment's notice. </p>
<p>As I live and breathe, I will squoosh the life out of that man. </p>
<p>But I'm a fool if I think what's mine is his. What's his is mine is more like it. </p>
<p>He stripped me of my lunch and my money. Now I'll strip that man from his life. 			[905]</p>
<p>And this hooker Erotium acted just as you'd have expected. </p>
<p>I asked her for the gown back and she swears </p>
<p>up and down that she returned it. What a mess I'm in!</p>
<p>SEN: Hear what he's saying?</p>
<p>MED: 		He says he's in a big mess.</p>
<p>SEN: 				Go talk to him.</p>
<p>MED: Hello there, Menaechmus. Why are you baring your arm? 				[910]</p>
<p>Don't you know how bad that is for you in your condition?</p>

<p>MEN-1: 		What do you want?</p>
<p>MED: 				Answer me this, if you would: </p>
<p>Do you drink red or white wine?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Why don't you go to hell? 					[915]</p>
<p>MED: (to audience) By Hercules, we're already seeing the first signs of insanity.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		What are you asking me? </p>
<p>If I usually eat purple bread or red or yellow? </p>
<p>Whether I prefer to eat scaly birds or feathery fish?</p>
<p>SEN: 		Oh boy! </p>
<p>Did you hear that? Is he talking crazy or what? Why are you waiting to give him[919-920]</p>
<p>some kind of drugs before he goes completely off his rocker?</p>
<p>MED: Hold your horses. I want to interview him a little more.</p>
<p>SEN: 		You'll kill him with all your yaking!</p>
<p>MED: (to MEN-1) Tell me this: do your eyes often feel riveted on things?</p>
<p>MEN-1: What? Do you think I'm a lobster, you loser?</p>
<p>MED: Tell me, do you ever hear rumbling in your gut? 					[925]</p>
<p>MEN-1: When I am full of food, my stomach makes no noises. When I am hungry, then it does.</p>
<p>MED: Hmm. Well, that doesn't sound like an answer from an insane man. </p>
<p>Do you usually sleep right through till morning? Do you sleep soundly?</p>
<p>MEN-1: If I have paid off my debts, I sleep soundly. </p>
<p>May Jupiter and all the gods destroy you, you pesterer pollster. 				[930]</p>
<p>MED: (to SEN) Uh-oh, we're losing him again. You'd better watch out.</p>
<p>SEN: Humph! He's wisdom incarnate compared to the way he was earlier. </p>
<p>Before you got here he was calling his wife a rabbit bitch!</p>
<p>MEN-1: I never called my wife a rabbit!</p>
<p>SEN: 		You are out of your mind!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Me?!</p>
<p>SEN: 						Yes, you. </p>
<p>You even threatened to run me down with a four horse chariot. 				[935]</p>
<p>I saw you do it! Don't even try to deny it! 						[936-940]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Oh yeah? Well I know that you stole the crown of Jupiter </p>
<p>and I know that they threw you into jail for that </p>
<p>and I know that after you got out they beat you silly with twigs and branches </p>
<p>and I know that you killed your father and put your mother up for sale. </p>
<p>How do you like that? Do I respond well enough for a sane man? 				[945]</p>
<p>SEN: (to MED) For God's sake, Doc, hurry! Whatever you're going to do, do it! </p>
<p>Can't you see this man's insane?</p>
<p>MED: 		Know what I think you ought to do? </p>
<p>Bring him to my office.</p>
<p>SEN: 		Is that what you think?</p>
<p>MED: 				Why not? </p>
<p>I'd be able to treat him better there.</p>
<p>SEN: 		Well, if you say so.</p>
<p>MED: (to MEN-1) I'll have you taking Hellebore for twenty days or so. 				[950]</p>
<p>MEN-1: No, I'll hang you upside down and use you for target practice for thirty days or so.</p>
<p>MED: (to SEN) Go get some men to take him to my clinic.</p>
<p>SEN: 		How many?</p>
<p>MED: Given the way he's raving, I'd say no fewer than four.</p>
<p>SEN: They'll be right here. You keep an eye on him, Doc.</p>
<p>MED: 		No, I'd better go back to the office </p>
<p>to get ready to receive him. You tell the slaves 						[955]</p>
<p>to bring him to me.</p>
<p>SEN: 		I'll get him there right away.</p>
<p>MED: 				I'm going now. (exit MED toward forum)</p>
<p>SEN: 						Good-bye. (exit SEN into MEN-1's house)</p>
<p>MEN-1: My father-in-law has left and the doctor, too. I am alone. By Jupiter, </p>
<p>why is it that these men think I'm insane? </p>
<p>I've never been sick a day in my life. </p>
<p>I'm not crazy and I'm not going to start a fist-fight or a quarrel. 				[960]</p>
<p>I'm sane, and everyone I see is sane as well. I know these men, I will speak rationally to them. </p>
<p>Or are they wrongly accusing me of lunacy when it's they who are loony? </p>
<p>What am I going to do now? I just want to go home, but my wife won't let me. </p>
<p>No one will let me in here either. What a disaster this whole day has turned out to be. </p>
<p>I'll just stay here until ... well, by nightfall I think I'll be able </p>
<p>		to get into my house.						[965]</p>
<p><u>Scene 6</u></p>
<p>(enter MESS from harbor)</p>
<p>MESS: This is your proof of a good slave: he takes care </p>
<p>of his master's business, sees to it, arranges it, thinks it over, </p>
<p>and protects his master's things diligently when his master isn't even around. </p>
<p>And he does it all as if his master were around, perhaps even more honestly than if. </p>
<p>The slave whose heart is in the right place ought to think 					[970]</p>
<p>more of his back than his gullet, more of his legs than his belly. </p>
<p>Just keep in mind what rewards are given </p>
<p>to good-for-nothing slaves: </p>
<p>whippings, shackles, </p>
<p>mill-work, exhaustion, starvation, not even a blanket for the bed. 				[975]</p>
<p>These are the rewards of laziness. </p>
<p>I'm really afraid of that little list, so I've decided to be good rather than bad. </p>
<p>I find it much easier to survive tongue-lashings - I hate the leather kind – </p>
<p>and I much prefer to eat the meal than turn the mill. </p>
<p>Therefore I follow my master's orders, attend to them well and without protest. 			[980]</p>
<p>Then I get what I want. </p>
<p>Other slaves can do as they please. More power to'em. </p>
<p>Me, I'll do what I'm supposed to. I should stay in fear and out of trouble, </p>
<p>		so I can be at my master's beck and call at every instant. </p>
<p>Slaves who stay in fear never get into trouble, </p>
<p>		they're always useful to their masters.				[983a]</p>
<p>Slaves who don't fear anything, well, once they get what they've got coming, </p>
<p>		they sure as heck fear then!					[983b]</p>
<p>I don't have much to fear, and it's almost time for my master to pay off my reward for my deeds. </p>
<p>I do my work on the principle that I think it's good for my back. 				[985]</p>
<p>So here I am, come back for my master just as he had ordered, after setting up the baggage </p>
<p>and the other slaves at an inn. Now I'll knock at the door so he'll know I'm here, </p>
<p>and lead him safely outside from this ravine of ruin. </p>
<p>But I'm afraid I've come too late and that the battle's already been fought.</p>
<p><u>Scene 7</u></p>

<p>unless of course you don't care what happens to you. </p>
<p>And don't pay any attention to anything he says. </p>
<p>Why are you still standing there? What are you waiting for? </p>
<p>		He should be up on you shoulders by now!				[995]</p>
<p>I'll go off to the clinic. I'll meet you there.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Uh-oh! I'm dead! </p>
<p>What's going on here? Why are those men running toward me? </p>
<p>What do you want? What are you looking for? Why are you surrounding me? </p>
<p>Hey! Where are you taking me? Where are you carting me off to? Oh no! Help! </p>
<p>Citizens of Epidamnus! I beg you! Why don't you let me go? 				[1000]</p>
<p>MESS: In the name of the immortal gods, what do I see before my eyes? </p>
<p>Who are those guys carrying my master off up in the air like that? It's so undignified!</p>
<p>MEN-1: Hey! Won't anyone dare to help me?</p>
<p>MESS: 		I'll dare, master, very daringly even! </p>
<p>Oh what a shameful and evil deed! Citizens of Epidamnus! </p>
<p>My master, who came here to your fine city of his own free will 				[1005]</p>
<p>is being masternapped right off the city streets - in broad daylight even! </p>
<p>to the slaves Let go of him!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		I beg you, whoever you are, help me! </p>
<p>Don't let them treat me like this!</p>
<p>MESS: Don't worry! I want to help you and defend you and come to your aid! </p>
<p>I would never allow you to be murdered! Why I'd rather they murdered me first! 			[1010]</p>
<p>Poke out his eye, master, the one who's got you by the shoulder, do it! </p>
<p>Now these here, I'll bust every single one of them in the chops with my fists! </p>
<p>You stupid racks of meat! I'll give you what for, carrying my master off like that! Let him go!</p>
<p>MEN-1: I've got this one by the eye!</p>
<p>MESS: 		Good! Now make sure there's nothing left but a socket in his head! </p>
<p>You bastards! You thieves! You masternappers!</p>
<p>SLAVES: 		(variously) We’re dying!					[1015]</p>
<p>Help us, by Hercules!</p>
<p>MESS: 		Well let him go then!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Why are you touching me? </p>

<p>MESS: 		Go on! Go on! Get out of here and go to hell! </p>

<p>There! That's another one for you since you're the last to leave, take it as your reward! </p>

<p>By Pollux, master, didn't I come to your aid in the nick of time just now? 				[1020]</p>
<p>MEN-1: May the gods always favor you, whoever you are. </p>
<p>If it hadn't been for you I never would have seen the sun set today.</p>
<p>MESS: Well then, by Pollux, if you were interested in doing the right thing, master, you'd set me free.</p>
<p>MEN-1: You want me to free you?</p>
<p>MESS: 		Yes, master, after all I did save you.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				What? </p>
<p>I think you're mistaken. </p>
<p>MESS: 		What? I'm mistaken?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Jove as my witness, 				[1025]</p>
<p>I swear that I'm not your master.</p>
<p>MESS: 		Well, shut my mouth!</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				I'm not lying. </p>
<p>My slaves never act like you acted toward me.</p>
<p>MESS: Very well then, if you say I'm not yours, let me go free.</p>
<p>MEN-1: As far as I'm concerned, you are free, and you may go wherever you wish.</p>
<p>MESS: You really mean it?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		I really mean it, by Hercules, </p>
<p>			if I have any power over you at all. 				[1030]</p>
<p>MESS: That makes you my patron now instead of my master, doesn't it? </p>
<p>Well then greetings, my patron! to self "Since you are free, Messenio, I congratulate you." </p>
<p>But, patron, please, don't hesitate to order me around any less than you did when I was your slave. </p>
<p>I shall live at your house and when you go home, I'll go with you.</p>
<p>MEN-1: I don't think so.</p>
<p>MESS: 		I'll go to the inn now and get your baggage and your cash. 			[1035]</p>
<p>The purse with the traveling money is sealed up tight in the bag. </p>
<p>I'll bring that here to you right away.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Sounds good! Hurry up!</p>
<p>MESS: I'll give it back safe and sound, just as you gave it to me. Wait here for me.</p>
<p>(MESS exits to forum)</p>
<p>MEN-1: This day has just been getting weirder and weirder. </p>
<p>Some are saying that I am not who I say I am and shut the door in my face, 			[1040]</p>
<p>and this slave is saying he is mine </p>
<p>and I set him free. </p>
<p>He says I had a purse with cash in it. </p>
<p>If he brings it back, I'll tell him he may leave a free man to go wherever he wishes. </p>
<p>But then he might come back looking for the money from me </p>
<p>		once he regains his senses. 					[1045]</p>
<p>My father-in-law and the doctor say that I'm crazy. Whatever's going on here, it's definitely weird. </p>

<p>rescue you from those four men who had picked you up and were carrying you away </p>
<p>right here in front of this very house? You were screaming for divine or human intervention </p>
<p>and I ran up and rescued you from those chumps by beating the crap out of them. </p>
<p>Then you set me free because I saved you. 						[1055]</p>
<p>Then when I said I was going back to fetch the money </p>
<p>you ran ahead as fast as you could so you could meet me and deny what you had done.</p>
<p>MEN-2: I told you you could go free?</p>

<p>I swear I've never seen two men more alike. </p>
<p>No water is more like water, no milk more like milk, believe you me, </p>
<p>than that one is to you and you to him. After all, he does remember 				[1090]</p>
<p>the same fatherland and father. We'd better go and quiz him.</p>
<p>MEN-2: By Hercules I think you're right! Thanks for pointing that out! </p>
<p>You go ahead and do that, go quiz him. If you find that he is my brother, </p>
<p>you're a free man.</p>
<p>MESS: 		I hope he is.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 				Me too.</p>
<p>MESS: Pardon me sir. I think you said that you are called Menaechmus? 			[1095]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Yes.</p>
<p>MESS: 		This man's name is also Menaechmus. You said </p>
<p>you were born in Sicily; and he was born there also. </p>
<p>You said your father was Moschus; so was his. </p>
<p>Now both of you can do a favor for me and for yourselves at the same time.</p>
<p>MEN-1: You deserve to get whatever your heart desires. 					[1100]</p>
<p>You just say the word and I'll serve you as if you had bought me as a slave.</p>
<p>MESS: I have a dream ... of finding that you two are twin brothers, </p>
<p>born of one mother and one father on one day.</p>
<p>MEN-1: You're talking miracles! I hope you can achieve this dream you're chasing.</p>
<p>MESS: I can. But come now, both of you, and answer me some questions. 			[1105]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Ask away whenever you're ready. I'll answer as best I can and won't hold anything back.</p>
<p>MESS: Is your name Menaechmus?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Yes.</p>
<p>MESS: 				And is yours also?</p>
<p>MEN-2: It is.</p>
<p>MESS: 		You say your father was Moschus?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Yes.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 						Mine too.</p>
<p>MESS: Are you a Syracusan?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Yes.</p>
<p>MESS: 				What about you?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 						You betcha.</p>
<p>MESS: All the signs point to one thing so far. </p>
<p>		Give me your attention just a little bit longer.				[1110]</p>
<p>What's the earliest thing you remember in your fatherland? Tell me.</p>
<p>MEN-1: When I left Tarentum for the forum with my father. I wandered away from him, </p>
<p>got lost among all the people, and was snatched up and carried off here.</p>
<p>MEN-2: O holy Jupiter, save me!</p>
<p>MESS: 		What are you shouting? Can't you keep still? </p>
<p>(to MEN-1) How old were you when your father took you away from your fatherland?		[1115]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Seven. My teeth were then just beginning to fall out. </p>
<p>After that day I never saw my father again.</p>
<p>MESS: 		What? How many sons </p>
<p>did your father have?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Wait. Ah, I remember now: two.</p>
<p>MESS: Which was older, you or he?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		We were both the same age.</p>
<p>MESS: How is that possible?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		We were both twins.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 				The gods are fulfilling my prayers!			[1120]</p>
<p>MESS: If you don't shut up I'll stop this investigation immediately.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		No, no. I'll shut up.</p>
<p>MESS: 				Tell me, </p>
<p>did you both have the same name?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		No. My name was Menaechmus, </p>
<p>as it still is, but they called him Sosicles.</p>
<p>MEN-2: Yup! There it is! I can't hold myself back any longer! </p>
<p>My dear twin brother! I'm Sosicles! 							[1125]</p>
<p>MEN-1: Then why did you say your name was Menaechmus?</p>
<p>MEN-2: When the news that you'd wandered away from Dad and been kidnapped, and then Dad died, </p>
<p>our grandfather changed my name. He missed you so much he gave me your name.</p>
<p>MEN-1: I believe what you say happened, but tell me this...</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Just ask! 							[1129-1130]</p>
<p>MEN-1: What was our mother's name?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Teuximarcha.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				The pieces fit! </p>
<p>Hello, my long lost brother!</p>
<p>MEN-2: O my dear brother, I'm so glad to have found you! </p>
<p>I've been through a lot of misery and trouble looking for you.</p>
<p>MESS: Ah-ha! So that's how the dolly over here came to call you by his name; 			[1135]</p>
<p>she thought you were he, I think, when she asked you to lunch.</p>
<p>MEN-1: By Pollux, I had ordered that lunch be prepared today – </p>
<p>it was to be a secret lunch away from my wife, from whom I stole the gown this morning. </p>
<p>I gave it to her.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Do you mean this gown, brother?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				That's the one! </p>
<p>How did you get this stuff?</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		The drab that lives in that house took me 				[1140]</p>
<p>in for lunch and said that I had given it to her. I had a pretty good lunch, </p>
<p>drank a bit, had my way with her, and left with the gown and some jewelry.</p>
<p>MEN-1: By Pollux, I'm happy if I was responsible for something good happening to you today. </p>
<p>When she invited you in, she must have thought you were me. 				[1144-1145]</p>
<p>MESS: You don't object to my being free, do you? You did order it.</p>
<p>MEN-1: Brother, he only asks for what is fair. Please agree to it, for my sake?</p>
<p>MEN-2: I set you free.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		Since you are free, Messenio, I congratulate you.</p>
<p>MESS: But I'm going to need more than just good will if I'm going to stay free. 			[1149-1150]</p>
<p>MEN-2: (ignoring MESS) Well, brother, since everything's turned out just the way we wanted it, </p>
<p>let's both go back to Sicily.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		I shall do whatever you wish, brother. </p>
<p>I'll have an auction here and sell whatever there is to sell. For the meanwhile, </p>
<p>though, brother, let's go inside.</p>
<p>MEN-2: 		Good idea!</p>
<p>MESS: 				Hello! I'm still here! Know what I'd like from you?</p>
<p>MEN-1: What?</p>
<p>MESS: 		Let me be your auctioneer.</p>
<p>MEN-1: 				Fine by me.</p>
<p>MESS: 						Then shall I announce 		[1155]</p>
<p>at once that there will be an auction?</p>
<p>MEN-1: 		All right, it'll be a week from today. </p>
<p>MESS: (to audience) There will be an auction of the goods of the Menaechmus estate a week from today! </p>
<p>In the morning. For sale: slaves, goods, land, houses, everything.</p>
<p>Everything’s for sale to whomever has cash up front.</p>
<p>Also for sale - a wife, if any buyer is interested. 						[1160]</p>
<p>I doubt the whole auction will bring in more 50,000 sestertii. A mere pittance.</p>
<p>Now, dear audience, please give us some loud applause!</p>

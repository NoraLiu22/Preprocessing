<H2>Veronica Guerin (2003)</H2>

<P>D: Joel Schumacher<BR>
S: Cate Blanchett, Gerard McSorley</P>

<P>Veronica Guerin was consulting with writer Michael Sheridan on a movie
script about her life before she was murdered in 1996. She specifically
instructed Sheridan not to turn her life story into a glamorised tale of
liberal martyrdom, but rather hoped for a story of how her journalistic
crusade blew the lid on the Dublin drug trade and the high-level criminals
behind it. Her death changed the situation, because instead of being merely
the victim of threats and beatings which made her a focus for concern, she
had quite literally become a martyr. Her death galvanised elements within
the city to take more action against so-called drug barons and a special
government bureau was established to freeze the assets of suspected criminals.
Among the first and most high-profile of these was John Gilligan, the man
believed to have ordered the hit on Guerin herself and who is still embroiled
in legal proceedings in attempt to reduce his sentence.</P>

<P>The first film to tell her story, partly based on Sheridan's original
script, was the less than effective <I><A HREF="wtsf.htm">When the Sky Falls</A></I>,
a well-meaning but poorly organised film which had the merit of succeeding
in its attempt to avoid sentimental overstatement. The prospect of a big
budget Hollywood treatment produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (<I><A HREF="conair.htm">Con-Air</A></I>)
and directed by Joel Schumacher (<I><A HREF="pbooth.htm">Phonebooth</A></I>)
was more than faintly scary. Produced under the working title &quot;Chasing
the Dragon&quot;, the film has finally arrived amid a blaze of publicity
which didn't bode well for a tone of restraint.</P>

<P><I>Veronica Guerin</I> is a great deal better than expected. It is, in
fact, so much better than expected that relief may prompt undue enthusiasm.
It is a good film, a solid piece of basic storytelling which holds the sentiment
firmly in check and manages to render the most impressively realistic representation
of criminal lowlifes yet seen on the Irish screen (oh don't start that old
debate again: the subject, most of the cast and most of the crew are Irish,
let's just leave it at that, okay?). In the wake of Irish-based crime dramas
and comedies of various levels of quality, <I>Veronica Guerin</I> is the
first film to portray gangsters as vicious scumbag thugs absolutely bereft
of glamorising characteristics or sympathetic dimensions, and this is its
strongest and most laudable aspect. After a few pretty sleazy opening scenes
which establish the context of drugs in the city perhaps too forcefully,
the film doesn't wallow in iniquity either (like the ill-fated 1980s crime
drama <I>The Courier</I> did). It is a straightforward story of a crusading
journalist taking on forces larger and more powerful than herself yet so
much less worthy of the label of 'human' that it is hard not to empathise
with her professional motivation.</P>

<P>Sensitively handled all round, <I>Veronica Guerin</I> also benefits from
a good central performance from Cate Blanchett in the title role. Her accent
is very good, but even better is the uncanny way she has captured the gestures
and vocal rhythms of the real Guerin while still retaining her thespian
grasp on fictionalised portrayal. Though not completely 'rounded' in the
classic Hollywood sense, nor as psychologically intricate as an art house
drama, the character comes across as a believable human being with many
sides. The darker and more potentially irresponsible traits of the obsessive
journalist are not really explored (certainly not as forcefully as they
were in <I><A HREF="wtsf.htm">When the Sky Falls</A></I>, perhaps to the
earlier film's detriment), but there are enough indications of conflicting
personal and professional elements to at least hint at them.</P>

<P>The supporting cast is mostly Irish, with Gerard McSorley (<I><A HREF="box.htm">The Boxer</A></I>) making an excellent antagonist as Gilligan,
here portrayed as a boorish, petty man with a vicious cruelty which is in
no way endearing. The same goes for the representation of nearly all of
the criminal characters, notably equally so of Martin Cahill, the subject
of three previous films which mixed humorous whimsy with the strong-arm
side (<A HREF="gen.htm"><I>The General</I>,</A> <I>Vicious Circle</I>, <I><A HREF="odc.htm">Ordinary Decent Criminal</A></I>). The only character who
aspires to traditional gangster 'cool' is the self-aggrandizing middleman
played by Ciaran Hinds, who is subjected to much subtle ridicule before
finally being fully implicated in the empty corruption against which Guerin
was still fighting when she died.</P>

<P>For all its good points, <I>Veronica Guerin</I> is a film which never
builds quite the head of steam it needs to catapult it to Oscar-level acclaim.
Its climax, though moving, is not quite as emotionally wrenching as the
slow reverse zoom and crane shot employed by Schumacher seems to suggest
it should be, and the montage with voice over which wraps the film and outlines
the official action taken in the wake of Guerin's assassination is less
a catharsis than the narrative structure implies. </P>

<P>We are never truly immersed in Guerin's emotional world either. Though
Blanchett is good and the script by Carol Doyle and Mary Agnes Donoghue
tries to balance the social roles of wife, mother, and crusader, she remains
an aloof figure. Even a small supporting turn by Brenda Fricker as Guerin's
mother fails to 'flesh out' the few basic character dimensions we are shown.
The movie really moves too quickly to allow a depth of characterisation
to emerge, and though this works well as far as the supporting cast is concerned,
it leaves too great a hole at the centre to generate a real connection between
the character and the viewer. Also, though the representation of the physical
world of the film is quite strong (and it gets the small details correct
that went astray in <I>When the Sky Falls</I>), this is not an unfamiliar
story from a strictly generic point of view. The film therefore lacks the
spark of originality or even of a truly interesting perspective (is this
a belated follow up to <I><A HREF="eb.htm">Erin Brockovich</A></I> or merely
another <I>Silkwood</I>?). Only the setting in Ireland makes it of special
interest, and then probably only to local audiences. Even then, it isn't
especially insightful and its penetration into the mindset of Celtic Tiger
Ireland is fairly superficial.</P>

<P>Don't get me wrong, there is much that is worthwhile about this film,
and it is, as noted, much better than expected. It is almost good enough
to at least dull the painful memories of <A HREF="bar.htm"><I>Batman &amp;
Robin</I> </A>as far as its director's career is concerned or, on a local
level, <A HREF="odc.htm"><I>Ordinary Decent Criminal</I>.</A> It is not
a masterpiece, nor, to be fair, does it really set itself up that highly.
It is a modest, well crafted drama showing admirable restraint, buoyed by
good performances and a solid script, and tackles a difficult subject pretty
well. It never really moves out of a steady and effective second gear, but
we should be thankful for the considerable mercy which comes from it not
being an overblown self-important weepie of the kind Guerin herself really
didn't want to see.</P>

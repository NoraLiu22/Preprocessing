<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> The Macedonians had perpetual contests with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrace.html#1">Thracians</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/illyria.html#1">Illyrians</A>, and, being hardened by their arms, as it were by daily exercise, they struck terror into their neighbours by the splendour of their reputation for war. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> The Illyrians, however, despising the boyhood of a king under age, attacked the Macedonians, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> who, being worsted in the field, brought out their king with them in his cradle, and, placing him behind the front lines, renewed the fight with greater vigour, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> as if they had been defeated before, because the fortune of their prince was not with them in the battle, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> and would now certainly conquer, because, from this superstitious fancy, they had conceived a confidence of victory; <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> while compassion for the infant, also, moved them, as, if they were overcome, they seemed likely to transform him from a king into a captive. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Engaging in battle, therefore, they routed the Illyrians with great slaughter, and showed their enemies, that, in the former encounter, it was a king, and not valour, that was wanting to the Macedonians. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> To Aeropus succeeded <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/amyntas.html#1">Amyntas</A>, a prince eminently distinguished, both for his own personal valour, and for the excellent abilities of his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#1">Alexander</A>, <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> who had from nature such remarkable talents of every kind, that he contended for the prize in various species of exercises at the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympic.html#1">Olympic</A> games.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7.3">[7.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte7.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp; About this time <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dareius.html#1">Darius</A> king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persia.html#1">Persia</A>, having been forced to quit <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythia</A> in dishonourable flight, but not wishing to be thought everywhere contemptible from losses in war, despatched <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/megabazus.html#1">Megabazus</A>, with a portion of his army, to subdue Thrace, and other kingdoms in those parts; to which Macedonia, he thought, would fall as an unimportant addition. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Megabazus, speedily executing the king's orders, and sending deputies to Amyntas king of Macedonia, demanded that hostages should be given him as a pledge of future peace. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> The deputies, being liberally entertained, asked Amyntas, as their intoxication increased in the progress of a banquet, "to add to the magnificence of his board the privileges of friendship, by sending for his and his sons' wives to join the feast; a practice which is deemed, among the Persians, a pledge and bond of hospitality." <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> The women having entered, and the Persians laying hands upon them too freely, Alexander, the son of Amyntas, begged his father, from regard to his age and dignity, to leave the banqueting-room, engaging that he himself would moderate the frolicsome spirit of their guests. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Amyntas having withdrawn, Alexander called the women from the apartment for a while, under pretext of having them dressed in better style, and bringing them back with greater attractions. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> But in their place he put young men, clad in the habit of matrons, and ordered them to chastise the insolence of the deputies with swords which they were to carry under their garments. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> All of them being thus put to death, Megabazus, not knowing what had happened, but finding that the deputies did not return, sent <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/bubares.html#1">Bubares</A> to Macedonia with a detachment of his forces, as to an easy and trifling contest; <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> disdaining to go himself, that he might not be disgraced by an encounter with so despicable a people. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> But Bubares, before he came to an engagement, fell in love with the daughter of Amyntas; breaking off hostilities, he celebrated a marriage, and, all thoughts of war being abandoned, entered into bonds of affinity with the king. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7.4">[7.4]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte7.html#4"> L</A>&nbsp; Soon after the departure of Bubares from Macedonia, king Amyntas died; but his relationship with Bubares not only secured to his son and successor, Alexander, peace during the reign of Darius, but also such favour with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/x/xerxes.html#1">Xerxes</A>, that, when that monarch overspread Greece like a tempest, he conferred upon him the sovereignty of all the country between the mountains of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympus.html#1">Olympus</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/haemus.html#1">Haemus</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> But Alexander enlarged his dominions not less by his own valour than through the munificence of the Persians. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> The throne afterwards descended, by the order of succession, to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/amyntas.html#3">Amyntas</A>, the son of his brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menelaus.html#7">Menelaus</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> This prince was remarkable for his application to business, and was endowed with all the accomplishments of a great general. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> By his wife <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eurydice.html#7">Eurydice</A> he had three sons, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#2">Alexander</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/perdiccas.html#3">Perdiccas</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philippus.html#2">Philippus</A>, the father of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A> the Great, and one daughter, named Eurynoe; he had also by Gygaea <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archelaus.html#15">Archelaus</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aridaeus.html#2">Aridaeus</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menelaus.html#8">Menelaus</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Subsequently he had formidable contests with the Illyrians and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olynthus.html#1">Olynthians</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> He would have been cut off by a plot of his wife Eurydice, who, having engaged to marry her son-in-law, had undertaken to kill her husband, and to put the government into the hands of her paramour, had not her daughter betrayed the intrigue and atrocious intentions of her mother. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Having escaped so many dangers, he died at an advanced age, leaving the throne to Alexander, the eldest of his sons.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7.5">[7.5]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte7.html#5"> L</A>&nbsp; <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#2">Alexander</A>, at the very beginning of his reign, purchased peace from the Illyrians with a sum of money, giving his brother Philippus to them as a hostage. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Sometime after, too, he made peace with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thebes.html#1">Thebans</A> by giving the same hostage; a circumstance which afforded Philippus fine opportunities of improving his extraordinary abilities; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> for, being kept as a hostage at Thebes three years, he received the first rudiments of education in a city distinguished for strictness of discipline, and in the house of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epaminondas.html#1">Epaminondas</A>, an eminent philosopher, as well as commander. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Not long afterwards Alexander fell by a plot of his mother Eurydice, <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> whom Amyntas, when she was convicted of a conspiracy against him, had spared for the sake of their children, little imagining that she would one day be the destroyer of them. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Perdiccas, also, the brother of Alexander, was taken off by similar treachery. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Horrible, indeed, was it, that children should have been deprived of life by a mother, to gratify her lust, whom a regard for those very children had saved from the punishment of her crimes. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> The murder of Perdiccas seemed the more atrocious from the circumstance that not even the prayers of his little son could procure him pity from his mother. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Philippus, for a long time, acted, not as king, but as guardian to this infant; <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> but when dangerous wars threatened, and it was too long to wait for the co-operation of a prince who was yet a child, he was forced by the people to take the government upon himself. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7.6">[7.6]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte7.html#6"> L</A>&nbsp; When he took possession of the throne, great hopes were formed of him by all, both on account of his abilities, which promised that he would prove a great man, and on account of certain old oracles respecting Macedonia, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> which had foretold that "when one of the sons of Amyntas should be king, the state of the country would be extremely flourishing:" to fulfil which expectations the wickedness of his mother had left only him. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> At the commencement of his reign, when, on the one hand, the murder of his brother, so atrociously put to death, and the dread of treachery; on the other, a multitude of enemies, and the poverty of his kingdom, exhausted by a series of wars, bore hard upon the young king's immature age, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> thinking it proper to make distinct arrangements as to the wars, which, as if by a common conspiracy to crush Macedonia, rose around him from different nations and several quarters at the same time, to all of which he could not at once make resistance, <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> he put an end to some by offers of peace, and bought off others, but attacked such of his enemies as seemed easiest to be subdued, that, by a victory over them, he might confirm the wavering minds of his soldiers, and alter any feelings of contempt with which his adversaries might regard him. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> His first conflict was with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athens.html#1">Athenians</A>, whom he surprised by a stratagem, but, though he might have put them all to the sword, he yet, from dread of a more formidable war, allowed them to depart uninjured and without ransom. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Afterwards, leading his army against the Illyrians, he killed several thousand of his enemies; and (?) he captured the famous city of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/larissa.html#1">Larissa</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> He then fell suddenly on <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thessaly.html#1">Thessaly</A> (when it apprehended anything rather than war), not from desire of spoil, but because he wished to add the strength of the Thessalian cavalry to his own troops; <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> and he thus incorporated a force of horse and foot in one invincible army. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> His undertakings having been thus far successful, he married <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympias.html#1">Olympias</A>, daughter of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/neoptolemus.html#1">Neoptolemus</A>, afterwards king of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/molossians.html#1">Molossians</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Her cousin <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arrybas.html#1">Arrybas</A>, then king of that nation, who had brought up the young princess, and had married her sister <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/troas.html#1">Troas</A>, promoted the union; but this proceeding proved the cause of his ruin, and the beginning of all the evils that afterwards befell him;<FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> for while he hoped to strengthen his kingdom by this affinity with Philippus, he was by that monarch deprived of his crown, and spent his old age in exile. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> After these proceedings, Philippus, no longer satisfied with acting on the defensive, boldly attacked even those who gave him no molestation. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> While he was besieging <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/methone.html#2">Methone</A>, an arrow, shot from the walls at him as he was passing by, struck out his right eye; <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> but by this wound he was neither rendered less active in the siege, nor more resentful towards the enemy; <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> so that, some days after, he granted them peace on their application for it, and was not only not severe, but even merciful, to the conquered.

<P> <FONT CLASS="ref">[8.1]</FONT> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte8.html#1"> L</A>&nbsp; The states of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/greece.html#1">Greece</A>, while each sought to gain the sovereignty of the country for itself, lost it as a body. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Striving intemperately to ruin one another, they did not perceive, till they were oppressed by another power, that what each lost was a common loss to all; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> for Philippus, king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonia</A>, looking, as from a watch-tower, for an opportunity to attack their liberties, and fomenting their contentions by assisting the weaker, obliged victors and vanquished alike to submit to his royal yoke. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> The Thebans were the cause and origin of this calamity, who, obtaining power, and having no steadiness of mind to bear prosperity, insolently accused the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemonians</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phocis.html#1">Phocians</A>, when they had conquered them in the field, before the common council of Greece, as if they had not been sufficiently punished by the slaughters and depredations that they had suffered. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> It was laid to the charge of the Lacedaemonians, that they had seized the citadel of Thebes during a time of truce, and to that of the Phocians, that they had laid waste <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/boeotia.html#1">Boeotia</A>, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> as if the Thebans themselves, after their conduct in the field, had left themselves any ground for resorting to law. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> But as the cause was conducted according to the will of the more powerful, the Phocians were sentenced to pay such a fine as it was impossible for them to raise, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> and in consequence, despoiled of their lands, children, and wives, and reduced to desperation, they seized, under the leadership of one <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philomelus.html#2">Philomelus</A>, on the temple of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollo.html#1">Apollo</A> at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/delphi.html#1">Delphi</A>, as if they were enraged at the god. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Being hence enriched with gold and treasure, and hiring mercenary troops, they made war upon the Thebans. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> This proceeding of the Phocians, though all expressed detestation at the sacrilege, brought more odium upon the Thebans, by whom they had been reduced to such necessity, than on the Phocians themselves; <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> and aid was in consequence despatched to them both by the Athenians and Lacedaemonians. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> In the first engagement, Philomelus drove the Thebans from their camp; <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> but in the next he was killed, fighting in front among the thickest of the enemy, and paid the penalty of his sacrilege by the effusion of his impious blood. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/onomarchus.html#1">Onomarchus</A> was made general in his stead. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="8.2">[8.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte8.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp; To oppose Onomarchus, the Thebans and Thessalians chose as general, not one of their own people, lest they should not be able to endure his rule if he should conquer, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> but Philippus, king of Macedonia, voluntarily submitting to that power from a foreigner which they dreaded in the hands of their own countrymen. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Philippus, as if he were the avenger of the sacrilege, not the defender of the Thebans, ordered all his soldiers to assume crowns of laurel, and proceeded to battle as if under the leadership of the god. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> The Phocians, seeing these symbols of the deity, and burdened with the consciousness of guilt, threw down their arms and fled, receiving punishment for their violation of religion by the bloodshed and slaughter that they suffered. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> This affair brought incredibly great glory to Philippus in the opinion of all people, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> who called him "the avenger of the god, and the defender of religion," and said that "he alone had arisen to require satisfaction for what ought to have been punished by the combined force of the world, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> and was consequently worthy to be ranked next to the gods, as by him the majesty of the gods had been vindicated." 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> The Athenians, hearing the result of the conflict, and fearing that Philippus would march into Greece, took possession of the straits of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thermopylae.html#1">Thermopylae</A>, as they had done on the invasion of the Persians, but by no means with like spirit, or in a similar cause; <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> for then they fought on behalf of the liberty of Greece, now, on behalf of public sacrilege; then to defend the temples of the gods from the ravages of an enemy, now, to defend the plunderers of temples against the avengers of their guilt, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> acting as advocates of a crime of which it was dishonourable to them that others should have been the punishers, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> and utterly unmindful that, in their dangers, they had often had recourse to this deity as a counsellor; that, under his guidance, they had entered on so many wars with success, had founded so many cities auspiciously, and had acquired so extensive a dominion by sea and land: and that they had never done anything, either of a public or private nature, without the sanction of his authority. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Strange that a people of such ability, improved by every kind of learning, and formed by the most excellent laws and institutions, should have brought such guilt upon themselves as to leave nothing with which they could afterwards justly upbraid barbarians.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> To Philippus succeeded his son Alexander, a prince greater than his father, both in his virtues and his vices. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Each of the two had a different mode of conquering; the one prosecuted his wars with open force, the other with subtlety; the one delighted in deceiving his enemies, the other in boldly repulsing them. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> The one was more prudent in council, the other more noble in feeling. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> The father would dissemble his resentment and often subdue it; when the son was provoked, there was neither delay nor bounds to his vengeance. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> They were both too fond of wine, but the ill effects of their intoxication were totally different; the father would rush from a banquet to confront the enemy, fight with him, and rashly expose himself to dangers; the son vented his rage, not upon his enemies, but his friends. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> A battle often sent away Philippus wounded; Alexander often left a banquet stained with the blood of his companions. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> The one wished to reign with his friends, the other to reign over them. The one preferred to be loved, the other to be feared. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> To literature both gave equal attention. The father had more cunning, the son more honour. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Philippus was more staid in his words, Alexander in his actions. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> The son felt readier and nobler impulses to spare the conquered; the father showed no mercy even to his allies. The father was more inclined to frugality, the son to luxury. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> By the same course by which the father laid the foundations of the empire of the world, the son consummated the glory of conquering the whole world.

<P> <FONT CLASS="ref">[10.1]</FONT> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte10.html#1"> L</A>&nbsp; <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/artaxerxes.html#2">Artaxerxes</A>, king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persia.html#1">Persia</A>, had a hundred and fifteen sons by his concubines, but only three begotten in lawful wedlock, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dareius.html#5">Darius</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ariarathes.html#11">Ariarathes</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/artaxerxes.html#3">Ochus</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Of these the father, from paternal fondness, made Darius king during his own lifetime, contrary to the usage of the Persians, among whom the king is changed only by death; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> for he thought nothing taken from himself that he conferred upon his son, and expected greater enjoyment from having progeny, if he saw the insignia of royalty adorning his son while he lived. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> But Darius, after such an extraordinary proof of his father's affection, conceived the design of killing him. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He would have been bad enough, if he had meditated the parricide alone, but he became so much the worse, by enticing fifty of his brothers to a participation in his crime, and making them parricides in intention as well as himself. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> It was certainly a kind of prodigy, that, among so great a number, the assassination should not only have been plotted, but concealed, and that of fifty children there should not have been found one, whom either respect for their father's dignity, or reverence for an old man, or gratitude for paternal kindness, could deter from so horrible a purpose. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Was the name of father so contemptible among so many sons, that he who should have been secured even against enemies by their protection, should be beset by their treason, and find it easier to defend himself against his foes than his children? 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="10.2">[10.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte10.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> The cause of the intended parricide was even more atrocious than the crime itself; <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> for after <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cyrus.html#2">Cyrus</A> was killed in the war against his brother, of which mention has been previously  made, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/artaxerxes.html#2">Artaxerxes</A> had married <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aspasia.html#2">Aspasia</A>, the concubine of Cyrus; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> and Darius had required that his father should resign her to him as he had resigned the kingdom. Artaxerxes, from fondness for his children, said at first that he would do so, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> but afterwards, from a change of mind, and in order plausibly to refuse what he had inconsiderately promised, made her a priestess of the sun, an office which obliged her to perpetual chastity. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The young Darius, being incensed at this proceeding, broke out at first into reproaches against his father, and subsequently entered into this conspiracy with his brothers. But while he was meditating destruction for his father, he was discovered and apprehended with his associates, and paid the penalty of his guilt to the gods who avenge paternal authority. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> The wives of them all, too, together with their children, were put to death, that no memorial of such execrable wickedness might be left. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Soon after Artaxerxes died of a disease contracted by grief, having been happier as a king than as a father. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="10.3">[10.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte10.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> Possession of the throne was given to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/artaxerxes.html#3">Ochus</A>, who, dreading a similar conspiracy, filled the palace with the blood and dead bodies of his kinsmen and the nobility, being touched with compassion neither for consanguinity, nor sex, nor age, lest, apparently, he should be thought less wicked than his brothers that had meditated parricide. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Having thus, as it were, purified his kingdom, he made war upon the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cadusii.html#1">Cadusii</A>; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> in the course of which one <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dareius.html#3">Codomannus</A>, followed by applause from all the Persians, engaged with one of the enemy that offered himself for single combat, and, having killed his antagonist, regained the victory for his fellow soldiers, as well as the glory which they had almost lost. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> For this honourable service Codomannus was made governor of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/armenia.html#1">Armenia</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Sometime after, on the death of Ochus, he was chosen king by the people from regard to his former merits, and, that nothing might be wanting to his royal dignity, honoured with the name of Darius. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> He maintained a long war, with various success, but with great efforts, against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A> the Great. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> But being at last overcome by Alexander, and slain by his relations, he terminated his life and the kingdom of the Persians together.

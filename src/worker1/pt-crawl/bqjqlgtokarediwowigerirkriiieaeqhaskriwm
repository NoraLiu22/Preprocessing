<h2>Part 1: Introduction &amp; bibliography</h2>

The clay tablet with the catalog number 322 in the G. A. Plimpton Collection at
Columbia University may be the most well known mathematical tablet, certainly
the most photographed one, but it deserves even greater renown.  It was scribed
in the Old Babylonian period between -1900 and -1600 and shows the most
advanced mathematics before the development of Greek mathematics.  <p>

<h2>Part 2: Transcriptions of the tablet</h2>


Here's a transcription of the Plimpton 322 tablet using modern digits. The
numbers on the cuneiform tablet are written sexigesimally (in base 60) with
combinations of two symbols, one for tens and one for units.  Several unit
symbols are placed in particular patterns to form the digits 1 through 9, and
several ten symbols are placed in particular patterns to form the five digits
10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.  Spaces are left to indicate zeros in the unit's place
and zeros in the ten's place. In this transcription a colon is used to separate different sexagesimal digits for ease of reading.  This is the same notation we use for time.  For instance, 3:10:15 means 10 and 1/4 minutes after 3 o'clock.<p>

There are fifteen rows and four columns on the tablet.  It isn't clear whether
the first column has all its numbers beginning with 1 or not; unfortunately the
tablet is broken off at that point.  There may have been more columns in the
broken off portion of the tablet.  Also, there are a couple of chips off the
tablet, but it's clear how to fill in the missing digits.  Within each column
the numbers aren't lined up quite as nicely as they are here, but the numbers
in each column are left justified.  <p>
<p>
The last column is clearly just the row number. The second and third columns
are headed by words that can be interpreted as "width" and "diagonal."<p>
<p>
The transcription above already includes four corrections.  In the second row,
third column, the original number was 3:12:01 rather than 1:20:25.  In the
ninth row, second column, the original number was 9:01 instead of 8:01.  In the
13th row, second column, the original number was 7:12:01 instead of 2:41.  And
in the 15th row, third column, the original number was 53 rather than 1:46.<p>
<p>
Often, this tablet is converted to decimal form, but it isn't clear whether the
numbers are fractions or integers.  The last column clearly contains integers,
the first almost certainly contains fractions, and the second and third might
contain fractions but probably contain integers.  Here's a translation of the
second, third, and fourth columns into decimal form under the assumption that
all the numbers are integers<p>

<h2>Part 3: Interpretation and possible construction</h2>


The numbers in the first column are interesting since each is a perfect square
and subtracting one from each leaves a perfect square.  Consider, for instance,
line 11. The number 1:33:45 represents 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;33/60&nbsp;+&nbsp;45/3600 &nbsp;=&nbsp; 1&nbsp;+&nbsp; 9/16 &nbsp;=&nbsp;25/16 which
is the square of 5/4.  One less than 25/16 is 9/16, the square of 3/4.  The
second and third entries in this row represent these fractions: 45 represents
45/60&nbsp;=&nbsp;3/4 and 1:15 represents 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;15/60&nbsp;=&nbsp;5/4.  (Or perhaps 45 represents 45 and
1:15 represents 75 in which case these two entries are proportional to the
fractions.)<p>
<p>
For another example, consider row 5. 1:48:54:01:40 represents
1&nbsp;+&nbsp;48/60&nbsp;+&nbsp;54/3600&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/216000&nbsp;+&nbsp;40/12960000&nbsp;=&nbsp; 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;4225/5184&nbsp;=&nbsp;9409/5184, which is the
square of 97/72.  And 4225/5184 is the square of 65/72.  The second and third
entries in row 5 are 1:05 representing 65, and 1:37 representing 97.  Nearly
always, the second and third entries aren't equal to the square roots, but just
proportional to them.<p>
<p>
This table is usually considered in relation to Pythagorean triples.  In that
interpretation, the second column is <i>a,</i> one side of a right triangle or the
width of a rectangle, and the third column is <i>c,</i> the hypotenuse of the right
triangle or the diagonal of the rectangle, and the other side of the triangle
or rectangle, <i>b,</i> doesn't appear on the table.  In this interpretation the first
column is then (<i>c/b</i>)<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;(<i>a/b</i>)<sup>2</sup>.<p>
<p>
The Old Babylonians knew the Pythagorean theorem (better called the rule of the
right triangle for them since there's no evidence that they had a proof;
Gillings calls the term "the Pythagorean theorem" a true mumpsimus), since
there are examples of its use in various problems of the period.  Along with
the headings of the second and third columns, that justifies believing that
this table relates to Pythagorean triples and right triangles.<p>
<p>
Some historians have noticed that (1) each first column entry is the square of
the cosecant of an angle of a right triangle, and (2) the associated angles are
roughly one degree apart. So they have suggested that this is a trigonometric
table of squares of cosecants for 45&deg; down to 30&deg;.  This would be
the earliest instance of cosecants by millennia, and the earliest instance of a
trigonometric function by over a thousand years (the first trig function being
the chord of an angle).  It would also be the earliest instance of degree
measurement by over a thousand years.  In other words, that's a bold claim.  A
weaker claim is that the table was constructed to make the first column
uniformly decreasing.<p>
<p>
Anyway, here are the actual associated angles in a table.  The angles are given
in degrees, but for perversity, their fractions are given decimally.  A column
for the remaining side is also displayed as well as columns for parameters <i>p</i>
and <i>q</i> generating Pythagorean triples where <i>a</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>q</i><sup>2</sup>,  <i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<i>pq,</i> and <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>q</i><sup>2</sup>.<p>

Note that the every value of p and q is a regular sexagesimal integer, that is,
their only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5.  That is necessary to make b regular
so that the fraction <i>c/b</i> terminates.  The Babylonians didn't like to divide by
irregular numbers.<p>
<p>
It may be that the Babylonians actually used the parameters <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> to generate
this table.  There is no direct evidence that they did, but there is some
indirect evidence.  When you consider all possible regular values of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>
with <i>p</i> less than or equal to 125 (and <i>q</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>p</i>, of course), tabulate the
associated triangles, and sort them by <i>p/q,</i> or what is the same order, by
(<i>c/b</i>)<sup>2</sup>, then there are exactly 16 triangles in the range of the table.  That
is, only one extra triangle.<p>

Only one extra line.  Perhaps it wasn't used because of the large values of <i>q</i>
and <i>b.</i>  Perhaps it wasn't copied into the table; there were, after all, four
other errors.  Under two other hypotheses, it ought to be in the table, too,
since it fills in a missing angle and a gap in the (<i>c/b</i>)<sup>2</sup> column.

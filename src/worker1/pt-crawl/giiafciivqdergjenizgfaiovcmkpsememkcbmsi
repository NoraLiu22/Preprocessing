<H2>A Love Divided (1999)</H2>

<P>D: Sydney McCartney<BR>
S: Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady</P>

<P>Though the events portrayed in <I>A Love Divided</I> actually occurred,
the film is often a thinly veiled allegory for recent Irish history which
manages to incorporate an unusual degree of subtlety in its depiction of
the backstage wrangling and dealmaking which goes to make up much of contemporary
Irish politics. Mid way through the film beleaguered Irish Catholic father
Liam Cunningham meets with his Protestant wife's female lawyer at a garden
restaurant in Belfast. His wife (Orla Brady) has fled Wexford with their
two young daughters after their local priest (Tony Doyle) has insisted they
attend Catholic school regardless of her wishes. Amid mounting chaos in
the town as Catholics boycott Protestants and events gradually become more
violent, Cunningham has gone to attempt reconciliation, only to meet demands
for 'clarification' and 'terms' from his wife's lawyer. The scene has chilling
echoes of the situation in 1990s Northern Ireland where people on either
side both desire peace, but whose definition of a satisfactory resolution
of the conflict differs.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, <I>A Love Divided</I> is also a love story, and it is
at its least convincing in its portrayal of the real life couple Sean and
Shelia Cloney. Their story is so well known and the wounds caused by the
events which transpired in 1957 still run so deep that it is difficult for
scriptwriter Stuart Hepburn to find a way through the political and thematic
strands to the heart of a genuine and believable human relationship. Both
Cunningham and Brady perform well, and their attempt to generate romantic
chemistry is forced with several all-too-idyllic establishing scenes followed
by too many all-too-convenient confrontations. It attempts to set up a contrast
between the private and the public and argue that, left to their own devices
and not forced to take religious or political positions on anything, the
world inside the Cloney's rather overtly symbolic farm gate would have been
wonderful beyond all reckoning. They kiss and frolic and play in the green
fields to their hearts content until the snake of sectarianism gets in,
whereupon they instantly transform into the dysfunctional patriarchy vs.
feminism archetype of the 1990s.</P>

<P>Luckily though, the film is canny enough to make sure that the world
of this couple is anything but enclosed. Their garden of eden is firmly
located within a living community where long-established relationships and
traditions are first established, then shattered by the boiling over of
hostilities. A strong cast of supporting character actors contribute to
the fabric of life in the town, and there is a genuine feeling of tragedy
when the boycott begins to destroy people who seem authentic and human.
The film is also very good in its depiction of the behind the scenes manoeuvring
by religious figures on either side of the border (with Ian McIlhenny making
a strong impression as a stern Belfast parson) to manipulate and/or respond
to the situation as suits their own ends. Though the Catholics are very
much the aggressors here (as they were in the case itself), the film is
careful to suggest that the civil and religious authorities on both sides
were both very much aware of what was going on, and used it as 'a test case'
to see just what would happen. Long suppressed sectarian hatreds come to
the surface despite the veneer of calm and co-operation; the 'us' and 'them'
rhetoric is always there, and when the trouble comes, it symbolises the
larger conflict in a way that is not just thematic contrivance on the part
of the film's makers.</P>

<P>It is a curious mixture though. There are many powerful and dramatic
moments, but there are some overwrought and obvious ones too. The final
confrontation between Cunningham and Doyle in the town hall feels like something
out of a Frank Capra movie, and Cunningham's hat seems a shade too Hollywood
Western for its own good. It often runs the risk of sacrificing its dignity
to the demands of a satisfied punter, and it is ultimately a personal decision
which side of the sentiment fence you feel it comes down on. There are indications
that the film is trying to 'universalise' the situation with scenes in its
latter stages which reunite the lovers and bring them face to face with
their accusers and with its continuing emphasis on the romantic tragedy.
It doesn't descend to the demagoguery of <I>Waking Ned</I>, but it comes
uncomfortably close to naivete too often to completely ignore.</P>

<P>On the balance, <I>A Love Divided</I> is a worthwhile film though, and
certainly stands above recent efforts like <A HREF="wn.htm"><I>Waking Ned</I>
</A>and <A HREF="timf.htm"><I>This is My Father</I> </A>as a portrayal of
Ireland. There is a certain frustration in seeing films dealing with sectarianism
and conflict in Ireland which set the story in the past and/or deflect attention
away from a representation of politics onto a love story, and it makes you
wish for something more direct and contemporary, but It is far from the
worst example of its kind. Buoyed by strong performances, skilful direction
and several standout scenes, it is well worth seeing, though it will probably
prove of most interest to those with a memory of the event or an awareness
of the history it portrays and the issues it raises in the larger context
as a representation. This is not a documentary, and people should be careful
about what conclusions they draw from it.</P>

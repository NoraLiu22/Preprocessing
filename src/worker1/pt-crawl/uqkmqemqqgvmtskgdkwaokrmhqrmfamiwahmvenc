<h3>Engraver and Illustrator William Alfred Delamotte (1775-1863)</h3>

<p class="one">William Alfred Delamotte, who was born in Weymouth in 1775, the son of a 
French refugee,​ won early recognition as a draughtsman of great technical precision. For 
his remarkable drawings he received the patronage of no less a visitor to the Dorset 
seaport than His Majesty, King George III. At the age of eighteen he exhibited several 
paintings at the Royal Academy in London, and then the next year registered at the Royal 
Academy Schools. Altghough he studied here under one of the greatest historical painters 
of the age, Benjamin West, another of the King's protégés and President of the Royal 
Academy, Delamotte preferred doing architectural studies and landscapes, the two chief 
types of wood-engravings among his illustrations for William Harrison Ainsworth <span 
class="book">Windsor Castle. An Historical Romance</span>. After his studies at the 
Academy, he moved to Oxford, where he enjoyed sketching its stately colleges and 
churches. In 1803 he accepted the post of drawing-master at the recently established 
Royal Military College at Sandhurst, a position that he held for forty years. Just 
towards the end of his employment there, aged 58, he accepted the Ainsworth commission to 
provide the kinds of wood-engravings that 
<a href="../cruikshank/tol/index.html">George Cruikshank</a> had provided for <span 
class="book">The Tower of London</span> in 1840. Here he deployed his considerable skill 
as a sketch-artist, wood-engraver, print-maker and lithographer, designing a hundred 
plates generally dropped right into the letterpress. He died in retirement, in Oxford, in​
1863, aged eighty-eight.</p>

<p>Although Delamotte's​eighty-seven woodcut illustrations amply describe the Home Park, 
the Great Park, and the Castle's architectural features, he shows very little of the town 
of Windsor as it must have appeared in the summer months of 1842. However, he does depict 
in three full-page engravings a plan for​ the 5,000-acre Windsor Great Park as it 
probably looked in 1529, as well as two plan views of Windsor Castle, as it must have 
looked in 1530, and as it appeared to him in 1843.​The three-volume edition of 1843 
contained only three of the steel etchings by Cruikshank, with one serving as the 
frontispiece; however, the serialised version in <span class="book">Ainsworth's 
Magazine</span> contained all of the Tony Johannot, 
<a href="../cruikshank/windsor/index.html">Cruikshank</a>, and Delamotte illustrations. 
During the initial volume publication of the novel, over 30,000 copies were sold, and the 
work was in high demand, despite the fact that the triple-decker contains only three​
illustrations. The single-volume edition of 1844, however, contains all of the Delamotte, 
Johannot, and Cruikshank plates.</p>

<p>Ainsworth instructed Delamotte as to precisely the kinds of sketches he wanted 
executed for <span class="book">Windsor Castle</span> in a letter: I shall be glad to see 
you to a family dinner at half-past three o'clock to-morrow — Sunday. Bring your 
sketch-books with you . . . . Remind Mr. Costello, when you see him, to get the order 
from Lady Mary Fox for her apartments at Windsor. You had better go down to Hampton Court 
and sketch Will Sommers, and some of the other figures in the old pictures of Henry the 
Eighth's time, carefully" (quoted in Ellis, pp. 57–58).</p>

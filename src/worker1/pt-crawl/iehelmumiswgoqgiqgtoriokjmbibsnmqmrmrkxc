<h3>Ossett Today </h3>
<p align="justify">In 1971, Ossett had a population of just over 17,000  and thirty years later there were 21,000 people living in the town. 
Located just off junction 40 of the M1 motorway, Ossett's convenient position has attracted industry and resident commuters working in the 
major cities of the West Riding. Following three decades of gradual decline, Ossett has seen unprecedented growth in recent years. House prices 
increased from an average of &pound;50,000 in 1998 to &pound;130,000 in 2003, one of the largest in the U.K. and only rivalled by some parts of 
London and Cheshire. </p>
<p align="justify">In the 1970s, a forty acre site, adjoining the A638 Dewsbury-Wakefield road at Flushdyke,  a feeder road off the M1 was zoned 
for industrial use. Longlands Industrial Estate has attracted many new businesses to the town, providing jobs and increased affluence, although 
it has to be said, ruining the residential nature of the area. Software company Team 17 were once based in Ossett and their most famous game
 &quot;Worms&quot; contains a Hell level with a sign saying<em> &quot;Welcome to Ossett&quot;.</em></p>
<p align="justify">One of the reasons for the influx of people to Ossett is the excellent performance of Ossett Academy and Sixth Form College, 
a specialist Technology and Sports College, which has some of the best academic results in the area. Ossett Academy (formerly Ossett School) was created in 1969 
when Ossett Grammar School, which was originally founded in 1735, became a comprehensive. The Academy now has 1660 pupils and 196 staff. Ossett School became Ossett Academy in 2011. An academy school in England is a state-funded school which is directly funded by the Department for Education and is independent of local authority control.</p>
<p align="justify">After recent boundary changes, Ossett is now part of the Wakefield constituency. Simon Robert Lightwood (born 15 December 1980 in South Shields) was elected as the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Wakefield in the 2022 by-election, following the resignation of Conservative MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, who was forced to resign following his conviction for sexual assault of a minor. Lightwood was elected on the 23rd June 2022 with a 4,925 majority. He is also notable for being the last Member of Parliament to swear his Oath of Allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, since his by-election was the last before her passing three months later.  At the 2022 Labour Party Conference, Lightwood was appointed Shadow Minister for Buses and Taxis, taking over from Sam Tarry. Lightwood lives in the Calder Valley constituency with his husband, however he has pledged to move into Wakefield following his election.</p>
<p align="justify">In the 2016 Referendum, 66.3 per cent of the Wakefield constituency opted to leave the European Union, compared to 33.6 per cent who wanted to stay in. </p>
<p align="justify">Within the town, local elections are usually closely contested between the Conservative and Labour Parties. The current local councillors for the Ossett ward after the 2024 Local Elections are Olivia Rowley (Labour); Nick Farmer (Conservative) and Duncan Smith (Labour) who was elected on the 3rd May 2024. For the South Ossett and Horbury ward, the councillors are Darren Byford (Labour) who was re-elected on the 3rd May 2024; Deb Nicholls (Labour) and Gwen Page (Labour). </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Councillors.jpg" width="450" height="552" alt="Ossett Councillors"></p>
<p align="justify">Ossett has strong sporting traditions with a semi-professional football club Ossett United, Ossett Cricket and Athletics Club</a>, <a href="https://yourossettclub.co.uk/rugby/" target="_blank">Ossett Rugby Union Club</a>, Ossett Trinity Rugby League Club, Ossett Sports Badminton Club, <a href="http://www.lowlaithesgolfclub.co.uk/" target="_blank">Low Laithes Golf Club</a>, a Martial Arts Academy 
  and a Pool &amp; Snooker Club. There was an Ossett Football Club in the 1890s, they played in the   original West Yorkshire League.</p>
<p align="justify">A thriving market town, Ossett holds a market on Tuesdays and Fridays. There is a Community Centre that hosts local hobby groups, 
  a new Public Library coming soon in the Town Hall and one very crowded central Post Office following the mindless closure of Ossett's sub-Post Offices in the outlying districts. 
  The Gawthorpe Maypole Feast and Procession has been held each May since 1874. </p>
<p align="justify">Under the Local Government Act of 1972, Ossett lost its Borough status in 1974 and became an unparished area in the Metropolitan 
Borough of Wakefield.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Maypole_Book.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="Book and Maypole"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> The new 2022 Ossett History and Heritage Book and the newly repainted Gawthorpe Maypole.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>From Mayall's Annals of Yorkshire 1734 - 1736 </strong><br>
  <em>&quot;The  inhabitants of Ossett, a village three miles from Wakefield, have been employed in making broad  woollen cloth from time out of mind. 
  In this year the weavers, etc., employed  in that trade, had to work 15 hours every day for eight pence. A horn was blown at five o&rsquo;clock 
  in the morning, the time for  beginning, and at eight at night, the time  for leaving their work. The clothiers  had to take their goods to Leeds 
  to sell, and had  to stand in Briggate in all sorts of weather. </em></p>
<p align="justify"><em>About the year 1736, Richard  Wilson, a resident of Ossett, made two pieces of broadcloth; he carried one of  them on his head 
to Leeds  and sold it. The merchant being in want of the fellow piece, he went  from Leeds to Ossett, then carried the other  piece to Leeds, and 
then walked to Ossett again; he walked about forty  miles that day.&quot;</em></p>
<p>That sturdy and forcible spirit is what has made Ossett  the flourishing place it is today. The incident we have quoted is 
characteristic of the old-time industry of the place. At one time Ossett could boast of  well over a hundred  manufacturers - chiefly handloom 
weavers who worked at home. Most of the houses  had looms in them, and Ossett was  musical with the sound of their working, whilst a manufacturer 
who had a  small mill and employed from ten to twenty people was considered to be in a big way of business. When a person could buy a bag of wool 
and a bit of mungo  - the local name for rag-wool and  had a family to assist him, he  became a manufacturer. These small manufacturers carried 
their pieces to Leeds; either - like the aforesaid Richard Wilson - on their heads or backs, or on the backs of donkeys. In the Cloth Hall at Leeds 
the  pieces were displayed on stalls for the inspection of the merchants. These  forerunners of the woollen industry of today traded in a very 
small way,  and to receive an order for half a dozen or  a dozen pieces was doing business  on the grand scale. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Ossett_Hand_Loom.jpg" width="449" height="299" alt="Hand Loom "></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Above:</strong> Typical handloom used by Ossett cloth makers of the 19th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p align="justify">Frequently these humble people had 
  to sell their pieces fresh from the loom in order to get supplies of money for the purchase of wool  for the next piece. Wool at this time was brought 
  from Leeds to Bradford by road. There was no standard rate of wages as there is now, and  when a certain manufacturer had an  order in a time of 
  depression, he called his men together and told them he could not accept the order unless they agreed to take 3d. per string less. The men would 
  hold a meeting in the  fields and agree to the reduction rather than face a further period of idleness. Wages were very low as  compared with recent 
  earnings. A  fettler or woolyer would earn from 9s to 11s. a week, while, in  the words of an old manufacturer,them that piecened billy - the youngsters 
  would earn 4s. 9d. a week working full time. There were few workpeople  who averaged a pound a week sixty years  ago. The old hand loom system died hard; 
  indeed, it lingered on until the early years of this century, when the last of the Ossett handloom  weavers passed away at the  patriarchal age of ninety. 
  The old order had given place to the power loom - an innovation that was long and  sorely resented by the old weavers. How many  and radical have been the 
  changes wrought in and by the power loom! - from &quot;The Town and Trade of Ossett&quot; published 1927 <br>
  <br>
  This Richard Wilson referred to above was one of the founders of the Green Chapel (later Ossett Congregational Church) in Ossett with his brother Robert Wilson 
  who was my direct ancestor. At this time, in the early part of the 18th century, Ossett had a population of about 2,000  and many were self-employed cloth weavers 
  like Richard and Robert Wilson. With this web site, I hope to share some of the history of Ossett that I have been able to collect over the last few years as I 
  researched my Wilson family roots in the town. I have gathered a good selection of pictures and information about Ossett from a number of sources and I have tried 
  to acknowledge those sources wherever possible. I hope none of the pictures on this site are copyrighted, but if they are, do please let me know and I will remove 
  them.</p>
<p align="justify">Although Ossett doesn't have an official coat of arms, the design above has been universally accepted as the unoffocial coat of arms. It has been 
  widely seen over the years on various Ossett keepsakes such as Silver Jubilee mugs, postcards and some official Town Hall documentation. The design features the 
  three principal industries of the town: wool and shoddy mills, coal mining and agriculture. The sheep signifies the importance of wool and the white rose is the 
  symbol of Yorkshire. The Latin transcription, attributable to Ossett Grammar School headmaster Mr. M. Frankland who joined the school in 1881, means roughly 
  &quot;useless things made useful by skill&quot;. It  is a reference to turning rags into mungo or shoddy - one of Ossett's major industries in the 19th and 20th 
  century.</p>

<p>Mayall's Annals of Yorkshire was published in three volumes in about 1862. It contains, to quote <em>"A most fascinating everyday history of the people 
of Yorkshire with accounts of the events relating to the "ordinary" people of the county."</em></p>
<p>The following extract is from <em>&quot;The Town and Trade of Ossett&quot;</em> published in 1927:</p>
<p>&quot;The Municipality of Ossett is of comparatively recent creation. The great increase in population which accompanied the industrial progress made 
by the town during the 19th century justified application for incorporation as a borough, and a Royal Charter giving effect to this natural ambition was 
granted on July 16th, 1890. It provides for the administration of the Borough by a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors. The original borough 
comprised the parish of Ossett-cum-Gawthorpe, but in 1900 part of Alverthorpe was added by an Act of Parliament confirming a Provisional Order of the Local 
Government Board. Gawthorpe, with Chickenly Heath, became a separate parish for ecclesiastical purposes in 1901, but the area is still included within 
the administrative borough.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Above: </strong>The World Coal Carrying Championships are held in Gawthorpe on Easter Monday each year. </p>
<p>The event consists of Men's, Women's and Children's races that take place on Easter Monday. Men carry 50kg of coal and women 20kg in weight.</p>
<p>On the 1st April 1974 Ossett ceased to be a Borough and became part of the Wakefield Metropolitan District ending 84 years autonomy.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/asteroid.jpg" alt="Asteroid" width="140" height="84"></p>
<p>The South African astronomer <strong>Cyril V. Jackson, who was born in Ossett,</strong>in 1903, honoured the town when he named asteroid 1244 Deira.</p>
<p> The citation he submitted to the IAU was meant to represent the ancient name of Ossett. However, that is something of an exaggeration: the ancient Kingdom 
  of Deira actually encompassed (at its height) most of modern Yorkshire. </p>
<p>Jackson emigrated to South Africa in 1911 with his family.

Whereas his offspring confident in the vigour of their youth and their natural strength go out to hunt and bring the old one with them by pushing him along. Then, when they have come half the necessary distance, they leave him behind and give themselves to the chase. And when they have obtained enough for themselves and for their father, with a magnificent and thrilling roar, even as banqueters summon a guest, so do these young children summon their aged father to the feast. And he comes softly, step by step, and almost crawling, and embraces his children, fawning upon them a little with his tongue as though he applauded their success, and attacks the meal and feasts with his sons. This is no order of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/solon.html#1">Solon</A>'s to the lions: it is Nature that teaches them - Nature that ' takes no heed of laws ' <FONT CLASS="green">[Eur. fr. 920 N]</FONT> made by man. But she is a law that does not change.
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="2">[2]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ael.+NA+9.pos=424"> G</A> &nbsp; Not only when he is alive and active do birds dread the eagle, the king of birds, and cower down when he appears, but if one mixes his feathers with those of other birds, the eagle's remain entire and untainted, while the others, unable to endure the association, rot away.
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3">[3]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ael.+NA+9.pos=425"> G</A> &nbsp; Mice, besides being prolific creatures, bring forth many offspring at a single birth; and if by some means they happen to eat salt, then they bring forth a great number and far more than is customary. And when crocodiles give birth they test the legitimate and the bastard offspring in this manner. If on being hatched a young crocodile immediately seizes something, it is henceforward reckoned among the family and is loved by its parents, is believed to be, and is counted as, one of the crocodiles. If however it remains inactive and is lazy and fails to seize some fly or gnat or earthworm or young lizard, the father tears it to pieces as a poor creature, spurious, and no kin of his. And as these creatures act, even so do eagles appear to test their legitimate offspring by the rays of the sun <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-1" TITLE="1">**</A> and to love them as the result of judgment and not of any feeling.
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="4">[4]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ael.+NA+9.pos=426"> G</A> &nbsp; I have heard that the asp's fangs, which one would be correct in styling ' poison-carriers,' have an exceedingly thin coating, so to say, round them, like membrane, covering them all over. So when the asp fastens its mouth on a man, they say that these membranes part and the poison is ejected, and then again they close and unite. Again, the sting of the scorpion has a kind of hollow core, so very fine as to be hardly visible. That is where they say the poison resides and is engendered, and directly the scorpion strikes, the poison shoots forward along the sting and flows out. And this opening also, through which it passes, is so fine as to be invisible to the eye. But if a man spits upon it the sting is blunted and numbed and becomes incapable of wounding.

At any rate it bears the closest resemblance to him in every respect, while the rest are born as chance may dictate. In this matter Nature appears to pursue reason in setting the male which sows above the female which receives.

As the moon wanes they are in the habit of somehow becoming both emptier and lighter. Among Testaceans the purple shellfish, whelks, red thorny oysters, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-2" TITLE="2">**</A> and those of the same species prove my statement; among Crustaceans, edible crabs, crayfish, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-3" TITLE="3">**</A> lobsters, crabs in general, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-4" TITLE="4">**</A> and all their kin. It is also asserted that the young of beasts of burden born when the moon is on the wane are less capable and feebler than others, and what is more, those who have knowledge of these matters recommend that animals born in this part of the month should not be reared on the ground that they are not of good quality. Whereas animals born at the new moon, as I learn, either utter their natural sound or drop. The lion alone, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristotle.html#1">Aristotle</A> says, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-5" TITLE="5">**</A> does neither.

I have ascertained also that the basse knows full well that there is in fact a small stone <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-7" TITLE="7">**</A> in its head, and this in winter becomes intensely cold and causes it severe pain. This is why at that season of the year it warms itself <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-8" TITLE="8">**</A> and devises this highly effective remedy against the cold due to the stone. And the Chromis, the sea-bream, and the Maigre, I learn, do the same, for these fish also have a similar stone.
<P> (ii). It seems that among fishes also there exist parasites. <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-9" TITLE="9">**</A> At any rate the Sucking-fish, as it is called, nibbles what the dolphin catches, and the dolphin is glad that he should, and willingly allows him a share. That is why the fish is exceedingly plump, like one gorged with a rich and abundant feast. And Theron in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menander.html#3">Menander</A>'s play <FONT CLASS="green">[fr. 895 & 937 K]</FONT> boasts that he has led men by the nose and used them as his manger.

Elephant-hunters dig trenches and these animals fall into them, and while some are captured, others are killed. You will learn from other sources how they dig these trenches, how they are shaped, how deep, and what the entrances to them are like. I however propose to reveal and demonstrate the elephant's affection. When the mother sees her young one has fallen into one of the trenches, she does not hesitate, does not waste time, but rushing up at full speed, all courage and passion, hurls herself upon the head of her child, and the pair meet one and the same end, for the young one is crushed by the mother's weight; she falls on her head ... So those who doubt whether elephants have a natural affection for their offspring are absurd.

Then they lead them back to the original place of their birth, and again bring them down to the sea, and quickly lead them out, and by doing this many times they end by making them excellent swimmers. And they easily slide into life in the sea: their instruction affords an inducement, while Nature forces them to love the haunts and the habits of their mothers.

But listen also to the wiles of the Fox-shark and learn the kind of things it does. Either it will not come near the hook at all, or else it swallows it and immediately turns itself inside out, reversing its body just like a garment, and in this way no doubt it gets rid of the hook.

And when it attracts the female to itself they wait for the night. They cannot copulate under water, and they shun mutual embraces on land in the daytime. But when night descends they emerge with complete fearlessness and take their pleasure of one another.
<P> Whenever frogs utter their cry more loudly and more clearly than is their wont, it signifies that rain is coming.

And I have learnt from persons of experience that if a man touches even the net in which it has been captured his entire body is numbed. And if one throws it alive into a vessel and pours salt water upon it, and if the fish happens to be pregnant and the time of its delivery is at hand, then it gives birth. And if one pours the water in the vessel over a man's hand or foot, the hand or foot is inevitably numbed.

For instance, if a wasp has tasted a viper's flesh its sting is fiercer; and if a fly has been near something of the same kind its bite is sharper and causes pain; the bite of an asp too is rendered quite incurable if it eats of a frog. If a healthy dog bites a man, it causes a wound and a burning pain, but if the dog is mad, the bite is deadly. A seamstress was mending a shirt that had been torn by a mad dog, when she somehow bit it with her mouth in order to stretch the shirt: she went mad and died. The bite of a human being when fasting is dangerous and hard to cure. And the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythians</A> are even said to mix serum from the human body with the poison that they smear upon their arrows to drug them.

You see, after hibernating through the winter in some dark hole, it is short-sighted. And so the gentle warmth of the fennel cleanses the creature's vision which the frosts have numbed, and makes its sight keener.

For some of the bones it fixes upright, others cross-wise (one would say that it was some woman skilled in weaving that was interlacing the woof with the warp), and makes the nest approximately round and bellying in shape, as though it were plaiting a weel. And when it has woven the aforesaid nest it takes it down to the sea, and there, as the waves flow gently in, the advancing surf puts the Halcyon's labour to a test. For the water encountering any part that is not watertight <I>penetrates the nest, and the Halcyon seeing this (?)</I>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-15" TITLE="15">**</A> repairs it. But if you strike with a stone the parts which have been closely fitted, you will not pierce them. And if you try to cut them with steel, so well and truly have they been interwoven that they will not yield, any more than that linen breastplate which they say <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/amasis.html#1">Amasis</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-16" TITLE="16">**</A> gave as an offering to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athena.html#1">Athena</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lindus.html#1">Lindus</A>. <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-17" TITLE="17">**</A> And the mouth of this weel no other creature can enter or indeed detect at all: it admits the Halcyon alone. But not even a drop of sea water could trickle in, so watertight is the nest. And there, they say, rocked on the waves the Halcyon rears its young.

But Helen planted the herb and in time it flourished and produced seed disagreeable to the snakes, and in Pharos such creatures have never recurred.

And their method of assailing the oysters is as follows. The latter frequently open for coolness' sake and anyhow in order to feed themselves on whatever comes their way. Accordingly the starfishes insert one of their limbs between the shells and take their fill of the flesh, the oysters being precluded from closing again. So much then for this characteristic of starfishes.

It possesses baits above its eyes : one might describe them as elongated eyelashes, and at the end of each one is attached a small sphere. The fish is aware that nature has equipped it and even stimulated it to attract other fish by these means. Accordingly it hides itself in spots where the mud is thicker and the slime deeper, and extends the aforesaid hairs without moving. Now the tiniest fishes swim up to these eyelashes, imagining that the round, swinging objects at the end are edible; meanwhile the Angler lies in wait, never stirring, and when the little fishes are near to him, he withdraws the hairs towards himself (they are drawn in by some secret and invisible means), and the little fishes, whose gluttony has brought them close up, provide a meal for the aforesaid frog.

When it has nothing to fear, this fish moves in a forward direction, turning its feelers <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-23" TITLE="23">**</A> to either side, in order that the water encountering it as it swims may not thrust them back and hinder its advance. But if it is trying to escape, it goes backwards, relaxing its feelers completely, in order that, like one rowing with oars and moving lightly like a boat, it may withdraw to a great distance. If crayfish fight with one another they raise their feelers, fall upon each other like rams, and butt their foreheads together.

For the tranquillity of river and lake is well adapted to receive their offspring and to preserve their young from harm and from attack, both for other reasons and especially because of the absence or paucity of savage creatures. And lakes and rivers normally enjoy this freedom. That is the reason why the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/euxine.html#1">Euxine</A> abounds in such a quantity of fish: it has not learnt to foster monsters. If it does breed the seal and dolphins, they are of the smallest, but from all other pests the fishes here are protected.

And the reason for this is, I learn, as follows. The asp's poison is exceedingly sharp and spreads very rapidly. So when the asp fastens on a man the poison does not remain on the surface but penetrates to the inner passages of the body and disappears from view and from the skin before one's eyes, and presses inwards. That, you see, is why the manner of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleopatra.html#7">Cleopatra</A>'s death was by no means easily recognised by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/augustus.html#1">Octavian</A>'s companions, but only after a time when two punctures, hard to detect and discover, were observed, and through them was revealed the riddle of her death.

Thereupon he sucked out the poison with his mouth. He failed however to swallow some water afterwards, there being none at hand although he had got some ready (the vessel had been upset by an act of treachery), and as he had not washed off the poison and thoroughly rinsed his mouth he passed away after, I believe, two days without suffering any pain, though the poison had little by little reduced his gums and his mouth to putrescence.

Among the fishes there are some that rub off their eggs, massed and clinging together, on the sand; others as they swim spawn a great quantity of eggs, most of which are swallowed by those that swim in the rear. <A CLASS="help" HREF="#9-49" TITLE="49">**</A> In fact the males lead the way and scatter milt, and the females that follow, open-mouthed and quite insatiable, swallow it.

But what I did not tell, I now will. When the viper intends to couple with the moray, in order to appear gentle as befits a bridegroom, he disgorges and throws up his poison, and then with a soft hissing sound, as though raising a kind of pre-nuptial wedding chant, summons his bride. And when they have together completed their amorous revels, the fish makes for the waves and the sea, while the snake gulps down his poison again and goes back to his native haunts.

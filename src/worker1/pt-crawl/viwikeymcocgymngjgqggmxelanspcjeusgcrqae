The French economy minister, Christine Lagarde, stopped short recently of revealing whether the negotiations between euro countries over support of heavily indebted member states would actually lead to a fiscal union, given the strict conditions that are expected to accompany any future provision of aid.        </p><p>
&ldquo;We certainly need more fiscal consolidation &mdash; that&rsquo;s a given,&rdquo; she said during a recent interview. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t use the word &lsquo;harmonization&rsquo; yet until we&rsquo;ve come closer.&rdquo;        </p><p>
Ms. Lagarde bridled at the suggestion that the euro zone was moving toward a &ldquo;transfer union&rdquo; where rich countries like Germany and France backstop their neighbors with weaker budgets as long as the recipients agree to strict budget constraints like spending curbs.        </p><p>
&ldquo;If you start to use certain concepts and words, it begins to infuriate some people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The approach that we try to have is to move collectively. It&rsquo;s going to be a give and take process. We can&rsquo;t talk about the give unless we know about the take.&rdquo;        </p><p>
She was speaking after holding preliminary discussions with partners last week on the future of the euro zone&rsquo;s financial support mechanisms. Finance ministers have been examining their primary funding structure, the European Financial Stability Facility, or E.F.S.F., which can offer guarantees of as much as &euro;440 billion, or $600 billion.        </p><p>
There have been suggestions that the facility should be extended by additional guarantees and made more flexible, perhaps being allowed to buy bonds in the secondary market, recapitalize banks directly or set adjustable interest rates for borrowers. Funds have already been made available to Ireland.        </p><p>
Many analysts contend that the facility needs to expand because more countries, notably Portugal and Spain, may require support in future. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111011306/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/citigroup_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about Citigroup Incorporated" class="meta-org">Citigroup</a>, for example, estimates that &euro;2 trillion will be needed to secure a safety net for the zone.        </p><p>
Ms. Lagarde said it was &ldquo;premature&rdquo; to give details on the future size of the aid facility or whether it would buy back bonds in secondary market. She said the euro-zone finance ministers would &ldquo;come back with a comprehensive range of tools and decisions&rdquo; in March, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121111011306/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the European Union." class="meta-org">European Union</a> leaders will meet to discuss economic policies.        </p><p>
She said the discussion would feed into negotiations on a permanent bailout mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, or E.S.M., to replace the current aid structures, which expire in 2013.        </p><p>
Graham Bishop, an independent financial analyst who has advised the European and British Parliaments, said both aid mechanisms would become vehicles for fiscal harmonization.        </p><p>
&ldquo;By the end of 2011, the euro zone will have emerged from the financial crisis as a political federation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;loose in some respects but with tightly centralized economic governance at its heart.&rdquo;        </p><p>
Ms. Lagarde would not make that leap, saying only that she and her fellow finance ministers were discussing both aid facilities &ldquo;in parallel&rdquo; and that there was general agreement that the permanent aid facility &ldquo;needs to be comprehensive, that it has to give a strong signal of our solidarity and unity going forward.&rdquo;        </p><p>
She added that it was not yet clear whether the permanent structure would require changes to the Lisbon Treaty, the bloc&rsquo;s enhanced rule book, which took effect in 2009. That would greatly complicate approval of the new structure because of possible legal challenges in some countries and the need for referendums in others.        </p><p>
Before the related issue of restructuring the mountain of bad debts at European banks can be addressed, Ms. Lagarde said, European countries need to conduct meaningful tests on the health of their lenders&rsquo; balance sheets. Such stress tests have been carried out twice during the current crisis but failed to win investor confidence. Since the last round, published in July 2010, further problems have emerged, notably at Spanish and Irish lenders. The results of the latest tests are expected to be published in June.        </p><p>
&ldquo;We will test banks in a very comprehensive manner and a more credible fashion than we did last summer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We need to improve the overall credibility of the process, and that includes communication, range, scope, a combination of bottom up, top down quality control.&rdquo;        </p><div id="pageLinks"><ul id="pageNumbers"><li> 1 </li><li> <a onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPagePageNum2');" title="Page 2" href="/web/20121111011306/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/global/25iht-euro25.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=busln">2</a> </li></ul><a class="next" onclick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPage-Next');" title="Next Page" href="/web/20121111011306/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/global/25iht-euro25.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=busln">Next Page &#x00bb;</a></div><nyt_correction_bottom>	<div class="articleCorrection">

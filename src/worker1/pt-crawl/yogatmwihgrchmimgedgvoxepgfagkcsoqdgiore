<H2>The Boxer (1997)</H2>

<P>D: Jim Sheridan<BR>
S: Daniel Day Lewis, Emily Watson, Gerard McSorley</P>

<P>Having made the breakthrough for international Irish films with the likes
of <I>My Left Foot</I> and <I>In the Name of the Father</I>, director Jim
Sheridan has now settled into a comfortable routine of writing, directing
and producing works of cinema which are well made and generally entertaining.
Of course, this has obvious pitfalls in that he is now less able to surprise
us. He remains a <I>metteur en sc&egrave;ne</I> to Neil Jordan's <I>auteur</I>,
to borrow the old fashioned critical distinction. He has become one with
the nameless artisans of Hollywood history; a man who can be relied upon
do to the job well, and who sometimes comes up with something special, but
whom you don't rely upon to make films which change your perception of the
world.</P>

<P><I>The Boxer</I> is exactly the kind of film you would expect from a
talent of this sort. It is a well realised drama which has nothing new to
say about its subject and offers nothing startling or of exceptional interest,
but which is thoroughly watchable. It is based on a workmanlike script by
Terry George and directed with concern for smooth, meaningful storytelling.</P>

<P>Boxer Daniel Day Lewis emerges from prison after fifteen years and returns
to his war torn ghetto in an attempt to rebuild his life and rekindle his
relationship with his old girlfriend, (Emily Watson), now married. He faces
the assembled forces of sectarian bitterness and intransigence as he steps
across several boundaries in doing so. Eventually, his personal struggle
brings questions of the future of Northern Ireland to a head and violent
confrontation with the forces of hardline Republicanism is inevitable even
in a climate of uncertainty and change.</P>

<P>Its presentation of the complexities of the current situation in Northern
Ireland (specifically as it applies to Catholic and Republican characters,
of course) is the only new element of this classic drama, and that is really
only a matter of a backdrop. The rest is played out entirely within expected
norms. It is a story of love across barriers, good versus evil (with some
shadowy delineation between hardline and compromising characters within
the paramilitary group), and ultimately resolves itself in a thoroughly
predictable final ten minutes. There's nothing wrong with this, but it seems
to have irritated many Irish critics, who are, as ever, eager to see Irish
cinema eschew the values of Hollywood classicism and embrace a more European
model.</P>

<P>Funnily enough, on the surface, the pace of the film is slow and deliberate
in the manner of second cinema, and its emphasis on characters framed by
a social and political environment might well be considered along the same
lines. It takes its time to lay out the details of the coming conflict,
and is not so much structured around the boxing matches in the manner of
a <I>Rocky</I> film, as it uses them as anchors in the continual upping
of the dramatic stakes. Only a match which takes place in an eerie London
club stands apart as something of a set piece; a chilling condemnation of
colonialism where former subjects of the Empire beat each other to a pulp
for the amusement of the rich and powerful.</P>

<P>The performances are sincere and generally good. Day Lewis is fine, and
works well with Watson (whose accent slips occasionally, but is usually
good). Brian Cox is menacingly sympathetic as the Republican negotiator,
with Gerard McSorley marvelously hateful as the unforgiving martyr to violent
resistance. Each actor contributes to the atmosphere and plays their part
in the unfolding drama without histrionics or uncomfortable emphases, though
it is possible to see the film as a vehicle for Day Lewis (whose stardom
has peaked nicely following the likes of <I><A HREF="mbl.htm">My Beautiful
Laundrette</A></I>).</P>

<P>Everything about the film is admirable and careful and works towards
the ultimate aim of telling a good story well. But there is nothing here
that makes it worth going to see unless you have an interest in questions
of representation of Ireland or some devotion to its star. It never moves
out of second gear, and though it gets where it's going without making many
serious mistakes, it is not about to make you see either Ireland or the
cinema in a different light.</P>

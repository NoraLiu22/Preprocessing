<div class="paragraph indent1"><span class="num" value="1">“(1)</span>
<div class="content"> In December 1921, the Peace silver dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, replacing the Morgan silver dollar and commemorating the declaration of peace between the United States and the Imperial German government.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph indent1"><span class="num" value="2">“(2)</span>
<div class="content"> The Peace silver dollar was minted in Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco. The Morgan silver dollar was minted at Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, Carson City, and New Orleans.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph indent1"><span class="num" value="3">“(3)</span>
<div class="content"> The Peace silver dollar was designed by Anthony de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on the obverse and a bald eagle clutching the olive branch (a symbol of peace) on the reverse. The Peace silver dollars were minted between 1921 to 1935.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph indent1"><span class="num" value="4">“(4)</span>
<div class="content"> The Morgan silver dollar was designed by George T. Morgan and was minted from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. The obverse depicts a profile portrait of Lady Liberty and on the reverse, a heraldic eagle.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph indent1"><span class="num" value="5">“(5)</span>
<div class="content"> The conversion from the Morgan silver dollar to the Peace silver dollar design in 1921 reflected a pivotal moment in American history. The Morgan silver dollar represents the country’s westward expansion and industrial development in the late 19th century. The Peace silver dollar symbolizes the country’s coming of age as an international power while recognizing the sacrifices made by her citizens in World War I and celebrating the victory and peace that ensued.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph indent1"><span class="num" value="6">“(6)</span>
<div class="content"> These iconic silver dollars with vastly different representations of Lady Liberty and the American Eagle, reflect a changing of the guard in 1921 in the United States and therefore on the 100th anniversary must begin to be minted again to commemorate this significant evolution of American freedom.</div>

<p>From the fifteenth to the eighteenth the centuries, many Europeans developed
a heightened concern with the phenomenon of witchcraft, seeing a new sect
hostile to humanity.&nbsp; Thus, governments and society organized
&quot;hunts&quot; for these alleged witches:&nbsp; accusing, torturing, and executing
thousands of people.&nbsp; The intensity and viciousness of these hunts varied
from place to place, as did their focus on particular targets, such as
women.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a changed world-view, informed by the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment,
brought an end to these hunts for threats that did not empirically exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<b><font color="#800000">Brief Historical <a name="summary"> Summary</a>
of the European Witch Hunts<br>
 by
Erin Nummey, 1998</font></b></p>

<p>The European Witch Craze started roughly during conclusion of the 15th century and
peaked during the first half of the seventeenth century. The belief that women were sinful and
had the power of the devil within them developed out of the Middle Ages. The
Reformation further promoted the idea of a satanic kingdom of evil on earth with which to justify
persecutions. Theologians sought to prove that accused witches represented the
devil.</p>

<p>The first and most significant written cumulative concept of witchcraft available to a
large audience was the <i>Malleus Maleficarum </i>written by Sprenger and
Kraemer<i>.</i> It
was first published in 1486 and reprinted fourteen times before 1520. The document made an
important contribution to the widespread witch hunt. Most people accused of witchcraft
were rural, poor, and single women. The hunts are often seen as a massive effort to keep
women in their place. Women were seen as evil, and unclean people whose weakness could
summon the devil for sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>The <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> document ignited a widespread hunt for the so-called
witches described in it. During the hunt, witches were accused of &quot;impractical&quot;
and &quot;traceless&quot; crimes such as intercourse with the devil, unregistered babies
from hidden pregnancies who were supposedly eaten or sacrificed, and even natural
disasters. However there is no record of any solid evidence for any of these accused
crimes. </p>

<p>Often these hunts were instigated by hysterical children, or nuns who accused
relatives, and neighbors of these outrageous crimes. Witnesses were often bribed or
threatened in order to prosecute the accused. The accused would then be tortured until
they confessed. The methods of torture were very cruel and painful, and almost all who
were put through the various devices would confess. In some cases the accused would die of
torture, and very few survived the ordeal without confessing. However, the accused was set
free if they survived the torture without a confession. After the forced confession, the
trial took place. These trials were run by genuine believers of witchcraft. The aim of the
trial was to exterminate the witches as conspirators with the devil.&nbsp; When the accused was declared guilty, they were
usually executed. </p>

<p align="left">Although, there are many estimates as to how many actual people were killed during
these hunts, most estimates show the number well below the one-million mark. The actual
number of documented executions, is generally considered to be under one hundred
thousand. Of all that were executed, only a minority were men, and of those men,
many are those who tried to protect accused women from the hunters.</p>

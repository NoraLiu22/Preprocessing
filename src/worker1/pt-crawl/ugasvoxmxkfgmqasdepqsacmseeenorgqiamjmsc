Piraino and MCFC also join in and adopt USA Fencing's motions. The plaintiffs have filed a Response in opposition to each of these motions (Doc. Nos. 52-55), and the defendants have filed Reply briefs in further support of each of the motions (Doc. Nos. 56-59). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="9" id="pa9"> For the reasons set forth herein, both Motions to Dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part. USA Fencing's Motion to Strike will be denied in its entirety. Piraino and MCFC's Motion to Strike will be granted in one respect but otherwise denied. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="10" id="pa10"> <b>I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTUAL SUMMARY</b> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="11" id="pa11"> Very generally, the plaintiffs allege that Jane Doe suffered sexual abuse from Piraino, her fencing coach, while she was a member of the MCFC. Piraino is the owner, principal, and former head coach of MCFC. MCFC is a Tennessee corporation whose principal place of business is in Nashville. At all times relevant to the FAC, it was &ldquo;Tennessee's #1 Olympic fencing club.&rdquo; (Doc. No. 36 &para; 6.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="12" id="pa12"> USA Fencing, a not-for-profit corporation based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is the national governing body for the Olympic sport of fencing in the United States. As alleged in the FAC, USA Fencing is responsible for, among other things, <span page-number="3" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p3"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="13" id="pa13">  <blockquote id="bq14" bq-id="14"> promoting the sport of fencing in the United States, determining the standards by which athletes will be chosen to represent the U.S. in international competition, maintaining a national membership system for students, coaches, referees, and other members of the fencing community, and creating a common set of rules and policies that govern members and clubs when participating in fencing-related activities. </blockquote>  (<i>Id.</i> &para; 15.) Further, &ldquo;[f]encers, coaches, and referees must be members of USA Fencing in order to compete or otherwise participate in USA Fencing-sanctioned tournaments, camps, and other events.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para; 16.) USA Fencing has more than 30,000 members and 700 approved fencing clubs in the United States. Its operations are organized into six &ldquo;regions.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para; 19.) Tennessee, along with most of the other states in the southeastern quadrant of the country, is a member of Region 6. During the time relevant to this lawsuit, USA Fencing's Tennessee Division included 14 clubs with more than 300 members, and it held 10 to 15 tournaments annually in Tennessee. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 17, 20.) In the summer of 2014, Piraino began acting as Chair of the Tennessee Division of USA Fencing and, at some point before he started abusing Jane Doe, was &ldquo;hired&rdquo; by USA Fencing as Regional Coordinator for Region 6. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 45, 47.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="15" id="pa15"> Jane Doe began taking fencing lessons at MCFC in July 2017, when she was eleven years old. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 91.) During the spring or summer of 2019, when she was thirteen, she sought Piraino's assistance in drafting an essay for a USA Fencing-sponsored college scholarship competition. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 93-94.) Piraino agreed to help her-but only if she sent him photos of herself in a bikini, which she did. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 95.) The sexual abuse, conducted primarily electronically, began at this time. Over the following months, Piraino sent messages to Jane Doe via text and SnapChat,<a note-disclosure="1" href="#N30043"></a> requesting more photos. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 96.) <span page-number="4" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p4"></span>  </p><div note-container="1" id="N30043"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="16" id="pa16"> SnapChat, as explained by the plaintiffs, is a social media application, the defining feature of which is that messages, pictures, and videos sent through the application are only viewable by the recipient for a short time before they automatically disappear. (Doc. No. 36, at 22 n.12.) </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="17" id="pa17"> Though initially reluctant, Jane Doe agreed to provide nude or semi-nude photographs of herself in sexually suggestive positions when Piraino offered to compensate her with a prepaid debit card. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 97-99.) Piraino's inappropriate interactions with Jane Doe continued for well over a year, during which they exchanged thousands of sexually explicit text messages, photographs and videos. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 101, 104-08, 118-19.) Piraino preserved the photos and videos and distributed them to others. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 110, 129-32, 229, 231.)<a note-disclosure="2" href="#N3005A"></a>  </p><div note-container="2" id="N3005A"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="18" id="pa18"> This allegation regarding the distribution of the images to others supports Count 7 of the FAC, which sets forth the plaintiffs' claim against Piraino (and MCFC) under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-110-sexual-exploitation-and-other-abuse-of-children/section-2255-civil-remedy-for-personal-injuries" class="raw-ref">18 U.S.C. &sect; 2255</a>, which creates a civil cause of action for any victim of an offense in violation of <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-110-sexual-exploitation-and-other-abuse-of-children/section-2251-sexual-exploitation-of-children" class="raw-ref">18 U.S.C. &sect; 2251</a>. <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-110-sexual-exploitation-and-other-abuse-of-children/section-2251-sexual-exploitation-of-children" class="raw-ref">Section 2251</a> prohibits, among other things, the sexual exploitation of minors and the distribution and possession of child pornography. This claim is not the subject of Piraino and MCFC's Motion to Dismiss. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="19" id="pa19"> When Jane Doe complied with Piraino's demands, he provided her with money and fencing equipment, and he waived fees for lessons and fencing-related activities. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 97-99, 113.) During practices at MCFC, Piraino would touch Jane Doe's inner thigh, while correcting her technique; he would also hug, kiss, and grope her. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 120.) He gave her massages, during which he would fondle her while moaning and grunting sexually. (<i>Id</i>.) If Jane Doe did not comply with Piraino's demands, he berated her in front of other students and singled her out for harsh treatment and physical punishment, including by making her repeatedly perform exercises that he knew aggravated a shoulder injury that initially manifested itself sometime in 2020, causing her &ldquo;excruciating pain.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 114-16.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="20" id="pa20"> In December 2020, Jane Doe took a break from fencing to rest her injured shoulder. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 122.) In early 2021, she told Piraino that she would no longer communicate with him. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 123.) On July 27, 2021, she reported the sexual misconduct to her psychotherapist. This disclosure led to Piraino's arrest in August 2021. Piraino was charged with 108 counts, based on criminal conduct <span page-number="5" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p5"></span> involving Jane Doe and another minor. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 126, 134.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="21" id="pa21"> The plaintiffs initiated this action on July 27, 2022. Shortly after the filing of the original Complaint (Doc. No. 1), they sought leave both to proceed pseudonymously and to stay the case pending the resolution of criminal charges against Piraino in the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Doc. Nos. 10, 13). The court granted both motions, and this case was stayed through December 2022. (Doc. Nos. 16, 17, 23.) At that time, the plaintiffs provided notice that Piraino had pleaded guilty to &ldquo;multiple counts relating to his sexual abuse of Jane Doe, including (1) two counts of especially aggravated exploitation of a minor and (2) one count of sexual exploitation of a minor via electronic means&rdquo; and had been sentenced to 25 years in prison. (Doc. No. 21, at 12.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22"> After reinstatement of the case on the court's active docket, the plaintiffs filed a motion for default judgment against Piraino and MCFC, and USA Fencing filed a motion to dismiss the claims in the original Complaint asserted against it. In response, the plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (&ldquo;FAC&rdquo;) (Doc. No. 36), which, as relevant here, adds new factual allegations in an attempt to remedy deficiencies identified in USA Fencing's motion. The court denied as moot the motions addressed to the original Complaint, and the defendants then filed the motions now before the court. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="23" id="pa23"> <b>II.

The parents expressly disclaim any intent to seek &ldquo;damages other than those to which they are entitled by law,&rdquo; and the FAC makes it clear that medical expenditures are the only type of economic damages they seek. (<i>See</i> Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 142, 154, 179, 194.)

As an initial matter, the court notes that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense on which defendants bear the burden of proof, and plaintiffs are not required to plead facts to avoid the application of a statute of limitations in order to state a claim. <i>Cataldo v.

(Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 115-17.) The injury occurred sometime in 2020, and the parents were clearly aware of the injury no later than December 2020, because the FAC alleges that Jane Doe took time off from fencing around that time to allow her shoulder time to heal. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 122.) The entity defendants argue that, because the plaintiffs knew of this injury and did not file suit until July 2022, it appears from the face of the FAC that the parents' claim for medical damages related to the shoulder injury is barred by Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations, <a href="/statute/tennessee-code/title-28-limitation-of-actions/chapter-3-limitation-of-actions-other-than-real/part-1-miscellaneous-limitations/section-28-3-104-personal-tort-actions-actions-against-certain-professionals" class="raw-ref">Tenn.

No. 42, at 9.) MCFC appears to be asserting on this ground that the entirety of the parents' damages claims related to the medical or psychiatric care of Jane Doe incurred by the parents arising from Piraino's abuse (and not just the damages related to her shoulder injury) are time-barred.<a note-disclosure="4" href="#N300FD"></a>   </p><div note-container="3" id="N300F8"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="36" id="pa36"> MCFC absurdly argues that the plaintiffs' claims accrued in 2017, because the Judgments entered against Piraino states that his criminal offenses began in 2017. (<i>See</i> Doc. No. 42, at 3, 89 (citing Doc. No. 41-1).) The plaintiffs clearly allege, however, that the abuse of Jane Doe did not begin until 2019. </p> </div><div note-container="4" id="N300FD"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="37" id="pa37"> MCFC also asserts that the plaintiffs fail to allege when the parents discovered the abuse of Jane Doe, but, again, the plaintiffs had no obligation to plead to avoid the application of the statute of limitations. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="38" id="pa38"> Tennessee, however, follows the &ldquo;discovery rule,&rdquo; under which the limitations period does not start running until the plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered, both the <i>injury</i> and the <i>source</i> of the injury. <i>Redwing v. Cath. Bishop for Diocese of Memphis</i>, <a href="/case/redwing-v-catholic-bishop-for-the-diocese-of-memphis#p458" class="raw-ref">363 S.W.3d 436, 458-59</a> (Tenn. 2012). The parents specifically allege that the communications between Jane Doe and Piraino primarily took place via SnapChat, which meant that the photographs and communications between them disappeared following receipt. (Doc. No. 36, at 22 n.12.) They allege that they did not know about the communications. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 92.) For purposes of the defendants' motions based on the statute of limitations, the factual allegations in the FAC do not establish that the parents knew or reasonably should have known prior to Jane Doe's disclosure of her abuse to her psychotherapist that their daughter had suffered physical and emotional injuries as a result of wrongful conduct. The lawsuit was filed within a year of the date of Jane Doe's disclosure of the abuse. Dismissal of the parents' damages claims <span page-number="10" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p10"></span> on statute of limitations grounds, therefore, is not warranted. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="39" id="pa39"> <i>2. The Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim Against MCFC</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="40" id="pa40"> MCFC also asserts that the parents' IIED claim is time-barred for the same reasons, but the same statute of limitations analysis applies. MCFC's motion will be denied, insofar as it seeks dismissal of the IIED claim based on the running of the one-year statute of limitations.<a note-disclosure="5" href="#N3011B"></a>  </p><div note-container="5" id="N3011B"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="41" id="pa41"> The damages sought by the parents in association with the IIED claim are the same medical damages sought in connection with the other claims set forth in the FAC. The FAC does not appear to set forth an independent IIED claim on behalf of the parents, as it nowhere alleges that the parents, as opposed to Jane Doe, suffered &ldquo;serious mental injury&rdquo; as a result of any defendant's conduct (including Piraino's), which is one of the necessary elements of an IIED claim. <i>Rogers v.

The plaintiffs here allege that USA Fencing knowingly participated in a &ldquo;venture&rdquo; with Piraino when it allowed him to act as an agent for the organization, hired him as Region 6 Coordinator, allowed him to serve as chair of an administrative division within the organization, and approved him and his fencing club as members of the organization. (Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 202, 217.)

(<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 204, 219.) Similarly, the plaintiffs allege that MCFC knowingly participated in a venture with Piraino, because Piraino was the &ldquo;sole owner, officer, and director of Music City Fencing and exercised control over the management of the company.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 203, 218.) And MCFC allegedly benefited financially by accepting Piraino's services as an officer and agent of MCFC and through the payment of dues and other fees from students and coaches who participated in fencing through MCFC.

The defendants do not effectively dispute that they were engaged in common undertakings with Piraino; they simply dispute that they were engaged in a sex trafficking venture with him. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="56" id="pa56"> But that question does not enter into the equation at this step in the inquiry. For purposes of these two factors, the plaintiffs adequately allege that USA Fencing and MCFC knowingly benefited from engaging in a common venture with Piraino-a common venture involving the <span page-number="13" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p13"></span> promotion and coaching of the sport of fencing.

That provision simply criminalizes attempts to violate the substantive provisions of the TVPA. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="60" id="pa60"> Regarding USA Fencing specifically, the FAC contains numerous allegations about the problem of sex abuse generally in youth sports, as well as allegations about a single complaint brought to USA Fencing's attention in 2017 that Piraino had engaged in inappropriate contact with an adult college student during a fencing competition at which the complainant was a referee. The <span page-number="14" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p14"></span> plaintiffs allege that USA Fencing was negligent insofar as it knew about a potential problem involving the sexual abuse of minors generally and that it failed to take effective steps to minimize opportunities for such abuse and also to facilitate the reporting and detection of such abuse when it occurs. They also allege that Piraino engaged in other misconduct that USA Fencing either knew about or should have known about but that does not amount to sexual misconduct. The plaintiffs' negligence claims against of USA Fencing related to Piraino's perpetration of abuse generally is addressed below. For purposes of the TVPRA, however, as indicated above, the plaintiffs must show that USA Fencing knew or should have known that Piraino's activities constituted sex trafficking or forced labor as to Jane Doe. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="61" id="pa61"> As USA Fencing points out, even Jane Doe's parents did not know about Piraino's sexual abuse of their daughter until months after the abuse had ceased, as he took great pains to ensure the secrecy of his activities. In cases in which courts have found hotels liable under a beneficiary theory, the plaintiffs have pointed to specific activities that should have put the hotels on notice of the specific trafficking of the victims, rather than merely the risk of trafficking in general. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>J.C.</i>, 624 F.Supp.3d at 1317 (recognizing that, while courts have &ldquo;grappled with the question of what conduct constitutes a defendant's participation in a venture under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-77-peonage-slavery-and-trafficking-in-persons/section-1595-civil-remedy" class="raw-ref">&sect; 1595(a)</a>, . . . the factor that appears to differentiate plaintiffs who adequately state TVPRA beneficiary claims from those who do not is that the successful plaintiffs &lsquo;connect the dots' between the plaintiff's traffickers and the specific defendant in the case&rdquo; and that one way to do this is to &ldquo;allege a &lsquo;continuous business relationship' between a defendant hotel and a sex trafficker where the defendant rented rooms to people it knew or should have known were engaged in sex trafficking&rdquo; (collecting cases)); <i>A.B. v.

We find these allegations plausibly allege Marriott knew or should have known of a sex trafficking venture involving A.B. at its three Philadelphia Airport hotels.&rdquo;). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="62" id="pa62"> The plaintiffs here do not point to any such specific and obvious signs that, if USA Fencing had been paying attention, would have alerted it to Piraino's sex trafficking of Jane Doe. That USA Fencing knew or should have known that Piraino had allegedly groped an adult woman in 2017, allegedly engaged in &ldquo;belligerent and unethical behavior at fencing tournaments&rdquo; (Doc. No. 36 &para; 61), and had been arrested in 2015 for public intoxication (<i>Id.</i> &para; 66) may have put it on notice that Piraino was generally a bad guy and a poor ambassador for the sport, but not that he was engaged in acts that constituted the sex trafficking of Jane Doe. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="63" id="pa63"> Apparently recognizing this deficiency, the plaintiffs premise USA Fencing's beneficiary <span page-number="16" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p16"></span> liability under the TVPRA on their allegations that Piraino was USA Fencing's &ldquo;agent&rdquo; and that &ldquo;USA Fencing knew that Piraino was engaged in conduct that violated [the TVPA] because . . . Piraino's knowledge of his own behavior is legally imputed to USA Fencing as an agent of the organization.&rdquo; (Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 206, 221.) USA Fencing argues that the factual allegations in the FAC fail to establish that Piraino was acting as USA Fencing's agent when he, unbeknownst to USA Fencing, engaged in illegal activity and that Piraino's knowledge of his own wrongdoing cannot be imputed to USA Fencing under the circumstances presented here. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="64" id="pa64"> In other words, the parties consider this issue to be determined by agency law, with the decision turning on whether Piraino's knowledge that he was sexually abusing Jane Doe should be imputed to USA Fencing. Regarding this argument, courts generally have found that vicarious or indirect liability may be available under the TVPRA. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Treminio v. Crowley Mar.

Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations &sect; 819, at 104-08 (2002)). The rationale for the rule is that, when a corporation has only one representative, that sole representative has &ldquo;no one to whom to impart his or her knowledge and no one from whom he or she may conceal it. In general, this is another way of stating that the agent is <i>de facto</i> the principal.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> (quoting Fletcher, &sect; 827.10, at 143; citing <i>Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Color Tile, Inc. v.

The plaintiffs themselves allege that USA Fencing is the &ldquo;national governing body for the sport of fencing in the United States,&rdquo; that it is a non-profit corporation whose principal place of business is in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and that it is a multi-million dollar business with 700 approved fencing clubs around the country and more than 30,000 dues-paying members. (Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 7, 17, 18.) Its operations are organized by region, and the regions are made up of State divisions. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 12, 19, 20.) The allegations make clear that USA Fencing has a national office and a board of directors-of which Piraino is not alleged to <span page-number="18" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p18"></span> have ever been a member. He is not an officer or manager of USA Fencing. Rather, he runs one member club. Beginning in 2014, he acted as Chair of USA Fencing's Tennessee division, and at some point before he began abusing Jane Doe, he was allegedly &ldquo;hired&rdquo; by USA Fencing as its Region 6 Coordinator, a two-year position. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 47.) These allegations firmly establish that there were others within USA Fencing to whom Piraino could have imparted his own knowledge of his wrongdoing and others from whom he actively sought to conceal it. The facts as alleged in the FAC do not remotely suggest that Piraino so &ldquo;control[led] and dominate[d]&rdquo; USA Fencing that he effectively acted as its alter ego. <i>Mann</i>, <a href="/case/mann-v-adventure-quest-inc#p612" class="raw-ref">974 A.2d at 612</a>.<a note-disclosure="10" href="#N301E9"></a> Accordingly, the FAC fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted as to USA Fencing under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-77-peonage-slavery-and-trafficking-in-persons/section-1595-civil-remedy" class="raw-ref">18 U.S.C. &sect; 1595(a)</a>, with respect to Piraino's alleged violations of the TVPA.  </p><div note-container="10" id="N301E9"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="68" id="pa68"> The sole actor exception may also apply in a situation where &ldquo;one person acts as the only agent representing the principal's interest in a particular transaction.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 614 (citing <i>Curtis, Collins &amp; Holbrook Co. v. United States</i>, <a href="/case/curtis-co-v-united-states#p222" class="raw-ref">262 U.S. 215, 222</a> (1923)). Even assuming the Sixth Circuit would recognize this exception, it only applies when the &ldquo;principal seeks to retain a benefit that the agent has procured for the principal.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 615. &ldquo;[T]he rule merely applies principles of estoppel, ratification or restitution in cases involving claims to property.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). It does not apply in this case. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="69" id="pa69"> But the same analysis does not necessarily apply to MCFC. Piraino is alleged to be the founder, sole owner, principal, director, and former head coach of MCFC, as well as its agent for service of process. (Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 6, 39, 41.) He was purportedly </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="70" id="pa70">  <blockquote id="bq71" bq-id="71"> responsible for the management of the company and made all decisions relating to finances, personnel, leases, equipment acquisitions, and policies and procedures governing the company's day-to-day operations, including the adoption, implementation, and enforcement of the company's policies and procedures relating to the prevention and detection of sexual abuse. </blockquote>  (<i>Id.</i> &para; 41.) In this role, he allegedly had &ldquo;complete control over the operations and management&rdquo; of MCFC, and the corporation itself placed no &ldquo;limits on Piraino's authority or ability to act on behalf of the company.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para; 43.) The court finds that these allegations, if found to be true, would <span page-number="19" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p19"></span> be sufficient to establish that the sole-representative exception to the otherwise applicable adverse-interest exception applies with respect to Piraino's relationship with MCFC. <i>Mann</i>, <a href="/case/mann-v-adventure-quest-inc#p612" class="raw-ref">974 A.2d at 612</a>. That is, the allegations support an inference that Piraino &ldquo;control[led] and dominate[d]&rdquo; MCFC to such an extent that his knowledge of his own wrongdoing may be imputed to MCFC. <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="72" id="pa72"> MCFC appears to argue that this exception cannot apply because it would suggest that there was no &ldquo;common venture,&rdquo; because Piraino was effectively in a sex-trafficking venture only with himself. (<i>See</i> Doc. No. 42, at 13 (&ldquo;Because Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint does not allege that &lsquo;two or more people' engaged in a sex trafficking venture involving MCFC, Plaintiffs' [TVPA] claim against MCFC fails as a matter of law.&rdquo;).) While this argument has some logical appeal, that Piraino may have dominated and controlled MCFC to such an extent that his knowledge of his own wrongdoing may be imputed to MCFC would not mean that MCFC did not exist as a separate corporate entity with which Piraino was engaged in a common venture involving the promotion and teaching of fencing. It simply means that MCFC is charged with knowing that Piraino was using MCFC, the enterprise, to engage in sex trafficking. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="73" id="pa73"> MCFC, moreover, conflates the standards applicable to criminal claims under the TVPA and those applicable to civil claims under the TVPRA, when it asserts-incorrectly-that the Sixth Circuit has defined the term venture, &ldquo;as contemplated by <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-i-crimes/chapter-77-peonage-slavery-and-trafficking-in-persons/section-1595-civil-remedy" class="raw-ref">18 U.S.C. &sect; 1595(a)</a>,&rdquo; as requiring &ldquo;[t]wo or more people who engage in sex trafficking together.&rdquo; (Doc.

In addition to knowledge of this general risk, the plaintiffs allege that, in February 2017, a female collegiate athlete and member of USA Fencing filed a written complaint with USA Fencing, alleging that Piraino had touched her breasts without <span page-number="21" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p21"></span> her consent during a fencing tournament in Tennessee at which she was serving as a referee. The event was organized and managed by Piraino in his capacity as Tennessee Division Chair. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 75-77.) Shortly after the woman filed her complaint, in which she explained the incident in detail and provided contact information for a witness, USA Fencing contacted her and told her she needed to submit the complaint under the category of &ldquo;physical misconduct&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;sexual misconduct.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 77-78.) She resubmitted the form and then had a telephone conversation with USA Fencing's then CEO on March 3, 2017. During this call, the woman again explained the incident in detail.

They also alleged that sexual abuse of young athletes by credentialed coaches generally was &ldquo;so rampant by 1999 defendant USOC required all [national governing bodies] to have specific insurance to cover coach sexual abuse,&rdquo; and they alleged that, by 2007, &ldquo;sexual abuse of minors by figures of authorit[y], like priests, coaches, and scout leaders was a widely known risk in American society.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 728. Based on all of these allegations, the court found it foreseeable that youth athletes attending Olympic qualifying competitions with their coaches might be sexually molested by their coaches, regardless of whether USA Taekwondo was specifically on notice of prior misconduct by Gitelman.

The court found it relevant for purposes of weighing this factor that the plaintiffs alleged that USA Taekwondo was negligent in failing to adopt and enforce policies and procedures to protect athletes from sexual abuse by coaches-in particular that it was aware by 1992 that taekwondo coaches were abusing athletes but did not adopt policies to prevent such abuse until late in 2013, after Gitelman had abused the plaintiffs-and that the failure to adopt policies and procedures was &ldquo;closely connected to the injury that the plaintiffs suffered because action by [USA Taekwondo] could have reduced the risk of the plaintiffs being abused by limiting inappropriate conduct between coaches and youth athletes.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 729. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="111" id="pa111"> Weighing the policy factors, the court attributed some moral blame to USA Taekwondo, because of its failure to implement policies to prevent sexual abuse of youth athletes by coaches <span page-number="31" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p31"></span> until 2013, noting that moral blame may attach when the defendant could have taken, but failed to take, reasonable steps to avert foreseeable harm. <i>Id.</i> ta 729-30. The court also found that the &ldquo;societal goal of safeguarding youth athletes from sexual abuse&rdquo; weighed heavily in favor of imposing a duty on USA Taekwondo to implement and enforce policies and procedures to protect athletes, that it was in the best position to take measures to prevent future harm, and that imposing this duty on it would not be unduly burdensome or costly in light of the benefits to society. <i>Id.</i> at 731. Finally, the court noted that the factor relating to the availability and cost of insurance weighed in favor of imposing a duty, in light of the allegation that USA Taekwondo had obtained insurance to cover sexual abuse by coaches in 1999. <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="112" id="pa112"> Based on all of these factors, the court found that application of the <i>Rowland</i> factors to the facts as alleged by the plaintiffs supported the imposition of a duty of care on USA Taekwondo to &ldquo;use reasonable care to protect taekwondo youth athletes from foreseeable sexual abuse by their coaches.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 731. Although Tennessee's framework for analyzing duty in the context of a special relationship is perhaps not as comprehensive as California's, and the facts alleged in <i>Brown</i> were substantially more egregious than those at issue here, <i>Brown</i> is nonetheless instructive. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="113" id="pa113"> <i>c) Whether USA Fencing Owed a Duty to Jane Doe</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="114" id="pa114"> In seeking dismissal of the negligence and negligent supervision claims, USA Fencing asserts that the plaintiffs' allegation that it &ldquo;failed to implement and enforce policies and procedures that would prevent coaches from having 1:1 unsupervised contact or communications&rdquo; with minor athletes is &ldquo;inconsistent with and contradicts the allegations&rdquo; in the FAC, because, according to USA Fencing, there is &ldquo;no doubt&rdquo; that it took measures to minimize the risk of sexual abuse of minor athletes. (Doc. No. 44, at 16.) USA Fencing construes the FAC as acknowledging that USA Fencing &ldquo;undertook extensive measures to prevent sexual abuse of minor fencers, consistent with [USOC] and SafeSport mandates,&rdquo; including requirements that coaches undergo <span page-number="32" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p32"></span> background screening, as well as training on the prevention of athlete abuse, and that member coaches and clubs comply with the &ldquo;U.S. Center Safe Sport Code and the USA Fencing Code of Conduct.&rdquo; (Doc. No. 44, at 20.) In support of these assertions, USA Fencing cites its own website and that of SafeSport rather than the FAC itself. (<i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Id.</i> at 20 nn. 8-11.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="115" id="pa115"> In the FAC, the plaintiffs indeed allege that USA Fencing adopted its own policies and procedures and that it represents to parents and young fencers that it is committed to &ldquo;creating a safe and positive environment for athletes' physical, emotional and social development&rdquo; and an &ldquo;environment free of misconduct,&rdquo; and that Piraino was subject to its various policies and procedures. (Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 35, 55.) However, they further allege that, although USA Fencing had the power and authority to control, monitor, and supervise Piraino, to discipline him and to strip him from any position held within the organization, it failed to &ldquo;take reasonable measures to prevent a person in [Piraino's] position&rdquo; from engaging in sexual misconduct or &ldquo;to detect such conduct when it occurred.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 58, 69.) Specifically, USA Fencing allegedly created a system &ldquo;where the only person tasked with ensuring that Piraino and the other coaches at MCFC&rdquo; followed the policies implemented by USA Fencing was Piraino himself. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 71.) The plaintiffs allege that USA Fencing &ldquo;did not have an audit process or other mechanisms in place to detect when repeated and pervasive violations of applicable laws and policies relating to sexual misconduct were occurring&rdquo; and, &ldquo;[p]erhaps most critically,&rdquo; &ldquo;failed to provide young fencers and their parents with information and training concerning MAAPP, the SafeSport Code, or USA Fencing's fencing-specific policies and procedures relating to the preventing and detection of sexual abuse.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 71-72.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="116" id="pa116"> USA Fencing does not actually address the question of whether a special relationship existed, either between it and Jane Doe or between it and Piraino. The court finds that the facts as <span page-number="33" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p33"></span> alleged are sufficient to establish the existence of a special relationship between USA Fencing and Piraino. As the Tennessee Court of Appeals found in 2014, &ldquo;[t]he plethora of litigation, both civil and criminal, arising from alleged sexual abuse of children by persons in authority, in addition to the attention provided to this social evil by the media and throughout every strata of society, renders the alleged abuse in this case entirely foreseeable.&rdquo; <i>Ms. B.</i> v, 2014 WL 890892, at *5. Here, as there, the gravity of the foreseeable harm is enormous, and the prevention of child sexual abuse is a &ldquo;priority in Tennessee.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> And, much like USA Taekwondo in <i>Brown</i>, fencing athletes in the United States must be members of USA Fencing and train under USA Fencing certified trainers in order to compete in USA Fencing-sanctioned tournaments or participate in other USA Fencing-sponsored events. (Doc. No. 36 &para; 16.) Piraino was a USA Fencing member coach, authorized by USA Fencing to supervise and instruct athletes at USA Fencing-approved clubs and at USA Fencing-sanctioned events. (<i>Id.</i> &para; 38.) The plaintiffs allege that USA Fencing had some measure of control over Piraino through its policies and procedures, and, as the national governing body of fencing, USA Fencing is responsible for the conduct and administration of fencing in the United States and for &ldquo;creating a common set of rules and policies that govern members and clubs when participating in fencing-related activities.&rdquo; (<i>See id.</i> &para; 15.) In addition to being governed by SafeSport, USA Fencing undertook to adopt its own policies and procedures relating to the prevention of sexual abuse, and it represents to the fencing community that it is committed to creating a &ldquo;safe and positive environment&rdquo; for young fencers. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 34-35.) It retained &ldquo;wide discretion and authority to implement its own abuse-prevention measures.&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> &para; 36.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="117" id="pa117"> In <i>Ms. B.</i>, the question of whether a national organization should incur a duty to &ldquo;take reasonable measures to prevent sexual abuse&rdquo; of the children participating in its programs turned on whether the national organization had the &ldquo;means and ability to control&rdquo; its local affiliates' <span page-number="34" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p34"></span> actions. <i>Id.</i> at *6. In the present case, the plaintiffs allege that, although USA Fencing had implemented certain policies related to the prevention of child sexual abuse, it failed to implement reasonable policies relating to the detection of child abuse or to informing children and parents about how to recognize and respond to abuse when it occurred, and failed to enforce the provisions it did have in place. They also allege that USA Fencing had the means and ability to supervise and monitor Piraino. While USA Fencing denies that it had the ability or means to oversee Piraino's day-to-day activities, the plaintiffs have adequately alleged that it did have the means. Like USA Taekwondo in <i>Brown</i>, USA Fencing was &ldquo;in a unique position to protect young athletes from the risk of sexual abuse by their coaches,&rdquo; <i>Brown II</i>, <a href="/case/brown-v-usa-taekwondo#p726" class="raw-ref">253 Cal.Rptr.3d at 726</a>. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="118" id="pa118"> The court finds, in short, that a special relationship existed between USA Fencing and its member organizations and coaches, and further finds that the foreseeability of the sexual abuse of young athletes gave rise to a duty to Jane Doe on the part of USA Fencing. To be sure, the allegations in this case are dissimilar from those in either <i>Brown</i> or <i>Ms. B.</i>, insofar as the plaintiffs here acknowledge that USA Fencing had, in fact, put in place at least some of the policies required by federal law and SafeSport. And they do not allege that Piraino openly engaged in sexual misconduct with Jane Doe such that his relationship with her was an open secret, as was the situation in <i>Brown</i>. Most of the abuse took place digitally and was designed to evade detection. However, the question of whether USA Fencing actually <i>breached</i> a duty is one not raised by USA Fencing's Motion to Dismiss and, even if it had been, that is not the type of question that can typically be resolved by a motion to dismiss. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="119" id="pa119"> USA Fencing does not substantively support its claim that the plaintiffs fail to adequately allege proximate causation and has not shown that dismissal on this ground is warranted.

The doctrine &ldquo;does not create a new cause of action. Rather, it is a form of ordinary negligence that enables the courts to use a penal statute to define a reasonably prudent person's standard of care.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). In other words, &ldquo;[n]egligence <i>per se</i> arises when a legislative body pronounces in a penal statute what the conduct of a reasonable person must be, whether or not the common law would require similar conduct.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).

Piraino and MCFC's Motion to Strike</b> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="145" id="pa145"> Piraino and MCFC (collectively &ldquo;MCFC&rdquo;) move to strike paragraphs 22 through 27, 61, 65, and 66 of the FAC as &ldquo;immaterial, impertinent, and/or scandalous matter.&rdquo; (Doc. No. 41, at 2.) The first set of these paragraphs concerns non-parties: a fencing coach suspended by USA Fencing in 2014 after allegations of a sexual relationship with a fencer when she was a minor; sexual assault allegations against an Olympic fencer in 2013 and 2014; comments by USA Fencing's Chairman in 2021 relating to the number of fencing coaches arrested for sexually assaulting a minor that year; a blog reporting a very unofficial survey and resulting estimate of the percentage of women in the fencing community who had been sexually assaulted; the resignation of USA Fencing's (female) CEO in September 2021 &ldquo;amid mounting pressure over the mishandling of complaints <span page-number="41" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p41"></span> relating to sexual abuse&rdquo;; and other well known scandals involving sexual misconduct in nationally known organizations. (Doc. No. 36 &para;&para; 22-27.) The second set of allegations concerns Piraino: his allegedly belligerent and unethical conduct at fencing tournaments; drinking to excess and providing alcohol to underage fencers at social events; and his arrest for public intoxication in 2015. (<i>Id.</i> &para;&para; 61, 65-66.)<a note-disclosure="18" href="#N304D2"></a>  </p><div note-container="18" id="N304D2"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="146" id="pa146"> The irony of moving to strike these allegations, of course, is that it brings them to the court's, and potentially the public's attention. </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="147" id="pa147"> The court finds the allegations regarding sexual misconduct involving non-entities in paragraphs 22 through 27 to be generally relevant to the question of whether the abuse at issue in this case was foreseeable. Although it is somewhat cumulative, it is not actually redundant or scandalous. Although MCFC argues that this material is not well known to the average citizen from Middle Tennessee, it cannot show that it is actually prejudiced by the allegations. The court notes that the results of the highly unscientific survey on the &ldquo;Fencing Coach&rdquo; blog in paragraph 25 are unsupported and likely inadmissible, but the court will simply exercise its discretion to disregard that paragraph. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="148" id="pa148"> Similarly, paragraphs 61 and 65 are at least potentially relevant and no more scandalous than the allegations concerning Piraino's sexual misconduct. The court will deny the motion to strike these paragraphs. Paragraph 66, however, concerning Piraino's alleged 2015 arrest for public intoxication, is completely immaterial, and whatever probative value it might have would be &ldquo;substantially outweighed by a danger of . . . unfair prejudice.&rdquo; <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-evidence/article-iv-relevance-and-its-limits/rule-403-excluding-relevant-evidence-for-prejudice-confusion-waste-of-time-or-other-reasons" class="raw-ref">Fed.R.Evid. 403</a>. The presence of this allegation in the pleading is likely to prejudice the defendants. <i>Hobbs</i>, 2019 WL 1861330, at *3. The court will strike paragraph 66 of the FAC. <span page-number="42" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p42"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="149" id="pa149"> <b>C. USA Fencing's Motion to Strike</b> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="150" id="pa150"> USA Fencing asks the court to strike many of the same paragraphs of the FAC to which MCFC objects (paragraphs 22, 23, 25-27, 61). (<i>See</i> Doc. No. 43-1.) The motion will be denied, insofar as it is directed to those paragraphs, for the reasons set forth above. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="151" id="pa151"> In addition, it seeks to strike numerous additional paragraphs (17, 39, 53, 56, 59, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 166-73, 176, and 179) of the FAC. Regarding these paragraphs, USA Fencing contends that the following categories of information are irrelevant or unduly prejudicial and should be stricken: (1) allegations regarding USA Fencing's annual revenues and the availability of insurance; (2) references to awards issued to MCFC or Piraino after Jane Doe joined MCFC; (3) references to Piraino's being USA Fencing's agent; (4) references to a duty owed to John Doe and Judy Doe, for purposes of the plaintiffs' negligence claim;<a note-disclosure="19" href="#N304EE"></a> (5) references to a 2022 USA Fencing survey; (6) references to a December 2022 USOC Audit Letter raising concerns about USA Fencing's process for handling complaints; (7) references to USA Fencing management changes and Board of Director meetings subsequent to Piraino's arrest; and (8) allegations about USA Fencing's complaint process or the plaintiffs' reporting of Piraino to law enforcement. The plaintiffs respond that USA Fencing cannot show that it is prejudiced by any of the challenged material and that the material is relevant and not scandalous or impertinent.  </p><div note-container="19" id="N304EE"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="152" id="pa152"> The court notes that USA Fencing did not actually move to dismiss the parents' negligence claim except on statute of limitations grounds and on the basis that the parents seek damages to which they are not entitled. To the extent USA Fencing is seeking to use its Motion to Strike as a substitute for a motion to dismiss, the court rejects the attempt.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="153" id="pa153"> Many of USA Fencing's objections are based on their contention that the allegations amount to legal conclusions or are unsupportable. (<i>See, e.g.</i>, Doc. No. 43, at 11 (disputing whether Piraino acted as USA Fencing's agent); <i>Id.</i> at 12 (disputing whether John Doe and Judy Doe can <span page-number="43" pagination-id="3:22-cv-00560" id="p43"></span> establish that USA Fencing owed them a duty for purposes of a negligence claim).) That is not a valid basis for striking material from a pleading. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="154" id="pa154"> The remaining challenged material is at least tangentially relevant, and none of it is scandalous or impertinent to the degree contemplated by <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/title-iii-pleadings-and-motions/rule-12-defenses-and-objections-when-and-how-presented-motion-for-judgment-on-the-pleadings-consolidating-motions-waiving-defenses-pretrial-hearing" class="raw-ref">Rule 12(f)</a>. Moreover, USA Fencing has not shown that the challenged allegations are actually prejudicial. Regarding USA Fencing's annual revenues, as the plaintiffs point out, the information is public, posted on USA Fencing's website. Regarding insurance, the plaintiffs posit that this information is not made for the purpose of showing that USA Fencing is insured, but because USA Fencing represents to the public on its website that its coaches are insured. Likewise USA Fencing published the results of a 2022 survey of its membership as well as the results of the audit conducted by the USOC and cannot claim to be prejudiced by allegations regarding these documents. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="155" id="pa155"> The court finds no basis for striking any of the material to which USA Fencing objects. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="156" id="pa156"> <b>IV. CONCLUSION</b> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="157" id="pa157"> For the reasons set forth herein, the court will grant in part and deny in part the Motions to Dismiss. (Doc. Nos. 41, 44-1.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="158" id="pa158"> USA Fencing's Motion to Strike (Doc. No. 43-1) will be denied in its entirety, and Piraino and MCFC's Motion to Strike (Doc. No. 41) will be denied, <i>except</i> insofar as it seeks to strike reference to Piraino's 2015 arrest for public intoxication (Doc. No. 36 &para; 66). An appropriate Order is filed herewith. </p> </section><hr> </section></div></div></section><section class="pb-5 container-fluid d-none"><div class="row"><div class="content-header col-12 col-lg-5 offset-lg-2"><div class="slogan text-muted mt-4">Summaries of</div><div class="short-title"><h1 class="mt-2">Doe v.

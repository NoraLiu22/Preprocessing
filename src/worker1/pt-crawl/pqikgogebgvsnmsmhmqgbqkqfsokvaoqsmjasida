<P 
CLASS="Ep2"><B>Diogenes 
Laertius, <I>Lives of Philosophers,</I> X.26: </B>Epicurus was quite a 
prolific author, surpassing all in the quantity of books produced.&nbsp; 
He authored, in fact, some three hundred books, and he never cited any 
other authors – all the words contained in them were Epicurus’ own.&nbsp; 
Chrysippus tried to match his vast literary output, but Carneades 
denounced him as a literary parasite: "Indeed, if Epicurus had written 
something, Chrysippus would vie to write just as much.&nbsp; To accomplish 
this, he wrote down whatever popped into his head and often repeated 
himself.&nbsp; In his haste, he neglected to do any editing, and he used 
many lengthy citations to the point of filling his entire books with them, 
not unlike Zeno and Aristotle."&nbsp; <A name=dlx27></A>Among the writings 
of Epicurus, the following are his best:

<P align=justify><B>Diogenes Laertius, <I>Lives of Philosophers, </I>I.16 
(Prologue): </B>Many books were written by Zeno, even more by Xenophanes, 
even more by Democritus, even more by Aristotle, even more by Epicurus, 
and even more by Chrysippus.
<P align=justify><B>Diogenes Laertius, <I>Lives of Philosophers, 
</I>VII.181 (Chrysippus): </B>Apollodorus of Athens, in his "Collection of 
Philosophical Doctrines," wanting to show that the works of Epicurus 
(written by his own efforts rather than propped up with citations) were 
infinitely more numerous than those of Chrysippus, said in the precise 
terms, "Indeed if one were to remove from Chrysippus’ books all the 
citations taken from elsewhere, nothing but a blank page would 
remain."
<P align=justify><B><I>Suda, </I>"Epicurus" {epsilon-2404}:</B> His 
writings, in sum, are numerous.
<P align=justify><B>Arrian, <I>Diatribes of Epictetus, </I>I.20.19: 
</B>Why, Epicurus, do you even light a lamp and labor for our sake, and 
write so many books?&nbsp; <B><I>Ibid,</I> II.20.9: </B>Dear fellow, why 
do you bother yourself about us?&nbsp; Why do you keep up a vigil on our 
account, for which you light a lamp?&nbsp; Why do you get up?&nbsp; Why do 
you write so many big books?&nbsp; Is it to keep one or another of us from 
being tricked into believing that the gods care for men, or is it to keep 
one or another of us from supposing that the nature of good is other than 
pleasure?&nbsp; If this is indeed so, then back to your bed and go to 
sleep!
<P align=justify><B>Seneca, <I>Letters to Lucilius,</I> 46.1: </B>I 
received your book that you had promised me... how well I find it written, 
you can know this much: it strikes me as light and elegant, though bulkier 
than we are accustomed to, so that at first glance it seems to resemble 
Livy or Epicurus.&nbsp; However, it caught and charmed me so much that I 
read it from beginning to end in one sitting.
<P 
CLASS="Ep2"><B>Plutarch, 
<I>Is "Live Unknown" a Wise Precept?</I> 3, p. 1129A: </B>{Rhetorically 
addressing Epicurus} Don’t send books everywhere to advertise your wisdom 
to every man and woman ...&nbsp; What sense is there in so many tens of 
thousands of lines honoring Metrodorus, Aristobulus, and Chaeredemus, and 
published with so much industry that they cannot remain unknown even after 
they’re dead?&nbsp; Who are you to call for the obliteration of virtue, 
the uselessness of skills, silence to philosophy, and forgetfulness of 
good deeds?
<P style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in" align=justify><B>Cicero, 
<I>Tusculan Disputations,</I> II.3.8:</B> Everyone, even those who do not 
accept their teaching or are not enthusiastic disciples, reads Plato and 
the rest of the Socratic school and after them their followers, while 
scarcely anyone beyond their own adherents takes up the works of Epicurus 
and Metrodorus.<B></B>

<BR><BR><H2>On the Language and Style of Epicurus</H2>

<P align=justify><B>Diogenes Laertius, <I>Lives of Philosophers,</I> 
X.13:</B> He uses plain language in his works throughout, which is 
unusual, and Aristophanes, the grammarian, reproaches him for it. He was 
so intent on clarity that even in his treatise <I>On Rhetoric</I>, he 
didn’t bother demanding anything else but clarity.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</I> I.5.14, 
(Torquatus to Cicero): </B>"I think that you, like our friend Triarius, 
are displeased with Epicurus because he neglected the rhetorical 
embellishments of Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus. I find it hard 
indeed to figure out why you think his opinions untrue." <B>(Cicero to 
Torquatus): </B>"You will see, Torquatus," said I, "how mistaken you are. 
I am not annoyed by this philosopher’s style. He is straightforward, 
expressing simple and plain concepts in a way that is easy to understand; 
though I do not despise eloquence in a philosopher either – but if he 
doesn’t have it, I do not insist on it.&nbsp; It’s in the contents where 
he does not satisfy me, and in many places."
<P align=justify><B>Aulus Gellius, <I>Attic Nights</I>, II.9.4: 
</B>&nbsp;In the same book {Book II of the <I>Essays On Homer</I>}, 
Plutarch finds fault again with Epicurus for using an inappropriate word 
and giving it an incorrect meaning. Now Epicurus wrote as follows: "The 
pinnacle of pleasure is the removal of everything that pains." Plutarch 
declares that he ought not have said "of everything that pains," but "of 
everything that is painful;" for it is the removal of pain, he explains, 
that should be indicated, not of that which causes pain. In bringing this 
charge against Epicurus, Plutarch is "word-chasing" with excessive 
nit-picking and almost with frigidity; for rather than hunting up such 
verbal meticulousness and such refinements of diction, Epicurus hunts them 
down {implying that Epicurus deliberately eliminates them}.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</I> II.4.12: 
</B>You Epicureans frequently tell us we do not correctly understand what 
pleasure might be which Epicurus refers to...&nbsp; <B>Ibid. II.5.15 
</B>&nbsp;Nevertheless, supposing that I don’t understand Epicurus’ 
intended meaning... then he himself might possibly be at fault, for 
speaking in such a way that defies understanding.&nbsp; Obscurity may be 
excused for two reasons: it might be intentional, like with Heraclitus... 
or it may reflect the difficulty of the material, rather than the 
rhetoric, as, for example, in Plato’s <I>Timaeus</I>.&nbsp; But Epicurus, 
as far as I can tell, neither refuses to speak in a simple and explicit 
manner whenever he can, nor does he speak here about an obscure subject, 
such as physics, or an artificial and technical subject, like 
mathematics.&nbsp; Pleasure is an easy topic that everyone can relate 
to.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On The Nature of The Gods,</I> I.31.85 
(Cotta speaking): </B>Regarding the formulation of this maxim {Epicurus’ 
<A href="../old/diogenes10c.html#e31">first Principal 
Doctrine</A>}, there are those who think that this simple man was 
deliberately vague, when in fact the ambiguity arose from his inability to 
express himself plainly.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</I> II.6.18: 
</B>Epicurus, by despising the dialectic, which encompasses the whole 
science of discovering the nature of things, judging their qualities, and 
how to do it with methodic rationality, stumbles, I say.&nbsp; He fails to 
even half-way distinguish what he desires to convey. <B><I>Ibid, 
</I>II.9.27: </B>Epicurus despises expressive eloquence; he speaks in 
confused manner.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On Divination,</I> II.50.18: </B>Epicurus, 
whom the Stoics usually describe as stupid and crude...

<P align=justify><B><A name=cleomedes></A>Cleomedes, 
<I>Lectures on Astronomy, </I>II.1 [p. 112 Bak.] {p. 489 Bowen and 
Todd}:</B> Epicurus claims that he alone has found the truth through his 
vast wisdom and knowledge, and so thinks it right that he should also take 
first prize.&nbsp; That is why I would believe it to be quite wrong for 
someone to say to <I>him</I>: "Babbling Thersites, clear orator though you 
are, hold off!" {Homer, <I>Iliad</I> 2.246-247}.&nbsp; For I would not 
also call <I>this</I> Thersites "clear," as Odysseus does the Homeric one, 
when on top of everything else his mode of expression is also elaborately 
corrupt.&nbsp; He speaks of "tranquil conditions of flesh" and "the 
confident expectations regarding it" and describes a tear as a "glistening 
of the eyes," and speaks of &nbsp;"sacred ululations" and "titillations of 
the body" and "debaucheries" and other such dreadful horrors.&nbsp; Some 
of these expressions might be said to have brothels as their source, 
others to resemble the language of women celebrating the rites of Demeter 
at the Thesmorphoria, still others to come from the synagogue and its 
suppliants <SPAN CLASS="Ep1">– 
</SPAN>debased Jew talk, far lower than the reptiles!
<P align=justify><B>Sextus Empiricus, <I>Against the Professors,</I> I.1: 
</B>In his ignorance, Epicurus is subject to blame in many respects; even 
in ordinary conversation his speech was not correct.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On The Nature of The 
Gods,</I> II.17.46 (Balbus speaking):</B>&nbsp;Epicurus may make a joke of 
this if he likes, although humor was never his strong point <SPAN

<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On The Nature of The Gods,</I> I.44.123 
(Cotta speaking): </B>Epicurus himself wrote a book on the sanctity of the 
gods.&nbsp; In this book the reader is fooled by a man who wrote not so 
much with irony as with wild abandon!
<P align=justify><B><A name=dionysius></A>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 
<I>On the Composition of Words</I>, 24, p. 188: </B>I ask for the 
indulgence of the Epicurean company, who have no regard for these 
things.&nbsp; The dictum that "writing presents no difficulties to those 
who do not aim at a constantly changing standard," which Epicurus himself 
propounded, was intended as a talisman to ward off the charge of extreme 
sloth and stupidity.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>Brutus,</I> I.44.123: </B>Titus Albucius 
grew up in Athens and left there a perfect Epicurean, typically lacking 
the capacity for eloquence.

causes as well.&nbsp; For in <I>On Lifecourses</I> he says that to pray is 
natural for us, not because the gods would be hostile if we did not pray, 
but in order that, according to the understanding of beings surpassing in 
power and excellence, we may realize our fulfillments and social 
conformity with the laws.

</B>Thus, the philosophy of Epicurus is subdivided into three parts: 
Canonics, Physics, and Ethics.&nbsp; Canonics forms the introduction to 
the system and is contained in a single work entitled <I>The Canon</I>.
<P align=justify><B><I>Ibid.,</I> X.14: </B>Ariston {of Alexandria} says 
in his <I>Life of Epicurus</I> that he derived his work entitled <I>The 
Canon</I> from the <I>Tripod </I>of Nausiphanes, adding that Epicurus had 
been a pupil of this man as well as of the Platonist Pamphilus in Samos.

well-established scientific system, observing the <I>standard</I> or 
<I>Canon </I>that has fallen as it were from heaven, so that all men may 
know it – only by making that Canon the test of all our judgments, that we 
can hope always to stand fast in our belief, unshaken by the eloquence of 
any man.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On the Nature of the Gods,</I> I.16.43 
(Velleius speaking): </B>What race of men or nation is there which does 
not have some untaught apprehension of the gods?&nbsp; Such an innate idea 
Epicurus calls <I>prolepsis,</I> that is to say, a certain form of 
knowledge which is inborn in the mind and without which there can be no 
other knowledge, not rational thought or argument.&nbsp; The force and 
value of this doctrine we can see from his own inspired work on <I>The 
Canon</I>.

the Epicureans generally make perceptions of mental presentations to be 
also standards.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; Every sensation, he says, is devoid of 
reason and incapable of memory; for neither is it self-caused nor regarded 
as having an external cause, can it add anything thereto or take anything 
therefrom.&nbsp; Nor is there anything which can refute sensations or 
convict them of error: one sensation cannot convict another and kindred 
sensation, for they are equally valid; nor can one sensation refute 
another which is not kindred but heterogeneous, for the objects which the 
two senses judge are not the same; nor again can reason refute them, for 
reason is wholly dependent on sensation; nor can one sense refute another, 
since we pay equal heed to all.&nbsp; And the reality of separate 
perceptions guarantees the truth of our senses.&nbsp; But seeing&nbsp; and 
hearing are just as real as feeling pain.&nbsp; Hence it is from plain 
facts that we must start when we draw inferences about the 
unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp; For all our notions are derived from perceptions, 
either by actual contact or by analogy, or resemblance, or composition, 
with some slight aid from reasoning.&nbsp; And the objects presented to

feaster at least offering libations ... all of which Plato also retains in 
his symposium.&nbsp; But with Epicurus there is no libation, no 
preliminary offering to the gods; on the contrary, it is like what 
Simonides says of the lawless woman: "Oftentimes she eats up the offerings

particular amount produces heat for a particular body in a particular

For in an aggregate such as wine there are also certain natural substances

not even possess the property of heating or cooling as it enters the 
body.&nbsp; Rather, the bodily mass is so set in motion that the corpuscle 
shift their position: the heat-producing atoms are at one time 
concentrated, becoming numerous enough to impart warmth and heat to the

Talk,</I> III 6, 1, p. 653B: </SPAN></B><SPAN 
CLASS="Ep1">Certain young men 
with no long experience in the ancient literature were attacking Epicurus 
on the ground that he had introduced in his <I>Symposium</I> an unseemly 
and unnecessary discussion about the proper time for coition.&nbsp; For an 
older man to talk about sex in the presence of youths at a dinner-party 
and weigh the pros and cons of whether one should make love before dinner 
or after dinner was, they claimed, the extreme of indecency.&nbsp; At 
this, some of our company brought up Xenophon, who, so to speak, took his 
guests home after dinner, not on foot, but on horseback, to make love to 
their wives.&nbsp; And Zopyrus the physician, who was very well acquainted 
with the works of Epicurus, added that they had not read Epicurus’ 
<I>Symposium</I> with attention; for Epicurus did not propose the problem 
as one involving a principle or a settled procedure and then proceed with 
his discussion of it; but he took the young men for a walk after dinner, 
conversed with them for the purpose of moral instruction, and restrained 
them from their lust on the ground that intercourse is always precarious 
and harmful, and affects worse those who engage in it when the have been 
eating and drinking.&nbsp; "Indeed," said he {Zopyrus}, "even if 
intercourse were the chief topic of his inquiry, would it be to the 
philosopher’s credit to have refrained entirely from all consideration of 
the right time and hour for coition?&nbsp; Would it not be better for him 
to engage, at the proper moment, in rational discussion of such 
matters?&nbsp; And would it be to his credit that he consider this stage 
of his discussion not inappropriate to any occasion except drinking and 
dining, and there shameful?"...&nbsp; This put the young men out of 
countenance, and they sat in silence.&nbsp; The rest of the company asked 
Zopyrus to give them an account of what Epicurus had to say about this 
matter, and he replied that he did not remember the particulars 
accurately, but thought that the man feared the afflictions resulting from 
coition, due to the disturbance caused by our bodies entering into the 
tumult and turmoil of such activity.&nbsp; For wine is generally a 
brawler, an instigator of tumult, and unsettles our body from its base; 
and if tranquility and sleep do not take possession of our body when it is 
in this condition, but the new disturbances of coition supervene, the 
forces which naturally tie together and cement the body are crushed and 
dislodged, and there is danger that the body be unseated, like a house 
shifted from its foundations – for the seed does not flow easily at this 
time, repletion blocking it, but with effort it is extracted in a clotted 
mass.&nbsp; Consequently our man says that we must engage in such activity 
when the body is quiet and ended are the assimilations and fluxes of the 
nourishment which traverses and quits the body, and must do so before the 
body is again in need of further nourishment. <B>654B:</B> Let us 
consider, if you will, whether it is proper and fitting, or contrary to 
all justice, for Epicurus to deprive Aphrodite of night ... <B>655A:</B> 
Surely the body would not suffer greater harm by coition after dinner, as 
Epicurus thinks it does, provided a man does not make love when he is 
over-burdened, drunk or stuffed full to the point of bursting.&nbsp; For 
of course, if that is the case, the thing is precarious and harmful.&nbsp; 
But if a man is sufficiently himself and moderately relaxed, his body at 
ease and his spirit disposed and if then after an interval he makes love, 
he neither causes his body great disturbance, nor does he bring on any 
morbid excitement or unsettling of atoms, as Epicurus claims.</SPAN>

<P align=justify><B>Athenaeus, <I>Deipnosophists, </I>VII p. 280A:

<P align=justify><B>Athenaeus, <I>Deipnosophists, </I>VII p. 278F:</B> For 
Epicurus does not speak with face muffled, but in a loud voice he 
declares: "As for myself, I cannot conceive of the good if exclude the

<P align=justify><B>Diogenes Laertius, <I>Lives of Philosophers,</I> X.6: 
</B>It is observed too that in his treatise <I>On the End-Goal,</I> he 
writes in these terms: "I know not how to conceive the good, apart from 
the pleasures of taste, sexual pleasures, the pleasures of sound, and the 
pleasures of beautiful form." 
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>Tusculan Disputations,</I> III.18.41:</B> 
Why do we shirk the question, Epicurus, and why do we not confess that we 
mean by pleasure what you habitually say it is, when you have thrown off 
all sense of shame?&nbsp; Are these your words or not?&nbsp; For instance, 
in that book which embraces all your teaching (for I shall now play the 
part of translator, so no one may think I am inventing) you say this: "For 
my part I find no meaning which I can attach to what is termed good, if I 
take away from it the pleasures obtained by taste, if I take away the 
pleasures which come from listening to music, if I take away too the charm 
derived by the eyes from the sight of figures in movement, or other 
pleasures by any of the senses in the whole man.&nbsp; Nor indeed is it 
possible to make such a statement as this – that it is joy of the mind 
which is alone to be reckoned as a good; for I understand by a mind in a 
state of joy, that it is so, when it has the hope of all the pleasures I 
have named – that is to say the hope that nature will be free to enjoy 
them without any blending of pain."&nbsp; And this much he says in the 
words I have quoted, so that anyone you please may realize what Epicurus 
understands by pleasure.
<P align=justify><B><I>Ibid.,</I> III.20.46: </B>For he 
has not only used the term pleasure, but stated clearly what he meant by 
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Taste," he says, "and embraces and spectacles and music 
and the shapes of objects fitted to give a pleasant impression to the 
eyes," 
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</I> II.3.7 
(Torquatus to Cicero): </B>"Does not Epicurus recognize pleasure in your 
sense?" <B>(Cicero):</B> "Not always," said I,&nbsp; "now and then, I 
admit, he recognizes it only too fully, for he solemnly avows that he 
cannot even understand what good there can be or where it can be found, 
apart form that which is derived from food and drink, the delight of the 
ears, and the grosser forms of gratification.&nbsp; Do I misrepresent his 
words?" <B><I>Ibid.,</I> II.7.20:</B> In a number of passages where he is 
commending that real pleasure which all of us call by the same name, he 
goes so far as to say that he cannot even imagine any Good that is not 
connected with pleasure of the kind intended by Aristippus.&nbsp; Such is 
the language that he uses in the lecture dealing solely with the topic of 
the Chief Good. <B>&nbsp;II.8.23:</B>&nbsp; Men of taste and refinement, 
with first-rate chefs...&nbsp; the accompaniment of dramatic performances 
and their usual sequel <SPAN 
CLASS="Ep1">&nbsp;– </SPAN>these 
are pleasures without which Epicurus, as he loudly proclaims, does not 
know what Good is.&nbsp; <B>II.10.29:</B>&nbsp; But fancy his failing to 
see how strong a proof it is that the sort of pleasure, without which he 
declares he has no idea at all what Good means (and he defines it in 
detail as the pleasure of the palate, of the ears, and subjoins the other 
kinds of pleasure, which cannot be specified without an apology). 
<B>&nbsp;I.10.30:</B> the <I>kinetic</I> sort of pleasure ... he extols it 
so much that he tells us he is incapable even of imagining what other good 
there can be.<B>&nbsp; II.20:64:</B>&nbsp; ... Nor did he forgo those 
other indulgences in the absence of which Epicurus declares that he cannot 
understand what good is.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On The Nature of The Gods,</I> I.40.111 
(Cotta speaking):</B>&nbsp; Your school recognizes no pleasure of the mind 
which does not have its beginning and end in the physical body.&nbsp; I 
take it that you, Velleius, are not like the rest of our Epicureans, who 
are ashamed of those sayings of Epicurus in which he states that he does 
not understand how there can be anything good except sensual and sexual 
pleasures.&nbsp; And he then goes on quite unashamed to enumerate these 
pleasures one by one.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>Against Lucius Calpurnius 
Piso,</I> 28.69:</B> {Piso} would have it that Epicurus was an eloquent 
fellow; and indeed he does, I believe, assert that he cannot conceive any

reduced, to take refuge in the "painlessness" and the "stable condition of 
the flesh," supposing that the pleasurable life is found in thinking of 
this state as about to occur in people or as being achieved; for the 
"stable and settled condition of the flesh," and the&nbsp; "trustworthy 
expectation" of this condition contain, they say, the highest and the most 
assured delight for men who are able to reflect.&nbsp; Now to begin with, 
observe their conduct here, how they keep decanting this "pleasure" or 
"painlessness" or "stable condition" of theirs back and forth, from body 
to mind and then once more from mind to body.

often," he says, "asked men who were called wise what content could be 
left in a good, if they took away the advantages named, unless it were to 
be supposed that it was their wish to utter sentences destitute of 
meaning; I have been able to learn nothing form these men; if they choose 
to go on babbling about ‘virtues’ or ‘wisdoms’ they will mean nothing but 
the way in which the pleasures I have named are brought about."&nbsp; What 
follows is to the same effect, and the whole book, which deals with the 
highest good, is packed with words and sentiments of similar character.
<P align=justify><B>Cicero, <I>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</I> 
II.15.48:</B> Your Epicurus tells us that he is utterly at a loss to know

make it the measure of the <I>chief good.</I>&nbsp; For if <I>morality</I> 
be the standard to which all things are referred, while yet they will not 
allow that pleasure forms any part of it, he declares that they are 
uttering sounds devoid of sense (those are his actual words), and that he 
has no notion or perception whatsoever of any meaning that this term 
<I>morality </I>can have attached to it.&nbsp; In common parlance, moral 
(honorable) means merely that which ranks high in popular esteem.&nbsp; 
And popular esteem, says Epicurus, though often in itself more agreeable 
than certain forms of pleasure, is yet desired simply as a means to 
pleasure.

his inheritance he entered the army, and on meeting with poor success in

says, Plato opened his school, and Aristotle went so far as to hazard 
himself there, and attended the lectures, being no dullard, and gradually 
assumed the contemplative habit.&nbsp; I am aware, too, that Epicurus is 
the only one that has said these things against him, and not Eubulides as 
well; nor has Cephisodorus, even, ventured to say that kind of thing

occupied himself selling drugs, and finally, when Plato opened his school

<P align=justify><B>Seneca, <I>Letters to Lucilius,</I> 52.3:</B> Epicurus 
remarks that certain men have worked their way to the truth without 
anyone’s assistance, carving out their own passage. And he gives special 
praise to these, for their impulse has come from within, and they have 
forged to the front by themselves. Again, he says, there are others who 
need outside help, who will not proceed unless someone leads the way, but 
who will follow faithfully. Of these, he says, Metrodorus was one; this 
type of man is also excellent, but belongs to the second grade. We 
ourselves are not of that first class, either; we shall be well-regarded 
if we are admitted into the second. Nor need you despise a man who can 
gain salvation only with the assistance of another; the will to be saved 
means a great deal, too.&nbsp; You will find still another class of man

forced and driven into righteousness, who do not need a guide as much as 
they require someone to encourage and, as it were, to force them along. 
This is the third variety. If you ask me for a man of this pattern also, 
Epicurus tells us that Hermarchus was such. And of the two last-named 
classes, he is more ready to congratulate the one, but he feels more 
respect for the other; for although both have reached the same goal, it is 
a greater credit to have brought about the same result with the more 
difficult material upon which to work.

it is stated by Epicurus in his letters.

<P align=justify><B>Seneca, <I>Letters to Lucilius,</I> 8.7:&nbsp; </B>I 
am still culling through the pages of Epicurus.&nbsp; I read today, in his 
works, the following maxim: <SPAN 
CLASS="Ep1">"</SPAN>To win real 
freedom, you must be the slave of Philosophy.<SPAN 
CLASS="Ep1">"</SPAN>&nbsp; The 
man who submits and surrenders himself to her is not kept waiting; he is 
emancipated on the spot. For the very service of Philosophy is 
freedom.&nbsp; It is likely that you will ask me why I quote so many of 
Epicurus’ noble words instead of words taken from our own {Stoic} school. 
But is there any reason why you should regard them as sayings of Epicurus 
and not common property?

<P align=justify><B>Porphyry, <I>Letter to Marcella,</I> 30, [p. 209, 7 
Nauck]: </B><SPAN CLASS="Ep1">Do 
not think it unnatural that when the flesh cries out for anything, the 
soul should cry out too.&nbsp; The cry of the flesh is, "Let me not 
hunger, or thirst, or shiver," and it’s hard for the soul to restrain 
these desires.&nbsp; And while it is difficult for the soul to prevent 
these things, it is dangerous to neglect nature which daily proclaims 
self-sufficiency to the soul via the flesh which is intimately bonded to 
it.</SPAN>
<P align=justify><B>Seneca, <I>Letters to Lucilius,</I> 4.10: </B>Let me 
share with you a saying which pleased me today.&nbsp; It, too, is culled 
from another man’s Garden:&nbsp; <SPAN 
CLASS="Ep1">"</SPAN>Poverty, 
brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth.<SPAN 
CLASS="Ep1">"</SPAN>&nbsp; Do 
you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us?&nbsp; Merely to 
avert hunger, thirst, and cold.

<P align=justify><B>Cf. Cicero, <I>Tusculan Disputations,</I> V.35.102: 
</B>Time would fail me should I wish to carry on about the cause of 
poverty; for the matter is evident and nature herself teaches us daily how 
few and how small her needs are, and how cheaply satisfied.

world is not strong enough to give the soul a worthy release from 
disturbance, but the trouble of the flesh is removed by very moderate, 
ordinary things which are very easy to get. And if even things on this 
level fall short, that does not disturb the person who rehearses death.

"We need to set our affections on some good man and keep him constantly 
before our eyes, so that we may live as if he were watching us and do 
everything as if he saw what we were doing."&nbsp; This, my dear Lucilius, 
is Epicurus’ advice, and in giving it he has given us a guardian and a

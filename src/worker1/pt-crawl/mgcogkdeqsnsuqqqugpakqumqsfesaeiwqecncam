      <p><a href="https://yarncommunity.org/" target="_blank"><strong>The Yarn Project </strong></a>is a Leeds University Project and <em>&quot;The Friends of Ossett Library&quot;</em>, with support from Wakefield Library Service, will be participating in a new phase starting in February 2017. </p>
      <p>The project will enable Ossett people to tell everybody about the history, heritage and community of Ossett and Gawthorpe and hopefully show what a great place it is to live, work, have a business or be educated in. We hope schools, Civic/Trade organisations, social and sporting clubs, etc. and individuals will participate. </p>
      <p>Contributions will be written works, illustrated with images already to be found on the Internet - don't worry if you are not good with computers, we will get someone to do the technical work for you. The work will be by way of essay, article, researched work, poem (which may even be in rap), etc. It is the story that is important and not the literary merit. </p>
      <p>You can write about any subject so long as there is a an Ossett or Gawthorpe connection. It would be great if people would write about their interests e.g. family or local history, sports clubs, etc. but if you want us to provide some ideas of subjects we would be glad to do so. </p>
      <p>LET US TRY AND GET AS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS AS POSSIBLE IN THE FIRST YEAR!!! If the project is successful we would hope to have a celebratory event for all participants in about February 2018. </p>
      <p>IF YOU MAY PARTICIPATE OR NEED ANY MORE INFORMATION - Email ossettarchive@gmail.com or phone Mike Adams on 01924 275644 (sorry -there is security on this phone so you will have to say who is calling) or mobile 07716 997444. </p>
      <p>THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE OSSETT. </p>

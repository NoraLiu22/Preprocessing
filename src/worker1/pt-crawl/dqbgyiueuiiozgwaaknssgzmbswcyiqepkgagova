Therefore, it is not possible tocompare those tests, for instance, with tests conducted in 1932 byBritish Post Office researchers on the same subject. Contrary to theStandard Telephones and Cables tests, the results of the British PostOffice tests were published &#91;7&#93;, and later referred to by,among others, William Aitken in 1939 &#91;8, p. 34&#93; and MichaelWoolley, International Telecommunications Union (ITU) GeneralSecretary, in 1976 &#91;9&#93;. Here is an excerpt of the BritishPost Office study as reported by Aitken (italics added foremphasis):</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">&#171;Recently it was suggested that   the description of Reis' instruments in the Science Museum was   hardly fair to Graham Bell, and the question was discussed by the   Council of The Institution of Electrical Engineers.&#187; As a   result the Post Office experts tested these instruments and   reported that: &#171;When the platinum contacts were so adjusted   as to be microphonic they would act as a fairly satisfactory   microphone.

Hughes later commented on those tests &#91;8, p. 33&#93;(italics added):</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">I was enabled to transmit and receive   perfectly </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>all musical   sounds, and also a few spoken words</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">,   though these were rather uncertain, for at one moment a word could   be clearly heard, and then from some unexplained cause no words   were possible. This wonderful instrument was based upon the true   theory of telephony, and it contained all the necessary organs to   make it a practical success . . . . I also believe that the often   successful transmission of words by Prof. Reis' transmitter was   due to an </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>accidental   adjustment of his contacts to a true microphonic   condition</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;In more recent times, Prof. Bernard S.Finn, Curator of the Division of Electricity and Modern Physics ofthe National Museum of American History (Smithsonian Institution) inWashington, D.

Instead, the   pressure of the former on the latter will fluctuate with the   sound, causing fluctuations in the electrical resistance and   therefore in the current. Similarly, the receiver will respond to   continuously fluctuating as well as to intermittent currents   (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>but not by   magnetostriction</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">).   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>The sensitivity,   however, is extremely low</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, so low   that it is not unreasonable to question the validity of the   limited testimony regarding successful voice transmission in the   1860s.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;In other words, the ability of Reis'telephone transmitter to transmit speech with acceptable quality,though at a much lower level, was quite known both before and afterthe aforesaid Standard Telephone and Cable tests. As for Reis'telephone receiver, when operated by magnetostriction-- that is, onthe principle on which it was designed and intended to operate -- ithad inherent limitations that prevented its use for speechtransmission, and was marginally acceptable for the mere transmissionof tones. For this reason, the above experimenters generally used aregular electromagnetic receiver to evaluate the "microphonic"performance of the Reis transmitter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Other authors, among them Silvanus P. Thompson-- considered to be the utmost Reis biographer and supporter -- havegone so far as to state that Reis transmitter was "fundamentallysimilar" to the carbon microphones later patented by Thomas Edison,Francis Blake and Emile Berliner.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Let us now delve a little more into the birthand development of the Reis' <I>Telephon</I>.</FONT></P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial">Invention and Development of the Reis<I>Telephon</I></FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It has been said justly that the telephone isthe son of the telegraph. The success of this great precursor was sooverwhelming and so escalating that many inventors began to wonderwhat else could they do by applying the same marvelous principle ofthe telegraph, namely the "make-and-break" of the electric current totransmit other types of signals, such as music or speech.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is recognized unanimously that the first toenvisage speech transmission by such a technique was the FrenchCharles Bourseul who, on August 18, 1854, sent a letter to theParisian journal <I>L'Illustration</I> &#91;11&#93;, in which hestated ( italics added):</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">I have asked myself . . . . if the   spoken word itself could not be transmitted by electricity. . . .   The thing is practicable in this way:--<BR>   . . . . Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disk,   sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice;   that this disk </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>alternately   makes and breaks the connection with a   battery</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">; you may have at a distance   another disk which will simultaneously execute the same   vibrations. It is true that </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>the   intensity of the sounds produced will be variable at the point of   departure</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">, at which the disk   vibrates by means of the voice, </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>and   constant at the point of arrival</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">,   where it vibrates by means of electricity; but it has been shown   that this does not change the sounds. It is, moreover, evident   that the sounds will be reproduced at the same pitch. The present   state of acoustic science does not permit us to declare a priori   if this will be precisely the case with syllables uttered by the   human voice. . . . However this may be, observe that the syllables   can only reproduce upon the sense of hearing the vibrations of the   intervening medium. Reproduce precisely these vibrations, and you   will reproduce precisely these syllables.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is no doubt that Charles Bourseul wouldhave gone beyond the mere description of a principle, if he were notdiscouraged by both his managers (he was then working in a telegraphoffice in Paris), and the scientists of the Paris Acad&eacute;mie desSciences, the latter harshly criticized by the editor of<I>L'Illustration</I> &#91;11&#93;. The Paris article was picked upshortly afterward in September 1854 by the German paper<I>Didaskalia</I> of Frankfurt-am-Main &#91;12&#93;. There it appearsto have met with greater appreciation. Many writers (&#91;8, p.17-18&#93;; &#91;13&#93;) reported that Johann Philipp Reis,professor of Physics at the Garnier Institute of Friedrichsdorf, hadread it and decided to embark on a practical realization ofBourseul's ideas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Philipp Reis essentially devised threedifferent models of his <I>Telephon</I>, all of which were based onthe same principle, namely the "make-and-break" of the current in thetransmitter and the "magnetostriction" or "galvanic music" in thereceiver. The latter was first discovered by Prof. Charles GraftonPage in 1837 &#91;14&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Reis built his first telephone model in 1858,four years after Bourseul's paper, as related in detail by SilvanusThompson &#91;15&#93;. The transmitter consisted of an ear-likeacoustic structure, that terminated in a tympanum whose oscillationscaused the make-and break of an electric current through a slenderS-shaped rod glued at one end to the center of the tympanum. Thereceiver consisted of a six-inches long coil, wound on a knittingneedle, similar to that shown in Figure 1 below, but setperpendicularly on top of a violin case, which acted as a soundingboard.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/Reis_2.jpg" WIDTH=499 HEIGHT=435 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=1 ALIGN=bottom><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Figure 1.

This time the transmitter (Figure 2) consisted of ahollow conical cavity bored in a block of wood which terminated in ananimal membrane upon which was glued a thin strip of platinum thatconnected to one pole of the battery. Another thin strip of metal,holding at a right angle a platinum wire, was placed in such a manneras to have the end of the wire very near but not touching the otherstrip at the center of the membrane, in order to make-and-break thecurrent according to the pressure of the sounds channeled into thecone. The screw (<I>h</I> in Figure 2) served to adjust the distancebetween the aforesaid platinum wire and the strip glued on themembrane.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="immagini/Reis_3.jpg" WIDTH=374 HEIGHT=252 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000">Figure 2.

The operator put his ear on top of the woodcover (which was normally closed) for better reception of thesounds.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A variation of Reis' secondmodel was built in the second half of 1862 by Wilhelm von Legat,inspector of the Royal Prussian Telegraphs, on the basis ofinformation gathered from the available literature &#91;18&#93;. Someauthors consider this one to be Reis's third model, whileothers--more appropriately--refer to it as "Reis-Legat" model.Legat's transmitter differed from Reis' second transmitter in that heused an hollow conical tube (instead of a hollow bored into a blockof wood), and the make-and-break device resembled more Reis' firstmodel's S-shaped rod, held in place by a spring. Although Legat basedhis receiver on magnetostriction, it differed quite substantially inconstruction from Reis' first and second receiver models. It utilizeda horseshoe electromagnet (featuring an iron core much larger indiameter than the Reis's knitting needle) placed upon a soundingboard, but equipped additionally with a light armature that was keptin contact with the poles of the electromagnet by means of a springand attached to a plate "suspended in the manner of a pendulum." Thepurpose of this alteration was to improve the communication of thevibrations of the core--caused by magnetostriction--to thesurrounding air.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Philipp Reis continued his experimentsand developed a third model of his <I>Telephon</I> (Figure 1). Hefirst demonstrated it to the Physical Society in Frankfurt-am-Main onJuly 4, 1863 &#91;20&#93;. The third was the most known and widelyavailable Reis model. It was built initially by J. Wilhelm Albert ofFrankfurt, and later by the Hauck firm of Vienna, and it sold inEurope and the United States at a price of 14 or 21 florins,depending on the finishing. Among the most renowned examples of Reis'third model are:</FONT></P><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">that of the London Science Museum , said to   be the property of the Institution of Electrical   Engineers;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">that bought by William Ladd of London, who   demonstrated it before the British Association for the Advancement   of Science on August 28, 1863 &#91;21&#93;;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">that exhibited by Prof. Clifton on November   10, 1864, before the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society   &#91;22&#93;;</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">that demonstrated by Mr. Shearer, dealer of   the shop "Messrs.

Two lateral faces held, respectively, thespeaking tube and a simplified Morse apparatus, to be used forsignaling. A tripod, clamped at one edge and holding the platinumwire in the middle, replaced the corresponding platinum stripemployed in the first two models. Also, Reis suggested putting a dropof mercury in a small bowl at the center of the tympanum tofacilitate the intermittent contact with the platinumwire.</FONT></P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial">Conclusions</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Reis third model met with an exceptionalsuccess, all over the world.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is worth pointing out that the UnitedStates, in its case against Alexander Graham Bell, cited AntonioMeucci and Philipp Reis as the precursors of the electromagnetictelephone and the variable resistance telephone, respectively&#91;26&#93;. An impressive list of 61 articles concerning Reis'stelephone (plus 5 concerning Bourseul), was appended to the printedversion of the "Deposition of Antonio Meucci" available at the NewYork Public Library. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is also worth recalling that Reis's<I>Telephon</I> was studied, tested and modified by scores ofscientists, including Stephen Yeates, Peter Van der Weyde, thebrothers Cecil and Leonard Wray (&#91;8&#93;, p. 39 et seq.), andSilvanus P. Thompson &#91;26&#93;, to name a few.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Philipp Reis would have improved his<I>Telephon</I> and offered us more creations from his ingeniousmind, if he had not died prematurely on January 14, 1874, just oneweek after his fortieth birthday.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Reis must be admired not only because of hisinventive genius, but also for his generosity and modesty, since hegave his invention to the world. In fact, not only did he not file anapplication for a patent, but he also disclosed all details ofconstruction and operation of his <I>Telephon</I> both orally and inwriting to anyone wishing to know them. In the circular accompanyingthe apparatus sold by W. J. Albert he stated "I am now able to offeran apparatus with which every physicist will succeed in repeatingthese interesting experiments regarding the reproduction of tone atdistant stations." He therefore followed the noble tradition ofphysicists who used to freely exchange knowledge, instruments andideas all over the world, without caring about making money out ofthem.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Very probably because there were no royaltiesto be paid to Philipp Reis or his successors for his invention (aswas the case of Meucci), many competitors of the Bell Company in theUnited States in the 1880s maintained Reis' priority in the inventionof the telephone. They tried to stretch the "make-and-break"transmitter principle into a "loose contact" principle, thence to a"variable pressure" principle, and later to a "variable resistance"principle. Similarly, the Reis receiver as improved by Legat wasgradually transformed to work with a "nonzero" air gap, thusobtaining a regular electromagnetic receiver. Lawyers argued forthese stretched interpretations and claimed that Reis had anticipatedBell, Edison, Blake, and Berliner. In other words they maintainedthat Reis invented everything! God save the physicists from thelawyers (as well as from the physicists who supported the lawyers)!</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Unfortunately, trying to put Reis on a higherpedestal, they ended up damaging his public image, since theyunfairly exposed him to the counterattack of Bell's supporters.Nonetheless, Philipp Reis must remain in our hearts and minds as asuperb man and scientist, deserving an everlasting recognition forhis outstanding contribution to the progress of telecommunications.</FONT></P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial">References</FONT></H2><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial">&#91;</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1&#93;   Liam McDougall, "Official: Bell didn't invent the telephone--'Top   secret' file reveals that businessmen suppressed the identity of   the telephone's real inventor," <I>Sunday Herald Online</I>,   November 23, 2003, </FONT><A HREF="http://www.sundayherald.com/38216"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">http://www.sundayherald.com/38216</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>   &#91;2&#93; "Bell 'did not invent telephone' -- Claims that a   German scientist invented the telephone 15 years before Alexander   Graham Bell are supported by evidence from newly surfaced archive   papers," <I>BBC News Online</I>, </FONT><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr//2/hi/science/nature/3253174.stm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr//2/hi/science/nature/3253174.stm</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">,   1 December, 2003<BR>   &#91;3&#93; Roger Highfield, "Debate over who invented first phone   hushed up for 50 years," <I>The Daily Telegraph of London</I>,   December 1, 2003, available from </FONT><A HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">   upon registration.<BR>   &#91;4&#93; "Who Invented the Telephone?" <I>Antenna</I>, Vol. 16,   No. 2 (April 2004): 14<BR>   &#91;5&#93; Basilio Catania, "Antonio Meucci Revisited,"   <I>Antenna</I>, Vol. 9, No. 1 (November 1996): 4-5<BR>   &#91;6&#93; Basilio Catania,"Truth &amp; Myth &amp; 'Firsts'",   <I>Antenna</I>, Vol. 13, No. 1 (November 2000): 2 &amp; 11<BR>   &#91;7&#93; "The First Telephone," <I>Post Office Electrical   Engineers Journal</I>, Vol. 25 (July 1932): 116-117<BR>   &#91;8&#93; William Aitken, <I>Who invented the telephone?</I>   (London: Blackie and Son Limited, 1939)<BR>   &#91;9&#93; Michael Woolley, "The Telephone, its Invention, and   Development," <I>Telecommunication Journal,</I> Vol. 43   (III/1976): 175-183.<BR>   &#91;10&#93; Bernard S.

More precisely, as the material is magnetized, itexhibits a change in length accompanied by an inverse change in girthand, when demagnetized, it suddenly regains its original shape&#91;1&#93;. The change in shape of the magnet, subsequent tomagnetization or demagnetization occurs very fast, the lag time beingtypically less than 1 microsecond &#91;2&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The figure below, taken from&#91;3&#93;, shows how the orientation of magnetic domains,occasioned by the application of a magnetic field <I>H</I>, provokesthe elongation <I>e</I> of the material. Philipp Reis clearlyexplained this mechanism in his lecture of October 26, 1861 at thePhysical Society in Frankfurt-am-Main &#91;10&#93;: "At each closingof the circuit, the atoms of the iron wire inside the distant spiralare moved away from each other (Pouillet M&uuml;ller, p. 304, Vol.II., fifth edition); on breaking the circuit, these atoms seek toregain their position of equilibrium".</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/magnetostriction.jpg" WIDTH=375 HEIGHT=209 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Orientation ofmagnetic domains caused by magnetization provokes the elongation<I>e</I> of the material &#91;3&#93;</FONT></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In the case of anelectromagnet, magnetostriction occurs each time the coil istraversed by an electric current, upon connection to a battery. Assoon as the connection with the battery is broken, the magnet'slength and girth return normal.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Magnetostriction canbe quantified by the <I>magnetostrictive coefficient</I>,</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Symbol" COLOR="#000000">l</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">,which is the fractional change in length as the magnetization of thematerial increases from zero to the saturation value &#91;4&#93;.Ferromagnetic materials exhibit a positive coefficient, of the orderof 40&#247;50 ppm, that is, the magnet length increases by between1/25,000 and 1/20,000 of its rest value, upon magnetization &#91;1,5&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The magnetostrictiveeffect was first identified in 1842 by James Prescott Joule, whoobserved that a bar of nickel changed in length when it wasmagnetized &#91;1, 4, 6&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">However, prior toJoule's observations, Charles Grafton Page of Salem, MA, haddiscovered, in 1837, that an electromagnet gives forth a sharp sound(often referred to as a "tick," or "click") when it is suddenlymagnetized or demagnetized. Page also noted that "when the contact ismade, the sound is very feeble; when broken it may be heard at two orthree feet distance" &#91;7, 8&#93;. As also noted by A. Graham Bell&#91;9&#93;, "when the circuit upon which it &#91;theelectromagnet&#93; is placed is rapidly made and broken, a successionof explosive noises &#91;clicks&#93; proceeds from the magnet." Theear will therefore perceive a continuous sound similar to a musicalnote, with a pitch depending upon the number of clicks per second.Thence the name of "Galvanic Music" given by Page to the phenomenon.Page gave public demonstrations of his "Galvanic music," and thesewere deemed as kicking off research on the speaking telephone &#91;8,9&#93;.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The frequency of thefree longitudinal vibration of the knitting needle used by Reis inhis receiver affects the frequency response in a regime of forcedoscillations. For this reason, Peter Van der Weyde &#91;11&#93;instead of a knitting needle used a bundle of five knitting needleswith different length--hence with different free longitudinalvibration frequency--thus obtaining a more uniform reproduction ofaudible sounds.</FONT></P><H2><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">References</FONT></H2><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;1&#93;   "Magnetostriction," by Magnetics Group, Department of Physics,   University of Hull, Kingston upon Hull, GB, posted at   </FONT><A HREF="http://www.physics.hull.ac.uk/magnetics/Research/Facilities/Magnetostriction/magnetostriction.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">http://www.physics.hull.ac.uk/magnetics/Research/Facilities/Magnetostriction/magnetostriction.html</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>   &#91;2&#93; Perucca, E.

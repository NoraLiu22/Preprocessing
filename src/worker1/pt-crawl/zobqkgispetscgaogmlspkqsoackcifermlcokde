<H2>All Souls' Day (1997)</H2>

<P>D: Alan Gilsenan<BR>
S: Declan Conlon, Jayne Snow</P>

<P>This film is a blur. Shot in a variety of formats, including Super 8mm
and Super 16mm film, making use of monochromatic tinting and deliberately
keeping its images out of focus, physically; <I>All Soul's Day</I> is a
blur. Likewise its narrative is deliberately fragmented, a <I>Last Year
at Marienbad </I>ish meander through the vagaries of memory and meaning
intended to confound and confuse its audience and draw them in to the heart
of a chilling mystery. A grieving mother interviews the killer of her daughter
in a prison chapel and tries to get to the facts about what really happened.
The story unfolds in between a series of intensely personal revelations
from both characters, intersped with footage of prisoners rehearsing for
a variety stage show with acts including juggling, telling dirty jokes and
singing songs from Hollywood musicals.</P>

<P>But like all confusing objects seen during momentary lapses in visual
integrity, once your vision clears, it is something very simple. <I>All
Soul's Day</I> is a dramatically asinine piece of self-indulgent stylistic
masturbation which is likely to tour the festival circuit to great acclaim.
The sad reality is that it is only difficult to watch because it is boring,
not because it makes demands on the intelligence and intellectual engagement
of the audience.</P>

<P>It's not that it doesn't do what it sets out to do. It successfully investigates
notions of subjectivity and questions our concept of meaning and narrative.
It deliberately sets out to argue that stories are inherently coloured by
the perception of both the storyteller and the listener, and often they
don't mean the same thing to both. It opens with a quote from Oscar Wilde
which tells us &quot;All life is a limitation&quot; (which is also the movie's
advertising blurb). It seems as if conventional cinema has proved a limitation
to Gilsenan, who, having made a series of excellent documentaries, has made
what is obviously an intensely personal film which attempts to push the
boundaries of the medium. It is an attempt to explore the limits of narrative
and psychological subjectivity, a spiritual exorcism of the moral questions
which must be asked of any documentarist in the age of postmodernism.</P>

<P>But while nothing quite like it has been seen on Irish screens, the film
ultimately boils down to a cross between <I>Last Year at Marienbad</I> and
<I>The Vanishing</I>, and its debts to European art-house and <I>avant-garde</I>
cinema are quite considerable. But it isn't as strong or as interesting
as even either of those titles, largely because the script is composed of
a series of dreadfully clich&eacute;d 'meaningful' exchanges, like Bergman
without the clarity. It never manages to surprise or to engage the viewer,
and its insights are generally pithy and adolescent. It often seems like
a student film rather than the work of a mature director.</P>

<P>It is important to any national cinema that it maintains an active <I>avant-garde</I>,
and <I>All Souls' Day</I> is an earnest attempt to contribute to one for
Irish cinema. As such, it deserves recognition and acknowledgement. But
Gilsenan's box of cinematic tricks is ultimately too limited to sustain
a full feature film, and while polite applause is due for the effort, and
no one, least of all me, would deny an artist his chance to express himself,
there is absolutely no reason anyone would need to see this movie.</P>

For my defence, gentlemen of the jury, of Marcus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/f/fonteius.html#2">Fonteius,</A> my contention is that, since the enactment of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Valerius_Flaccus_(consul_86_BC)#Credit_crisis_of_the_80s_BC">Valerian</A> Law, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn1" ID="nr1" TITLE="1">**</A> from his <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaestor">quaestorship</A> until that of Titus Crispinus no one has ever paid otherwise ; I assert that my client followed the example of all his predecessors, while all my client's successors have followed his. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="2">[2]</A> What accusation do you make ? What fault can you find ? For with regard to the prosecutor's statement that in the account-books where the abatements of three-fourths and additions of one-fourth were made, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn2" ID="nr2" TITLE="2">**</A> which he says were established by Hirtuleius, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn3" ID="nr3" TITLE="3">**</A> he finds Fonteius to have failed in his duty, I cannot conclude whether he is himself mistaken, or wishes to lead you, gentlemen, astray. I put it to you, Marcus Plaetorius : can you bring yourself to admit that we have made good our case, if Marcus Fonteius, in that whereof you accuse him, has followed the lead of Hirtuleius in whose praises you are so loud, while in that for which you praise Hirtuleius, Fonteius has done exactly the same? You censure the method of payment; the public account-books prove that Hirtuleius in his payments followed the same method. You praise Hirtuleius for his method of making reductions of three-fourths in the accounts ; Fonteius instituted the same method with regard to the same description of money. For in case you should be so ignorant of the facts as to suppose that those accounts have reference to a quite different species of old-standing debt, I may tell you that they were established for the self-same reason to deal with the self-same description of money. For when to the tax-farmers who had taken out contracts for Africa and the harbour-dues of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aquileia.html#1">Aquileia</A> . . .

No one, no one, I say, gentlemen, will be bold enough to assert that he gave Marcus Fonteius a penny during his <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaestor">quaestorship</A>, or that Fonteius appropriated a penny from the money paid to him on the public account; in no one's books will there be found the slightest hint of such embezzlement, nor among all the items the slightest trace of such misappropriation or deficit. Yet we commonly find that any who are accused under an investigation of this nature are at the outset convicted by witnesses ; for it is almost inconceivable that one who has given money to a magistrate should fail to be induced by resentment, or compelled by scruple, to disclose the fact; and, in the second place, supposing that the witnesses are intimidated by influence, the account-books at any rate remain, and they can neither be corrupted nor tampered with. Let us suppose that Fonteius enjoyed the close friendship of everyone, while all those vast numbers of persons concerned - persons utterly unknown to him and utterly unconnected with him - were anxious not to damage his position, careful of his good name ; yet the facts themselves, the form of the documents, and the way in which the accounts are made up are sufficient to make obvious any forgery, embezzlement, or inaccuracy on either the debit or the credit side. All these persons entered duly monies that they had received on account of the people of Rome ; if they forthwith paid out or advanced to others equally large sums, so that what was received on account of the people of Rome was expended upon some person or other, then it is clear that nothing can have been embezzled. But if some of them took money home with them, from their cash in hand and from their . . .

Why do we not hear what they have to say, and why are none of their accounts brought into court? I ply the prosecutor with earnest insistence, gentlemen; I ply him, I say, and dun him for his witnesses. In the present case I am expending more pains and energy in making the prosecution produce their witnesses than counsel for the defence usually expend in cross-examining them. I say this confidently, gentlemen ; I do not make my assertions without book. Gaul is packed with traders, crammed with Roman citizens. No Gaul ever does business independently of a citizen of Rome ; not a penny changes hands in Gaul without the transaction being recorded in the books of Roman citizens. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="12">[12]</A> Mark my condescension, gentlemen, and how far I am departing from my customary habits of caution and exactitude. Let one single account be produced in which there is a single hint indicating that money has been given to Fonteius; let them bring forward the evidence of one single trader, colonist, tax-farmer, agriculturist, or grazier out of all the inhabitants ; and I will grant that the charge is a true one.

<P> In heaven's name, what a case is this, and how strange a task for defendant's counsel! Marcus Fonteius was in charge of the province of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gaul.html#1">Gaul,</A> which comprises a type of men and communities which (to say nothing of ancient times) have either within our own memory waged long and bitter wars with the people of Rome, or have been quite recently subdued by our generals, subjugated in war, brought to notice by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_triumph">triumphs</A> and memorials of which their conquest has been the occasion, and have lately had their lands and cities made forfeit by the senate ; in some cases they have met in armed encounter with Marcus Fonteius himself, and have, at cost of much strenuous effort to him, been brought beneath the power and dominion of the Roman people. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="13">[13]</A> In this same province is the town of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/narbo.html#1">Narbo</A> Martius, <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn8" ID="nr8" TITLE="8">**</A> a citizen-colony, which stands as a watch-tower and bulwark of the Roman people, and a barrier of defence against these tribes which I have mentioned ; there is also the city of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/massilia.html#1">Massilia,</A> to which I have already alluded, inhabited by brave and faithful allies, who have found in the resources and rewards of the Roman people a recompense for the dangers they have run in our Gallic wars ; there is moreover a large body of highly respected Roman citizens. <A CLASS="green" NAME="c6">[6.]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://www.lateinlex.de/?call=Puc&permalink=Cic_orat_Font_6"> L</A> &nbsp; Of this province with its heterogeneous population Marcus Fonteius, as I said just now, was appointed governor. Those who were our enemies he subdued; those who had recently been so he evicted from the farms they had forfeited ; while from the remainder, who had been repeatedly conquered in great wars to the end that they might be made obedient for ever to the Roman people, he requisitioned large troops of cavalry to serve in the wars then being waged all over the world by the people of Rome, large sums of money to provide these with pay, and enormous quantities of corn to enable us to carry on the war in Spain. <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn9" ID="nr9" TITLE="9">**</A> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="14">[14]</A> The man who accomplished all this is summoned before your bar ; you, who took no part in the events, are, in concert with the Roman people, taking cognisance of the case; our opponents are the men who met these requisitions with the utmost reluctance; they are the men who were evicted from their farms by the decree of Gnaeus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pompeius.html#22">Pompeius</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn10" ID="nr10" TITLE="10">**</A> ; they are the men who, having escaped from war, massacre, and rout, venture for the first time to face Marcus Fonteius now when he is unarmed. And what of the colonists of Narbo? What is their desire, their view in the matter? Their desire is that he should owe his deliverance to you, their view that it is to him they stand indebted for their own. And what of the community of Massilia? While he was with them they conferred upon him the highest distinctions they had to bestow; and now, from their distant abode, they beg and implore you that their sense of honour, their commendation, their influence may appear to have been not without weight in determining your attitude. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="15">[15]</A> And our citizens of Rome, what are their sentiments? No one of that immense body but considers that my client has done signal service to his province, to the empire, to our allies, and to his fellow-citizens.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c7">[7.]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://www.lateinlex.de/?call=Puc&permalink=Cic_orat_Font_7"> L</A> &nbsp; Since, therefore, you now perceive who are they who would have Marcus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/f/fonteius.html#2">Fonteius</A> assailed, and who would have him defended, you must now determine what it is that your sense of justice and the dignity of the Roman people demands - whether you prefer to rely upon the statements and to consult the welfare of your colonists, your trading interests, and your most attached and ancient allies, or of men who by their animosity have forfeited all claim to your trust and by their disloyalty all claim to your respect. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="16">[16]</A> If, furthermore, I can produce a still more numerous array of unimpeachable persons ready and able to attest my client's virtue and innocence, shall none the less the common judgement of Gauls prevail over that of men of the very highest authority ? You are aware, gentlemen, that at the time when Fonteius was governor of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gaul.html#1">Gaul</A> there were in the two <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/spain.html#2">Spains</A> large armies of the Roman people commanded by illustrious generals. How many were the Roman <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equites">knights</A>, how many the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tribune">military tribunes</A>, how many, how frequent, how eminent were the delegations that visited these armies! What is more, a large and splendid army commanded by Gnaeus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pompeius.html#22">Pompeius</A> wintered in Gaul during Marcus Fonteius's tenure of power. Does it not seem that fortune herself designed that there should be witnesses adequate both in quantity and quality ready to attest by personal knowledge what was done in Gaul when Marcus Fonteius was <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetor">praetor</A>? "Who is there of all this body whom you <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn11" ID="nr11" TITLE="11">**</A> can cite as witness in the present trial? Who is there of all this body whom you will accept as an authority? Him we will at once use as our witness and our panegyrist. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="17">[17]</A> And will you have any further misgivings, gentlemen, of the absolute truth of the suggestion I made to you at the outset, that the sole motive behind these proceedings is that, when Marcus Fonteius has been overwhelmed by the evidence of men who deeply resent the requisitions made upon them in the public interest, his successors may hereafter be disinclined to make such requisitions in view of the possibility of attacks being made upon them by men whose victory could result only in the insecurity of the empire of the Roman people ?

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c8">[8.]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://www.lateinlex.de/?call=Puc&permalink=Cic_orat_Font_8"> L</A> &nbsp; It is further alleged against Marcus Fonteius that he has made profits from the construction of roads, exacting a price either for not demanding their construction, or for not condemning those already constructed. If it is a fact that all states were compelled to construct, and also that in many cases the works were condemned, then it is obvious that both charges are false - the charge that exemptions were sold, because no exemptions were given, and the charge that the work was passed, because in several instances it was not passed. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="18">[18]</A> But suppose we should be able to shift this imputation to the account of excellent persons, and that not in order to transfer culpability to others, but to prove that the men in charge of this road-construction are men who are well able to show that their duty was satisfactorily performed ; will you still believe evidence dictated by rancour, and heap all the blame upon Marcus Fonteius? He, finding himself embarrassed by more urgent affairs of state, when it was a matter of state-interest that the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Domitia">Via Domitia</A> should be constructed, entrusted the business to Gaius Annius Bellienus and Gaius Fonteius his lieutenants, men of the highest character. Accordingly they superintended it, giving such orders as seemed to them in their official capacity to be desirable, and expressing their satisfaction with the work. You have had the opportunity of learning this, if from no other source, at any rate from our letters, either sent or received, which you have had written out <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn12" ID="nr12" TITLE="12">**</A> ; and if you have not previously read these, hear me read what Fonteius wrote to his legates in this matter, and what they wrote in reply.

<BR><BR>
<P> { <I>The letters sent to Gaius Annius the legate and to Gaius Fonteius the legate, and those received from Gaius Annius the legate and from Gaius Fonteius the legate, are read.</I> }

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="19">[19]</A> I think it is sufficiently clear, gentlemen, both that this question of the road-construction is no concern of Marcus Fonteius, and also that it was dealt with by men who are quite beyond censure.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c9">[9.]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://www.lateinlex.de/?call=Puc&permalink=Cic_orat_Font_9"> L</A> &nbsp; Let us turn now to the charge with reference to wine, a charge intended by our opponents to be the most important and the most damaging of all. The terms in which the charge has been stated by Plaetorius are as follows : it was not in Gaul that Marcus Fonteius first conceived the idea of imposing a transit-duty <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn13" ID="nr13" TITLE="13">**</A> on wine, but the plan was suggested to him in Italy before he left Rome. Accordingly it is alleged that Titurius exacted at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tolosa.html#1">Tolosa</A> four <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">denarii</A> on every <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphora">amphora</A> of wine under the head of transit-duty ; that at Crodunum Porcius and Munius exacted three <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoriatus">victoriati</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn14" ID="nr14" TITLE="14">**</A> ; while at Vulchalo Servaeus exacted two <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoriatus">victoriati</A>; also that in these districts transit-duty was exacted from any who turned aside at Cobiomachus (a village between Tolosa and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/narbo.html#1">Narbo),</A> not wishing to proceed to Tolosa ; and that at Elesioduli they exacted six <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">denarii</A> on each <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphora">amphora</A> from those who conveyed wine to the enemy. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="20">[20]</A> I realise, gentlemen, that this is a grave charge - grave not only in its actual nature - for it is alleged that a tax has been imposed on our produce, and I admit that vast sums might have been raised by this method - but grave also in the odium it must arouse ; for our enemies have done their best to spread this imputation by common talk as widely as possible. But, in my opinion, the heinousness of the outrage committed by the inventor of a charge which is proved to be false is great in proportion to the gravity of the offence alleged ; for by the very enormity of the charge he aims at so hypnotising the minds of his hearers as to leave but a difficult access to the truth hereafter.

<P> { <I>Here follows matter <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn15" ID="nr15" TITLE="15">**</A> dealing with the charge of the wine-dues, the war with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/v/vocontii.html#1">Vocontii,</A> and the arrangement of winter-quarters.</I> }

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="c10">[10.]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://www.lateinlex.de/?call=Puc&permalink=Cic_orat_Font_10"> L</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="21">[21]</A> "But," our opponents allege, "the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gaul.html#1">Gauls</A> deny this." But the circumstances of the case and the compelling nature of the arguments prove it. Is it possible, then, for a juryman to refuse belief to witnesses? To refuse belief to witnesses who are interested or prejudiced, who have entered into a conspiracy or who are devoid of scruple, is more than possible; it is obligatory. For indeed if Marcus Fonteius must be assumed to be guilty merely because the Gauls assert him to be so, what need, pray, for a wise jury, an impartial president, an advocate not without intelligence ? The Gauls assert it; it is no good our denying. If you think it to be the duty of a clever, experienced, and impartial juryman to think that a statement must be unhesitatingly believed just because witnesses assert it, then the goddess of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/salus.html#1">Salvation</A> herself cannot protect the innocence of a brave gentleman. But if in the determination of a verdict you consider the sagacity of a juryman to find its chief scope in the scrutiny of every circumstance and the weighing of it by its inherent importance, then bethink you whether your function as critics is not a far graver and more momentous one than my own as pleader. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="22">[22]</A> My task in every case is to question a witness upon each point not merely once only, but also briefly - often, indeed, to abstain from questioning him, so as not to give passion the opportunity of utterance or to seem to attach weight to self-interest. You are in a position repeatedly to revolve a point in your minds and to give prolonged consideration to the evidence of a single witness ; and, if we have shown reluctance to cross-examine, it is for you to infer a motive for our silence. If therefore you think that a juryman has either a legal or a moral obligation to believe witnesses, then there can be no reason for judging one juryman to be better or wiser than another. For the judgement of the ear is single and it is simple, and has been bestowed by nature upon both wise and foolish with indiscriminate universality. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="23">[23]</A> What scope then has sagacity for display, or how can the mere unreflecting and uncritical listener be distinguished from the scrupulous and sagacious juryman? Surely on occasions when the depositions of a witness are submitted to scrutiny and reflection which determines the authority, the impartiality, the honour, the faith, the conscientiousness, the regard for reputation, the care, and the scrupulous reverence with which those depositions are made. <A CLASS="green" NAME="c11">[11.]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://www.lateinlex.de/?call=Puc&permalink=Cic_orat_Font_11"> L</A> &nbsp; Or will you, gentlemen, in dealing with the evidence of barbarians, show hesitation, whereas frequently, within the recollection both of ourselves and of our fathers, the wisest of juries, in regard to the most eminent citizens of our own country, thought that there should be no hesitation? They refused belief to evidence given by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caepio.html#5">Gnaeus</A> and Quintus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caepio.html#6">Caepio</A> and by Lucius and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/metellus.html#6">Quintus</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/metellus.html#5">Metellus</A> against Quintus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pompeius.html#3">Pompeius,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn16" ID="nr16" TITLE="16">**</A> the first of his family to hold office ; for though virtuous, noble, and illustrious in action, their credibility and authority as witnesses was impaired by a suspicion of animus and self-interest. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="24">[24]</A> Is there a man whom we have seen or whom we can truly name as the peer in discretion, dignity, and strength of will, and all other great qualities, er in the distinctions of a great career, a brilliant intellect, and splendid achievements, of Marcus Aemilius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scaurus.html#1">Scaurus</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn17" ID="nr17" TITLE="17">**</A> ? Yet he, who unsworn well-nigh controlled the earth by his nod, had no belief accorded to his sworn evidence against Gaius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/f/fimbria.html#1">Fimbria</A> and Gaius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/memmius.html#4">Memmius.</A> Those who sat in judgement were unwilling that private enmity should be afforded in the witness-box an open road to ruin the object of individual hatred. Who is there who does not know the sense of honour, the ability, the influence that marked Lucius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crassus.html#23">Crassus</A> ? None the less, a man whose very conversation had all the impressiveness of evidence, could not, when he spoke from the witness-box, render plausible the statements that dislike prompted him to utter against Marcus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/marcellus.html#16">Marcellus.</A> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="25">[25]</A> Yes, gentlemen, the jurymen of those days were inspired with a lofty and sublime conception of their duty ; the verdict they gave was, they thought, not a verdict upon the defendant alone, but upon the prosecutor and upon the witness ; they had to determine the inventions of falsehood, the contributions of chance or opportunism, the corruptions of bribery, the distortions of hope or fear, the promptings of self-interest or of hatred. If the juryman does not embrace all this in his deliberation, does not earnestly and intelligently view it from every side, if he assumes that all that is spoken from the witness-box is the utterance of an oracle, then assuredly, as I said before, any man who is not deaf will be amply qualified to fulfil the office and the function of juryman. There will be no earthly reason why the responsibility of giving a verdict should demand some paragon of wisdom and wide experience.

Yes, for he was palpably afraid lest he should forfeit some of his reputation in your eyes and those of the Roman people, afraid of the tale going round, "To think of a man like Indutiomarus making such partial, such wild statements" ; but he failed to see that there was nothing which he was bound to furnish either to his own citizens or to our prosecutors in his evidence except his voice, his impudence, and his effrontery. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="30">[30]</A> Or do you think that nations like that are influenced, when they give evidence, by the sanctity of an oath or by the fear of the immortal gods, differing so widely from all other nations as they do in habits and in character?

In time past there was a greater abundance of such men in our commonwealth than to-day ; yet though this was so, not only their safety but also their honour was regarded. And to-day how should you act, now that the profession of arms has fallen out of fashion among our youth ; when our best men and our greatest generals have been wasted either by age or by civil dissension and public calamity ; when wars so numerous are either unavoidably undertaken by us, or sprung upon us with unforeseen suddenness? Do you not think you should retain this man himself against our nation's doubtful hour, while at the same time you kindle his fellow-countrymen to the pursuit of honour and virtue? <A CLASS="ref" NAME="43">[43]</A> Recollect the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legatus">legates</A> recently employed in war in the service of Lucius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/julius.html#9">Julius,</A> of Publius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lupus.html#1">Rutilius,</A> of Lucius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cato.html#7">Cato,</A> and of Gnaeus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pompeius.html#21">Pompeius</A> ; you will learn that among the past masters of warfare holding <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetor">praetorian</A> rank at that time were Marcus Cornutus, Lucius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cinna.html#2">Cinna,</A> and Lucius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sulla.html#5">Sulla,</A> not to mention Gaius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/marius.html#1">Marius,</A> Publius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/didius.html#1">Didius,</A> Quintus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/catulus.html#3">Catulus,</A> and Publius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crassus.html#14">Crassus,</A> men who gained their military knowledge not from text-books but from their operations and their victories. And now, if you please, cast your eyes over the senate-house, and scan deeply every department of public life; can you not conceive the possibility of circumstances arising when there may be a call for such men as this; or, should such circumstances arise, do you think that the Roman people is particularly rich in such men? View carefully these considerations, gentlemen, and you will assuredly prefer to retain at home in the service of yourselves and your children a man so tireless in the toils of war, so valiant in the face of its perils, so skilled in its theory and its practice, so wise in its strategy, so fortunate in its accidents and its chances, rather than to resign him to the tender mercies of cruel tribesmen who are the bitterest foes of the Roman people.

Your first outwork against their attack is <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonia,</A> a province loyal in friendship with the Roman people, which, declaring that itself and its cities owe their preservation to the brawn, as well as to the brain, of Marcus Fonteius, repels the threatening assaults of the Gauls from his head, even as it was itself defended by him from the devastating inroads of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrace.html#1">Thracians.</A> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="45">[45]</A> Ranged upon the other wing is Further <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/spain.html#3">Spain,</A> which assuredly is able not only to oppose its loyalty to the wild ambition of our foe, but also by its testimonies and panegyrics to refute the perjuries of scoundrels.

Finally - as is right in a war with Gaul, and as the principles and practice of our ancestors prescribe - there is no citizen of Rome who deigns to resort to any excuse, but all the tax-collectors, farmers, stock-raisers, and traders of the province rally with one heart and one voice to the defence of Marcus Fonteius.

Bethink you of the peril that lies in wait for such pride, if you should be deaf to the appeal of one, the rejection of whose supplication by the gods would dissolve the fabric of our daily lives. Do you mark, gentlemen, how Marcus Fonteius, brave man though he be, has at my allusion to his parent and his sister broken into sudden tears ? Never has he flinched upon the field, often has he dashed into the thickest of the fray fighting sword in hand against fearful odds, thinking, as he faced such dangers, that he left behind the same solace to his dear ones as his father had left to him. Yet he to-day flinches, for his mind is clouded with a doubt lest, far from lending aid and honour to his own, he may even leave to his hapless loved ones undying dishonour and ignominy that shall wring their hearts with sorrow. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="49">[49]</A> O how unlike to this would have been your fate, Marcus Fonteius, could you have made election that it were better to perish by the weapons of the Gauls than by their perjuries? Then would Valour have been your companion in life, and Honour your comrade in death; but now what anguish is yours ! - to bow beneath the bludgeoning of domineering triumph inflicted by the pleasure of those who were either vanquished by your arms or who submitted with reluctance to your rule.

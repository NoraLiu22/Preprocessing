a reason all of us — magazine editors in particular, perhaps, but not only us — love an artistic debut. It’s not just that those releasing their first album, book or movie, or having their first gallery exhibit or Broadway show, are usually young; it’s that they embody that most delicious and evanescent of qualities: promise. Any painter could be the next Rothko or Basquiat; any singer could be the next Joni or Aretha. There the new artist sits, poised between our expectations and their unwritten reality. Becoming emotionally invested in an untested creative life is like becoming financially invested in an exciting new company — should they (or it) work, the reward is not just theirs but ours. “See?” we tell ourselves. “We knew it all along.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But the real test of being an artist isn’t the first album, book, movie or Broadway show, as significant as those accomplishments are. It’s what happens after. All artists know that living a true creative life means facing an endless series of beginnings: It’s starting over after setbacks; it’s pushing forward through doubt and despair; it’s trying again when someone tells you no; it’s slogging ahead when no one seems to like or care about what you make; it’s ignoring the voice inside you that tells you to stop; it’s striving and failing, again and again and again. There is no point of complete security, no award or recognition that bestows total confidence — a life in art means that, to some degree, you’re starting anew every day. As the novelist Andrew Holleran tells T, “Writing is basically unconscious, and you don’t get any smarter about it. Imagine a brain surgeon who didn’t learn from each operation? We’d be horrified. But when you sit down to write, you’re always wondering how to do it.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><div class="cover-images svelte-67bc97"><div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2250" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-edletter-slide-CSC3/18tmag-edletter-slide-CSC3-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 820px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-edletter-slide-CSC3/18tmag-edletter-slide-CSC3-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 821px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-edletter-slide-CSC3/18tmag-edletter-slide-CSC3-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A cover of T: The New York Times Style Magazine's April 21, 2024 Culture issue, with the heading &quot;Beginners.

And though the artists who appear in these pages are all different, they share a spirit of generosity: It’s no easy thing to give voice to your dreams and insecurities, much less to do so publicly. Their collective perseverance — a mix of dogged determination and wild hope — is a reminder for all of us that a creative life, that <em>all</em> life, takes nerve. It takes humility. It takes a kind of arrogance that sees you through the most barren periods. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And by the way: You don’t need to be young to lead a creative life. All you have to do is start. Start — and then never stop.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->On March 12, as we were readying this issue to go to press, one of our colleagues, Carter Love, T’s senior photography editor, died. He was 41.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Being a good photo editor demands taste and a sense of coordination. For a fashion or celebrity shoot, they, along with the creative director and style director, assemble teams: the photographer, of course, but also the stylist, models, hair and makeup artists and set designers. For a travel story, the photo editor selects and hires the fixer, the photographer, the location scout, the translator and the transportation. Once on set, a photo editor stays until the very end of the shoot, even if the shoot goes all day. Carter worked on these — and many other — kinds of stories, often simultaneously; in this issue alone, he produced a dozen images, from the portrait of the longtime collaborators Cindy Sherman and Marc Jacobs to the picture of the fashion designer turned photographer Miguel Adrover.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Along with his native senses of taste and coordination, Carter was — crucially — able to laugh at the absurdities, the unexpected little (and not-so-little) disasters that inevitably arise during a shoot, no matter how thorough the planning: rain on a day when sun was predicted; equipment stuck in customs; a subject’s last-minute cancellation. He had a big laugh, resonant and full, which everyone in the office could hear; at work parties, he sometimes broke into song. In addition to his big laugh, he had a big voice. He was tall and wiry and quick moving, with magnificent red hair — I’d often look up from my desk and see his head and torso streaking across the top of the cubicle walls, hurrying off somewhere. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->One of Carter’s most used phrases was “absolutely.” Could I see more options from this shoot? “Absolutely.” Could I have a list of the talent that had already confirmed? “Absolutely.” Thanks, Carter, for this new information. “Absolutely.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Barely a week after his death, that word keeps beating in my head. Will we always ask ourselves why he had to die? Absolutely. Were we lucky to work with him? Absolutely. Will we miss him? Absolutely. Absolutely.

Naipaul came to dinner at my flat in Delhi. The writer, who had become something of a mentor to me, was transfixed by a painting I had bought a few years before. It was a self-portrait, over 7 feet tall and 5 feet wide. “I find it hypnotic,” Naipaul said, filing away spoonfuls of yellow dal. Observing the beauty of the hand clasped (as if in horror) over the mouth, the thumb livid against the dark hollows of the eyes, he added of the artist, “This is someone who has really seen, who has gone back again and again to see.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group"><div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-k5quak"><h3 class="g-heading svelte-k5quak"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Listen to this article, read by Neil Shah<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3>  </div></div> </div>  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media">   <script src="https://static01.nyt.com/video-static/vhs3/vhs.min.js"></script> <div class="g-vhs-video svelte-eb68ke"></div></div></div> </div>  </figure><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I was at the beginning of my writing career, using my first advances to collect a few works of art.

Its creator, Zack, who’d been a close friend at Amherst College in Massachusetts in the late 1990s, had recently given up painting, and “How Did You Sleep?” had become a symbol to me of the precarity of what it means to get started as an artist.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2557" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-R3JW/18tmag-firststroke-slide-R3JW-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-R3JW/18tmag-firststroke-slide-R3JW-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A painting of a nude woman turning away from two men who are leaning over a balcony, with one whispering in the other's ear." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2557" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-R3JW/18tmag-firststroke-slide-R3JW-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi was 17 in 1610 when she painted “Susanna and the Elders” (above).

After struggling with feelings of inferiority in our first year related to his public school education, he taught himself to paint from scratch. I would visit him and watch as he, dressed in paint-stained khakis and New Balance sneakers, toiled away at the self-portraits that were his trademark. He was a model to me of artistic labor and discipline, even if those early paintings were painfully amateurish.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Then, in our last semester, having been abroad a while, I entered Fayerweather Hall for the art department’s end-of-year show and saw “How Did You Sleep?” I was dumbstruck. I’m not sure I would’ve even been able to recognize it as Zack’s work — so prodigious had been his development as a painter — if it hadn’t been a self-portrait. Painted in the wake of 9/11, it showed the artist in a blue shirt with an expression of prophetic terror, as if watching a disaster foretold. I remember wanting to own it because it was proof, like none I had ever had before, that there really did exist such a thing in the world as raw talent. I persuaded Zack to sell it to me.

I love those romantic tales of creative daring and breakthrough: the English travel writer and novelist <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/03/19/specials/chatwin-writer.html">Bruce Chatwin</a> quitting his job at The Sunday Times of London’s magazine with a simple telegram that read, “Have gone to Patagonia”; or, more dramatically, Paul Gauguin abandoning his wife, kids and job as a salesman to pursue his dream of being a painter. I love the improbability of the lives that could not have been: Salman Rushdie, the adman; W. Somerset Maugham, the doctor; the director Kathryn Bigelow, renovating dilapidated apartments in New York with the then-obscure composer Philip Glass. I remember Arundhati Roy teaching my mother and aunt aerobics in the basement of the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi before going on to win the Booker Prize for her debut novel, “The God of Small Things” (1997). It’s exhilarating to see destiny pick those who could but only have been artists out of the mundanity of their lives and light the way to a life of vocation.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’m especially moved by those first moments of validation by which an artist comes out to himself, as it were. Consider Joseph Conrad in his mid-30s, working aboard the ship Torrens, with the manuscript of his first novel, “Almayer’s Folly” (1895). It had acquired, he writes in “A Personal Record” (1912), “a faded look and an ancient, yellowish complexion.” At sea, Conrad met his first reader, Jacques, a “young Cambridge man.” “Well, what do you say?” Conrad, brimming with anxiety, asked his new friend. “Is it worth finishing?” “ ‘Distinctly,’ he answered, in his sedate, veiled voice,” Conrad recalls years later, “and then coughed a little.” With that one word, Jacques, who was soon to be carried away by a fatal cold, had given a seafaring Polish exile a vital nod of encouragement. “The purpose instilled into me by his simple and final ‘Distinctly,’” writes Conrad, one of literature’s late bloomers (he was 38 when he published his first novel), “remained dormant, yet alive to await its opportunity.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This quiet admission to oneself, as sacred as the vows of priesthood, of wanting to undertake the creative life is a necessary step; but like talent, it’s not enough. To be an artist is not a private act but a public one. No artist is born into a vacuum, or later speaks into one. They are as much a product of the society they emerge from as a response to it. Nor is artistic expression all spirit, all feeling. As Naipaul has frequently noted, writers require a complex edifice of interlocking parts — an infrastructure, if you will — to thrive. More broadly speaking, all successful artists rely on a network of critics, journals and newspapers, a discerning audience, bookshops and concert halls and galleries — which is generations in the making, presupposing certain values, certain economic and political realities. The Ukrainian-born novelist Clarice Lispector came of age in the Brazil of the 1920s. At 13, she “consciously claimed the desire to write,” as her biographer Benjamin Moser quotes her in “Why This World” (2009), but no sooner had she claimed her destiny than she felt herself in a void. The idea of vocation had been instilled in her, but that didn’t mean she knew how to proceed. “Writing was always difficult for me,” Lispector once wrote, “even though I had begun with what is known as vocation. Vocation is different from talent. One can have vocation and not talent; one can be called and not know how to go.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lispector had both vocation and talent, but what makes any artist’s first steps so tentative is that the path forward is narrower than we imagine. We come into the world believing we can be a great many things (and for a great many this is true) but, for those destined to be artists, the creative choices they make are almost as limited as the choice of being an artist itself. Maugham wanted to demystify the impulse that had him give up medicine to answer his calling as a novelist. “I am a writer as I might have been a doctor or a lawyer,” he writes in “The Summing Up,” his 1938 literary memoir, but, soon after that, despite himself, Maugham stumbles on that aspect of the artistic life that eludes banalization, for it’s truly mysterious — namely, the bond between the artist and his subject. “Though the whole world,” writes Maugham, “with everyone in it and all its sights and events, is your material, you yourself can only deal with what corresponds to some secret spring in your own nature.” <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2420" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 762px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 763px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A painting of a skull next to an hourglass with flowers, butterflies and bubbles around it." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2420" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Vanitas Still Life” (circa 1665-70) by Jan van Kessel the Elder, who was from a long line of celebrated Flemish painters — Pieter Bruegel the Elder was his great-grandfather — and was perhaps destined to be an artist.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>    </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s this, the inexorability of the correspondence between an artist and the world, that gives those first steps their magical quality. It represents a rebirth so profound that it can often entail the killing off of a former self. One of my literary heroes, the writer Rebecca West — the author of that magisterial work of travel, inquiry and sympathy “Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia” (1940) — was abandoned (as I was) by her father as a child. In late Victorian England, it left her with an exaggerated regard for what were seen as male qualities, as well as the need to compensate for their absence. “Men, she felt,” writes J.R. Hammond in “H.G. Wells and Rebecca West” (1991), his biography of their romantic and literary relationship, “should be strong and dependable; deep inside herself she sensed they were not to be trusted.” These gendered dynamics were surely at work as West, first making her way in the world at age 20, sloughed off the softer given name of Cissie Fairfield to adopt, as a pseudonym, the name of the spirited protagonist of Henrik Ibsen’s play “Rosmersholm” (1886). <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->No artist is without this set of special circumstances. They are the ground from which the need for expression arises. The path forward comes upon the artist-in-waiting with the power of certain mathematical proofs, elegant, inevitable, at once simple and inscrutable. “Falling in love for the first time and getting started as a writer,” my friend the writer Karan Mahajan, 39, the author of the novels “Family Planning” (2008) and “The Association of Small Bombs” (2016), replied by email when I asked him what it had been like for him, “both things happened at once for me. Suddenly, I had my material, and it encompassed all aspects of my life: my childhood in Delhi; immigration to the United States as a student; a future decided by plane journeys. I could love myself as the other loved me.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For the Pakistani-born American painter Salman Toor, 40, the moment when, he says, “something vital clicked into place” meant that he suddenly found himself in “a direct relationship” between the things he was thinking and talking about every day and the paintings he was at work on. “In 2016,” he says, “I did a few paintings out of a need to be completely honest with myself. I wanted to illustrate the stories I was bursting to tell. A lot of these stories were about coming out and showing the excitement, anxieties and challenges of belonging to multiple cultures and living a cute little life in the East Village.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The date surprised me. I had been aware of Toor’s work for almost a decade before this moment. To me, he was the painter of a certain kind of South Asian disquiet. No one captured the massive cultural and economic disparities of my life in Delhi (and his in Lahore) like Toor. Upon scenes of revelry and privilege — a party, a picnic, a rich westernized couple frolicking out of doors with a glass of wine and an iPhone — he would, in the form of servants in the background looking on, introduce an element of unease that hinted at the fragility of the societies we lived in. But quite unbeknown to me, Toor’s life in New York had opened up a new vein of material. To put it another way, he had begun again. And this is what we tend to forget: In the careers of certain artists, those who make big, varied bodies of work in which different strands of their experience are subsumed, the business of beginning, and beginning again, never ceases. Each new beginning brings with it all the uncertainty and blankness of the first. Experience might protect such an artist from forcing what’s clearly not working, but that core anxiety of not knowing if one will create again always remains. “Do not worry,” Hemingway would console himself, “you have always written before and you will write now.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->WHAT CONSTITUTES A beginning? In the common conception, it’s the first book, the first album, the first show at a major gallery. Yet an artist has myriad private ways in which they mark moments of true breakthrough. My childhood friend the sitarist and composer Anoushka Shankar, 42, regards her fourth album as her first. She had grown up under the influence of her mighty father, Ravi Shankar, the man credited with having introduced Indian classical music to the West. Every artist struggles with what the literary critic Harold Bloom has called the anxiety of influence but, in Anoushka’s case, it was even more pronounced. As she told me, Ravi Shankar was “my guru, my teacher, my father.” It was he who had composed her first three albums.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ravi, before he went on to become the greatest sitarist of his generation, had been part of a dance troupe led by his brother Uday, which caused a sensation in the Europe and America of the 1930s. “Hindu thought, alive, authentic, in flesh and bone, in sound, gesture and spirit,” is how the French mystic René Daumal describes the Shankar troupe in his book “Rasa” (1982), but Ravi was conflicted. He eventually broke with the troupe and dedicated himself entirely to the sitar. “He had a real directional shift that I didn’t have,” Anoushka says. Her beginnings, though she was six decades younger than her father, were in a sense more traditional. They entailed the surprise of finding newness within tradition. “I think my journey,” she says, “was more progressively finding how the thing that was in front of me — the sitar, namely — the thing that had been given to me, could be my outlet, could be my voice.” <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A coda to this intergenerational tale of artistic beginnings is the story of Anoushka’s half sister, Norah Jones, who spent years of her childhood estranged from her father and grew up in Texas with her American mother. At a time when both Anoushka and I were discovering our half siblings, I remember going to see Norah play at little-known clubs on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She was staking claim to what felt like a genetic destiny in music, though in a tradition entirely different from that of her father and sister. I don’t know if I’ve ever witnessed beginnings as meager and transformational as these for, not long after, Norah’s debut album, “Come Away With Me” (2002), was released; it went on to win five Grammys, sell 30 million copies and all but save the piracy-shattered music industry.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid48" class="place-ad" data-position="mid48" data-size-key="default"></div> </div><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We live in a society that prizes the individual above all else but, in the art of premodern Europe and classical India, to begin as an artist didn’t necessarily entail breaking with tradition, nor was it given to every artist to be original. “Raphael was adept at this,” writes Rachel Cusk in her travel memoir “The Last Supper: A Summer in Italy” (2009), in which she describes the Italian Renaissance painter’s relationship to his first guru, Perugino. Raphael had become so good at imitating Perugino, Cusk tells us, that the copies of his master’s work were indistinguishable from the originals. The art of pastiche, of inhaling the influence of an older admired artist so completely that it enters your soul, exists today, too. The South African writer J.M. Coetzee’s early works owe a huge debt to Samuel Beckett, as Rushdie’s do to Gabriel García Márquez and Thomas Pynchon’s to James Joyce. The difference in the modern era is that influence is something we must shrug off in order to become our own people, yet not everyone can. Cusk deals very movingly with Raphael’s quest (and ultimate failure) to be his own man. In a field crowded with giants such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he “retreated behind the mask of humility, never to come out again.” But far from this being his downfall as an artist, it, too, was a kind of beginning. “In the end,” writes Cusk, “his borrowing of such greatness amounted to greatness itself. Not everyone who sees a Michelangelo can go off and paint a Michelangelo.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->THERE ARE SO many ways to begin. I said it wasn’t my intention to open with a story of artistic death, but I never explained why I did. The reason is that after six books, and 20 years after writing my first publishable sentences, stamina, endurance and the ability to stay the course have come to mean at least as much to me as that first raw efflorescence of talent. If Zack’s story acquired the force of parable for me, it was because it showed me the vanity of our preoccupation with talent. Many with fewer gifts who are yet more steadfast go on to have brilliant careers as artists. There’s an undeniable mystery in why some among us become artists, but there’s a greater mystery to me still in those who survive the vicissitudes of creative life, leaving behind bodies of work through which there runs an arc of growth as sublime as the vaulting of a Gothic cathedral.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A true artist always brings something new into the world. A new color, a new complexion, a new way of looking — a “new kind of beauty,” to use Marcel Proust’s phrase for the special distinctiveness he felt that Fyodor Dostoyevsky had brought to literature. We make the mistake of thinking of that newness as an externality, a scaffolding, a mere matter of style. But in fact, the originality we detect on the surface is an emanation from the birth of a new idea. It’s something far more radical, far more unnerving, than we are prepared to accept. Real artists bring about real rupture. We want to domesticate the discomfort that makes us feel but, deep down, we know the old rules no longer apply; and for one fleeting moment, our world, with us in it, is laid bare, transfigured by the imagination of someone who has dared to see it anew. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Read by Neil Shah.

It was too long for the markets that I had in mind, and I didn’t know very much about girls anyway, particularly girls’ gym classes and locker rooms, so I threw the story away. My wife fished it out of the trash, uncrumpled the pages, looked at it and said, “This is pretty good. I’ll help you.” It’s a very short book, way under 300 pages. Also, there are pejoratives that were common then that I wouldn’t use now, even though they’re realistic and come out of the mouths of characters we don’t like.

It was going to be the last book I ever wrote, because I’d been writing for 10 years after graduating from an M.F.A. program and had only had one story published in a magazine. I said to myself, “You have to stop now and go to law school.” Luckily, the book came out of me very quickly and, in retrospect, became a description of six years I’d spent in New York. It was very easy because I’d obviously touched something that mattered to me. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’ve never reread “Dancer” [about gay life in 1970s New York] so, while I’m sure that if I did, I’d revise, revise, revise, I can’t imagine changing any of it. The campy style of the letters that frame the book is probably outdated, which is a shame since I love camp. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’ve learned since then that writing is basically unconscious, and you don’t get any smarter about it. Imagine a brain surgeon who didn’t learn from each operation? We’d be horrified. But when you sit down to write, you’re always wondering how to do it. — <em>L.G.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><div class="g-paid svelte-1va431l"><div id="mid68" class="place-ad" data-position="mid68" data-size-key="default"></div> </div></section> <section><figure class="diptych svelte-67bc97 g-image-small"><div class="image-wrapper svelte-67bc97"><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2589" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-origins-slide-GWEY/18tmag-origins-slide-GWEY-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-origins-slide-GWEY/18tmag-origins-slide-GWEY-superJumbo-v2.jpg"> <img alt="Debbie Harry and Chris Stein stand on a staircase with a curved bannister and portraits hanging on wooden walls." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2589" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-origins-slide-GWEY/18tmag-origins-slide-GWEY-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Harry and Stein, of the rock band Blondie, in the U.K. in 1977.

It was a different era. I think the fact that the album wasn’t overproduced gives it a kind of timelessness. We still perform some of those songs.

Generally, we’d just go in and do a bunch of takes, pick the best one, throw some stuff on it and that was pretty much it. There was hardly any overdubbing.

The structure isn’t so much an object inserted into the earth; it’s the earth itself being polished like a geode. I considered everything, even the walkway, which was put in to intentionally separate the wall from the ground. If you put the granite sidewalk all the way up against the wall, it would no longer be a polished geode — it’d be a curb. I put grass there.

It’s a very forceful declaration. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A song like “Fast Car,” which I wrote when I was maybe 22, wasn’t a very long process, but it reflected a different strategy about songwriting. It was more about revelation, sharing a story about a person and the changes happening in their life. I made edits to “Fast Car.” I definitely changed words and lines. I’m too embarrassed to tell you exactly what, but it was the verse that starts “See, my old man’s got a problem.” Let’s just say that there was something else there.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In some ways, writing a song is about asking and answering questions: “Who is this character, why are they doing this and where is the story going?” When I was young, I thought all these questions could be answered with the first iteration of the song. I’m not as enamored with this idea that the very first thing that comes to mind is what I have to remain committed to. — <em>L.G.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Jewel</strong>, 49, musician, on “Pieces of You” (1995)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh  g-image-small" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-300 svelte-1jrfrvl" style="max-width: 300px;"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1194" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Jewel, surrounded by people in a recording studio, wearing a white and orange striped shirt, looks back over her left shoulder." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1194" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2/18tmag-origins-slide-H4R2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Jewel at the musician Neil Young’s private studio in Northern California in 1994.

I remember thinking, “I’m going to bring a bunch of wigs and makeup.” It was just me for a few shots, but then [the German photographer] Juergen [Teller] got playful and started putting himself in the pictures. He gradually shaved parts of his face and head. He’d started the shoot with a full head of hair and beard; by the end, he was completely bald with no facial hair at all. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>M.J.: </strong>I wasn’t there, but I got calls from Juergen saying, “It’s [expletive] excellent, it’s [expletive] excellent.” He says that when he’s really excited.

There was one where you were both older, sitting on a bench. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.S.: </strong>Rifling through a big bag. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>M.J.: </strong>That image became a billboard on Melrose [Avenue in Los Angeles]. It was great because fashion campaigns like that didn’t exist back then. Nobody would’ve ever said, “<em>That’s </em>our ad,” because it wasn’t exactly selling clothes or bags. But it was exciting. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.S.: </strong>What’s funny is that you’d asked me, a year or two ago during Covid, to do something — I don’t even remember what it was. I’d gained a bit of weight, so I was self-conscious and kept turning you down. [For the 2024 campaign I ended up doing] some of the outfits were a little tight. The people assisting me said, “We can fix that.” And I said, “No, no, it’s [perfect for] the character.” I guess I could’ve thought of someone who was trying to hide, but I decided, “No, she seems like she could just let it all hang out in her leather pants.” How do you feel when you see different types of women wearing your pieces or putting them together in unusual ways? <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>M.J.: </strong>It’s the ultimate validation.

I remember an early series of horizontal pictures that I called “The Centerfolds” (1981) — I thought they were kind of disturbing, but some collector said, “I have that one hanging over my bed because it’s so sexy.” And I’m thinking, “Ugh, I don’t want to know that.” But you can’t control what happens to a piece. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>M.J.: </strong>Or what other people see in it.

Like Truman Capote’s swans, we had salads and talked about water and weight loss.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>CARLOS NAZARIO: </strong>It wasn’t like we were meeting to discuss a project. That sort of evolved organically. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>W.C.: </strong>I was terrified to ask you to work with me. I remember texting to [see] if you’d style my [fall 2023] show. Do you know what you said? “I thought you’d never ask.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.N.: </strong>Willy’s work spoke to me in such a profound way. There was such a similarity — if not in aesthetic, definitely in intention. A lot of brands lack depth and a soul. I’m Afro-Latino. I grew up in New York with a certain relationship to how one presents themselves to the world, what glamour means and looks like and how it’s communicated. I was always intrigued by how Willy’s designs encompassed all those things.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>W.C.: </strong>[The way we collaborate] is so natural and unpretentious. We end up telling a story that we feel good about. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.N.: </strong>Every relationship between a stylist and designer is unique. Some designers require a lot more — from research to manufacturing and the show. Others want you to come in right at the end and say, “Let’s put that on this model.” With Willy, our conversations prior to my first day were conceptual. We talked about what he wanted it to feel like, rather than what he wanted it to look like.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>W.C.: </strong>For that first show together, we wanted the cast — all people of color, many of them queer and trans — to feel elevated and empowered. Marlon [Taylor-Wiles, the show’s movement director] was going to have the models look down at the guests. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.N.: </strong>At the rehearsal, we were like, “Maybe it’s a bit creepy.” I wasn’t uncomfortable [giving my opinion] because Willy’s such an easy person to talk to. But anytime you’re coming into a space where everyone has clearly defined roles, you feel like a stepparent. You’re a bit like, “Do I discipline the daughter? Do I tell her the skirt’s too short?” I didn’t want to overstep, but I also wanted to make my presence worth it. As we got more comfortable [with each other], we got more comfortable trying things. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>W.C.: </strong>The next season, we took more risks. We wanted it to feel refined and elegant, but we also wanted to inject a youthfulness. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.N.: </strong>At a lot of [brands], it’s like, “This season, everything’s a miniskirt. If your thighs aren’t great, see you in the fall!” Willy’s casting allows for a very broad vision in terms of what the styling can do: You’ll have someone like me, who’s 5-foot-4 [Nazario walked in the fall 2024 show], and then you’ll have someone who’s 6-foot-4. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>W.C.: </strong>You’ll have a woman in her late 50s and a 17-year-old boy. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.N.: </strong>Everyone from twinks to daddies. If you tried to dress everyone the same, it’d be a disaster. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>W.C.: </strong>I can suggest something that you don’t like, and you’ll say, “Let’s go with it. Let’s see.” And I’ll do the same. I’ve worked with stylists who will deliberate over the positioning of a hat for hours. The stress level is so intense, it kills the moment. Having the freedom [to experiment reflects] a levity we want the brand to have. You know, we address serious subjects, like human rights, inclusion … <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.N.: </strong>Self-identity. But if we’re stressed, everyone’s stressed. We try to keep it light, but we also understand the weight of the responsibility. It’s rare that you work with people who understand what you’re feeling and what you want to convey. And I think our trust lies in that. — <em>N.H.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Photo assistants: Eamon Colbert, Jordan Zuppa<!--

Back then, Coby was a street writer.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.K.: </strong>A graffiti writer, in the parlance of our times.

The Wide Awakes [their most recent art collective, named after a progressive group that supported Abraham Lincoln during the 1860 presidential election] took off in my old studio in December 2019. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.K.: </strong>We were trying to plug into society and see how we could influence it.

But then again, 2016 is when “Reach” [their sculpture at Chicago’s O’Hare airport] first started.

Coby, who has a history as an industrial designer and animator, is the bridge between the proposal and how it happens. With virtually every one of my public sculptures, he’s done all the initial concepting. He’s always had this ability to see what others are thinking. We also have different tastes. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>C.K.: </strong>And they’re sometimes at odds with each other, which is one of the best parts [of our working relationship], because I’d hate for both of us to be middle ground. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>H.W.T.: </strong>Coby has a very clear, singular vision, while I create art through consensus.

He’s creating the artworks. — <em>J.H.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><div><header><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>BOBBI SALVÖR MENUEZ, ACTOR, AND MICHAEL BAILEY-GATES, ARTIST</strong> Have collaborated on dozens of performances and photography projects throughout their decade-long friendship.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1351" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A portrait of Bobbi Salvör Menuez and Michael Bailey-Gates against a gray background." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1351" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0/18tmag-thesetwo-slide-OVA0-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->From left: Menuez, 30, and Bailey-Gates, 30, photographed at Smashbox Studios in Culver City, Calif., on Feb. 1, 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Joyce Kim<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure></header> </div><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>BOBBI SALVÖR MENUEZ: </strong>I curated a 2014 show at [the Brooklyn exhibition space] Muddguts that was part of a series in which I invited people who didn’t always make performance work to create something in a performance context. We’d been in a group show together before and had mutual friends, and I was excited about the work I was seeing Michael make. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>MICHAEL BAILEY-GATES: </strong>It was me, Bobbi and maybe two or three other people. I had this party trick of being able to talk really fast, like an auctioneer. When I said certain phrases, one of them would stand up, and another would scream at the top of their lungs or throw an object at someone.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>B.S.M.: </strong>It felt like the beginning of us making things together on the fly. We both had this down-to-get-into-it energy that was well matched. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>M.B.G.: </strong>We shared an urgency to make work come to life. Sometimes it’s as simple as being a body for another person. I’ve been the lead in Bobbi’s performances, and I’ve been in the background, lying on a floor covered in red paint. Performance art in New York at the time was about executing an idea without a lot of money. These days, I don’t go into a shoot thinking we’re performing, but it’s very much that: The camera is the audience looking back at us. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>B.S.M.: </strong>Michael has this ability to see the kaleidoscopic possibility of someone’s self- expression. Around 2018, I was out as nonbinary to my close friends and finding my new name. I took a break from auditions and started working part-time as a substitute teacher. When a film I’d shot the year before got into [the 2019] Sundance [Film Festival], it was an invitation to step back into the spotlight. I’d shaved my head and was nervous about that formal, public coming- out moment. It just felt so cringe. I went to Los Angeles before going to Sundance and made some pictures with Michael that were only for us. Those were the first images of Bobbi that entered the world.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>M.B.G.: </strong>I never want to make a picture of somebody that’s not reflective of them. I’ve chosen in my practice to always focus on a small group of friends, and those collaborations are the grounding force of my work. Without them, what would my pictures be? They’d be something less precious. — <em>C.R.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Makeup: Zenia Jaeger at Streeters using Submission Beauty.

In 2020, I’d recently quit Kenzo and sold Opening Ceremony. My sisters and brother-in-law were in the midst of changes of their own, and we’d always wanted to tell my mom’s story. So we decided to open a restaurant together in Eagle Rock, the Los Angeles neighborhood where my family first lived when we immigrated to the United States in the late ’70s. We named it Chifa, after my mom’s place in Lima, and based the menu on a similar mix of classic Peruvian dishes like lomo saltado (beef stir fry) and anticucho (meat skewers) and Chinese home cooking — though my brother-in-law, the chef John Liu, has added some of his Taiwanese family’s culinary staples, too.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Starting anything new is scary, and I didn’t have the confidence to do so until the pandemic, which gave me time to try new ideas. (I also wrote a screenplay and a script for a TV show.) I tried to channel the intuition [I’d brought to Opening Ceremony] into other fields. I realized that what I’d done with the store was ultimately about the fond memories people had of the place rather than any specific product. Food does something similar: It creates conversations and memories.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I had the same feeling when I opened the store: “Will anyone show up?” We’d built Opening Ceremony from the ground up — no ads, only word of mouth — and that experience lent itself to launching Chifa, as well as Monarch and Arroz & Fun [our second and third restaurants, which opened last year in the Arcadia and Lincoln Heights neighborhoods, respectively]. In many ways, I’m bringing the same sensibility to the restaurants that I brought to Opening Ceremony: They’re places where you can discover new things. We aren’t aiming for formality or perfection. If anything, part of the experience is dropping your fork and noticing the cool terrazzo floor or really looking at the flatware, which we made with the designer Izabel Lam. As a person who shops and eats a lot, I want to be excited, to feel that nervousness of trying something new. — <em>M.S.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Nick Cave,</strong> musician, writer and artist<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1453" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-Q01J/18tmag-beginagain-slide-Q01J-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-Q01J/18tmag-beginagain-slide-Q01J-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-Q01J/18tmag-beginagain-slide-Q01J-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Nick Cave, wearing a shirt, tie and white jacket and sitting in a pink room in front of a tall mirror, holds a paint brush above a porcelain figure.

Starting in secondary school, I wanted to be a painter. I went to art school [for university in 1976] and, to my horror, failed my second year. At the same time, my first band [the Boys Next Door, which eventually became the Birthday Party] was starting to do well in the underground scene in Melbourne. I was much more interested in painting — I did figurative work that often referenced myself — but I’d failed, so I carried on with the band.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I started making ceramics during the pandemic. I collect Victorian Staffordshire-style figurines, the sort of thing an English grandmother might have on her mantelpiece, and one day I thought, “I could make these.” I found I was really swept up by clay. I struggle hugely with writing songs — not the music, but the lyrics. They never feel good enough. Mostly it’s all doubt and despair. But I don’t think I’ve felt more pleasure than I have when pulling a piece out of the kiln and looking at something I’ve made with my hands.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At some point, I had an idea to make a devil, mostly because I wanted to paint a figure in a fiery red glaze. I made one devil and then others, and eventually they began to tell a story. In the beginning, there’s a sort of lightheartedness about this wicked little guy: In his youth, he’s embedded in the world and in love with it. But then he kills his child, and [the figures] get dark and desperate. Later, he becomes remorseful and dies a terrible death. And in the end he’s forgiven by his child.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The death of a child is obviously very important to me because two of my own children have died. [Cave’s son Arthur died in 2015 at age 15. His oldest son, Jethro, died in 2022 at age 31.] And the works were saying something very powerful to me about my unfolding situation in life, something that my songs didn’t really talk about. I found that I could look at this poor devil in a pool of tears, with his lost child extending his hand to him, as a kind of meditation on my own place in the world and find a way that I — or we or whoever — may live a life. — <em>M.H.M.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Jordi Roca,</strong> pastry chef<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1350" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="In an ice cream shop with blue walls and pipes painted red and white, Jordi Roca leans on a glass countertop covering various tubs of ice cream and toppings." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1350" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07/18tmag-beginagain-slide-2K07-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Roca, 45, photographed at Rocambolesc Gelateria in Girona, Spain, on March 13, 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Anna Bosch Miralpeix<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Then:</strong> Joined the restaurant El Celler de Can Roca — founded in 1986 by his brothers, Joan and Josep, in Girona, Spain — in 1997, becoming head pastry chef in 2000. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Now:</strong> After starting his own gelateria chain, Rocambolesc, in Girona with his wife, Alejandra Rivas, in 2012, and being diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder four years later, opened an outpost of the gelateria in Houston in 2022 with a neurodiverse team.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I first started to lose my voice, it didn’t have much of an effect on my creative process in the kitchen. I had to learn to interact more through gesture, but I could still speak during quieter moments. That was around 2016, when I was giving a lot of interviews. It was a period in my career when I needed to speak but, instead, was a time of introspection. Once I got the diagnosis — I have an unusual expression of spasmodic dysphonia [a neurological disorder that causes spasms in the voice box] — it meant I could finally move forward. Now I think of this as just part of who I am.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The idea to open a U.S. branch of Rocambolesc, the gelateria, which has five locations in Spain, came a year or so before this. In 2015, when we were [hosting] cooking events around the world for Celler de Can Roca, we met our business partner Ignacio Torres in Houston. He has family members with autism, and having a place that would hire people with autism and Down syndrome was part of his idea from the beginning. By the time we opened Rocambolesc in Houston in 2022, we’d already had experiences in Celler de Can Roca with team members who had neurological differences. But staffing a project with a neurodiverse team was a huge personal gamble taken by Ignacio and his wife, Isabel, to transform the stigmas around neurodivergence in the United States. The project’s really been embraced in Houston. We have staff who’ve been with us right from the beginning. Of course, my own difficulties have given me a deeper empathy with people who can’t always express themselves in the way they might like. But what I’ve learned — especially through this project — is that we all live in the same world. There’re just many ways to see it. — <em>M.S.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Cassi Namoda,</strong> painter<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1200" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-5902/18tmag-beginagain-slide-5902-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-5902/18tmag-beginagain-slide-5902-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-5902/18tmag-beginagain-slide-5902-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Cassi Namoda leans back on a step ladder with one arm over a large painting of a woman with green outlines on an orange background.

In 2013, we had the number one tour in the world, and I was great for 100-plus shows. But in 2014, I wasn’t really making any music, which was hard psychologically. Then some of the recordings and shows we did, especially after 2017, were challenging — my range seemed to have narrowed and it was becoming difficult to sing consistently. But none of the professionals I saw could figure it out.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In March 2022, a doctor in Philadelphia explained that one of my vocal cords was atrophying. I thought I could get my voice back in shape if I just did enough shows, so I went back on the road. But it was a struggle. Finally, that June, I had an implant put [inside the cartilage of my larynx] to bring my [vocal folds] together. There was no singing at all for the first six weeks. Then I started speech therapy. I have rehab four times a week. But I’m still not sure what to expect. Yesterday when I was rehearsing with the band, I had a rough go with the song “Limitless” from the album “2020” [released by the group that same year]. I said, “Guys, I only ever sang this song when I was broken. I don’t know how to sing it not broken.” If I had the word “lay,” I’d put an “E” on the end of it to try to push it up to pitch: “layeee.” But right after that, I popped the high notes on [our 1986 hit] “Livin’ on a Prayer.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This new album’s much more of a collaborative record than the ones I’ve made in the past. It’s a celebration of my accepting any and all input and acts of kindness. It’s not been a good decade. It’s not been easy to not be the best guy in the band; it’s not easy to be the worst. It’s humbling but I don’t mind the humility. I just want my tools back. Yesterday, I pressed the point-of-no-return button and said yes, in theory, to a handful of possible shows abroad for the summer, the first ones since the spring of 2022. I’m not an applause junkie. I do it because I love to write a song and play it for people. If I have all my tools, it’ll be a joy. — <em>E.L.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Grooming: Loraine Abeles<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Titus Kaphar,</strong> artist<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1201" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Titus Kaphar sits on an office chair in a gallery space with three large paintings of the exteriors of houses hanging on the walls." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1201" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M/18tmag-beginagain-slide-7H0M-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kaphar, 47, photographed at his studio in New Haven, Conn., on Feb. 22, 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Artwork, from left: Titus Kaphar, “I Knew,” 2023 © Titus Kaphar; Titus Kaphar, “Do You Want It Back?” 2023 © Titus Kaphar; Titus Kaphar, “Some Things Can’t Be Worked Out on Canvas,” 2023 © Titus Kaphar<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Then:</strong> An artist whose works, which often confront family history and the experience of being Black in America, are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, among other institutions. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Now:</strong> Wrote and directed his first feature-length film, “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” which premiered at Sundance in January.

It didn’t take long to realize that what I was doing wasn’t best processed with paintings alone. [The film focuses on a successful artist, Tarrell, played by André Holland, who struggles to deal with the reappearance of his estranged, abusive father, La’Ron, played by John Earl Jelks, who’d force Tarrell to perform grueling manual labor as a child.] The power of painting’s often the absences: what’s not there, what’s implicit. You don’t know what happened before and you don’t know what will happen after. In film, you have an opportunity for elaboration.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’ve tried hard not to read reviews of the film, though a friend sent me one. It was positive but what [the critic] wrote at the end, I’ll never forget. He said, “But I can’t say this film is entertaining.” [<em>Laughs.</em>] With film, some of us expect entertainment, to have a great time. And that response does frame the way we distinguish film from painting. As a painter, I don’t stand in front of [Pablo Picasso’s] “Guernica” and go, “This isn’t entertaining!” I didn’t approach filmmaking as anything different from painting. I wanted the film to be a painting in motion. The way I make decisions in the studio, about how to follow my intuition or instincts, or how to lay out a composition, was the same process I used on set. The difference is I had an extraordinary cinematographer and cast of actors to help me realize the paintings in my head.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At its essence, “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is about generational healing. I took on this project because I wanted to have a conversation with my children about the world I grew up in, which is so different from the world they’ve grown up in. And I think making the film helped resolve something within me. The revelation I had is that I can’t make my father out as the villain in my mind. He’s a victim of violence himself. And even though [he] created challenges for me, I’ve never wondered whether or not he loved me. — <em>M.H.M.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Bárbara Sánchez-Kane,</strong> artist<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2700" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-X4EQ/18tmag-beginagain-slide-X4EQ-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-X4EQ/18tmag-beginagain-slide-X4EQ-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Bárbara Sánchez-Kane wearing a double-breasted black jacket stands in a doorway." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2700" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginagain-slide-X4EQ/18tmag-beginagain-slide-X4EQ-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sánchez-Kane, 36, photographed at his studio (the artist uses she/her and he/him pronouns interchangeably) in Mexico City on Jan. 22, 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ana Topoleanu.

The curators invited me to present a collection from my fashion line that I’d shown in New York, and I said, “No, but maybe I can do a performance.” There’s a kind of freedom in making wearable sculptures because, in the end, clothing has to be ergonomic: The jacket I made with boxing gloves has an opening for your hands so you can eat a burger. But for the ICA show, I created a pair of transparent plastic pants with a metal frame that made them almost impossible to walk in. And last year, for my first New York solo exhibition, at Kurimanzutto gallery, I made a piece from 1,170 black plastic belts that was so big and heavy, I had to break it into parts to show it. I remember reading an article by the queer theorist Jack Halberstam on the work of the artist Gordon Matta-Clark, who would [create] windows in structures where they shouldn’t be. For me, the work is like that: opening windows that give you a different way of seeing what’s in front of you.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I started as an industrial engineer first and then became a fashion designer, but I’ve come to realize that it doesn’t matter what you’ve studied or haven’t. When I feel like the worst sculptor, I think, “Well, at least I’m a good designer.” And when I feel like a great sculptor, I might look at [the clothes in my studio] and think, “Those terrible [expletive] trousers!” Expanding into other fields is a way to embrace yourself. All we have is our imagination, which allows us to create things: objects, garments, skins that we wear when we go out into the world. I’m not saying they’ll save us, but maybe they can help us navigate the transition to another universe. — <em>M.S.</em> <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->These interviews have been edited and condensed.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section>  <div class="g-sharetools-wrapper svelte-16x78r3 g-align-left"> </div></div> <button class="prev svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-ticker"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C7.16345 0 0 7.16345 0 16C0 24.8365 7.16345 32 16 32C24.8365 32 32 24.8365 32 16C32 7.16345 24.8365 0 16 0ZM12.8704 23.7642C13.2925 24.1204 13.9233 24.067 14.2795 23.6449C14.6357 23.2228 14.5823 22.5919 14.1603 22.2358L8.63049 17.5694H26.1055C26.6577 17.5694 27.1055 17.1216 27.1055 16.5694C27.1055 16.0171 26.6577 15.5694 26.1055 15.5694H8.4502L14.1941 10.2607C14.5996 9.8858 14.6245 9.25317 14.2496 8.8476C13.8749 8.44202 13.2422 8.41705 12.8365 8.79193L5.21619 15.835C5.00562 16.0296 4.88867 16.3053 4.89514 16.5919C4.90161 16.8786 5.03088 17.1487 5.25 17.3336L12.8704 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-bial1l">Previous</span></button> <button class="next svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-edletter"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C24.8365 0 32 7.16345 32 16C32 24.8365 24.8365 32 16 32C7.16345 32 0 24.8365 0 16C0 7.16345 7.16345 0 16 0ZM19.1296 23.7642C18.7075 24.1204 18.0767 24.067 17.7205 23.6449C17.3643 23.2228 17.4177 22.5919 17.8397 22.2358L23.3695 17.5694H5.89453C5.34229 17.5694 4.89453 17.1216 4.89453 16.5694C4.89453 16.0171 5.34229 15.5694 5.89453 15.5694H23.5498L17.8059 10.2607C17.4004 9.8858 17.3755 9.25317 17.7504 8.8476C18.1251 8.44202 18.7578 8.41705 19.1635 8.79193L26.7838 15.835C26.9944 16.0296 27.1113 16.3053 27.1049 16.5919C27.0984 16.8786 26.9691 17.1487 26.75 17.3336L19.1296 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-1sbm5cd">Next</span></button></div> </div><div id="18tmag-theend" data-article-id="18tmag-theend" data-slug="18tmag-theend" class="g-article exiting svelte-1yr85b1" style="--progress: 1;"> <div class="g-article-body svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="g-article-cover svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="hed-wrapper svelte-1yr85b1"><h1 class="svelte-bpjjku"><span class="svelte-bpjjku" data-svelte-h="svelte-1nmzwrr">When the <strong class="svelte-bpjjku">Beginning</strong></span> <span class="svelte-bpjjku" data-svelte-h="svelte-jc3q4u">Is Also the <strong class="svelte-bpjjku">End</strong></span> </h1></div> <p class="byline svelte-1yr85b1">By John Wogan and M.H.

My collections dealt with social justice, environmental consciousness and diversity before those topics became mainstream, and some seasons I didn’t sell anything. I never had a sugar daddy, and I invested everything I made back into the company. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I miss New York a lot. I’m homesick for it, but it isn’t the same city, and fashion is very different, too — it feels inauthentic and disconnected from reality. When I was doing consulting and research for Alexander McQueen [in the mid-90s], we had no money. But the energy was amazing. When you don’t have money, that’s when you’re most creative. Now all of these big companies have so much money that it feels like a different world. [Still] I’d love to have the chance to put on one last presentation, one last show to express how I feel today and how I see the world right now. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I left New York, I decided to come to Majorca, where my parents have a farm. I started doing photography accidentally; I had no knowledge of cameras, every day was a process of me learning something totally on my own. There was a 300-year-old well on the property with no water inside, and I realized it could be my studio. It’s kind of like a basement; light comes from a little window high above. It reminds me of my apartment in New York. It’s where I develop my [projects]. I use things that surround me: tulips and rose bushes, fruit trees, a tropical garden, chickens. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I got here, I didn’t have a team [as I did in fashion], and one of the challenges was being surrounded by people who don’t care about what I did or what I’m doing. Photography was the ideal thing to do because I don’t need anybody, I can do it on my own. I don’t have any models; I started working with mannequins and, for many years, I collected them on eBay or from secondhand stores on the island. [I decided] I’d rather not use models — when you photograph human beings, they’re pretending or acting, and I was running away from that.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s been nine years since I found photography, and I’m really happy. I have a monograph coming out later this year. The photographs are like my biography. I’ve developed my style in photography and I have a creative language.

His contemporary Norman Mailer would write of him that at his best, “He writes so perfectly that one can never forget the experience of reading him.” “Invisible Man,” a surreal picaresque that follows an unnamed Black protagonist — “a man of substance, of flesh and bone,” Ellison writes — as he travels through a country full of people who “refuse to see me,” is a book of such remarkable confidence that Ellison’s career, in later years, became mired in questions of what next? Ellison, a prolific writer of essays, reviews and criticism, worked for years on a follow-up, suffering one setback when a 1967 house fire destroyed portions of his manuscript. When he died in 1994, he left behind thousands of pages of drafts, fragments and unfinished tangents. Ellison’s literary executor and longtime friend, John F. Callahan, tried to edit the material down into a “single, coherent narrative,” as he put it, and published the result, called “Juneteenth,” in 1999; the New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani called it “disappointingly provisional and incomplete.” Ellison often struggled with writing. He once likened his second novel to a “bad case of constipation” and, in a 1958 letter to his friend the author Saul Bellow, Ellison wrote, “I’ve got a natural writer’s block as big as the Ritz and as stubborn as a grease spot on a gabardine suit.” — <em>M.H.M.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Charles Laughton,</strong> actor and director, 1899-1962<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1345" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Charles Laughton sits in a director's chair wearing a straw hat with a girl looking through a viewfinder in his lap." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1345" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF/18tmag-theend-slide-YELF-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The actor turned director Charles Laughton with the actress Sally Jane Bruce on the set of “The Night of the Hunter” (1955).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Everett Collection<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Born in the last year of the 19th century, Charles Laughton left his family’s successful hotel business at the age of 26 to study acting at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. What he lacked in movie star looks — the critic J. Hoberman described him as “coarse-featured, overweight and slovenly” — he made up for in talent. Following a successful stage career in London’s West End, he turned to film, making a name for himself as a versatile character actor in the 1930s and ’40s. In 1955, at the age of 55, he made his most indelible contribution to his craft, directing “The Night of the Hunter,” a film noir so dark it easily passes today as horror. (William Friedkin, the director of 1973’s “The Exorcist,” described it as “one of the scariest films ever made.”) Robert Mitchum plays a terrifying ex-convict posing as a preacher and stalking the children of his former cellmate in order to find a hidden fortune. While casting Lillian Gish in the role of the children’s caretaker, Laughton told the actress about his disappointment in audiences’ lack of attention for movies, how they “slump down with their heads back, or eat candy and popcorn. I want them to sit up straight again,” he said. Though now often ranked among the greatest American movies, “The Night of the Hunter” — released just a few years before Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” (1960) made the psychological thriller into a marketable genre — was a commercial flop. Reviews were mixed; The New York Times’s Bosley Crowther called it “a weird and intriguing endeavor.” Years later, Terry Sanders, a second-unit director of the film, wrote that “the rejection by critics and the indifference of audiences hit [Laughton] hard and crushed his spirit. It wasn’t just disappointment he felt, it was utter and deeply debilitating devastation.” He never directed a second movie. — <em>M.H.M.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Willis Alan Ramsey,</strong> 73, Loveland, Colo.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2400" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 769px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Willis Alan Ramsey stands with his hands behind his back wearing a cowboy hat." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2400" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey, photographed at Sam’s Town Point bar in Austin, Texas, on March 14, 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Caleb Santiago Alvarado<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey, originally from Alabama, released his self-titled debut album in 1972, becoming a forebear of the alt-country genre.

My first song was just awful, but I got better over time. I dropped out of college twice, the second time in 1970, from the University of Texas [at Austin], after discovering a folk club where I became an opening act for $5 a night. Those were golden, halcyon days in Austin filled with sunshine and margaritas and very little traffic. That fall, I left to begin performing at colleges around the country. I was briefly back in Austin to play at U.T. and, somehow, during two days there, I’d managed to play for Gregg Allman and Leon Russell, two of the most influential musicians of that decade. They both gave me their cards and said to look them up if I ever made it their way. [I went to Los Angeles] and recorded a demo at Skyhill, Leon’s personal home studio, and he basically offered me the moon to sign with his new label, Shelter Records [which folded in 1981]. I’d just turned 20. Over the next year, I recorded my first and only album to ever be released [“Willis Alan Ramsey,” often known as the Green Album for its green cover].<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I finished the record when I was 21. I was just a kid. Leon gave me my career, to the extent that I’ve had one [but the reason I never released another record was also] Leon’s fault. He told me that if I signed with Shelter, he’d show me the studio and how it worked, and he did. I immediately wanted to learn everything I could about the recording process. I used seven studios and three rhythm sections [to make the record]. I was given carte blanche. The budget was 85 grand. I could do it for 200 grand [now], but I can’t do it any cheaper. I’d need to rehearse every musician. And my songs are all over the place. I get bored doing one particular style.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’m the most frustrated recording artist you’ve probably ever met in your life. But I still feel I’ll figure something out. I’ve always been optimistic. I’ve got at least three more records of material.

(a stand-in for the writer’s hometown, Monroeville), who defends a Black man from a false accusation of rape by a white woman, became one of the biggest literary sensations of its era. Lee, who worked as an airline reservations agent in New York for a few years before quitting (with friends’ financial support) to work on her writing, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961; two years later, a film adaptation starring Gregory Peck won three Academy Awards. “To Kill a Mockingbird” would go on to sell tens of millions of copies and become a fixture of high school English classes. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lee had a hard time with her sudden fame. After that radio interview in 1964, she mostly avoided the press and, as the years and decades passed without a second novel, Lee continued to guard her privacy, albeit regularly attending the Methodist Church in Monroeville and occasionally visiting the local high school during lessons about her work. The year before she died at age 89 in 2016, a previously unknown novel, “Go Set a Watchman,” which had been written before “To Kill a Mockingbird,” appeared to tepid reviews and claims that Lee, by then largely deaf and blind following a stroke, had been manipulated into releasing subpar work. Controversy aside, even just the announcement of a lost novel reignited interest in Lee’s lone masterpiece; at that point, sales of “To Kill a Mockingbird” in trade paperback nearly tripled. — <em>M.H.M.</em> <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->These interviews have been edited and condensed. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section>  <div class="g-sharetools-wrapper svelte-16x78r3 g-align-left"> </div></div> <button class="prev svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-ticker"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C7.16345 0 0 7.16345 0 16C0 24.8365 7.16345 32 16 32C24.8365 32 32 24.8365 32 16C32 7.16345 24.8365 0 16 0ZM12.8704 23.7642C13.2925 24.1204 13.9233 24.067 14.2795 23.6449C14.6357 23.2228 14.5823 22.5919 14.1603 22.2358L8.63049 17.5694H26.1055C26.6577 17.5694 27.1055 17.1216 27.1055 16.5694C27.1055 16.0171 26.6577 15.5694 26.1055 15.5694H8.4502L14.1941 10.2607C14.5996 9.8858 14.6245 9.25317 14.2496 8.8476C13.8749 8.44202 13.2422 8.41705 12.8365 8.79193L5.21619 15.835C5.00562 16.0296 4.88867 16.3053 4.89514 16.5919C4.90161 16.8786 5.03088 17.1487 5.25 17.3336L12.8704 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-bial1l">Previous</span></button> <button class="next svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-edletter"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C24.8365 0 32 7.16345 32 16C32 24.8365 24.8365 32 16 32C7.16345 32 0 24.8365 0 16C0 7.16345 7.16345 0 16 0ZM19.1296 23.7642C18.7075 24.1204 18.0767 24.067 17.7205 23.6449C17.3643 23.2228 17.4177 22.5919 17.8397 22.2358L23.3695 17.5694H5.89453C5.34229 17.5694 4.89453 17.1216 4.89453 16.5694C4.89453 16.0171 5.34229 15.5694 5.89453 15.5694H23.5498L17.8059 10.2607C17.4004 9.8858 17.3755 9.25317 17.7504 8.8476C18.1251 8.44202 18.7578 8.41705 19.1635 8.79193L26.7838 15.835C26.9944 16.0296 27.1113 16.3053 27.1049 16.5919C27.0984 16.8786 26.9691 17.1487 26.75 17.3336L19.1296 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-1sbm5cd">Next</span></button></div> </div><div id="18tmag-juvenilia" data-article-id="18tmag-juvenilia" data-slug="18tmag-juvenilia" class="g-article exiting svelte-1yr85b1" style="--progress: 1;"> <div class="g-article-body svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="g-article-cover svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="hed-wrapper svelte-1yr85b1"><h1 class="svelte-bpjjku"><span class="svelte-bpjjku">J</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">u</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">v</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">e</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">n</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">i</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">l</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">i</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">a</span> </h1></div> <p class="byline svelte-1yr85b1">Interviews by Julia Halperin, Kate Guadagnino and Juan A.

I was completely intrigued by the people gathering the garbage outside of our house in Antwerp [Belgium] — their truck, their dress code. During a summer day, I took out my colored pencils. I wrote underneath the drawing, “My Big Vacation.” <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It came across as fairly cynical: My big vacation was garbage. It wasn’t meant that way. I really was intrigued by this operation. [Looking at it now] I’m amazed that there’s this perspective already in it. The teacher didn’t believe I made the drawing and took me by the ear to the blackboard to do it again in front of the class.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’d been bullied a lot as a kid. I was extremely shy. Drawing was a way out, in a sense. I’d draw people who came to visit my parents and, at the end of the year, when exams were done, I’d make drawings for the whole class — whatever they wanted. I always had a ballpoint pen and a piece of paper with me, and people would gather around me while I was drawing, sometimes 20 to 30 of them. The kids were happy to have a drawing, but it didn’t really change the bullying pattern.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I saved most of my [childhood] drawings and gave them to my nephew. Unluckily, he lost them. This is virtually the only one that survived, and I gave it to my wife as a present. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s quite interesting to see the size of things — the difference between the houses and the people — and most of all, the idea of space that was already in the drawing. [If I were to redraw this today] it’d be a bit more meticulous, more worked out. But it’s an indication of things that would come later. My skepticism is embedded in this drawing without my doing that consciously — this quite specific, sardonic sense of humor. When I found it again, I had to laugh very, very hard. — <em>J.H.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Do Ho Suh, 62, visual artist<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1561" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1561" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-L6NJ-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Do Ho Suh, “Tiger Mask” (1971).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Courtesy of the artist © Do Ho Suh<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This drawing is based on a Japanese anime character, Tiger Mask, that was really popular in the ’70s. Back in those days, Korean TV broadcast Japanese anime in black and white. Everybody at school watched. The character is a pro wrestler who puts on a tiger mask to disguise his identity. I drew the mask directly from the anime. I was probably 9. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Once my friends saw it, they all wanted one. Demand for tiger masks became much greater than supply. Some of the rich kids wanted to trade their Japanese pencils — which had graphics or custom characters on the surface — and colorful erasers for a drawing. My parents couldn’t afford those things, and they weren’t available in Korea. The kids’ parents must have traveled to Japan, which was quite rare back then, and brought them back. [Eventually] I had a box full of those pencils, but I didn’t have the guts to actually use them. The pencils are untouched; the erasers are dried out. For some reason, my mom kept them all these years. — <em>J.H.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Niki Nakayama, 49, chef and Restaurant owner<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Tonkatsu is a Japanese home-style staple. It’s a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet — “ton” means “pork” and “katsu” is a sort of translation of “cutlet” — and it was my absolute favorite food when I was a kid. When my mom made tonkatsu, she’d have my sister and me do the breading, and we really bonded over that. It helped me understand family. We’d set up in the dining room and dredge the cutlets in flour, dip them into the egg wash, cover them with dried breadcrumbs and stack them high on paper plates that we’d bring in to my mother to fry up. Our kitchen had high countertops, and I can remember her standing at the stove in these three-inch platform clogs she’d wear to be a little taller. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I loved seeing how something became something else — it felt like unraveling magic. One day when I was about 9, I came home from school and got the brilliant idea to make my own [but with chicken]. I grabbed some drumsticks from the freezer, did the breading and, while standing on a stool, dipped them in hot oil. (I never admitted this to my mom.) When they turned the color they were supposed to, I was so proud. I bit into one and it was still frozen. That was my first shock of “I can’t believe I didn’t make [this thing] the way I imagined it would be.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Anytime I was in Japan, especially in my 20s, my friends there would ask what subarashii gochiso, or “the best thing one could possibly eat,” was for me. I’d say tonkatsu, and they’d be like, “What?!,” because it’s such a simple dish — it was like asking for a sandwich. It isn’t the sort of thing I specialize in at my restaurant [N/Naka in Los Angeles], and I don’t have it often anymore because, as I age, I’m trying to eat lighter, but I still associate it with deliciousness and with happiness. Ever since childhood, I’ve thought of food as being about coming together and cooking as an expression of care and love. Having been on the receiving end of that, I do the work that I do to try to make people happy. — <em>K.G.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Marina Abramović, 77, performance artist<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1590" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A painting of two vehicles crashing into each other." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1590" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ/18tmag-juvenilia-slide-QOKQ-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Marina Abramović, “Truck Accident (I)” (1963).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->© Marina Abramović/Courtesy of the Marina Abramović Archives/ARS, 2024<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I was a teenager in Communist Yugoslavia, there were these ugly green trucks that weighed so much, they often fell over.

Then I went to the gifted and talented program with high school art students from all over Austin, Texas. I wasn’t the best anymore, but it just made me work harder. That’s where I was first introduced to the work of Henry Ossawa Tanner [one of the first African American painters to achieve international fame, in the early 20th century]. I didn’t even know there were Black artists. We didn’t have the internet or access to museums.

When we did the play on Broadway, my grandmother was still alive and came to see the show. She was supportive of it, but I feel like she liked this version better. — <em>J.A.R.</em> <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->These interviews have been edited and condensed. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section>  <div class="g-sharetools-wrapper svelte-16x78r3 g-align-left"> </div></div> <button class="prev svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-ticker"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C7.16345 0 0 7.16345 0 16C0 24.8365 7.16345 32 16 32C24.8365 32 32 24.8365 32 16C32 7.16345 24.8365 0 16 0ZM12.8704 23.7642C13.2925 24.1204 13.9233 24.067 14.2795 23.6449C14.6357 23.2228 14.5823 22.5919 14.1603 22.2358L8.63049 17.5694H26.1055C26.6577 17.5694 27.1055 17.1216 27.1055 16.5694C27.1055 16.0171 26.6577 15.5694 26.1055 15.5694H8.4502L14.1941 10.2607C14.5996 9.8858 14.6245 9.25317 14.2496 8.8476C13.8749 8.44202 13.2422 8.41705 12.8365 8.79193L5.21619 15.835C5.00562 16.0296 4.88867 16.3053 4.89514 16.5919C4.90161 16.8786 5.03088 17.1487 5.25 17.3336L12.8704 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-bial1l">Previous</span></button> <button class="next svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-edletter"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C24.8365 0 32 7.16345 32 16C32 24.8365 24.8365 32 16 32C7.16345 32 0 24.8365 0 16C0 7.16345 7.16345 0 16 0ZM19.1296 23.7642C18.7075 24.1204 18.0767 24.067 17.7205 23.6449C17.3643 23.2228 17.4177 22.5919 17.8397 22.2358L23.3695 17.5694H5.89453C5.34229 17.5694 4.89453 17.1216 4.89453 16.5694C4.89453 16.0171 5.34229 15.5694 5.89453 15.5694H23.5498L17.8059 10.2607C17.4004 9.8858 17.3755 9.25317 17.7504 8.8476C18.1251 8.44202 18.7578 8.41705 19.1635 8.79193L26.7838 15.835C26.9944 16.0296 27.1113 16.3053 27.1049 16.5919C27.0984 16.8786 26.9691 17.1487 26.75 17.3336L19.1296 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-1sbm5cd">Next</span></button></div> </div><div id="18tmag-beginners" data-article-id="18tmag-beginners" data-slug="18tmag-beginners" class="g-article exiting svelte-1yr85b1" style="--progress: 1;"> <div class="g-article-body svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="g-article-cover svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="hed-wrapper svelte-1yr85b1"><h1 class="svelte-bpjjku"><span class="svelte-bpjjku">Begin</span><span class="svelte-bpjjku">ners</span> </h1></div> <p class="byline svelte-1yr85b1">Interviews by Juan A.

What I find fabulous about Chekhov is that there are sad situations but also human comedy. You have to find the funny if you’re in dire straits, otherwise you’ll slit your wrists.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>How she feels about having her Broadway debut after five decades on the New York stage:</strong> “You live long enough, [expletive] happens. I’d kind of figured, ‘Maybe I’m not Broadway material.’ Usually, when Asians get cast, it’s a musical, and I’m not a singer-dancer, so it was never necessarily going to be a goal. I’m a little bit more realistic: I recently got a text [with a photo of the ‘Uncle Vanya’ ad] from a colleague who said, ‘Look at Miss Fancy Pants,’ and I’m like, ‘I’m just a working stiff.’”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>How she reinterprets classics:</strong> “From the get-go, the point of NAATCO was to ask people to open their vistas in terms of ‘how, what, by whom, for whom’ in theater. We tackled the Western classics first — William Shakespeare’s ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ (1600) and Thornton Wilder’s ‘Our Town’ (1938) — and my only caveat was not to change them to Asian settings. I remember the first couple of years, maybe decades, people always used to ask, ‘Oh, you’re doing Shakespeare! Are you going to set it in Japan?’ Which isn’t bad, but it’s not the only way to do it. Reception was mixed; there was criticism from both Asian and non-Asian audiences. When we started to do new work — with Michael Golamco’s ‘Cowboy Versus Samurai’ in 2005 — it became a redefinition of what immigrant stories were. Most of the time, the work’s thought of as only one thing, so that was something to figure out. But you can say that about all good theater: It’s asking you to receive something in a different way.” — <em>J.A.R.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><div><header><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-wide svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1440" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Arielle Smith stands with her hands behind her back in the corner of a dance studio." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1440" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR/18tmag-beginners-slide-83GR-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Smith, photographed at Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance in the London suburb of Twickenham on Feb. 14, 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Andrea Urbez<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Name: <strong>Arielle Smith</strong><br />Profession: <strong>Choreographer</strong><br />Age: <strong>27</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2></header> </div><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Debuting in:</strong> A reimagined “Carmen,” based on the French writer Prosper Mérimée’s 1845 novella about a Roma woman in southern Spain, which Smith has set instead in Cuba for the version (of the same name) she’s choreographing that premieres at San Francisco Ballet this month.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>What she’s excited about:</strong> “As a performer, I trained in classical ballet but then went into contemporary dance — the reason I fell out of love with ballet was that the female roles didn’t feel empowering. Not that I needed to be empowered all the time, but every story was dictated by the relationship a woman has to a man. So when Tamara [Rojo, the company’s artistic director] approached me, my first thought was, ‘How could we justify another “Carmen”?’ I wondered how the story would change if one of her lovers was a woman. Musically it’s also not the same — we’ve got a new score from the Mexican Cuban composer Arturo O’Farrill [departing from the French composer Georges Bizet’s 1875 opera], so it’s quite a leap from where it was birthed.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>What she’s nervous about:</strong> “I don’t see the point in telling a story again the same way, so that’s one element I’m not nervous about ... but I’m about everything else.

I’m Cuban; Tamara’s Spanish; and [the Uruguayan fashion designer] Gabriela Hearst is our costume designer. It’s a full Latinx team, but we’re all different. And this is a universal story that’s not driven by geography. It’s not set on a certain road in Havana but in the soul of these people. I’m not trying to overly examine Cuba.

There’s this sense that it’s not necessarily a performance when we’re doing these shows; it’s not showy.

It has to do with quote-unquote diversity in the workplace, and it feels like we’ve gone through three different cycles of that conversation since I started writing it.

I was never a theater kid; film was my first love — I’d done my thesis in screenwriting. After I graduated [from New York University], I’d written a play, and I used that to get into the [playwriting] group. The idea for ‘Jordans’ came partly from my own experience post-grad of being fired three times in a row and being like, ‘What’s going on?’ I was also trying to express something about being the only Black person entering all these professional spaces.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>How the play’s surrealist tone came to be:</strong> “The main character gets coffee poured on her face in the first scene.

I’ve had a long collaboration with him [Peck has based six ballets on Stevens’s music, beginning with “Year of the Rabbit” for New York City Ballet in 2012], so it feels full circle, having discovered that album as a teenager.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>What he’s nervous about:</strong> “It’s not a conventional musical; it lives between genres. It’s framed as a gathering around a campfire, being intoxicated by the heat … a campfire beckons storytelling. We enter into the worlds of these people sharing stories on an evening in the wilderness. That’s a difficult thing for managing audience expectations. One of the most challenging parts is trying to tell a full story without words. There are lyrics, but even the lyrics have a sense of poetry to them. They’re not literal.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>How he brought on board his collaborator Jackie Sibblies Drury:</strong> “Sufjan was involved early in developing the musical arrangements but has been relatively hands-off [since being diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, last year] and wasn’t in a place where he wanted to go back to that time in his life. I needed a storytelling partner. Jackie told me how much she loved the album; when she moved to Chicago, she and her then boyfriend listened to it on the road there. A lot of these songs resonated with both of us at a coming-of-age time in our lives, and that’s part of our approach: intimate and personal.” — <em>J.A.R.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Production: Shay Johnson Studio.

She’ll say, “Tell me what you think about the hair,” and, “Tell me if there’re any outfits you don’t like.” She even made a playlist Jessica would listen to. There’s Avril Lavigne, Girlpool, Sabrina Carpenter. When I’m studying the script, I’ll play that in the background. Jessica’s into the dreamy side of London and Jane Austen. She’s a little girlie and wears a lot of pink. She wears [nightgowns] as actual dresses and things that’re a little bit too cute for work. I sent [the costume designer] Arielle [Cooper-Lethem] some dresses from Fashion Brand Company. They look like [they could be in an Austen adaptation] but modern and sexier. Like shirts with ribbons all over or matching sets made of lace. Everything’s kind of funny but also hot. It’s stuff I would’ve worn when I thought I was straight. I feel like Jessica’s the straight version of me. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s interesting to be playing a version of someone whose work I’ve admired for so long.

It wasn’t until he took part in the 2020 show “Siembra” at the gallery Kurimanzutto in Mexico City, though, that the art world took notice of his dreamlike Surrealist works.

I’m inspired by my surroundings — by the jungle, by the ocean. I often say there’s no better background than the ocean for painting. I have two studios: one at home, where I work on paper, and a painting studio in town near the ocean. Usually, I start at home on paper. I either sketch or use watercolor wash. If I’m going to do an oil painting, I go to the studio in town. Before I work, I might just sit around and look at books — I like [monographs about Henri] Matisse, [Paul] Cezanne, [Edouard] Manet. It’s sort of a meditation. A lot of times, an idea surges when I’m working on something already; other times, it might be a memory. Or a dream. The other day, I had a dream that I was taking a photo with my phone of a house on fire — but I was conscious that the house was a drawing. [When I woke up] I thought, “Well, I should do a painting of that.” <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’m very intrigued by how memory works and how the memory of something can trigger [a new idea]. [While putting together the career survey] I’ve revisited all of these old works of mine. Some I remember painting. Others I don’t remember at all. I’m 73 years old. I forget things, and then I start thinking, “Wow, this is interesting because if I’m working from memory and forgetting things, how’s that going to affect the work that I do? How can I explore that?” For instance, somebody sent me a painting they said was mine. I said, “No, I didn’t do that painting. I’m sorry,” only to find out that I’d signed the back. A lot of the ideas I’ve been working on come from the past. In the [2022] Venice Biennale, I had a painting [“Up,” 2021] of somebody hanging upside down or falling through the sky. That came [about] when I walked into the studio and noticed I had inadvertently put a painting upside down. I said, “Actually, that’ll make a good painting upside down.” I don’t know how other artists work. I’m very open to ideas.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Reimagining a Retrospective<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="video">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media" style="--ratio: 320 / 240;">  <noscript><video class="g-video readystate-0 svelte-1d6mogr" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/04/08/117220_1_jenny-holzer-loop_wg_240p.mp4" autoplay poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/autossell/holzer-still/holzer-still-articleLarge.jpg" width="" height=""  loop playsinline preload="auto" disableremoteplayback muted></video></noscript></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The conceptual artist Jenny Holzer, photographed at her studio in upstate New York on Feb. 6, 2024, with LED text from her series “Survival” (1983-85), which will be on view at her exhibition at the Solomon R.

The first was “A Doll’s House” (1879), starring Jessica Chastain. Herzog’s latest staging, “An Enemy of the People” (1882), stars Jeremy Strong as Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a physician who is shunned for warning his town that its lucrative public baths are contaminated. Michael Imperioli plays his brother, Peter Stockmann, the mayor, who seeks to suppress Thomas’s findings.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I begin an adaptation, I first read a few different translations of the play. Then I try to get those out of my head. For “A Doll’s House” and now “An Enemy of the People,” I’ve worked with a translator named Charlotte Barslund. She does a literal translation in English, which stays as close to the feeling and meaning of the original Norwegian as possible. I go through that line by line, translating it into my own words without making any big decisions. Once I have my first version, I start the bigger work of cutting. For “An Enemy of the People,” we cut three characters. I decided to cut the character of Katherine, Thomas Stockmann’s wife, after a lot of conversations with Sam [Gold, the play’s director and Herzog’s husband]. Her sections weren’t working; they were feeling really turgid. There’re sections that his daughter, Petra [played by Victoria Pedretti], could pick up if Katherine was gone.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What was remarkable about cutting Katherine was realizing how little had to change. The fact that you didn’t have to do major surgery on the play was one tell that cutting Katherine was a good idea. It gives Stockmann this recent terrible grief. It’s a particular grief when you’re a doctor, I think, to lose a spouse — to be the doctor who can’t save your loved ones. That spring loads the play as it begins: He’s reaching a place where he can have happiness again — [only] to be completely betrayed by his community and to lose everything he’s finally gained.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ibsen wrote domestic psychological plays and social plays. “A Doll’s House” is the former and “An Enemy of the People” the latter. [When adapting “A Doll’s House”] I learned some pretty basic things about the mechanics of making it feel leaner and more modern. But other than that, it was shockingly different to translate them and humbling that he had plays that were so totally different inside of him. This play is bigger and rangier and even more relevant than “A Doll’s House.” It’s very timely — there’re a few headlines it brings up. One is climate change. I was reading a lot about scientists who weren’t listened to when they tried to sound the alarm years ago. I was also reading Naomi Klein’s [2023 memoir] “Doppelganger” and thinking about the way the body politic becomes sick. I try to do a lot of research before writing — I read a fair amount of Ibsen biographies — so there’s no single influence that’s too loud while I’m working. When I’m really doing the translation, I need quiet and cloistering. So there’d be gaps in my communication with [Jeremy] and everyone else. Then there’d be the moments, after reading a draft, when it was time to talk and become porous again.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Jeremy was the reason for the production. From the moment I began to work on “An Enemy of the People,” I knew who was playing Thomas Stockmann. I’ve known Jeremy since 1997, and I’ve seen a ton of his work, so his voice was influencing the way I adapted that character. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->[Jeremy and Dr. Stockmann] are similar in that they both have a total commitment to what they believe in. Having someone in my life with that kind of devotion to his craft and to his storytelling means that I’m coming to [the character] with the texture of a real, contemporary person. Every few days, he sends me a poem or an article or something that’s meant something to him related to the play. He sent me the William Butler Yeats poem “A Coat.” The first three lines are “I made my song a coat / Covered with embroideries / Out of old mythologies.” There’s this incidental line in Ibsen’s original [script] that people often cut — but I didn’t, I love it — when Captain Horster [Dr. Stockmann’s loyal friend] makes his first entrance before you even see Dr. Stockmann, who says, “Hang your coat on that peg. Oh, you don’t wear an overcoat?” Captain Horster is this character who has no pretense and is an uncorrupted type of human. And Ibsen has him coatless at the beginning. So the idea of a coat and what it is to cover yourself has become an interesting thematic touch point for us.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Putting Up a Gallery Show<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Since graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1999, the visual artist Joe Bradley, 49, has made a habit of reinvention. His style continuously shifts, from mixed-media sculptures to line drawings to highly saturated large-scale canvases. His most recent exhibition of paintings opens this month at David Zwirner gallery in New York.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I tend to arrive at my studio [in Long Island City, Queens] around nine, turn the lights on, make a pot of coffee. Then, depending on what sort of stage the paintings are at, I’ll just start working. If it’s early on [in the piece], I’m much more active. When the paintings [begin] to come together, it’s a lot more about just looking and making little decisions to resolve things. I don’t have a real ritual. I don’t even have to be in any particular state of mind. If I’m distracted or depressed or happy or whatever, I just come in and see what happens.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I do begin with some practical decisions. I know how big the painting is going to be and what sort of surface I’m going to be working on. I know what the contour of [a show] will look like. I don’t make any sort of preparatory sketches — the paintings reveal themselves to me through the process of working on them. But the deadline [for the show] ends up being this organizing force. It’s the day your entire year revolves around, the time [by which] you know the paintings will have to be presentable and cohesive. It’s helpful to have that because, otherwise, you could keep things up in the air indefinitely.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I paint today, I might be responding to a mark on the canvas that I made six weeks or six months ago. What I’m doing early in the process isn’t going to be available visually by the end — most of it’ll be painted out or it’ll disappear in the process. I lay traps or create little problems for myself to encounter. It’s almost like the uglier it gets in the early stages, the better the painting will be. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Building an Installation<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2700" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-howitbegins-slide-9VYW/18tmag-howitbegins-slide-9VYW-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-howitbegins-slide-9VYW/18tmag-howitbegins-slide-9VYW-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Suzanne Jackson sits on a bucket assembling a sculptural work involving paper or plastic and wire mesh." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2700" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-howitbegins-slide-9VYW/18tmag-howitbegins-slide-9VYW-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The artist Suzanne Jackson, photographed at her Savannah, Ga., studio on Feb. 1, 2024, works on a piece that will eventually be installed on a terrace at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kendrick Brinson<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The Savannah, Ga.-based artist Suzanne Jackson, 80, has worked as a dancer, a set and costume designer, a professor and a poet — but most notably as a painter.

It’s an installation that’ll climb the walls of the terrace and partially fill the open space. My approach is quite different than if I were working on a painting in my studio: I have to think of it in an architectural or sculptural sense. There’re technical aspects, so I’ve been doing a lot of research in airports and from airplane windows, looking at large-scale structures that don’t fall down — things on the rooftops of buildings like windsocks or poles. This piece will be built from the ground up, unlike my other work that hangs from the walls or ceiling.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I don’t go looking for ideas. I just go into the studio and start painting. Now that I’m older and not teaching, I don’t have to do anything except paint. In the morning, I roam around the house. I do the laundry. I feed the cats. I look out the window and stare at nature. I have a big window at the end of my kitchen and can see tall trees and birds and animals and insects. I go through the studio to get to the kitchen from my bedroom, so sometimes I end up stopping and looking at work I’ve already done. There’s a lot of sitting and thinking and looking. Sometimes, I’ll turn on music — Charles Mingus and Eric Dolphy or Yo-Yo Ma. On Mondays and Fridays, it’s [the Savannah radio D.J. and jazz historian] Ike Carter’s show “Impressions.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As the music flows, so does the paint — that’s a spiritual environment to be in. Other times, I’ll work in absolute silence. At the beginning, I explore. I’m never quite sure what’s going to happen. Usually, it comes spontaneously. One brushstroke leads to the next, and then it becomes another idea. I might think I have one idea when I start, but it often changes along the way to be something completely opposite. I’m just having a good time being a painter.

My family tells me that I made my first poem when I was a year and a half old: “I like mice because they’re nice.” [In my early 30s, after working for five years] as an intelligence analyst, I went to the Iowa Writers’ Workshop for fiction. I hadn’t really been reading fiction, though, so I wasn’t very good at writing it. I spent most of my second year there translating short stories written by my instructor [the Chilean novelist] José Donoso.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Growing up, I had all these exposures to beauty. I’d gone to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston as a child and seen [Paul] Gauguin’s “Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?,” a painting that continues to influence me. And my mother was a dress designer. She redid our house every six months. By the time I was 10, I basically had everything that I’m now working with in place, but I didn’t have the language. I didn’t get that language until the early 1970s, when I read [the critic and curator] Lucy Lippard’s “Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object From 1966 to 1972.” [Then] I was ready. The ideas for my visual art already existed within my experience. I just hadn’t known they were art before. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A few years later, when I was in my early 40s, I had to have a biopsy of my breast. After — thank God, it was negative for cancer — I was thinking about what I could give my doctor as a thank-you present. Reading my copy of the Sunday New York Times, I saw a line in the sports pages about Julius Erving that said, “The doctor is operating again.” I said, “OK, this could be the start of something,” and I made a really good poem for my doctor [out of words clipped from the newspaper]. But when I finished the poem, I said, “This is too good to give to him.” Then I immediately started making newspaper poems for a project called “Cutting Out The New York Times.” I made one every week for 26 weeks. When I finished, I realized that I’d become a visual artist — or revealed that I was a visual artist. — <em>interview by J.C.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Toni Morrison, <!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->1931-2019<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The author of 11 novels, including “Beloved,” “Sula” and “Song of Solomon.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By the time Toni Morrison wrote “Beloved” (1987), her best-known novel, she’d worked for nearly two decades as a book editor. Her debut, “The Bluest Eye” (1970), was published when she was 39 and, while not a commercial success, was critically praised. She published three more books between 1973 and 1981 — including “Song of Solomon” — while still at her editing job. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Prior to going into publishing, Morrison — who had a master’s degree in American literature from Cornell University — spent nearly a decade teaching college English. After her divorce, she worked for a textbook division of Random House before joining Random House proper as its first Black female editor; there, she championed and published Black authors such as Angela Davis, June Jordan, Gayl Jones and Toni Cade Bambara. “I didn’t go to anything. I didn’t join anything,” she once said about the civil rights movement. “But I could make sure there was a published record of those who did march and did put themselves on the line.” All the while, Morrison was waking by dawn to write before heading into the office. She’d later describe those sessions as a form of liberation: “The writing was the real freedom because nobody told me what to do there. That was my world and my imagination. And all my life it’s been that way.” <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For many years, Morrison considered her day job essential to her art. “I thrive on the urgency that doing more than one thing provides,” she once said. But the industry had its difficulties — the overwhelming whiteness, the increasing commercial demands — and she left her position in 1983. Four years later, at age 56, she published “Beloved.” In a preface to the 2004 edition of the book, she looks back on the rush of feelings she experienced following her last day at the job. “I was happy, free in a way I had never been, ever. It was the oddest sensation. Not ecstasy, not satisfaction, not a surfeit of pleasure or accomplishment. It was a purer delight, a rogue anticipation with certainty.

I remember my first sale, to my aunt Julie. She wanted me to copy [Jean-François] Millet’s “The Gleaners.” I didn’t want to copy someone else’s stuff — I think one of the reasons I’m popular is that I’m very original — but I still did the painting, of course.

Elton John and Gianni Versace bought my paintings. I don’t want anyone to have the impression — which certain people seem to — that I took up painting just because I stopped doing drag.

I became a performer, and I’ve been doing cabaret for many years. In 2008, when I broke up my cabaret act Kiki and Herb, my rent was so cheap that I didn’t have to work as much. I started painting again, and it flows very naturally for me.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->My watercolors are primarily portraits of people I know. I’ll ask them to pose for a photograph and then paint from that. I also make pseudo fan art, like my “Witch Eyes” series, which is based on iconic photographs of celebrities’ eyes. The wonderful thing about painting is that you have total control over it, if you’re lucky. Onstage, there’re so many variables. And with painting, you don’t have to be there [when people see your work]. I love being in front of an audience, but I don’t really love being among people. The pleasure for me is singing but, when the show’s over, I have to talk to a lot of people. I like all of them, but there’re too many, so it can be a little overwhelming. You don’t ever get to connect on a deeper level. The most satisfying times in my life have been when my shows have been installed and it’s the night before the opening. All of it’s exactly how I want it — the room, the lighting — and I just sit there and look and have this sense of utter satisfaction. — <em>interview by J.C.</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Wallace Stevens, <!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->1879-1955<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The poet, whose best known works include “The Emperor of Ice-Cream,” “The Snow Man” and “Anecdote of the Jar.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Wallace Stevens never quit his day job. Though he had literary ambitions as a young man, serving as the editor of the Harvard Advocate as an undergraduate, he earned his degree from New York Law School and in 1916 joined the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, where he remained, specializing in surety and fidelity claims, until his death, in 1955. Yet he was writing all the time: on his daily walk to work, at home in the evenings and sometimes in the office.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It wasn’t until 1914, when Stevens was 34, that his first post-college poems appeared in literary journals. He went on to publish seven volumes of poetry over the course of his lifetime. The first, “Harmonium,” released in 1923, sold fewer than 100 copies; the last, 1954’s “The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens,” won the Pulitzer Prize. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The themes of Stevens’s work — the affirming power of art and beauty, the sublime contained within the mundane — suggest one reason why he stuck with insurance law even as his artistic acclaim grew. His steady paycheck would have allowed writing to remain a purely creative act. In his essay “Surety and Fidelity Claims,” Stevens says of his insurance work, “You sign a lot of drafts. You see surprisingly few people. ... You don’t even see the country; you see law offices and hotel rooms.” Poetry, on the other hand — as he characterizes it in 1923’s “Of Modern Poetry” — “must be the finding of a satisfaction.” It was his livelihood, in the most artistic sense of the word.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Theaster Gates, <!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->50, Chicago<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The University of Chicago professor and multidisciplinary artist, whose solo shows at the Gagosian gallery in Le Bourget, France, and the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo open this month.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2400" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 769px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="A sculpture resembling a piano covered with white metal." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2400" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT/18tmag-halloffame-slide-28KT-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Theaster Gates’s sculptural work “Sweet Sanctuary, Your Embrace” (2023).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->© Theaster Gates.

The show grew out of a desire to grapple with my feelings and honor these people.

I used to avoid anything with an accent but now, if I got the call for “Bridgerton,” I’d feel confident enough to go for it. Definitely do your homework, though. With almost every trading scene in “Industry,” I’ve thought, “Nope, I’m not going to be able to get the words out.” I don’t sleep the night before, and I’m wrecked the next morning. Then everything pours out because I’ve come in prepared. Filming the first season of “Industry” in 2019 was the first time I’d been on a job longer than five days, the first time I’d worked out of the country, the first everything, and I was so nervous.

But you can only think about something for so long before you just have to try it. Someone once told me that when he makes a painting he likes, he’ll make another one with the same idea to see if it holds up and then another, which I thought was pretty good advice. Sometimes I force myself to go to my studio and start painting [Gordon initially set out to be a visual artist and started focusing more on her art practice about 25 years ago], even if I don’t have an idea. I like conceptual thinking, but I also like the physicality of painting.

That’s a nervous system in panic. There’s a grounding exercise I like to do where I jump and really feel my feet smack the floor — trying to get yourself back into your body’s part of the trick. And then I go, “Well, who’s dreaming?” If you can get there, you’re lucid in the dream, and that’s a good place to be. Still, feelings will come up that you don’t want. When I was working on this satyr painting, suddenly the satyr was my old friend Chris, who betrayed me when I was 18 to a group of guys who beat me up. I thought, “Why am I painting Chris? I don’t want to paint Chris.” I was in flow for a while but, when I hit this painting, I experienced self-doubt and thought, “People are going to think these paintings are awful.” Then I went on Instagram and liked one of his pictures. It felt like a weird, brave task. And he wrote to me and asked if he could call me, 26 years after ghosting me, and he apologized for 20 minutes. I cried and I think he probably cried, and I felt it all melt away. And then I went back to the painting. <strong>— TM Davy, 43, artist</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh  g-image-small" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-300 svelte-1jrfrvl" style="max-width: 300px;"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/2731" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-advice-slide-NC0Y/18tmag-advice-slide-NC0Y-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-advice-slide-NC0Y/18tmag-advice-slide-NC0Y-superJumbo-v2.jpg"> <img alt="Kim Gordon, wearing a floral jumpsuit, poses in front of a red background and extends her left hand." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="2731" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-advice-slide-NC0Y/18tmag-advice-slide-NC0Y-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs  is-vertical"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kim Gordon in 1990.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Laura Levine/Corbis via Getty Images<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Psych Yourself Out<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->If things are too hard, something’s wrong, but you also have to embrace the awkward feelings.

The great works often appear when we’re aiming toward something completely different. Start as soon as you see a way in. I [also] find it helpful to work on multiple things at the same time. Not in the same moment but during the same general time period. The beauty is that different projects are at different stages, so you can avoid getting burned out on any one [thing]. We can step away, work on something else and come back with new eyes, as if we’re seeing it for the first time. Tunnel vision’s easy to fall into when working on a single project for a long period.

It’s called “Showbiz! My Unexpected Life as a Middle-Aged Man,” and I’ve got to get that done — by June 1st! I’m used to being onstage. When I’m sitting at my desk in my studio apartment, I procrastinate quite a bit, and I’m always asking myself, “Is this part of the creative process for me, or am I just making my life harder?” But I also procrastinate in productive ways. I go for a walk — in rehab, they taught us, “Move a muscle, change a thought.” Then I come back and put on jazz music. Doing that removes the blocks, probably because jazz is so much about improvisation and I’m at my core an improviser. Another thing I’ll do to light the match is turn to others’ work. I’ll watch Dean Martin videos or a documentary or old game shows. For this memoir, I’ve been reading memoirs by other people — Gary Gulman, Viola Davis, Maria Bamford, Leslie Jones, Aparna Nancherla — and not only does that awaken my creative senses, it triggers memories. <strong>— Murray Hill, 52, comedian, actor and writer</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Be Comfortable With Discomfort<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There was a time when [my] body was always ready, and when I had so many axes to grind and windmills to chase [that] something would come out. Now I can’t just depend on my body being there — that I’m going to bust a move and seduce — so I have to be a little more strategic: “What’s the idea? Does it serve anyone other than you?” I’m trying to reaffirm for myself that what I have left in me to say is worth saying. Doubt is always with us, and it burns like fire. But if I refuse to give up the mantle of being a creative artist, I’ve got to do something. [You might say] “Well, why don’t you just love a child? Why don’t you go work at a soup kitchen down the street?” Because I’m a self-involved son of a bitch. Procrastination says, “I don’t dare,” but can you live with yourself if you don’t? So how do you start? Terror. Guilt. Fear. All negatives to this generation of young people who don’t ever want to be uncomfortable, but the generation that formed me and my own generation had that feeling that you’re being pushed against and you’ve got to push back, because you’re not like them. As Martha Graham said to Agnes de Mille, “There is only a queer divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.” I’ve got to believe that about myself, and the evidence is what I dare to do. <strong>— Bill T.

I recently spent nine months quietly making these works — mineral paint on cement slabs — and ended up throwing them all away because I decided they were too conventional. You’re not married to your old self, either. In 2013, there was an electrical fire at the studio I’d just moved into, and the building burned to the ground. I lost cartons of negatives and proof sheets that were over six feet tall, as well as photographs — stuff I’d made five, seven, 10, 15 years prior. Of course, it was traumatic and terrifying, but it was also freeing. Eventually I realized it was an opportunity for me to draw a line and stop making a certain kind of work. As artists, we think, “I got known for this type of thing,” or, “This is what everybody seems to like of mine.” A part of me felt, “I have to rebuild this person,” and then I thought, “Well, I don’t,” and I started something else. It was actually one of the most fruitful periods of my creative life. <strong>— Anthony Pearson, 55, painter, sculptor and photographer</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-13ig1yh" style="" role="group" aria-label="image">  <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"> <div class="g-media"> <picture style="--g-picture-ratio: 1800/1733" class="svelte-1bbwgvj"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 740px) and (max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT-jumbo.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT-superJumbo.jpg"> <img alt="Joan Baez holds a guitar and sings into a microphone." loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1733" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT/18tmag-advice-slide-CMMT-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" class="g-image svelte-z1ymna  nojs"></picture></div></div> </div> <div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline" style=""><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><div class="g-wrapper_caption g-text-align-left svelte-1f86www"><p class="g-caption svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Joan Baez in 1974.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class="g-credit svelte-1f86www"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->David Redfern/Redferns via Getty Images<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div> </div> </figure><h2 class="g-subhed  g-theme-news  svelte-1jdmsuh"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Practice Some Denial<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </h2><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I was working on “Diamonds & Rust” (1975), I was at a low point of my career and I made a decision that I was going to concentrate on music and quit globe-trotting for different issues.

You can’t force it, and you have to listen to the work — it’ll tell you what it needs to be. Look at me getting all woo-woo, but it’s true. When you make a living off of writing, not every single project’s going to be from the depths of your soul, but I think there should always be some level of enjoyment. Starting over is really humbling, by the way. Knowing when to stop and when to start over requires giving your ego an Ambien. Real failure is letting your ego drive the bus of your life right off the cliff. <strong>— Ryan O’Connell, 37, writer and actor</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><p class="g-text g-detailblock svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->These interviews have been edited and condensed.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section>  <div class="g-sharetools-wrapper svelte-16x78r3 g-align-left"> </div></div> <button class="prev svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-ticker"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C7.16345 0 0 7.16345 0 16C0 24.8365 7.16345 32 16 32C24.8365 32 32 24.8365 32 16C32 7.16345 24.8365 0 16 0ZM12.8704 23.7642C13.2925 24.1204 13.9233 24.067 14.2795 23.6449C14.6357 23.2228 14.5823 22.5919 14.1603 22.2358L8.63049 17.5694H26.1055C26.6577 17.5694 27.1055 17.1216 27.1055 16.5694C27.1055 16.0171 26.6577 15.5694 26.1055 15.5694H8.4502L14.1941 10.2607C14.5996 9.8858 14.6245 9.25317 14.2496 8.8476C13.8749 8.44202 13.2422 8.41705 12.8365 8.79193L5.21619 15.835C5.00562 16.0296 4.88867 16.3053 4.89514 16.5919C4.90161 16.8786 5.03088 17.1487 5.25 17.3336L12.8704 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-bial1l">Previous</span></button> <button class="next svelte-1yr85b1" data-article-id="18tmag-edletter"><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="svelte-1yr85b1"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 0C24.8365 0 32 7.16345 32 16C32 24.8365 24.8365 32 16 32C7.16345 32 0 24.8365 0 16C0 7.16345 7.16345 0 16 0ZM19.1296 23.7642C18.7075 24.1204 18.0767 24.067 17.7205 23.6449C17.3643 23.2228 17.4177 22.5919 17.8397 22.2358L23.3695 17.5694H5.89453C5.34229 17.5694 4.89453 17.1216 4.89453 16.5694C4.89453 16.0171 5.34229 15.5694 5.89453 15.5694H23.5498L17.8059 10.2607C17.4004 9.8858 17.3755 9.25317 17.7504 8.8476C18.1251 8.44202 18.7578 8.41705 19.1635 8.79193L26.7838 15.835C26.9944 16.0296 27.1113 16.3053 27.1049 16.5919C27.0984 16.8786 26.9691 17.1487 26.75 17.3336L19.1296 23.7642Z" fill="black" class="svelte-1yr85b1"></path></svg> <span class="svelte-1yr85b1" data-svelte-h="svelte-1sbm5cd">Next</span></button></div> </div><div id="18tmag-ticker" data-article-id="18tmag-ticker" data-slug="18tmag-ticker" class="g-article exiting svelte-1yr85b1" style="--progress: 1;"> <div class="g-article-body svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="g-article-cover svelte-1yr85b1"><div class="hed-wrapper svelte-1yr85b1"><h1 class="svelte-bpjjku"><span class="svelte-bpjjku">Up</span> <span class="svelte-bpjjku">Next</span>  </h1></div> <p class="byline svelte-1yr85b1">Interviews by Kate Guadagnino</p> <p class="summary svelte-1yr85b1">We asked 80 artists and other creative people to tell us what they’re starting right now or hope to start very soon.</p></div> <div class="g-sharetools-wrapper svelte-16x78r3 g-align-left"> </div> <div class="body-wrapper svelte-1yr85b1"><section><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Alice McDermott, </strong><em>70, writer</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There are three kinds of novels I’ve never taken to heart: science fiction, murder mysteries and novels about novelists.

While ghosts are a well-trod literary device, their visual representation on stage and screen also has a rich history that can be told through the lens of an architect. Despite the fact that ghosts transcend the laws of physics, they’re stubbornly site-specific — they live in walls, closets, attics and other marginal domestic settings, and they rarely stray from home.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section> <section><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>David Oyelowo,</strong> <em>48, actor</em><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="g-text svelte-emdow7"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Something that three friends and I are in the process of building and developing is a streaming platform that we launched last year called Mansa.

It’s not just that those releasing their first album, book or movie, or having their first gallery exhibit or Broadway show, are usually young; it’s that they embody that most delicious and evanescent of qualities: promise. Any painter could be the next Rothko or Basquiat; any singer could be the next Joni or Aretha. There the new artist sits, poised between our expectations and their unwritten reality. Becoming emotionally invested in an untested creative life is like becoming financially invested in an exciting new company — should they (or it) work, the reward is not just theirs but ours. “See?” we tell ourselves. “We knew it all along.”"},{type:"text",value:"But the real test of being an artist isn’t the first album, book, movie or Broadway show, as significant as those accomplishments are. It’s what happens after. All artists know that living a true creative life means facing an endless series of beginnings: It’s starting over after setbacks; it’s pushing forward through doubt and despair; it’s trying again when someone tells you no; it’s slogging ahead when no one seems to like or care about what you make; it’s ignoring the voice inside you that tells you to stop; it’s striving and failing, again and again and again. There is no point of complete security, no award or recognition that bestows total confidence — a life in art means that, to some degree, you’re starting anew every day. As the novelist Andrew Holleran tells T, “Writing is basically unconscious, and you don’t get any smarter about it. Imagine a brain surgeon who didn’t learn from each operation? We’d be horrified.

And though the artists who appear in these pages are all different, they share a spirit of generosity: It’s no easy thing to give voice to your dreams and insecurities, much less to do so publicly. Their collective perseverance — a mix of dogged determination and wild hope — is a reminder for all of us that a creative life, that \u003Cem>all\u003C/em> life, takes nerve. It takes humility.

Once on set, a photo editor stays until the very end of the shoot, even if the shoot goes all day.

He had a big laugh, resonant and full, which everyone in the office could hear; at work parties, he sometimes broke into song. In addition to his big laugh, he had a big voice.

Consider Joseph Conrad in his mid-30s, working aboard the ship Torrens, with the manuscript of his first novel, “Almayer’s Folly” (1895). It had acquired, he writes in “A Personal Record” (1912), “a faded look and an ancient, yellowish complexion.” At sea, Conrad met his first reader, Jacques, a “young Cambridge man.” “Well, what do you say?” Conrad, brimming with anxiety, asked his new friend. “Is it worth finishing?” “ ‘Distinctly,’ he answered, in his sedate, veiled voice,” Conrad recalls years later, “and then coughed a little.” With that one word, Jacques, who was soon to be carried away by a fatal cold, had given a seafaring Polish exile a vital nod of encouragement. “The purpose instilled into me by his simple and final ‘Distinctly,’” writes Conrad, one of literature’s late bloomers (he was 38 when he published his first novel), “remained dormant, yet alive to await its opportunity.”"},{type:"text",value:"This quiet admission to oneself, as sacred as the vows of priesthood, of wanting to undertake the creative life is a necessary step; but like talent, it’s not enough. To be an artist is not a private act but a public one. No artist is born into a vacuum, or later speaks into one. They are as much a product of the society they emerge from as a response to it. Nor is artistic expression all spirit, all feeling. As Naipaul has frequently noted, writers require a complex edifice of interlocking parts — an infrastructure, if you will — to thrive. More broadly speaking, all successful artists rely on a network of critics, journals and newspapers, a discerning audience, bookshops and concert halls and galleries — which is generations in the making, presupposing certain values, certain economic and political realities. The Ukrainian-born novelist Clarice Lispector came of age in the Brazil of the 1920s. At 13, she “consciously claimed the desire to write,” as her biographer Benjamin Moser quotes her in “Why This World” (2009), but no sooner had she claimed her destiny than she felt herself in a void. The idea of vocation had been instilled in her, but that didn’t mean she knew how to proceed. “Writing was always difficult for me,” Lispector once wrote, “even though I had begun with what is known as vocation. Vocation is different from talent. One can have vocation and not talent; one can be called and not know how to go.”"},{type:"text",value:"Lispector had both vocation and talent, but what makes any artist’s first steps so tentative is that the path forward is narrower than we imagine. We come into the world believing we can be a great many things (and for a great many this is true) but, for those destined to be artists, the creative choices they make are almost as limited as the choice of being an artist itself. Maugham wanted to demystify the impulse that had him give up medicine to answer his calling as a novelist. “I am a writer as I might have been a doctor or a lawyer,” he writes in “The Summing Up,” his 1938 literary memoir, but, soon after that, despite himself, Maugham stumbles on that aspect of the artistic life that eludes banalization, for it’s truly mysterious — namely, the bond between the artist and his subject. “Though the whole world,” writes Maugham, “with everyone in it and all its sights and events, is your material, you yourself can only deal with what corresponds to some secret spring in your own nature.” "},{type:"image",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopImage",assetSlug:"100000009392823",breakpointName:void 0,assetErrors:[],__typename:"Image",sourceId:"100000009392823",url:"/imagepages/2024/04/04/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51.html",uri:"nyt://image/250de6a0-c361-5abd-9ef4-67deed011416",lastModified:"2024-04-15T18:11:14.836Z",lastMajorModification:"2024-04-15T18:11:14.836Z",headline:{default:""},bylines:[],type:"image",caption:{text:"“Vanitas Still Life” (circa 1665-70) by Jan van Kessel the Elder, who was from a long line of celebrated Flemish painters — Pieter Bruegel the Elder was his great-grandfather — and was perhaps destined to be an artist."},altText:"A painting of a skull next to an hourglass with flowers, butterflies and bubbles around it.",credit:"",summary:"",original:{width:3046,height:4096},imageType:"photo",crops:[{name:"MASTER",box:{y2:4096,y1:0,x2:3046,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:600,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-articleLarge.jpg",name:"articleLarge",height:807},{width:762,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-jumbo.jpg",name:"jumbo",height:1024},{width:1523,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-superJumbo.jpg",name:"superJumbo",height:2048}]},{name:"SIXTEEN_BY_NINE",box:{y2:1713,y1:0,x2:3046,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:600,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg",name:"videoSixteenByNine600",height:338}]},{name:"FACEBOOK",box:{y2:1594,y1:0,x2:3046,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:1050,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-facebookJumbo.jpg",name:"facebookJumbo",height:549}]},{name:"MOBILE_MASTER",box:{y2:4096,y1:0,x2:3046,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:1800,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51/18tmag-firststroke-slide-8B51-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg",name:"mobileMasterAt3x",height:2420}]}],mediaComponent:"ImageLoader"},maxWidth:"body",marginInline:false}},{type:"text",value:"It’s this, the inexorability of the correspondence between an artist and the world, that gives those first steps their magical quality.

One of my literary heroes, the writer Rebecca West — the author of that magisterial work of travel, inquiry and sympathy “Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia” (1940) — was abandoned (as I was) by her father as a child. In late Victorian England, it left her with an exaggerated regard for what were seen as male qualities, as well as the need to compensate for their absence. “Men, she felt,” writes J.R. Hammond in “H.G. Wells and Rebecca West” (1991), his biography of their romantic and literary relationship, “should be strong and dependable; deep inside herself she sensed they were not to be trusted.” These gendered dynamics were surely at work as West, first making her way in the world at age 20, sloughed off the softer given name of Cissie Fairfield to adopt, as a pseudonym, the name of the spirited protagonist of Henrik Ibsen’s play “Rosmersholm” (1886).

The path forward comes upon the artist-in-waiting with the power of certain mathematical proofs, elegant, inevitable, at once simple and inscrutable. “Falling in love for the first time and getting started as a writer,” my friend the writer Karan Mahajan, 39, the author of the novels “Family Planning” (2008) and “The Association of Small Bombs” (2016), replied by email when I asked him what it had been like for him, “both things happened at once for me.

I wanted to illustrate the stories I was bursting to tell. A lot of these stories were about coming out and showing the excitement, anxieties and challenges of belonging to multiple cultures and living a cute little life in the East Village.”"},{type:"text",value:"The date surprised me. I had been aware of Toor’s work for almost a decade before this moment. To me, he was the painter of a certain kind of South Asian disquiet. No one captured the massive cultural and economic disparities of my life in Delhi (and his in Lahore) like Toor. Upon scenes of revelry and privilege — a party, a picnic, a rich westernized couple frolicking out of doors with a glass of wine and an iPhone — he would, in the form of servants in the background looking on, introduce an element of unease that hinted at the fragility of the societies we lived in. But quite unbeknown to me, Toor’s life in New York had opened up a new vein of material. To put it another way, he had begun again. And this is what we tend to forget: In the careers of certain artists, those who make big, varied bodies of work in which different strands of their experience are subsumed, the business of beginning, and beginning again, never ceases. Each new beginning brings with it all the uncertainty and blankness of the first. Experience might protect such an artist from forcing what’s clearly not working, but that core anxiety of not knowing if one will create again always remains. “Do not worry,” Hemingway would console himself, “you have always written before and you will write now.”"},{type:"text",value:"WHAT CONSTITUTES A beginning? In the common conception, it’s the first book, the first album, the first show at a major gallery. Yet an artist has myriad private ways in which they mark moments of true breakthrough. My childhood friend the sitarist and composer Anoushka Shankar, 42, regards her fourth album as her first. She had grown up under the influence of her mighty father, Ravi Shankar, the man credited with having introduced Indian classical music to the West. Every artist struggles with what the literary critic Harold Bloom has called the anxiety of influence but, in Anoushka’s case, it was even more pronounced. As she told me, Ravi Shankar was “my guru, my teacher, my father.” It was he who had composed her first three albums."},{type:"text",value:"Ravi, before he went on to become the greatest sitarist of his generation, had been part of a dance troupe led by his brother Uday, which caused a sensation in the Europe and America of the 1930s. “Hindu thought, alive, authentic, in flesh and bone, in sound, gesture and spirit,” is how the French mystic René Daumal describes the Shankar troupe in his book “Rasa” (1982), but Ravi was conflicted. He eventually broke with the troupe and dedicated himself entirely to the sitar. “He had a real directional shift that I didn’t have,” Anoushka says. Her beginnings, though she was six decades younger than her father, were in a sense more traditional. They entailed the surprise of finding newness within tradition. “I think my journey,” she says, “was more progressively finding how the thing that was in front of me — the sitar, namely — the thing that had been given to me, could be my outlet, could be my voice.” "},{type:"text",value:"A coda to this intergenerational tale of artistic beginnings is the story of Anoushka’s half sister, Norah Jones, who spent years of her childhood estranged from her father and grew up in Texas with her American mother. At a time when both Anoushka and I were discovering our half siblings, I remember going to see Norah play at little-known clubs on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She was staking claim to what felt like a genetic destiny in music, though in a tradition entirely different from that of her father and sister. I don’t know if I’ve ever witnessed beginnings as meager and transformational as these for, not long after, Norah’s debut album, “Come Away With Me” (2002), was released; it went on to win five Grammys, sell 30 million copies and all but save the piracy-shattered music industry."},{type:"ad",value:{id:48,size:void 0}},{type:"text",value:"We live in a society that prizes the individual above all else but, in the art of premodern Europe and classical India, to begin as an artist didn’t necessarily entail breaking with tradition, nor was it given to every artist to be original. “Raphael was adept at this,” writes Rachel Cusk in her travel memoir “The Last Supper: A Summer in Italy” (2009), in which she describes the Italian Renaissance painter’s relationship to his first guru, Perugino. Raphael had become so good at imitating Perugino, Cusk tells us, that the copies of his master’s work were indistinguishable from the originals. The art of pastiche, of inhaling the influence of an older admired artist so completely that it enters your soul, exists today, too. The South African writer J.M. Coetzee’s early works owe a huge debt to Samuel Beckett, as Rushdie’s do to Gabriel García Márquez and Thomas Pynchon’s to James Joyce. The difference in the modern era is that influence is something we must shrug off in order to become our own people, yet not everyone can. Cusk deals very movingly with Raphael’s quest (and ultimate failure) to be his own man. In a field crowded with giants such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he “retreated behind the mask of humility, never to come out again.” But far from this being his downfall as an artist, it, too, was a kind of beginning. “In the end,” writes Cusk, “his borrowing of such greatness amounted to greatness itself. Not everyone who sees a Michelangelo can go off and paint a Michelangelo.”"},{type:"text",value:"THERE ARE SO many ways to begin. I said it wasn’t my intention to open with a story of artistic death, but I never explained why I did. The reason is that after six books, and 20 years after writing my first publishable sentences, stamina, endurance and the ability to stay the course have come to mean at least as much to me as that first raw efflorescence of talent. If Zack’s story acquired the force of parable for me, it was because it showed me the vanity of our preoccupation with talent. Many with fewer gifts who are yet more steadfast go on to have brilliant careers as artists. There’s an undeniable mystery in why some among us become artists, but there’s a greater mystery to me still in those who survive the vicissitudes of creative life, leaving behind bodies of work through which there runs an arc of growth as sublime as the vaulting of a Gothic cathedral."},{type:"text",value:"A true artist always brings something new into the world. A new color, a new complexion, a new way of looking — a “new kind of beauty,” to use Marcel Proust’s phrase for the special distinctiveness he felt that Fyodor Dostoyevsky had brought to literature. We make the mistake of thinking of that newness as an externality, a scaffolding, a mere matter of style. But in fact, the originality we detect on the surface is an emanation from the birth of a new idea. It’s something far more radical, far more unnerving, than we are prepared to accept. Real artists bring about real rupture. We want to domesticate the discomfort that makes us feel but, deep down, we know the old rules no longer apply; and for one fleeting moment, our world, with us in it, is laid bare, transfigured by the imagination of someone who has dared to see it anew.

What he lacked in movie star looks — the critic J. Hoberman described him as “coarse-featured, overweight and slovenly” — he made up for in talent. Following a successful stage career in London’s West End, he turned to film, making a name for himself as a versatile character actor in the 1930s and ’40s. In 1955, at the age of 55, he made his most indelible contribution to his craft, directing “The Night of the Hunter,” a film noir so dark it easily passes today as horror. (William Friedkin, the director of 1973’s “The Exorcist,” described it as “one of the scariest films ever made.”) Robert Mitchum plays a terrifying ex-convict posing as a preacher and stalking the children of his former cellmate in order to find a hidden fortune. While casting Lillian Gish in the role of the children’s caretaker, Laughton told the actress about his disappointment in audiences’ lack of attention for movies, how they “slump down with their heads back, or eat candy and popcorn. I want them to sit up straight again,” he said. Though now often ranked among the greatest American movies, “The Night of the Hunter” — released just a few years before Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” (1960) made the psychological thriller into a marketable genre — was a commercial flop. Reviews were mixed; The New York Times’s Bosley Crowther called it “a weird and intriguing endeavor.” Years later, Terry Sanders, a second-unit director of the film, wrote that “the rejection by critics and the indifference of audiences hit [Laughton] hard and crushed his spirit. It wasn’t just disappointment he felt, it was utter and deeply debilitating devastation.” He never directed a second movie. — \u003Cem>M.H.M.\u003C/em>"}]},{type:"section",body:[{type:"subhed",value:"\u003Cstrong>Willis Alan Ramsey,\u003C/strong> 73, Loveland, Colo.",className:"g-heading3block g-align-left"},{type:"image",value:{media:{assetType:"scoopImage",assetSlug:"100000009391851",breakpointName:void 0,assetErrors:[],__typename:"Image",sourceId:"100000009391851",url:"/imagepages/2024/04/04/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX.html",uri:"nyt://image/c9d5301f-8726-5c64-b32e-0648a61ead1a",lastModified:"2024-04-17T19:29:02.200Z",lastMajorModification:"2024-04-17T19:29:02.200Z",headline:{default:""},bylines:[],type:"image",caption:{text:"The singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey, photographed at Sam’s Town Point bar in Austin, Texas, on March 14, 2024."},altText:"Willis Alan Ramsey stands with his hands behind his back wearing a cowboy hat.",credit:"Caleb Santiago Alvarado",summary:"",original:{width:2250,height:3000},imageType:"photo",crops:[{name:"MASTER",box:{y2:3000,y1:0,x2:2250,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:600,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-articleLarge.jpg",name:"articleLarge",height:800},{width:768,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-jumbo.jpg",name:"jumbo",height:1024},{width:1536,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-superJumbo.jpg",name:"superJumbo",height:2048}]},{name:"SIXTEEN_BY_NINE",box:{y2:1266,y1:0,x2:2250,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:600,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg",name:"videoSixteenByNine600",height:338}]},{name:"FACEBOOK",box:{y2:1178,y1:0,x2:2250,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:1050,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-facebookJumbo.jpg",name:"facebookJumbo",height:550}]},{name:"MOBILE_MASTER",box:{y2:3000,y1:0,x2:2250,x1:0},bleed:null,renditions:[{width:1800,url:"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/t-magazine/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX/18tmag-theend-slide-Q5FX-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg",name:"mobileMasterAt3x",height:2400}]}],mediaComponent:"ImageLoader"},maxWidth:"body",marginInline:false}},{type:"text",value:"The singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey, originally from Alabama, released his self-titled debut album in 1972, becoming a forebear of the alt-country genre.

We tackled the Western classics first — William Shakespeare’s ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ (1600) and Thornton Wilder’s ‘Our Town’ (1938) — and my only caveat was not to change them to Asian settings. I remember the first couple of years, maybe decades, people always used to ask, ‘Oh, you’re doing Shakespeare! Are you going to set it in Japan?’ Which isn’t bad, but it’s not the only way to do it. Reception was mixed; there was criticism from both Asian and non-Asian audiences. When we started to do new work — with Michael Golamco’s ‘Cowboy Versus Samurai’ in 2005 — it became a redefinition of what immigrant stories were. Most of the time, the work’s thought of as only one thing, so that was something to figure out.

She does a literal translation in English, which stays as close to the feeling and meaning of the original Norwegian as possible. I go through that line by line, translating it into my own words without making any big decisions. Once I have my first version, I start the bigger work of cutting. For “An Enemy of the People,” we cut three characters. I decided to cut the character of Katherine, Thomas Stockmann’s wife, after a lot of conversations with Sam [Gold, the play’s director and Herzog’s husband]. Her sections weren’t working; they were feeling really turgid. There’re sections that his daughter, Petra [played by Victoria Pedretti], could pick up if Katherine was gone."},{type:"text",value:"What was remarkable about cutting Katherine was realizing how little had to change. The fact that you didn’t have to do major surgery on the play was one tell that cutting Katherine was a good idea. It gives Stockmann this recent terrible grief.

That spring loads the play as it begins: He’s reaching a place where he can have happiness again — [only] to be completely betrayed by his community and to lose everything he’s finally gained."},{type:"text",value:"Ibsen wrote domestic psychological plays and social plays. “A Doll’s House” is the former and “An Enemy of the People” the latter. [When adapting “A Doll’s House”] I learned some pretty basic things about the mechanics of making it feel leaner and more modern. But other than that, it was shockingly different to translate them and humbling that he had plays that were so totally different inside of him. This play is bigger and rangier and even more relevant than “A Doll’s House.” It’s very timely — there’re a few headlines it brings up. One is climate change. I was reading a lot about scientists who weren’t listened to when they tried to sound the alarm years ago. I was also reading Naomi Klein’s [2023 memoir] “Doppelganger” and thinking about the way the body politic becomes sick. I try to do a lot of research before writing — I read a fair amount of Ibsen biographies — so there’s no single influence that’s too loud while I’m working. When I’m really doing the translation, I need quiet and cloistering. So there’d be gaps in my communication with [Jeremy] and everyone else. Then there’d be the moments, after reading a draft, when it was time to talk and become porous again."},{type:"text",value:"Jeremy was the reason for the production. From the moment I began to work on “An Enemy of the People,” I knew who was playing Thomas Stockmann.

"},{type:"text",value:"[Jeremy and Dr. Stockmann] are similar in that they both have a total commitment to what they believe in. Having someone in my life with that kind of devotion to his craft and to his storytelling means that I’m coming to [the character] with the texture of a real, contemporary person. Every few days, he sends me a poem or an article or something that’s meant something to him related to the play. He sent me the William Butler Yeats poem “A Coat.” The first three lines are “I made my song a coat / Covered with embroideries / Out of old mythologies.” There’s this incidental line in Ibsen’s original [script] that people often cut — but I didn’t, I love it — when Captain Horster [Dr. Stockmann’s loyal friend] makes his first entrance before you even see Dr. Stockmann, who says, “Hang your coat on that peg. Oh, you don’t wear an overcoat?” Captain Horster is this character who has no pretense and is an uncorrupted type of human. And Ibsen has him coatless at the beginning.

Does it serve anyone other than you?” I’m trying to reaffirm for myself that what I have left in me to say is worth saying. Doubt is always with us, and it burns like fire. But if I refuse to give up the mantle of being a creative artist, I’ve got to do something. [You might say] “Well, why don’t you just love a child? Why don’t you go work at a soup kitchen down the street?” Because I’m a self-involved son of a bitch. Procrastination says, “I don’t dare,” but can you live with yourself if you don’t? So how do you start? Terror. Guilt. Fear. All negatives to this generation of young people who don’t ever want to be uncomfortable, but the generation that formed me and my own generation had that feeling that you’re being pushed against and you’ve got to push back, because you’re not like them.

You’re not married to your old self, either. In 2013, there was an electrical fire at the studio I’d just moved into, and the building burned to the ground. I lost cartons of negatives and proof sheets that were over six feet tall, as well as photographs — stuff I’d made five, seven, 10, 15 years prior. Of course, it was traumatic and terrifying, but it was also freeing. Eventually I realized it was an opportunity for me to draw a line and stop making a certain kind of work. As artists, we think, “I got known for this type of thing,” or, “This is what everybody seems to like of mine.” A part of me felt, “I have to rebuild this person,” and then I thought, “Well, I don’t,” and I started something else.

<p class="one"><span class="building">Butcher Works</span>.  Nineteenth century. Arundel Street, Sheffield. 
 According to the heritage plaque at the building's entrance, William and Samuel Butcher, makers of the famous Bowie knife,  built the various buildings that form the works between 1819 and 1875, beginning with the part facing Eyre Street  — &ldquo;the finest remaining integrated cutlery, edge tool, file making works. The austerity of the 40 m. four-storey fa&ccedil;ade to Arundel Street and surviving brick built ranges are powerfully evocative of the working conditions once prevalent throughout the cutlery industry in Sheffield.&rdquo; The yard, which provided a safe, convenient place to load and unload goods, includes a small steam power plant used in driving the company's machines. This small factory complex continued in use by the same firm until 1959, lay vacate for three decades, received a grade II listing in 1998, and was recently refurbished as flats and workshops with the aid of a £1.2 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

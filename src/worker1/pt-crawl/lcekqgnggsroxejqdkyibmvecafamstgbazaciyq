<H1> Antipater of Thessalonica : Epigrams </H1>

<P> <I><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater_of_Thessalonica">Antipater of Thessalonica</A> was a prolific writer of epigrams, who lived during the reign of the emperor Augustus in the late first century B.C.; his patron was <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Calpurnius_Piso_Caesoninus_(consul_15_BC)">L.Piso</A>, the consul of 15 B.C. &nbsp; It is sometimes difficult to distinguish his poems from those of the similarly name <A HREF="antipater1.html">Antipater of Sidon</A>; the poems shown here are those attributed to him by  A.S.F.Gow &amp; D.L.Page in &quot;The Greek Anthology: The Garland of Philip and Some Contemporary Epigrams&quot;.</I>

<P> <I>The epigrams are shown in the order that they appear, scattered throughout the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Anthology">Greek Anthology</A>.  The labels in <FONT CLASS="ref">red</FONT> at the start of each epigram are their numbers within the Anthology.  The labels in <FONT CLASS="green">green</FONT> are the numbers assigned to the epigrams in the edition by Gow &amp; Page.

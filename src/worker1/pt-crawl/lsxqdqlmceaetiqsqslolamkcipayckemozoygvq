<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document serves both as the 2022 revision of the GBIF Implementation Plan for the period 2017-2022 and also as the GBIF Annual Work Programme 2022. Both elements are based upon the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBIF Strategic Plan for 2017-2021</a>, which was extended for one year due to the challenges created by the global pandemic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Annual Work Programme 2022 represents the final programme based on the current strategic plan. The new strategic planning framework for the period 2023-2027 was approved at the 28th GBIF Governing Board meeting (GB28) in October 2021, and it will form the basis of a new implementation plan to be developed during 2022.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Strategic Plan 2017-2021, agreed at the GB22 meeting in 2015, established five priorities for GBIF’s work. The Implementation Plan identified 22 activities which GBIF must undertake to address these priorities during the six-year period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each year, GBIF has reviewed progress against these activities and available resources (including Secretariat staff and other uses of core and supplementary funding, as well as resources committed by GBIF Participants). Using this information, an Annual Work Programme is defined for the following year. Each Annual Work Programme identifies a prioritized set of work items during the year. Annual Work Programmes in the second and subsequent years have also reported on progress against the plan.</p>

<p>Information on activities planned for 2022 is included under each of the Activity sections included in the 2022 implementation plan update below. For convenience, this information has also been collated as an <a href="#overview-of-2022-work-items">Overview of 2022 Work Items</a> listing the items for which approval is sought from the Governing Board at GB28.</p>

<h3 id="financial-situation">
<a class="anchor" href="#financial-situation"></a>Financial situation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of September 2021, current and imminent voting participant contributions are slightly above expected contributions approved in the GB27 budget. This targeted total, however, takes into consideration expected inability of some countries to pay contributions. Therefore, the total financial contribution provided by countries remains below the goal set forth in the financial model approved at GB22.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 2021 budget approved by GB27 included funds for travel and in-person meetings in 2021 (including regional meetings and GB28), but very little of this was used, and these budget items were downscaled in a mid-year revision. Partly due to these savings, €200K budgeted within the 'COVID-19 reserve' was deemed not to be needed, and following mid-year approval by the Executive Committee the Secretariat removed this level of reserve from the budget.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 2021 Work Programme budget items were adjusted with the overall budget level similar to the budget adopted in GB27. Changes approved by the Budget Committee and Executive Committee for each Strategic Plan Priority are listed below. Information on each new or amended item is included in the 2021 progress reported for all activities.</p>

<p>In addition to salary and operating costs (including support for GBIF Governance mechanisms), funding was allocated from core funds to the 2021 Work Programme.

<p>As a result of the past year’s staffing and Work Programme changes, GBIF is expected to close 2021 with net capital of around €398,181, with an additional €461,000 in the COVID-19 Reserve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 2022 proposed budget includes a smaller allocation (€400K) for contracted activities in the Work Programme expenditure (i.e. non-salary costs allocated to calls, workshops, contracts, etc.) than currently budgeted for 2021. The proposed 2022 budget uses just over half (€261K) of the COVID-19 Reserve. The planned expenditure for 2022 is €188,155 greater than the income projected in the budget. This is considered to represent a responsible balance between advancing GBIF’s mission and reserving some funds against future risks (€471,026, net capital forecast for the end of 2022).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF is a maturing infrastructure and network of people. This maturation has enabled infrastructure improvement, inclusion of new data types and stronger global engagement.  It also comes at an increased cost to maintain the infrastructure and engagement at current levels. The current core budget is based on €3.5 million from Voting Participants, but the amount actually received is typically less than this. Staff growth in past years means that staff salaries and basic operational costs (including insurance) are now similar to or exceed Voting Participants' contributions. This leaves little room for increased feature development and engagement using core funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To meet the development needs, the Secretariat has initiated a resource mobilization strategy to meet these needs with supplementary funding. The Secretariat is confident that the value presented by BID and other supplementary programmes, present infrastructure and data quality improvements will be translated into a strong external funding stream.</p>

<p>The Secretariat is in the process of hiring two new staff members. In response to GB value proposition discussions and the recommendations of the CODATA review of GBIF’s first 20 years, the Secretariat has hired a new communications officer to begin in October 2021. This new staff member is part of the Participation and Engagement staff. We currently are recruiting an administrative assistant to supplement our capacity in our administrative staff. These new hires will bring our staffing level to 30 staff, three of whom work part-time. In addition to the Director and Deputy Director, the Secretariat is structured as four teams, as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participation and Engagement (nine staff)</p>
</li>
<li>

<a class="anchor" href="#rationale-for-the-period-2017-2022"></a>Rationale (for the period 2017-2022)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF is the result of work by thousands of people in agencies and institutions worldwide. This network’s long-term sustainability depends on demonstrating the value of such contributions and justifying continued investment of effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat can enhance efforts to develop capacity within the network and build an effective distributed help desk system that acknowledges and showcases relevant skills and experience that people across the network possess. Users of GBIF data products would also benefit from showcasing the network’s indispensable human resources and their impact on assessing and improving biodiversity data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these reasons, the next round of improvements to GBIF.org should enhance the network’s capacity to serve as a hub for the GBIF community by identifying its active contributors, integrating information on their relevant GBIF activities, and supporting broader knowledge exchange and skill development.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#2021-progress"></a>2021 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Building on previous efforts during the current Implementation Plan, GBIF has continued to make use of the growing cadre of volunteers— <a href="https://www.gbif.org/article/6dNF1d0tgcI4cmqeoS2sQ4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biodiversity Open Data Ambassadors</a>, <a href="https://www.gbif.org/article/5SExsCfj7UaUkMCsuc6Oec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentors</a> and <a href="https://www.gbif.org/translators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translators</a>—who contribute their time and energy toward fulfilling the network’s global mission. While the opportunities for representing the GBIF community in relevant fora were limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the GBIF volunteer community has remained active in numerous virtual events this year, including mentoring and training workshops, e-conferences and symposia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from maintaining lists of volunteers, progress on this activity since 2017 has mainly focused on establishing the ability to connect individual ORCID IDs with various activities on GBIF.org and developing the <a href="https://discourse.gbif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBIF Community Forum</a> as an effective space for both general discussions and targeted consultations. More ambitious plans to represent and increase connections between the individual contributions across GBIF.org have not been implemented, due in part to challenges of effectively managing and protecting personal data. The final year of the Implementation Plan presents an opportunity to review and consolidate this work in order to make progress toward the original objectives of this activity.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Andorra:</strong> We are working on purely national activities (migration of the portal to an AmazonWS server, script correction, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Argentina:</strong> Once the pandemic is resolved (we have an estimate of the possibility of vaccination only in April 2021) the plan is to resume the pending activities of 2021. All our node performs its tasks with the home office mode and it has been impossible to continue with many activities that depend on of the Ministry. Therefore, being able to resume activities normally would be our priority one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Belgium:</strong> Many mentors/trainers/translators activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brazil:</strong> Citation tracking possibilities were evaluated, but not implemented. Was implemented a tool that allows the user to know the number of downloads made for each collection, thus valuing the datasets of a given publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Chinese Taipei:</strong> TaiBIF staff members facilitated the BIFA workshop as mentors and helped the evaluation of BIFA and CESP projects. TaiBIF node manager is serving as Deputy Representative for Asia.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Andorra:</strong> Significantly increase the number of data on the national portal, with an important data reorganization. Then make the GBIF portal more widely available to biodiversity managers in Andorra. All these actions must have to permit a better network’s long-term sustainability in Andorra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Argentina:</strong> Unfortunately, we (partially) follow the restrictions due to COVID19 and our situation is not different from the previous year. It remains our priority to reactivate face-to-face activities as soon as possible, despite everything, we have transferred the activities of data publication and support to publishers to virtual media, as well as training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Belgium:</strong> Organize EBRII conference to gather all Biodiversity Informatics people of our country. Continue our mentors/trainers/translators activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brazil:</strong> Continue the assessment of citation tracking possibilities; communicate the benefits to publishers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Chinese Taipei:</strong> TaiBIF will continue to work closely with the Secretariat on these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>France:</strong> We will continue to support and organize workshops, webinars, symposia, and other events aimed at increasing digitization, mobilization, and research use of biodiversity data. Continue to update the metadata of the organizations and disseminate the benefits of using ORCID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Korea, Republic of:</strong> The field surveys of 2022 on biodiversity data with the Korean Biodiversity Consortium will be conducted in June and September 2022. And new two institutes will be participated in Korean Biodiversity Consortium in 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spain:</strong> Support of data providers, data users, and interested parties in GBIF and biodiversity data is provided through a range of core operations: annual training program, e learning platform. Data publication and  quality control services (inc. IPT), helpdesk, software development, communication services, Citizen Science services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sweden:</strong> To the extent possible and asked for we will continue to provide such support as described above. We encourage being included in the public catalogue of potential trainers, mentors, technical support persons etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taxonomic Databases Working Group:</strong> At TDWG, our 2021 Conference Theme: Connecting the world of biodiversity data: standards uniting people, processes, and tools highlights that we understand, value, and note the need to focus on the fact that people create much biodiversity data (or create the tools that collect automated data), and people use, curate, develop policies and tools, and publish using this information. Our plans include developing a new strategic plan for TDWG, and continuing work to build a community understanding of a) how to contribute to standards development, b) how to implement them, and c) help the community to adopt any changes in the standards. This work will include continuing to strategize around what the Technical Architecture Group of the future looks like for TDWG. Additionally, TDWG notes the worldwide strain on all for constant "virtual" meetings (due to Covid). While in-person meetings require a lot of logistics, so too do virtual or hybrid meetings. The costs (both for humans, and software to do this well) are high. We have very actively sought support this year in order to enhance what our small group can manage. We are already doing similar for next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uganda:</strong> The successful proposals will be helped to publish the datasets in the GBIF data portal through participating in the activities preceding data publishing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strengthening of personal skills through international collaboration has been one of the great successes of the GBIF global network. During this implementation period, GBIF must build on this past experience (including the support mechanisms developed for the BID programme) to reinforce efficient training and capacity enhancement across the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Central to this is the development of a collaborative help desk capability and the alignment of relevant aspects of national training initiatives with a global curriculum to facilitate direct reuse of resources.</p>

<h4 id="2021-progress-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#2021-progress-2"></a>2021 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current implementation period has seen very substantial progress in skills development across the GBIF network, including the consolidation of training resources in multiple languages, mainly developed through BID but re-used across a range of projects and programmes. Increasingly these resources are available both for rollout in Secretariat-led workshops (virtual as well as in-person) and for self-instruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new <a href="https://www.gbif.org/article/2IE7tH4dlcik1BnmniIPAc/training-and-e-learning">training and e-learning page on GBIF.org</a> now provides open access to a core curriculum including courses on a general introduction to GBIF, node management, data mobilization, and data use for decision making. These courses use a flexible format enabling easy updates, self-guided instruction and embedding of videos. They complement the <a href="https://elearning.gbif.es/">e-learning platform hosted by GBIF Spain</a> which is still used to organize training workshops for participants in programmes such as BID and BIFA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following progress can be reported on the specific work items listed in the 2021 Work Programme:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>During 2021, collaboration between nodes and secretariats from GBIF and the <a href="https://obis.org/">Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)</a> resulted in <a href="https://gnm2021.gbif.org/sessions/thursday-marine-data-mobilization-session">a series of videos prepared for the virtual Global Nodes Meeting</a>, outlining the overlaps and differences involved in publishing marine data for the two networks. This collaboration is the first step towards aligning guidance and training materials between OBIS and GBIF, with further opportunities provided by the data mobilization workshops in the second phase of BID, especially in the Caribbean where several funded projects have a marine focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the release of manuals updating guidance on <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/41BVgRGo4KMyZ773THzzSC/new-documents-support-improved-georeferencing-practices">georeferencing</a>, <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/3CWFpx9s1tX5U1j3wLKsC8/spanish-language-guide-to-using-openrefine-now-available">data cleaning</a> and <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/18GVsWZ6Heas1RBAEmHHSv/gbif-releases-new-guide-for-publication-of-data-on-sensitive-species">generalizing data on sensitive species</a>, GBIF’s core documentation programme proceeded with identification of further guidance to be commissioned in 2021. These include updated guidance on digitization and publication of data from camera traps, and new guidelines on species migration and telemetry data, targeted filling of data gaps and data quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work on developing an e-Learning strategy to support GBIF’s training needs has begun and will be completed in the final quarter of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While opportunities to engage with external projects remained limited due to the pandemic, GBIF continued to support and develop training materials for the BioDATA programme, and a graduate programme for the UK Natural Environment Resource Council (see Activity 5a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work was scheduled for the final quarter of 2021 to develop the curriculum for a data quality management course aimed at nodes, with rollout expected to carry over to 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Secretariat launched a new sign-up form for volunteer mentors, and further steps for engaging and monitoring the work of mentors were planned for the final quarter of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements to the guidance materials for project writing, including better organization of FAQs and subtitles for guidance videos, are under way and expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021.</p>

<h4 id="rationale-for-the-period-2017-2022-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#rationale-for-the-period-2017-2022-3"></a>Rationale (for the period 2017-2022)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By coordinating national, regional and thematic networks, Participant nodes play an essential role in helping GBIF engage the broadest possible community of institutions, initiatives and individuals engaged in biodiversity informatics. GBIF must provide learning materials and tools to support nodes efficiently as they work to mobilize biodiversity data, promote the reuse of available data and support users by improving data management and quality. Preferred approaches enable any one node to invest in developing tools and capacity that others can easily leverage for the benefit of the whole community. The skills and experience of the node managers and other team members are recognized as uniquely valuable in helping new Participants establish their nodes and allowing the community to develop together.</p>

<h4 id="2021-progress-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#2021-progress-3"></a>2021 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following progress can be reported on the work items in the 2021 work programme:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to the continuing COVID-19 travel restrictions, plans for in-person regional nodes meetings during 2021 were impossible to implement. Instead, and through consultation with the Nodes Steering Group, the Secretariat decided to organize a <a href="https://gnm2021.gbif.org/">virtual Global Nodes Meeting in June/July 2021</a>, returning to the usual cycle of holding such meetings every second year. As part of the series of sessions held over five days, regional breakout sessions were organized for all six of the GBIF regions. To maximum engagement during the meeting, a series of videos produced by Secretariat staff, nodes and other partners were made available ahead of time, with the live sessions focused on panel discussion and interventions from participants. The virtual format attracted record attendance for a Global Nodes Meeting, with 168 participants attending at least one live session, including node managers, node staff and observers from all regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The involvement of OBIS in the virtual Global Nodes Meeting laid the ground for improved connections between OBIS and GBIF nodes, and this is evident from the progress reported by several nodes. Further work is planned for the remainder of 2021 to map the overlap and gaps between the two networks and determine where further connections could be made, including at regional level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Secretariat established a working group involving several nodes to share experiences and make recommendations on working with indigenous and local knowledge (ILK), especially with regard to application of the <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care">CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Secretariat began development of guidelines to provide more consistent visual branding of products and platforms associated with GBIF nodes, regions and publishers, as well as externally-managed platforms with a dependency on GBIF services. This was in connection with the hosted portal programme (see below), and outcomes of the work are planned for rollout in the final quarter of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.gbif.org/article/T3jBo3MS19P1xnCG2zQUz/piloting-gbif-hosted-portals-call-for-expressions-of-interest-from-the-nodes-community">call for expressions of interest from nodes to take part in the pilot phase of the GBIF hosted portal programme</a>, the Secretariat accepted 19 hosted portal projects, covering institutional, national, regional and thematic examples. The first version of the technical framework was complete as of July 2021, and participants were in the process of preparing their content and styling. Terms were drawn up through legal consultation enabling the Secretariat to provide this hosted service through agreements with participating nodes. The first portals were expected to be made public on the internet in August 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consideration of possible pricing structures for additional services was deferred until the completion of the hosted portal pilot, and will be taken up in the final quarter of 2021 and continued into 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following discussion of the concept of regional offices at GB27 a stepwise approach to regional support was adopted in 2021, and the selection of regional project support contractors for Africa, the Caribbean and Asia (see Activity 1g) may be seen as the first step in this process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Living Atlas community has continued to collaborate virtually throughout the Covid disruption with activity from 16 partners and virtual technical sessions with five. The <a href="https://toolkit-demo.l-a.site/#/">toolkit</a> that configures and manages an installation has been reworked to simplify the processes, and installations are now able to include DOI citation and Sensitive Data Service modules. The community of users are increasingly contributing code to the core ALA software, particularly from France, Sweden and Spain, and the Technical Coordinator has contributed to the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/682aTsuU4npVdKT4AWgK9P">GBIF / ALA data pipeline work</a> in preparation for rolling out across the wider Living Atlas community. A new <a href="https://melecoq.github.io/la-website/">website</a> is near completion, and revisions to the community MoU, branding and documentation have been ongoing.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#rationale-for-the-period-2017-2022-4"></a>Rationale (for the period 2017-2022)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data publishers are an essential component of the GBIF network as they share their content through the common infrastructure. More than 1,700 data publishers actively distribute datasets through GBIF.org, and their ranks increase steadily. Publishers from different parts of the world often face unique challenges, though common themes emerge. These problems range from lack of data publishing experience or skills, lack of equipment, language barriers, difficulties in managing data hosting facilities, and the inability to publish high-quality data or curate data into the future. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) requires ongoing improvements and enhancements, including the establishment of hosted instances that reduce the technical burden on data publishers.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first bi-annual newsletter to data publishers is scheduled for the final quarter of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancements were made to the pages associated with DOI citations of GBIF-mediated data, to enable easier export of citations using standard formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploration of push notifications to data publishers for new citations was deferred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further development of regional helpdesk services was redirected into the establishment of the regional project support contractors (see Activity 1g).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The open curation of vocabularies has been included in the GBIF registry with the LifeStage vocabulary being the first pilot used by GBIF and the ALA. Work is underway with the TDWG Vocabulary Task Group to migrate all existing vocabularies into the registry. Once complete, communities can get involved in the maintenance of the vocabularies which dictate how data is treated in GBIF.org.</p>

<p>Following publication of the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/18GVsWZ6Heas1RBAEmHHSv/gbif-releases-new-guide-for-publication-of-data-on-sensitive-species">updated guidance on generalizing data on sensitive species</a> and in response to issues raised during GB27, the Secretariat set up a working group of nodes to document the various approaches across the community in application of national sensitive species lists. This group will make recommendations on a more consistent approach, and options for helping data publishers to identify records that may present risks if published with precise location details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the 2020 TDWG Conference, GBIF and the BioCASe team held two virtual workshops to capture ideas and hold discussion on the future of the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT). The <a href="https://tinyurl.com/tdwg-2020-IPT-BPS-report">final report</a> captures the outcomes which provided clear direction. Following this feedback GBIF has appointed a new lead developer on the IPT product and released the 2.5.0 version of IPT which addresses many of the key issues.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#rationale-for-the-period-2017-2022-5"></a>Rationale (for the period 2017-2022)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF’s national membership has remained largely static in recent years. Active participation in the network is confined to a limited number of regions, with the most dynamic activity in node collaboration and data publication focused in Western Europe, North America, Latin America, Oceania, increasingly sub-Saharan Africa and limited parts of Asia. Thus, significant parts of the world have little or no direct involvement in GBIF’s activities, which poses a risk to the long-term credibility of GBIF as a global collaborative network. Secretariat staff and existing Participants constantly engage potential new members through ad hoc contacts, but the situation calls for a more strategic approach to expand membership.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="2021-progress-5">
<a class="anchor" href="#2021-progress-5"></a>2021 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking across the whole implementation period to date, 13 new countries have joined GBIF as national Participants. They include Mali (2017); Cameroon, Liberia, South Sudan, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe (2018); Angola, Belarus and Tonga (2019); Armenia, Cambodia and Uzbekistan (2020); and Namibia (2021). Over the same period, seven regional or international organizations have joined as associate participants: the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), iDigBio (Integrated Digitized Biocollections), LifeWatch ERIC, Specify Collections Consortium, Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo), the East Asia Biodiversity Conservation Network, and Observation International. Several of the new members joined GBIF as a direct result of engagement through funded programmes led or supported by GBIF, in particular the BID, BIFA and BioDATA programmes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Opportunities for direct engagement at international conferences and intergovernmental fora continued to be severely limited in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a series of regional engagement webinars was planned for later in the year, building on the successful outreach achieved by such webinars in 2020. In addition, targeted communication products were developed during 2021 aimed at strengthening GBIF’s value proposition for existing and potential national members, as well as supporting the new GBIF resource mobilization strategy (see Activity 1g).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While expansion in formal participation over the period has been modest, engagement through a range of activities has significantly increased GBIF’s global footprint both in terms of the sharing and use of data through the network. By July 2021, institutions from 124 countries were publishing data through GBIF, compared with 61 countries that participate through signature of the GBIF Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Two countries outside the formal network (India and Italy) were within the top ten locations of visitors to GBIF.org, while China ranked second in the world both for data download requests and peer-reviewed studies citing use of data accessed through GBIF. Perhaps the most dramatic increase in activity outside the formal national membership has been in the case of the Russian Federation, where <a href="https://www.gbif.org/country/RU/publishing">data publishing</a> stood at virtually zero in 2017, and by 2021 had reached more than 3.8 million species occurrence records, being shared through GBIF in nearly 500 datasets published by 117 Russian institutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following specific progress on work items in the 2021 Work Programme may be reported:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pro-active engagement in the delayed process for agreeing the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has maintained GBIF’s profile in supporting national implementation of global goals and targets to address the biodiversity crisis. Acknowledgement of GBIF in decisions and background documents still under negotiation ahead of the COP15 meeting in China will provide important additional support for expansion of GBIF’s membership in the coming decade, especially in relation to GBIF’s role to support indicators, taxonomy, knowledge management and capacity development (see also Activity 5c).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plans for an annual call for regional outreach proposals were deferred due to the impossibility of travel during 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploration of potential additional funded capacity programmes was initiated through discussions with a number of potential funding partners; this will be carried over into implementation of the resource mobilization strategy in 2022 (see Activity 1g).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further progress in translation of web content and key publications to support internationalization of GBIF.org was planned for the final quarter of 2021. In addition, the contracting of professional live interpretation for virtual events was piloted in the BID Caribbean data mobilization workshop, and will be further considered for the regional engagement webinars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A catalogue of capacity enhancement services has been drafted as an internal document, and will be developed further in the final quarter of 2021 to support outreach materials for funders under the resource mobilization strategy (see Activity 1g).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of communication products supporting GBIF’s value proposition across key thematic areas was commissioned and will be rolled out in the final quarter of 2021.</p>

<p>Following the 2nd Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in 2018, GBIF has taken a leadership role in convening a number of consultations across the broader biodiversity informatics community through the <a href="https://www.allianceforbio.org/"><em>alliance for biodiversity knowledge</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2021, as part of the EU-funded <a href="https://www.synthesys.info/">SYNTHESYS+ project</a> and within the framework of the <em>alliance</em>, GBIF convened a workshop focused on Converging Digital Specimens and Extended Specimens - Towards a global specification for data integration.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among its other roles, the GBIF Secretariat coordinates efforts to expand the scale and scope of GBIF activity beyond the levels achievable using only annual core Participant contributions. GBIF Participants commit to establish and operate nodes which serve as significant centres for GBIF activity. Some nodes have sufficient resources to contribute skills and developments which advance GBIF’s work, while others may require external support to become fully active. A limited amount of funding has been allocated each year under the GBIF work programme to support capacity enhancement for GBIF nodes. GBIF or individual Participants may also secure supplementary funds to contribute to particular areas of GBIF work. Improved coordination of these various resources will assist GBIF to advance more rapidly at all scales.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>During 2021, the Secretariat selected a total of 42 projects for funding under the second phase of the Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) programme following the calls for the proposals launched during 2020. These included <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/7l1zEWC918t4F5i1T6XQDN/bid-programme-funds-18-new-projects-in-sub-saharan-africa">18 projects in sub-Saharan Africa</a>, 18 in the Caribbean and 7 in the Pacific. In addition to the top-up funding of €1.6M from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/international-partnerships_en">European Commission’s Directorate-General for International Partnerships (EU-INTPA)</a> to support the new phase of BID, GBIF secured a funding agreement with the <a href="https://jrsbiodiversity.org/">JRS Biodiversity Foundation</a> to contribute €411K towards BID projects in Africa, enabling approval of five additional projects on biodiversity data mobilization and use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The continuing COVID-19 travel restrictions inevitably disrupted the original plans for implementing BID activities during 2021. Apart from requiring funded projects to avoid international travel in their plans for this year, the main impact was the need to replace planned in-person training workshops organized by the Secretariat with virtual alternatives for the three target regions. The Secretariat Participation and Engagement team organized virtual data mobilization training for BID grantees in Africa (May), the Caribbean (July/August) and Pacific (August), using the curriculum developed during the first phase of BID and combining a preparatory phase with 'live' sessions over a week and subsequent submission of exercises to demonstrate acquisition of the necessary skills. Additional virtual sessions were conducted for the project teams implementing the data use grants, introduced as an innovation in the second phase of BID.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BID Steering Committee approved a proposal from the Secretariat to redirect funds originally budgeted for in-person workshops towards regional project support contracts, aimed at providing ongoing technical support for the funded projects within the target regions, and helping to grow the community of practice developed through the BID programme. Following open calls in <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/3Rjfr2mlTH0xLxt5wKNvPA/call-for-proposals-for-bid-project-support-in-africa">Africa</a> and the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/2HMlzg8ijKRJKtH2WqX1XK/call-for-proposals-for-bid-project-support-in-the-caribbean">Caribbean</a>, three individuals in Africa and one in the Caribbean were selected to provide these support services under 2-year contracts starting in August 2021. As well as supporting the projects funded through BID, these contractors will work with regional node representatives to help coordinate and direct technical support for GBIF nodes in the respective regions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/6rId141fSTuAVznmZhD2YG/closed-new-call-to-promote-the-mobilization-and-use-of-biodiversity-data-in-asia">call for proposals in December 2020</a>, the Secretariat selected 13 data mobilization projects in Asia, under the sixth funding round of the Biodiversity Information Fund for Asia (BIFA), using supplementary funds contributed by the Ministry of Environment, Government of Japan. As this was expected to be the last BIFA call in its present form, the BIFA Steering Committee agreed to 'double up' two annual contributions into a single call with €220,000 available for grants up to €20,000 each, with projects implemented over 18 months. Particular priority in the call was given to projects combining DNA-based techniques such as barcoding with mobilization of data through GBIF. A virtual data mobilization training workshop for the BIFA projects was scheduled for November 2021, with funds reserved for an in-person engagement meeting in Asia in 2022 if the travel situation permits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on the model developed for the BID programme, the Secretariat prepared a call for proposals for regional project support contracts for Asia, using funds from the EU-funded SYNTHESYS+ programme under an agreement reached with the programme partners. These roles will be recruited by November 2021 from Asian applicants and will support project teams funded through BIFA as well as nodes and data publishers in the region.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 2021 call for proposals under the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme resulted in selection of five projects involving a total of 14 nodes, led from Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Cameroon and South Sudan. The themes of the selected projects included mentoring to support node development, extending knowledge of data quality, and the role of zoological collections in filling taxonomic and geographic data gaps.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF network participants are able to reliably exchange data thanks to their adherence to a set of standards. As GBIF looks to grow in capability, enable exchange of richer content and improve the quality of data, the standards must be revised and evolve accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current standards adopted by GBIF are not yet adequate to accommodate the needs expressed by many potential and existing data publishers. Weaknesses in the model have led to ambiguous or over-complex data representations and unclear documentation, leading to difficulties in data integration and use. The main issues relate to uncertainties around the use of Darwin Core record types, the basisOfRecord element, and the use of Core and Extension vocabularies. Reviewing and updating the core domain model, tightening up the vocabularies and documentation and adopting more robust exchange standards will result in an easier to use, and a wider reaching GBIF data exchange network.</p>

<p>The Secretariat have started work that will result in a new information model for GBIF. This model will allow GBIF to better accommodate wider data types in its data infrastructure, potentially including tracking data (organism-oriented data), ecological and monitoring data (site-oriented data), automated detection (e.g. camera traps), preserved physical material (e.g. tissue or environment specimens), DNA-derived data (e.g. metabarcoding projects) and literature-based data (e.g. material citations). Following approval by the Science Committee, Budget Committee and Executive Committee, the Secretariat has commissioned a contracted expert to work during in the second half of 2021 to compile known use cases, and define a data model and initial formats for data exchange beyond the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A). The outputs of this work will be followed by prototyping work in 2022.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most significant challenge to improving the quality of aggregated occurrence data is the continuing need for a comprehensive checklist of known species, and even for a comprehensive list of published scientific names. Interpreting and mapping names depends on the quality and completeness of these resources. Even in cases where names in occurrence records are incorrect or misspelled, better names infrastructure can assist by increasing confidence that fuzzy match algorithms or human intervention is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Delivering these resources is the focus of a number of GBIF Participants and other stakeholders, including the Catalogue of Life partnership, WoRMS, nomenclators (IPNI, Index Fungorum, ZooBank) and many national, regional or taxonomic databases. A comprehensive resource for scientific names and taxon concepts organized at least as a workable reference classification (but with support for additional classifications as appropriate) would also benefit other infrastructures, including Encyclopedia of Life, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Barcode of Life and GBIF nodes, and improve interoperability between data from these infrastructures. It would also be beneficial to accommodate vernacular names, informal names for undescribed species and other identifiers such as Barcode Index Numbers.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#rationale-for-the-period-2017-2022-10"></a>Rationale (for the period 2017-2022)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Natural history collections are the largest source of data on biodiversity outside nature itself. Collectively the worlds natural history collections number about 3 billion specimens and document over 300 years of active human exploration of biodiversity on earth. In addition the fossil remains provide us with glimpses into the very far past before humans existed. The collections and their ancillary materials (images, collectors’ notes, sequences, measurements, etc.), contain colossal amounts of data that should be digitized and shared. Only about 10% of the world’s collections have been digitized and only a portion of digitized collections are shared publicly through the internet. A large number of current GBIF publishers comprise natural history museums and herbaria. The Secretariat will work with Participants to deliver the most comprehensive catalogue possible of collections, including metadata to publicize undigitized collections as a first step towards their digitization and mobilization.</p>

<h4 id="2021-progress-10">
<a class="anchor" href="#2021-progress-10"></a>2021 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat created a <a href="https://github.com/gbif/registry/blob/dev/roadmap-grscicoll.md">road map</a> in 2021 for the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll">GBIF Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl)</a>, focusing on the development necessary to allow wider external contribution, and to mature the processes around editing. Editors may now be given scoped responsibility at institutional or national level. Induction webinars have been held with several nodes, resulting in a global team of 45 editors and 12 mediators actively curating content in the registry as of July 2021. Training videos are being developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.idigbio.org/">iDigBio</a> collection catalogue is now powered by GRSciColl, through its open APIs. iDigBio data managers edit directly through the online <a href="https://registry.gbif.org/">editing interface</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentation for editors is in progress and can be expected in Q3 2021. All GRSciColl fields are associated with an English-language description available in the online forms. Capabilities for anyone to suggest a change were deployed in May. Proposed data changes are reviewed by the pool of editors and mediators before being applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Capability for user interface translations is set up to support multilingual content. Editors and external communities in support of the catalogue are invited to propose translations to support their work. This has already been taken up by the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) Biodiversity Crisis Response Committee.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A service has been deployed allowing the linking of collections in GRSciColl to specimen records in GBIF. This has resulted in 134 million records being linked to GRSciColl entries. A basic data dashboard is now available for institutions and collections such as <a href="https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll/institution/59175240-4500-42b9-9e98-42ae299a5e9b/metrics">this example</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Options for a richer user interface for GRSciColl are being considered within the hosted portal framework (see Activity 1c). There is work remaining on the data model, and how to make best use of the data clustering to link related data before this can progress. It is anticipated the collections catalogue user interface will continue into 2022.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adoption of persistent identifiers, such as Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifiers is actively being discussed within European nodes (e.g. through DiSSCo) with some nodes piloting use of ROR IDs on their entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integration with the CETAF registry remains an objective, but has not yet started due to the effort required to enable external editors and focus on content issues. It is expected to extend into 2022. Piloting a profile of the TDWG Collection Descriptions to capture collection-level metadata has also been delayed and will be considered for 2023.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF has a range of tools, including fitness-for-use groups, other community consultations, feedback channels, direct communication with authors of scientific studies, and societal demands, to identify and collect data needs. Addressing data gaps may require focus on gaining additional occurrence records, targeting data areas missing from published records, or getting additional metadata elements. By consolidating and prioritizing demands for data content, in the context of already accessible data and knowledge of resources which are not yet available as open data, GBIF will be positioned to inform collection and data holders, funding institutions and political decision makers of the most worthwhile and cost-effective ways to extend the available knowledge base.</p>

<p>Analytics work in 2021 focused on the exploration of taxonomic gaps, checking for areas in GBIF-mediated occurrences that are insufficiently mapped to the Catalogue of Life (CoL). No major areas were discovered, most gaps being detected in the area of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) rather than Linnean taxonomy. Minor results in that area were fed back to CoL’s issue tracking system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Updated guidance on prioritizing data mobilization based on analysis of data gaps was being commissioned in 2021 as part of the GBIF documentation programme (see Activity 1b). This guidance will take account of previous work carried out by the Secretariat during the current implementation period to analyse gaps and biases in data available through GBIF.org, such as those reported to the 2020 regional meetings and <a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-regional-statistics-2020/">documented in the GBIF data blog</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF serves as an integration point for any source of evidence of the recorded occurrence of species in time and space. A primary role for the GBIF infrastructure is to serve as a comprehensive single point of access for discovery, access, use and curation of all such evidence. Several classes of data are already well-supported within the GBIF network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These include collections data, observations from field research, and many categories of citizen science data. However, there are other new and developing streams of data which should be accommodated if GBIF is to serve as the platform for supporting comprehensive data assessment and modelling (e.g. for GEO BON Essential Biodiversity Variables, IPBES assessments, Red List assessments, etc.). These include efforts to mine historical data records from literature, genomics activities and particularly barcode-driven surveys, and potentially species-level data from remote-sensing systems. More work is also still needed to engage with the full spread of research activities delivering sampling event data of various kinds. GBIF needs to ensure that it provides simple, effective and beneficial ways for researchers to share these and other streams of Darwin Core compatible data.</p>

<p>During 2021, the Secretariat developed a framework for running data mobilization campaigns based on thematic data streams, including engagement of expert groups, identification of potential mobilization targets, and help desk services to support data formatting and publication in collaboration with nodes. Specific mechanisms are being trialled with regard to data on disease vectors and hosts, as well as soil biodiversity data (see Activity 5b), and data mobilized through the private sector (see Activity 3c).</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Sweden:</strong> 2021: By teaming up in a unified organization (SBDI), a considerable number of ”lukewarm” providers have a stronger commitment to arrange, standardize and begin publishing data with SBDI and thus GBIF-Sweden. This includes governmental agencies, universities (mainly individual researchers but also monitoring programmes run on behalf of agencies). We have not yet seriously confronted private or semi-private data holders but expect to start doing this in the near future. Yet, we have to be cautious not to interfere very strongly with the public conservation management sector in Sweden since this domain has so far by itself and by various responsible agencies been expected to be indigenously run a in parallel to GBIF using idiosyncratic tools for data publication and extraction/analysis. As SBDI we now have the mandate to become ”the major, single gateway to Swedish biodiversity data”.</p>

GBIF-Sweden has been accepted but with some suspicion from several sides: collections managers have always complained – without realizing that the responsibility is in fact mainly theirs – about data quality issues, whereas environmentalists have seen GBIF-Sweden – again without being aware of the real situation - as serving mainly collections managers and researchers with far too sophisticated data for their meaningful use.

<p>Many researchers hold potentially valuable data which are not yet in a suitable digital format for integration into GBIF. Historical publications are a similar source of valuable data which remain inaccessible. This offers an opportunity to establish a community platform to capture information on such datasets where the researcher or owner lacks the time or capability to make the data available as a GBIF-compatible dataset, and to enable interested individuals to volunteer time to collaborate with the owner to publish a dataset, potentially in conjunction with a data paper credited to all parties. Such a model may address a key bottleneck in bringing valuable data online.</p>

<p>Journals are the traditional established avenues for scientific communication. They not only disseminate research findings and other scholarly communications but are increasingly helping to disseminate research data. These data may be provided as supplementary materials or deposited in biodiversity data repositories as a precondition for publication of the paper. However, such data publishing data does not necessarily facilitate its integration with other related data or make the data discoverable and reusable.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There exists a significant portion of data available through GBIF.org that is not actively curated by a data host. In some cases, there are no resources or desire to make further edits to the datasets. These datasets are effectively orphaned and the GBIF.org version of the dataset is often the last remaining version available on the internet. As GBIF develops mechanisms to provide feedback to data publishers and support curation of datasets, we need to consider that these orphaned datasets will not be updated with corrections or migrated to adhere to modern data standards.</p>

<h4 id="2021-progress-16">
<a class="anchor" href="#2021-progress-16"></a>2021 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work earlier in the current implementation period addressed the issue of <a href="https://github.com/gbif/watchdog/wiki/OrphanedDatasets">orphaned datasets</a>, with a major effort to ensure that datasets no longer connected to their original host were transferred to a 'live' version that could be successfully crawled by the Secretariat, with many nodes 'adopting' these datasets for the purposes of hosting and curation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following <a href="https://discourse.gbif.org/t/gbif-exports-as-public-datasets-in-cloud-environments/1835">open discussion on the Community Forum</a>, GBIF now provides monthly exports of GBIF occurrence records and makes them available on Microsoft Azure in the <a href="https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog">Planetary Computer</a> and on Amazon AWS as <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/gbif/">Public Datasets</a>. Tutorials and guides have been developed, and support will be given to early adopters. The Secretariat anticipates that GBIF-mediated data will be available in a similar manner on the Google Cloud, and made available in Google BigQuery during Q3 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When implementing the new service for exports to cloud environments, the Secretariat was very conscious of the risk of losing the connection between uses of GBIF-mediated data and the data publishers whose records are included in applications using these services. To address this, a new citation tool was developed in support of the cloud data services, known as the <a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/derived-datasets/">Derived Dataset</a> service. This ensure users of cloud environments, or after further filtering of any GBIF download, can still provide a DOI-based citation for the content used (see Activity 3e).</p>

<p>GBIF has been accepted as a <a href="https://providers.eosc-portal.eu/service/gbif.gbif_species_occurrence_data">Data Provider within the European Open Science Cloud</a>.

<p>Assessing data quality includes applying data validation tools to capture and monitor suspected and confirmed errors and ambiguities in data, highlighting useful areas for additional information (metadata and qualifiers) that would improve usability and enhance processing options, and documenting completeness and standardization of information both within a dataset and within aggregated data. A number of validation tools exist in the wider community, and should be brought together to mutually profit from investments and to more efficiently plan future distributed development efforts.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most significant user community for GBIF is academic researchers. Even policy-related uses of GBIF often derive from the work of such individuals. It is accordingly important for GBIF to understand the needs of researchers and academic societies and to communicate clearly regarding the tools and services GBIF can deliver. Communication should include information and support materials for students and early-career researchers, on both publication and use of data, including citation, use tracking and data papers. University faculties and libraries may be important channels for this information. In addition, GBIF needs to engage more closely with taxonomic societies and other academic bodies which could be key collaborators in curating and improving data. Achieving such an outcome depends on understanding how GBIF can become a more central tool for their work, so that work on digital knowledge directly benefits those who contribute</p>

<p><strong>Sweden:</strong> 2021: Being funded by the Swedish Research council (SRC) as a national research infrastructure (with 50% co-funding by the partners in SBDI) GBIF-Sweden’s predominant users are by definition expected to be found within academia. It is mandatory for us to produce key performance indicators regarding the use of the infrastructure in terms of academic users alone. altogether disregarding use by any other group (this in fact being mandatory!). Against this we struggle to convince  both the SRC and particularly the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) whose influence on environmental management practitioners otherwise advised to use indigenous tools for data extraction and analysis is inevitably high, of the advantage of instead using and collaborating in developing SBDI and GBIF tools. We obviously have strong connections to academia, yet we still need to find more opportunities to contribute to basic and advanced education, training at least the next generation of researchers and management officials in the use of SBDI and GBIF. As described under the first major heading of the annual work plan update, GBIF-Sweden, and by the SBDI collaboration also our colleagues, participate in, or run a set of courses and workshops in biodiversity informatics in Sweden. Outside of our sphere, interest is unfortunately alarmingly low!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF-mediated data are aggregated from many sources and are consequently heterogeneous, varying in fitness for various uses. During 2015–2016, GBIF established three task groups on data fitness-for-use, in agrobiodiversity research, in distribution modelling and in research on invasive alien species, to document how these communities use GBIF data and to understand their data quality demands. The resulting reports inform data mobilization, data processing and improvements to GBIF.org. Further expert groups are considered during the current Strategic Plan period.  Depending on resources, these groups will operate through a combination of face-to-face meetings and online or remote collaboration.</p>

Among the early activities of the group was to approve commission of a <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/7bCzV4wWp7olE76fiT6jfU/call-for-systematic-review-of-literature-using-gbif-mediated-data-relating-to-human-health">systematic review of literature using GBIF-mediated data relating to human health</a>. Following an open call, Dr Francisca Astorga of Universidad de Chile was selected to carry out this review, which will will help to inform GBIF’s future work in meeting the biodiversity data needs of the biomedical research community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional work requested by the task group is an initiative to promote mobilization of biodiversity datasets relevant to human health, through support for data papers to be published in a special journal issue following a call later in 2021. This will be enabled through a financial contribution from the <a href="https://tdr.who.int/">Tropical Disease Research centre (TDR)</a> of the World Health Organization, with GBIF providing funded help desk support to ensure that datasets associated with the data papers are correctly formatted and published through GBIF.org (see also Activity 3e).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of GBIF’s key roles is as organizer or global evidence for species distribution, based on point records for species in time and space. Expansion of data publishing to accommodate sampling event data enables this evidence base also to mobilize and organize basic data on species populations and abundance. As a result, GBIF is positioned to serve as a critical resource for supporting biodiversity assessment at all scales. In particular, GBIF should serve as the data foundation for GEO BON to deliver Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) for species distribution and population abundance. These EBVs represent a continuum from modelled representation of species occupancy (presence-only) in defined units of space and time through to richer assessment of species abundance in those units. GEO BON should serve as a forum for addressing the challenges of modelling such variables and interpolating sensibly between existing data points. This includes determination of appropriate scale at which modelled variables are adequately supported by current data. GBIF needs to ensure that it delivers the data foundations required for these activities, thereby supporting the requirements of IPBES, species Red Listing through IUCN and national authorities, the CBD and the Aichi Targets and Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>Following the contract awarded in 2020 to the VertNet consortium in response to the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/news/1TMjgXqZ3LRynaCICIQr09/call-for-proposals-analysis-of-biodiversity-data-needs-in-the-post-2020-framework">call for proposals to analyse the biodiversity data needs in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework</a>, the Secretariat worked with the authors to finalize the document which will be published later in 2021. The analysis presents a number of conclusions and recommendations for more consistent and transparent use of species occurrence data in indicators monitoring the goals and targets of the framework. Plans are being developed for a workshop to be held early in 2022 bringing together key partners to help implement the recommendations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat has engaged actively in the delayed preparations for the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference, through virtual sessions of the Convention’s subsidiary bodies in May and June, as well as the final meeting of the Open Ended Working Group in August/September 2021 addressing recommendations for the detail of the framework. Through collaboration with GEO BON and a number of national governments, these meetings have provided an opportunity to highlight the importance of primary data mobilization in successful implementation of the framework, and this is reflected in wording of several of the draft recommendations arising from these meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In April ahead of the subsidiary body meetings, the Secretariat organized and chaired a <a href="https://science4biodiversity.org/session-videos/">virtual round table on biodiversity monitoring and data</a> as part of the <a href="https://science4biodiversity.org/">Fifth Science-Policy Forum for Biodiversity and Eighth International Conference on Sustainability Science</a>. Including speakers from GEO BON, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, UNEP-WCMC, NatureServe, iDiv and the Instituto de Investigación de Recursos Biológicos Alexander von Humboldt, the session provided an opportunity to reach a broad science/policy audience regarding the need for increased investment in biodiversity data and monitoring. The key messages from the round table were included in an <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/8cd2/6eab/663d8a4cc2d198b104225345/sbstta-24-inf-28-en.pdf">information document</a> provided for the virtual SBSTTA24 meeting.</p>

This included a survey of experts involved in the IUCN Species Survival Commission to understand better the way that GBIF-mediated data is used in the Red Listing process, and issues identified by IUCN users. The survey will help to inform planned engagement activities including webinars to improve understanding of GBIF’s services and functionality, as well as emphasizing best practices for data citation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat implemented a new connection with the IUCN Red List web services to ensure that the latest version of the extinction risk category is available on the species pages of GBIF.org. Development has begun to implement filtering of occurrence data by Red List extinction risk category, but issues related to the handling of synonyms are being addressed before this functionality can go live on GBIF.org.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat continued to work with the IPBES Task Force on Knowledge and Data across a number of areas to improve the use and citation of data in assessments, as well as prioritizing data gaps (see also Activity 3a).

<p><strong>Taxonomic Databases Working Group:</strong> Please note from recent NSF grant, we developed a tool for use by the IUCN to visualize the georeferences against the shape files for the Horseshoe Bats and relatives. We successfully worked out a way to give them access to this information. For your purposes, we note they shared with us that most often, groups come to them asking for data, but rarely do groups come to them, offering them data. They were pleased to receive the contact and the data — for use by their IUCN group that manages these particular taxa. (Note of course we selected these taxa for their alleged link to Covid19).</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#rationale-for-the-years-2017-2022"></a>Rationale (for the years 2017-2022)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF Participants require clear evidence of the benefits arising from investments in national- scale content mobilization and from GBIF global activity. At present, the main source of evidence presented derives from monitoring of published literature to identify uses of GBIF within research. This activity has been reported through annual GBIF Science Reviews and clearly demonstrates growing use of GBIF in research. Monitoring the literature in this way is time-consuming, and becomes more so as the relevant literature increases. A sustainable approach is required for future monitoring of this kind. GBIF now issues and promotes Digital Object Identifiers for data downloads and expects that these can be used both to simplify discovery and to improve the detail offered to Participants and data publishers on some uses of data. Participants also require more information on non-research uses of GBIF infrastructure, particularly in various kinds of government or industry assessments. A broader review of costs and benefits arising from GBIF investment would be valuable for Participants arguing continued engagement within GBIF and other countries considering Participation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The outcomes of the systematic review of research enabled by access to GBIF-mediated data, commissioned by the Secretariat in 2020 and carried out by Dr Mason Heberling were published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018093118">PNAS journal</a>, providing a valuable reference on the range of science across many disciplines that is made possible by the GBIF collaboration and investment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The total number of <a href="https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=literature&amp;literatureType=journal&amp;relevance=GBIF_USED&amp;peerReview=true">research papers citing use of GBIF as a data source</a> passed the 6,000 milestone in July 2021, and the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/science-review">2020 Science Review</a>, published in February 2021, summarized 67 articles reflecting the range of research and policy applications supported by GBIF. Based on the citation trends observed by July 2021, the number of research papers citing GBIF use was anticipated to exceed 1,200 during the whole year, compared with 987 in 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support broader demonstration of GBIF’s impact, the Secretariat secured approval from the Executive Committee during 2021 to commission a robust quantitative analysis of the value and impact of the GBIF network. Terms of reference for this study will include examining GBIF’s investment and use values, contingent value, efficiency impacts, innovation value and return on investment. Responding to a recommendation of the GBIF 20-year review, this work is expected to begin in the last quarter of 2021 and be completed by the middle of 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Finland:</strong> FinBIF has developed tools for <a href="https://laji.fi/en/theme/publications">automatic tracking of citations</a>. FinBIF has also launched Restricted Data Request Service for managing data requests for sensitive data or data that have other restrictions preventing open access. The data compiled will shed light on what is restricted-use data needed for (mining, wind farms, power lines, construction etc.) and will give unique data on impact of making restricted data available and accessible.</p>

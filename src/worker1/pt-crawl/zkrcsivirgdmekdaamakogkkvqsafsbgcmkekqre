<b>CREATED/PUBLISHED</b><br> United States : Massachusetts : Boston Little, Brown and Company 1872 03 01<p>
<b>SUMMARY</b><br> This Act designates Yellowstone as a park "for the benefit and enjoyment of the people," with "all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders" within it to be retained "in their natural condition," though roads, bridle-paths, and buildings for the accomodation of visitors may be permitted.  Jurisdiction is given to the Secretary of Interior.<p>
<b>NOTES</b><br>This landmark legislation creates the first national park.  The painter and explorer George Catlin had proposed the idea that Western prairies might be preserved as "a nation's Park" in 1832, the same year that Congress set aside the medicinal springs of Hot Springs, Arkansas, as a public reservation (the area became a national park in 1921), and the 1864 Congressional grant of Yosemite to California (13 Stat. 325) had set an important legislative precedent.  Nevertheless, the implementation of the national park idea in this Act must be considered a conservation milestone of global significance.  The bill's immediate origins are shadowy and open to dispute (explorer and subsequent Park Superintendent Nathaniel P. Langford's well-known claim that the idea originated around a Yellowstone-area campfire in 1870 is almost certainly an ex post facto legend), but the success of the measure in Congress was indisputably due to recognition of the area's great commercial potential as a magnet for tourism--the bill was pressed by representatives of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, which stood to profit handsomely--as well as its demonstrable dearth of other exploitable natural resources.  The photographs of William Henry Jackson and the paintings of Thomas Moran, both from the Hayden Expedition of 1871, provided Congress with powerfully persuasive images of the region as a place of uniquely American wonders. <p>Published 1873. <p>

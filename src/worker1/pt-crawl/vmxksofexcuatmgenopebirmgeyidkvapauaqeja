	<p>When <em>Hairspray</em> originally debuted on screens in 1988, people thought it was weird for a John Waters film.&nbsp; That is saying a lot.&nbsp; Waters (<a href="dirty_shame.html"><em>A Dirty Shame</em></a>, <a href="cecil_b_demented.html"><em>Cecil B. Demented</em></a>), was notorious for outrageous, lowbrow, boundary pushing movies (he has since calmed down considerably and almost feels like an anachronism), and all of a sudden releases a bright, happy movie that was fine for most people.&nbsp; And it even tackled social issues!&nbsp; <em>Hairspray</em> later made the move from the big screen to the stage, and now returns to the big screen. <br>
          <br>
  The result is something that is far more enjoyable than one would expect.&nbsp; <em>Hairspray</em> is just a lot of fun.&nbsp; The music (songs and lyrics by Marc Shaiman) are poppy confections that are catchy, and people will find themselves tapping their feet and bobbing their heads along.&nbsp; Even though the movie touches up racism, there is still a bizarre feeling of innocence - it probably has to do with the setting in the 60s.&nbsp; Either way, director Adam Shankman (<a href="cheaper_dozen2.html"><em>Cheaper by the Dozen 2</em></a>, <a href="pacifier.html"><em>The Pacifier</em></a>) and adapter Leslie Dixon (<a href="just_like_heaven.html"><em>Just Like Heaven</em></a>, <em>Freaky Friday</em>) cram a lot into a movie that seems shorter than it is.&nbsp; The only time <em>Hairspray</em> slows down is when it stops to tackle more serious issues. <br>
  <br>
  Hairspray revolves around Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a heavyset high schooler who adores <em>The Corny Collins Show</em>, and in particular, the dreamy Link Larkin (Zac Efron).&nbsp; Every day, Tracy and her friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes, <a href="shes_man.html"><em>She's the Man</em></a>, <a href="robots.html"><em>Robots</em></a>) rush home to watch Collins (James Marsden, <a href="superman_returns.html"><em>Superman Returns</em></a>, <a href="x-men_last_stand.html"><em>X-Men:&nbsp; The Last Stand</em></a>) and other people dance.&nbsp; Little do Tracy and Pingleton know that the show's producer, Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer, <a href="sinbad.html"><em>Sinbad</em></a>, <a href="white_oleander.html"><em>White Oleander</em></a>), schemes to keep the members of the show white, thin, and beautiful.&nbsp; A space opens up for a dancer on the show, and Turnblad, much to the disgust of Von Tussle, tries out.&nbsp; Her dancing is great, and she impresses the more progressive Collins, and wins a place on the show.<br>
  <br>
  <em>The Corny Collins Show</em> is Tracy's gateway into her burgeoning adulthood.&nbsp; She befriends Seaweed (Elijah Kelley, <a href="take_lead.html"><em>Take the Lead</em></a>, <a href="28days.html"><em>28 Days</em></a>), an African-American and dancer on Negro Day, which happens once a month on Collins' show.&nbsp; She doesn't understand why blacks and whites cannot share the same show, and why they need to be separated by a rope when they dance.&nbsp; Bright-eyed Tracy, full of hope and inspiration, envisions a colorful melting pot where everybody can dance and have fun.&nbsp; Tracy's mother Edna (a dragged up John Travolta, <a href="wild_hogs.html"><em>Wild Hogs</em></a>, <em>Lonely Hearts</em>), hasn't left the house in years.&nbsp; She disapproves of Tracy's dancing, but there is something about it that intrigues her.&nbsp; Over the course of nearly two hours, Shankman has his cast dance and sing their way into even the most jaded audience member, climaxing in a rousing dance-off where Tracy takes on the resident WASP bimbo.&nbsp; It's a lot of fun, and goes by a little too quickly.</p></td>

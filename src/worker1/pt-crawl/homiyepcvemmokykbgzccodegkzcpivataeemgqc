<p class="one"><a href="southwh.html"><span class="caption">Southwell workhouse</span></a>, Nottinghamshire. Photograph and text by <a href="../../misc/bloy.html">Marjie Bloy</a>, Senior Research Fellow, National University of Singapore. This was the 
  first of the &quot;new&quot; <a href="plaatext.html">workhouses</a> in England; 
  conditions there were deliberately harsh, to discourage the poor from seeking 
  relief. The master's quarters were situated in the centre of the building and 
  from the windows of his rooms, he was able to see each of the exercise yards 
  apart from one corner of the able-bodied men's yard.</p>

<p>Families were separated in the workhouse: there was an exercise yard for able-bodied 
  men, male 'deserving poor', able-bodied women, 'deserving poor' women and another 
  for the children. The dividing and perimeter walls were too high for people 
  to be able to see outside or into the other yards.</p>

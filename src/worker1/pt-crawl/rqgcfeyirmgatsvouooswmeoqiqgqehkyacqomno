                <h3 id="blog"><a href="https://blog.stoa.org">Blog</a></h3>
                <p>Since 2003, the <span class="title">Stoa Blog</span> fronted this site, providing news, announcements, and other posts of interest to creators and users of digital resources in the Classics. In 2019, the blog was rehosted to a server operated
                    by the <a href="https://icls.sas.ac.uk/">Institute
                            of Classical Studies</a> at the University of London. It can be reached directly at <a href="https://blog.stoa.org/">https://blog.stoa.org/</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="about">About this site</h3>
                <p>The <span class="title">Stoa Consortium for Electronic Publication in the Humanities</span> was founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Scaife">Allen Ross Scaife</a> in 1997 as an umbrella project for many projects in the
                    Classics. Information about the history and the current status of the Stoa may be found on <a href="about">this site's "about" page</a>.</p>

                <p><span class="title">The Ancient City of Athens</span> is a photographic archive of the archaeological and architectural remains of ancient Athens (Greece), developed by <a href="https://chc.arch.tamu.edu/about/people/index.html">Kevin T.

                    the assistance of Pamela A. Draper and published on the Stoa in 2002 with the editorial oversight of <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/classicalstudies/people/facultyMahoney.htm">Anne Mahoney</a> and Ross Scaife (assisted by Mark Weber
                    and Phillip Sauerbeck).</p>
                <p>Two derivative versions of this work are now available online:</p>

                    <li>The "Stoa" version, <a href="lane">hosted here as of 2019</a>, is a static HTML capture of the original, which used the Perseus hopper to transform the XML files used to encode the text.</li>

                <p><span class="title">Dēmos: Classical Athenian Democracy</span> was developed and edited by <a href="http://www2.furman.edu/academics/classics/about/Pages/FacultyandStaff.aspx">Christopher W.
                            Blackwell</a> for the Stoa. It incorporates contributions from Danielle Allen, Elizabeth Baughman, Victor Bers, Michael de Brauw, Matthew Christ, Christopher Cotten, Casey Dué, Michael Gagarin, Craig Gibson, Edward Harris,
                    Steven Johnstone, Konstantinos Kapparis, Adriaan Lanni, Thomas R. Martin, Josiah Ober, David Phillips, Hershal Pleasant, Amy Smith, and S.C. Todd. The original publication was encoded in TEI XML and converted to HTML for web dissemination
                    on demand using a bespoke web application dependent on Apache Tomcat and Coccoon. This application could no longer be maintained after 2019 and so a static HTML version of the content is now hosted here.</p>

                <h3 id="diotima"><a href="https://diotima-doctafemina.org/">Diotíma</a> v. 3.0</h3>
                <p><span class="title">Diotíma: Materials for the Study of Women and Gender in the Ancient World</span> (v. 1.0) was launched by Ross Scaife and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzanne-bonefas-0896ba9">Suzanne Bonefas</a> in early 1995
                    and was maintained by Scaife until his death in 2008. The site ceased to be updated after 2011 and the server rights have since lapsed. An archival copy of the original <span class="title">Diotíma</span> and all its materials can be
                    accessed via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190628224208/http://www.stoa.org/diotima/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190628224208/http://www.stoa.org/diotima/></a>. In 2017, the
                    <a href="https://www.wccclassics.org/">Women’s Classical Caucus</a> took over maintenance of a “new and improved” <span class="title">Diotima</span> (v. 2.0), which itself expired in 2020 and may now only be accessed through the Wayback
                    Machine at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200301185952/https://diotimawcc.wordpress.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20200301185952/https://diotimawcc.wordpress.com/</a>. Some content was migrated from the original
                    <span class="title">Diotíma</span> to the 2.0 version. In late 2019 the decision was made to move the website, ad-free, to the home server of the Women’s Classical Caucus. The migration of content from
                    <span class="title">Diotíma</span> v.1.0 and v.2.0 was completed in February 2020, and <a href="https://diotima-doctafemina.org/">the resulting <span class="title">Diotíma Version 3.0</span></a> is the present version of record.</a>.

                <h3 id="educe"><a href="educe">EDUCE</a></h3>
                <p><span class="title">Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and Exploration</span> was a project Scaife was pursuing at the time of his death in 2008. It aimed to develop non-destructive mechanisms for detecting and visualizing text
                    preserved on problematic objects like papyrus scrolls and damaged codices. The page linked here announces the award, in 2006, of a large grant from the National Science Foundation to Scaife and his co-investigators (<a href="https://www.engr.uky.edu/directory/seales-brent">Brent
                            Seales</a> and <a href="https://www.engr.uky.edu/directory/griffioen-james">James
                            Griffioen</a>). Seales has continued the work in collaboration with others under the rubric: "<a href="http://www2.cs.uky.edu/dri/">The Digital Restoration Initiative</a>".</p>

                <h3 id="aelfric"><a href="http://www.sd-editions.com/aelfric/intro.1rev.php">The Electronic Aelfric</a></h3>
                <p>For a period of time between 2006 and 2010, the Stoa seems to have hosted an informational website about a project directed by <a href="https://www.biola.edu/directory/people/aaron-kleist">Aaron J.
                            Kleist</a> and funded by the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities (<a href="https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=RQ-50239-06">"The Ælfric of Eynsham
                            Project"; Grant number: RQ-50239-06</a>). This project has since reached full publication under the auspices of the Modern Language Association's "Approved Edition" program. Its title is now <span class="title">The Digital Aelfric: Eight Catholic Homilies</span>                    and it is hosted on the Scholarly Digital Editions website: <a href="http://www.sd-editions.com/aelfric/intro.1rev.php">http://www.sd-editions.com/aelfric/intro.1rev.php</a>.

                <h3 id="epidoc"><a href="https://epidoc.stoa.org/gl/latest/">EpiDoc Guidelines</a></h3>
                <p>Since the late 1990s, the Stoa has hosted both <a href="https://epidoc.stoa.org/gl/latest/">the Guidelines</a> and
                    <a href="https://epidoc.stoa.org/schema/latest/">the RelaxNG schema</a> maintained by the
                    <a href="http://epidoc.sf.net">EpiDoc Community</a>, an international, collaborative effort that provides guidelines and tools for encoding scholarly and educational editions of ancient documents.

                <h3 id="tinctoris"><a href="http://earlymusictheory.org/Tinctoris/">Johannes Tinctoris</a></h3>
                <p>A digital edition of <span class="title">The Theoretical Works of Johannes Tinctoris</span>, created by <a href="https://www.bcu.ac.uk/conservatoire/research/research-staff/ronald-woodley">Ronald
                            Woodley</a>. <a href="tinctoris">The Stoa version</a>, kept here for historical reasons, was superseded in 2014 by a new version on the <a href="http://earlymusictheory.org/">Early Music Theory
                            website</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="metis">Metis</h3>
                <p><span class="title">Metis QTVR</span> was developed by Bruce Hartzler and initally published on the Stoa in 1998, with a major upgrade for performance and function in 2003. <span class="title">Metis</span> provided users with manipulable
                    panoramas for 63 different ancient Greek sites, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_VR">the "QuickTime VR" format</a> introduced by Apple in 1995. Apple discontinued QTVR in the late 2000s, thus rendering inoperative
                    <span class="title">Metis</span> and other web publications that had used the technology. Discussions are underway concerning the feasibility of creating an archival version in another format. Meantime, the structure of the site (but
                    not the movie content) can be reviewed via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190513015842/http://www.stoa.org/metis/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190513015842/http://www.stoa.org/metis/</a>.

                <h3 id="misc">Miscellaneous Texts</h3>
                <p>The Perseus Hopper instance on stoa.org contained a number of scholarly texts in a collection titled, simply, "misc". As the hopper could not be re-installed on the new server in the summer of 2019, these texts are currently not available
                    here; however, work is underway to produce static versions of them. In the meantime, captured versions are available from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine:</p>

                <h3 id="colloquia">Neo-Latin Colloquia</h3>
                <p>The <span class="title"><span lang="la">Colloquia Scholastica</span> (Neo-Latin Collquia)</span> page on the Stoa was created by graduate students and faculty associated with the University of Kentucky's Institute for Latin Studies. It
                    was intended to serve as "a gateway to a variety of materials" they developed "for the renewed study and enjoyment of neo-Latin <span lang="la">colloquia
                            scholastica</span>, texts that date primarily from the 16th century." It was last updated in 2011. Several of the texts produced by this group were encoded in TEI XML and hosted through the Perseus hopper at stoa.org. As the
                    Perseus Hopper cannot be maintained on stoa.org following the 2019 transition to a new server, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tunberg">Terence Tunberg</a> and <a href="https://linguistics.as.uky.edu/users/mrlaue2">Mark Lauersdorf</a>                    are working on a new hosting arrangement. In the meantime, archival versions of these materials may be viewed through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190405153208/http://www.stoa.org/colloquia/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190405153208/http://www.stoa.org/colloquia/</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="olynthus">Olynthus</h3>
                <p>Stoa content related to the ancient city of Olynthus was developed by <a href="https://arthistory.wisc.edu/staff/nicholas-d-cahill/">Nicholas Cahill</a> and collaborators. As of 2002, it was to have included the full text of <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014757935">Cahill's 2002 book <span class="title">Household and city
                                organization at Olynthus</span> (Yale)</a>, as well as a "Database of Houses, Rooms, and Objects" linked to a "Site Plan" GIS. The book content was still functional, via the Stoa copy of the Perseus hopper, as of 2019,
                    but "Coming soon" notices were posted for both the database and GIS, so it seems that this portion of the site was never completed. A static version of the book content will soon be brought forward to the new server. Until the static
                    version is available, interested users can access a copy of the book content via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608124937/http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0003">https://web.archive.org/web/20110608124937/http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0003</a>.

                <p>Since 2007, the <span class="title">Pleiades</span> gazetteer of ancient places has been hosted on its own server at <a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org">https://pleiades.stoa.org/</a>. The Stoa provided incubation space on a development
                    server during the early years of the project's design (2002-2007), as well as a permanent "home" in the form of a subdomain within stoa.org domain.</p>

                <p>At one time, the Stoa site hosted information about a project to transcribe the late anglo-saxon period manuscript known as Pembroke 25 (collection of Cambridge University, Pembroke College). In 2010, this information was transferred off
                    the Stoa. The project, which is co-directed by <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/people/staff/dot-porter">Dot Porter</a> and Paul E. Szarmach, is now headquartered at the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies (University
                    of Pennsylvania):

                <p><span class="title">Pompeian Households: An On-line Companion</span> was published by the Stoa in 2004. These "materials to accompany <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/academics/allison">Penelope M. Allison</a>,
                    <a class="title" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/865248457">Pompeian Households: An Analysis of the
                            Material Culture</span> (Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, Monograph 42, 2004)</a> [include] detailed documentary information on 30 Pompeian houses and their contents, consisting of 865 rooms and more than
                    16,000 artifacts." A static version of the original site will be posted here during summer 2019. In the meantime, the Internet Archive's copy may be browsed starting at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190619221951/http://www.stoa.org/projects/ph/home">https://web.archive.org/web/20190619221951/http://www.stoa.org/projects/ph/home</a>.

                <h3 id="gallery">Stoa Image Gallery</h3>
                <p>Ross Scaife added the <span class="title">Stoa Image Gallery</span> to the Stoa site in 2004 or 2005 using <a href="http://galleryproject.org/">the now-defunct open-source "Gallery" software package</a>. A number of collaborators were
                    given access to make changes and additions to the gallery through its web interface. Most activity on the site seems to have ended in 2006 or 2007; however, some users have continued to make minor changes through 2019. As of July 2019,
                    the gallery hosted 12,639 images in 17 top-level albums. Gallery software could not be migrated to the new server in summer 2019, so the image gallery will be offline until a new hosting strategy can be implemented and the content
                    migrated. In the meantime, <span class="title">Stoa Gallery</span> images can be browsed via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine at
                    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190326121223/http://www.stoa.org/gallery/albums.php?set_albumListPage=1">https://web.archive.org/web/20190326121223/http://www.stoa.org/gallery/albums.php?set_albumListPage=1</a>.

                <p><span class="title">Suda On Line: Byzantine Lexicography</span> began in 1998 and achieved its initial goal in 2013: an open, peer-reviewed English translation of all 31,000+ entries in the 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia known as
                    the <span class="title">Suda</span>. This ground-breaking, collaborative digital project continues today, with the continual update and improvement of the translations and other related research tasks. It is currently hosted on a server
                    operated by the department of Computer Science at the University of Kentucky while a more permanent new home is sought.

                <p>In the late 1990s, <a href="http://mythfolklore.net/">Laura Gibbs</a> curated a page on the Stoa devoted to information about online texts of Suetonius: <a href="http://www.stoa.org/suetonius/">http://www.stoa.org/suetonius/</a>. Updates
                    seem to have stopped around 2000.

                <p>In 1999, the <span class="title">McMaster Column of Trajan Project</span> produced an on-line presentation of the Column of Trajan. At least two copies were put online. One was at McMaster University. It can be accessed at <a href="https://sws.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~trajan/">https://sws.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~trajan/</a>,
                    although some images and pages (notably, the credits page) are now missing. Another copy was put online at the Stoa. The Stoa version is offline as of summer 2019, as the new Stoa server cannot host the database-driven portion of the
                    site; however, the Internet Archive Wayback Machine's copy of the Stoa mirror (which seems to include most or all of the missing pages and images) may still be browsed via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190703121009/http://www.stoa.org/trajan/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190703121009/http://www.stoa.org/trajan/</a>.
                    The original McMaster version is also backed up in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190708192356/https://sws.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~trajan/">https://web.archive.org/web/20190708192356/https://sws.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~trajan/</a>.

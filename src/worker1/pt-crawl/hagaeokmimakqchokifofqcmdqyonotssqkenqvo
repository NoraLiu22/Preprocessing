<H2>Angela's Ashes (1999)</H2>

<P>D: Alan Parker<BR>
S: Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle</P>

<P>Beautifully crafted adaptation of Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir
of an impoverished Irish Catholic childhood in 1930s Limerick which will
please people who find the subject intrinsically interesting, but which
will produce varying levels of hostility and/or boredom in others for its
unrelenting and all-too-familiar obsession with the dark and distant history
of an Ireland long dead. As the opening voice over warns, this is a film
which thrives on misery. It lovingly depicts the ugliest side of old Limerick
in the almost constant rain (also a feature of Neil Jordan's <I><A HREF="ea.htm">The End of the Affair</A></I>, curiously), for the returned emigrant,
mixed religion family; victims of religious prejudice, unemployment, alcoholism,
familial claustrophobia, borderline starvation, and sexual extortion. Yet
there is a paradox here. The events are viewed with the eye of the successful
expatriate (or, in this case, double expatriate), and the film is framed,
rather simplistically, by images of the Statue of Liberty which, despite
some comic irony, ultimately gives the film the kind of redemptive framework
which makes all that has preceded it too easy to dismiss as nostalgia. As
a portrait of poverty, it has many (better) precedents, not least of all
in the Italian neo-realist masterpieces <I>Bicycle Thieves</I> and <I>Umberto
D</I>, and as a portrait of Ireland it has too many precedents to list,
so much so that there may be a large number of people who just don't want
(or need) to see it all again. The Irish release of the film has already
been greeted with a combination of apathy and anger. Prominent Limerick-born
Oscar nominee Richard Harris reacted contemptuously to what he saw as the
defamation of his home by people who ultimately know very little about it.
And after now several years of the McCourt family's seemingly endless round
of publicity tours and spinoffs, some people have begun to wonder how much
of this is a media manufactured wallow in half-invented remembrance.</P>

<P>Such considerations aside, <I>Angela's Ashes</I> is extremely well put
together and confidently directed by Alan Parker. Having turned an expressionistic
eye on Dublin city in his filming of Roddy Doyle's <I>The Commitments</I>,
Parker and cinematographer Michael Seresin have done an excellent job of
rendering the urban landscape of 1930s Limerick in a palette of dark greys,
greens, and browns (assisted by Geoffrey Kirkland's production designs,
Jennifer William's sets, and Consolata Boyle's costumes). Parker and co-writer
Laura Jones have done a great job of extracting from the book scenes which
advance the narrative quickly and with a good balance of humour and darkness
despite its 145 minute running time. The casting by John and Ross Hubbard
and Juliet Taylor is spot on. Though Emily Watson and Robert Caryle are
both good in the adult starring roles, the casting directors have picked
a cast of youngsters to play both Frank McCourt at his various ages (Joseph
and Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, and Michael Legge) and the many other teens
and youngsters featured in the story which give it much of its energy. Editor
Gerry Hambling also keeps things moving along nicely and John Williams adds
an evocative orchestral underscore which while not instantly memorable,
is intrinsic to the mood and tone of the film on the whole. On a technical
level, this is a remarkable achievement.</P>

<P>Yet despite all of this craft, the story elements at the heart of the
film are numbingly familiar, so much so that it is difficult to feel anything
for the characters in spite of the horrors and hardships they undergo. It
is a retread of the clich&eacute;s of The Old Country knocked around since
the silent era, and though at least purportedly based on fact, they are
by now dull rather than quaint, irritating instead of camp, and certainly
not effective in terms of getting the audience involved. Though Emily Watson
(<I><A HREF="box.htm">The Boxer</A></I>, <I><A HREF="haj.htm">Hilary and
Jackie</A></I>) is superbly perturbed as the put-upon mother of the family
and Robert Caryle (<I><A HREF="fm.htm">The Full Monty</A></I>, <I><A HREF="wne.htm">The World is Not Enough</A></I>) gives the one genuinely moving
characterisation in the film, you feel distant from the people on screen
in a way which makes them little more than props in Parker's arsenal of
cinematic representation. They become elements of the physical environment,
used as effectively as the rest is used, only without the kind of empathic,
human content required to make this kind of film work. The rain-drenched
streets, the propaganda in the classrooms, the joys of the local cinema,
the deaths in the family, the parental strife, the nasty matriarch and the
repressed auntie, the flashes of hope, the momentary naughtiness and the
heady rush of hope in the quest to return to America: these are all individually
well handled. But cumulatively there is just too much that we have seen
before (not necessarily all in one film, but this stuff has done the rounds),
and it feels contrived and constructed in a way which ultimately defeats
much of what would seem to be the point of a 'true' story of redemption
and overcoming adversity.</P>

<P>It is also arguable that tales such as this no longer need to be told,
not because Ireland's economy and political character have changed, but
because, on the contrary, tales of poverty and prejudice continue. Perhaps
the emigrant story which currently most needs to be explored by Irish filmmakers
and writers is that of the African and Eastern-European refugees now filling
the streets and facing the beast of Irish racism. Maybe the tales of sexual
misadventure highlighted by McCourt need to be contemporarised by a discussion
of the recent arguments over the rights of women to control their bodies
and their lives, and the revelations of sexual abuse by religious orders
which have inevitably affected the attitudes towards morality. It is possible
that, at the end of the day, <I>Angela's Ashes</I> is no more relevant to
today's Ireland than it is to today's United States. This is a nostalgic
film in the worst sense of the word. Though it deals in misery and poverty,
it makes them distant and picturesque, a memoir by a man whose life now
is evidently far from what it was then. Contemporary audiences can watch
this film and, all too easily, allow themselves the comforts of knowing
that &quot;it's not like that anymore&quot; and &quot;I've come so far since
then&quot; in a way which invites them to ignore the problems which still
affect the lives of people who can't write nostalgic memoirs about it.</P>

<P>This of course does not mean that the film is not well made or worth
seeing. <I>Angela's Ashes</I> is a work of supreme craftsmanship. In general,
there's no particular harm in deconstructing certain received images of
the bucolic splendour of 1930s Ireland, though how much is deconstruction
and how much is a reconstruction of a new set of myths is debatable. Thematically,
the film is consistent and relatively successful in exploring various familiar
chords of Irish life of the time. There are some good individual moments
and the visuals tend to stick with you afterwards. Parker has dignified
material which may well have sunk in lesser hands, and he has made a good
movie out of a book whose audience will doubtless enjoy seeing it done on
the big screen. There are certainly worse films out there (<I><A HREF="wn.htm">Waking
Ned</A></I> , <I><A HREF="neph.htm">The Nephew</A></I>, and <I><A HREF="gits.htm">Gold in the Streets</A></I> leap to mind). There are better ones,
though, with fresher and more original takes on similar situations. It is
ironic that this film's trailer taglines, describing it as &quot;A family's
hardship, a mother's struggle, and one boy's unbreakable spirit,&quot; could
also be used to describe <I><A HREF="bb.htm">The Butcher Boy</A></I>, where
the idea of a child who cannot be repressed became a study of the dark unconscious
of insanity. As to whether or not it is worth seeing, this depends entirely
on your predisposition to McCourt's interpretation of his past. There are
some for whom the evocation of time and place be effective. Others will
see the whole thing as an offence to their own sense of history. It is a
personal reaction, and the best recommendation any critic can give you is
that you make up your own mind after viewing it. It is no masterpiece, it
won't hold up to the standards set by films like <I><A HREF="bb.htm">The
Butcher Boy</A></I> and <A HREF="gen.htm"><I>The General</I>,</A> and it
is unlikely to take a prominent place in the history of Irish cinema, but
it's beautifully done, well acted, and generally coherent, which is perhaps
more than this story deserves in a world whose problems are far beyond those
of the one which it portrays.</P>

This drawing formed the basis for Meucci's caveat of 1871,but, as Meucci's lawyer did not file it with the caveat, it was laternotarized by Meucci himself in his affidavit of 9 October 1885.</P><CENTER><A NAME=corradi></A><IMG SRC="immagini/corradi_drw.gif" ALT="Antonio Meucci 's scheme of telephone conversation, with first anti sidetone and call signaling system" WIDTH=458 HEIGHT=254 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>The drawing shows a two-way, simultaneous, telephone conversation,with a complete separation between the two directions of transmission(indicated by arrows). This contrivance is aimed to counteract theso-called "side-tone" effect, that is, the hearing of the echo of thespeaker's own voice (as well as any background noise) in his ownreceiver. This layout is known today as a "four-wire circuit". Withit, Meucci anticipated any other inventor, as proved by thefollowing:</P><UL>   <LI>No mention of side-tone effects, nor measures to counteract   it, are found in Bell's patents, nor in Gray's caveat, both of   1876. In the first Bell's subscriber lines, the four (initially,   two) instruments were simply put in series on the same line.<BR>   </LI>      <LI>The first anti-sidetone (AST) circuits were introduced by the   Bell people in the 1900s, particularly by George A. Campbell, with   his nine patents of 1918, many decades after Meucci's solution was   shown in this drawing, and over thirty years after the same   drawing was notarized.</LI></UL><P><HR></P><P>Panel<B> D2 -<A NAME=lemmi></A> Inductive loading</B></P><CENTER><IMG SRC="immagini/lemmi_drw.gif" ALT="Antonio Meucci 's sketch of inductive loading for long-distance telephone lines" WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=282 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>The drawing reproduced above is taken from a note jotted down byMeucci in his Laboratory notebook on 27 September 1870, and reportedin an affidavit by M. Lemmi of 28 September 1885, containing theEnglish translation of said notebook (see also <A HREF="antenna.htm">mypaper on "Antenna"</A>).</P><P>It can be seen that diagrams "No. 2" and "No. 3" differ from "No.1" in the insertion midway along the long-distance line of aninductor (with either a horseshoe or bar iron core). In diagram "No.4," the inductor is split into two parts, inserted at both ends ofthe line. In his notes, Meucci pointed out that, in this way, hecould get rid of the battery, and that, by splitting the inductor, heobtained better results.</P><P><A NAME=loading></A>This technique is known today as the"inductive loading" of long distance telephone lines, allowing toincrease the distance and/or the quality of speech. The proof thatMeucci came first, can be drawn from the following events, occurredmany years after Meucci's discovery (or its notarization):</P><UL>   <LI>In June-July, 1887, Oliver Heaviside and Alfred Vaschy   predicted, on the basis of mathematical calculations, that   telephone signals could be transmitted without distortion by   increasing the line's self-induction.<BR>   </LI>      <LI>On 19 June 1900, M. I. Pupin obtained the first two patents   for said technique. The Bell Telephone Co. acquired both patents   and, later on, applied them in its lines.</LI></UL><P><HR></P><P>Panel<B> D3 - <A NAME=skin></A>Means to counteract the skineffect</B> <I>(see drawing below by B. Catania)</I></P><P>Because of the increased bandwidth of the telephone with respectto the telegraph, telephone lines were subjected to increasedattenuation, due to the so-called skin effect.</P><P>In two notes of 1862 in his Laboratory notebook (notarized inLemmi's affidavit of 1885), Meucci suggested to treat the surface ofthe (copper) conductor in various ways (basically with graphite) toincrease its surface conductivity.</P><P>Moreover, in his caveat of 1871, Meucci stated:<FONT COLOR="#660000"><I>&#147;I believe it preferable to have thewire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electrictelegraph.&#148;</I></FONT></P><P>Another note in his notebook, dated 17 August 1870, reads:<FONT COLOR="#660000"><I>&#147;To be adopted, for having longdistance, bundles of copper wire insulated with cotton or any otherkind of wrapper; by this means I have obtained a distance of aboutone mile.&#148;</I></FONT> For this "bundle" of copper wires Meuccifiled a US patent application "Wire for Electrical Purposes" on 2July 1880.</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="immagini/skin_effect.gif" ALT="Telephone line structures suggested by Antonio Meucci" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=175 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>That Meucci was first in said techniques, is proven by thefollowing facts:</P><UL>   <LI>Skin effect in telephone lines was neglected by all inventors   till 1880, when it began to be investigated by David E. Hughes and   Oliver Heaviside.<BR>   </LI>      <LI>Following their studies and the development of "hard drawn"   copper, the Bell Telephone Co. decided to use copper in place of   steel, beginning from the Boston-New York line, which was   inaugurated on 27 March 1884.</LI></UL><P><HR></P><P><B>Panel D4 - Call signaling</B></P><P>In his scheme of 1858 (<A HREF="#corradi">see drawing of PanelD1</A>), Meucci adopted a telegraphic call signaling, simply effectedby a Morse key, attached to each end of the line, momentarilyshort-circuiting the local transmitter. In this way, strong pulses ofcurrent were sent along the line, and the distant receiver would emitintermittent ticks, much louder than the ordinary speech. In hiscaveat of 1871, Meucci gave a detailed description of his callsignaling, consistent with this scheme.</P><P>For what concerns the call signaling in the Bell system, we mayfirst remark that no mention of it is found in the first Bell patentnor in Gray's caveat of 1876. Only a vague mention of a (not betterspecified) "call bell" is found in Bell's second patent of 1877. Forseveral months after commercial telephone service was started, in1877, the Bell subscribers resorted to either thumping the diaphragmor shouting into it, to call the other party. Less rudimentary callsignaling was adopted in the years to follow, but Meucci must becredited for having identified the problem and offered an ingeniousand inexpensive solution to it, many years before the Bell Co.</P><P><HR></P><P><B>Panel D5 - <A NAME=quietness></A>Quietness of theenvironment</B></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0>   <TR>      <TD HEIGHT=438>         <CENTER><IMG SRC="immagini/french_booth.gif" ALT="French telephone both of 1884, to ensure quietness of environment" WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=419 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=middle><BR>         <BR>         <FONT COLOR="#660000">French telephone booth of         1884</FONT></CENTER>      </TD>      <TD HEIGHT=438>         <P>With early (electromagnetic) transmitters, received         speech signals were quite feeble and noisy, therefore,         quietness of environment was of paramount importance,         especially for long-distance links.

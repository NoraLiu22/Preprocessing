<P> <FONT CLASS="ref">[21.1]</FONT> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte20.html#1"> L</A>&nbsp; When Dionysius the tyrant was cut off in Sicily, the army elected in his room Dionysius the eldest of his sons, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> both in accordance with the law of nature, and because they thought the power would be more secure, if it continued in the hands of one son, than if it were divided among several. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Dionysius, at the commencement of his reign, was eager to remove the uncles of his brothers, as being his rivals in the government, and as having encouraged the young men to ask for a division of power. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> But concealing his inclinations for a while, he applied himself first to gain the favour of his subjects, as being likely to cause the atrocity, which he had resolved on committing, to be regarded with more indulgence, if he previously made himself popular. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He therefore released three thousand prisoners from the gaols, remitted the people the taxes for three years, and sought the affection of all by whatever blandishments he could use. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Then, proceeding to execute his determination, he put to death, not only the relatives of his brothers, but his brothers themselves; <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> so that he left to those, to whom he owed a share of power, not even a share of life, and commenced cruelty upon his kindred before he exercised it upon strangers. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="21.2">[21.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte21.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp; When his rivals were removed, he fell into indolence, and contracted, from excessive indulgence at table, great corpulence of body, and a disease in his eyes, so that he could not bear the sunshine, or dust, or even the brightness of ordinary daylight. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Suspecting that, for these weaknesses, he was despised by his subjects, he proceeded to inflict cruelties upon them; not filling the gaols, like his father, with prisoners, but the whole city with dead bodies. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Hence he became an object of hatred, rather than contempt, to everyone. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> When the Syracusans, in consequence, resolved to rebel against him, he long hesitated whether he should lay down the government or oppose them in arms; <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> but he was compelled by the soldiery, who hoped for plunder from sacking the city, to march into the field. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Being defeated, and trying his fortune again with no better success, he sent deputies to the people of Syracuse, with promises that "he would resign the government, if they would send persons to him with whom he might settle terms of peace." <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Some of the principal citizens being accordingly sent for that purpose, he put them in close confinement, and then, when all were off their guard, having no fear of hostilities, he despatched his army to devastate the city. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> A contest, in consequence, which was long doubtful, took place in the town itself, but the townsmen overpowering the soldiery by their numbers, Dionysius was obliged to retire, and fearing that he should be besieged in the citadel, fled away secretly, with all his royal paraphernalia, to Italy. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Being received, in his exile, by his allies the Locrians, he took possession of the citadel as if he were their rightful sovereign, and exercised his usual outrages upon them. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> He ordered the wives of the principal men to be seized and violated; he took away maidens on the point of marriage, polluted them, and then restored them to their betrothed husbands; and as for the wealthiest men, he either banished them or put them to death, and confiscated their property. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="21.3">[21.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte21.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp; In process of time, when a pretext for plunder was wanting, he conquered the whole city by an artful stratagem. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> The Locrians, being harassed in war by Leophron the tyrant of Rhegium, had vowed, if they were victorious, to prostitute their maidens on the festal day of Venus; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> and as, on neglecting to perform the vow, they were unsuccessful in another war with the Lucanians, Dionysius called them to an assembly, and advised them "to send their wives and daughters, as richly dressed as possible, to the temple of Venus; <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> out of whom a hundred, chosen by lot, should fulfil the public vow, and, for religion's sake, offer themselves for prostitution during the space of a month, the men previously taking an oath not to touch any one of them; <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> and, in order that this should be no detriment to the women who released the state from its vow, they should make a decree, that no other maiden should be married till these were provided with husbands." <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> This proposal, by which regard was shown both to their superstitious observances and to the honour of their virgins, being received with approbation, the whole of the women, in most expensive dresses, assembled in the temple of Venus, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> when Dionysius, sending in his soldiers, took off their finery, and made the ornaments of the matrons a spoil for himself. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> The husbands of some of them too, who were of the richer class, he put to death; others he tortured to make them reveal their husbands' wealth. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> After reigning in this manner for six years, he was driven from Locri by a conspiracy of the people, and returned to Sicily; <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> where, while all, after so long an interval of peace, were free from apprehension, he possessed himself of Syracuse by surprise. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="21.4">[21.4]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte21.html#4"> L</A>&nbsp; While this affair occurred in Sicily, Hanno, a leading man among the Carthaginians, in Africa, employed his power, which surpassed that of the government, to secure the sovereignty for himself, and endeavoured to establish himself as king by killing the senate. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> For the execution of this atrocity he fixed on the day of his daughter's marriage, in order that his nefarious plot might be the better concealed in the pomp of religious ceremonies. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> He accordingly prepared a banquet for the common people in the public porticoes, and another for the senate in his own house, so that, by poisoning the cups, he might take off the senate privately and without witnesses, and then more easily seize the government, when none were left to prevent him. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> The plot being disclosed to the magistrates by his agents, his destructive intentions were frustrated, but not punished, lest the matter, if publicly known, should occasion more trouble, in the case of so powerful a man, than the mere design of it had caused. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Satisfied, therefore, with putting a stop to it, they merely set bounds by a decree to the expenses of marriage entertainments, and ordered the decree to be obeyed, not by him alone, but universally, that nothing personal to him, but the general correction of an abuse, might seem to be intended. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Prevented by this measure, he, for a second attempt, raised the slaves, and appointing another day for the massacre of the senate, but finding himself again betrayed, he threw himself, for fear of being brought to trial, into a strong fortress with a body of twenty thousand armed slaves. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Here, while he was soliciting the Africans, and the king of the Moors, to join him, he was captured, and after being scourged, having his eyes put out, and his arms and legs broken, as if atonement was to be exacted from every limb, he was put to death in the sight of the people, and his body, mangled with stripes, was nailed to a cross. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> All his children and relations, too, though guiltless, were delivered to the executioner, that no member of so nefarious a family might survive either to imitate his villainy, or to revenge his death. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="21.5">[21.5]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte21.html#5"> L</A>&nbsp; Dionysius, in the meantime, being re-established in Syracuse, and becoming every day more oppressive and cruel to the people, was assailed by a new band of conspirators. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Laying down the government, therefore, he delivered up the city and army to the Syracusans, and, being allowed to take his private property with him, went to live in exile at Corinth; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> where, looking on the lowest station as the safest, he humbled himself to the very meanest condition of life. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> He was not content with strolling about the streets, but would even stand drinking in them; he was not satisfied with being seen in taverns and impure houses, but would sit in them for whole days. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He would dispute with the most abandoned fellows about the merest trifles, walk about in rags and dirt, and afford laughter to others more readily than he would laugh at them. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> He would stand in the market, devouring with his eyes what he was not able to purchase; he would wrangle with the dealers before the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedile">aediles</A>, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> and do everything in such a manner as to appear an object of contempt rather than of fear. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> At last he assumed the profession of a schoolmaster, and taught children in the open streets, either that he might continually be seen in public by those who feared him, or might be more readily despised by those who did not fear him; <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> for though he had still plenty of the vices peculiar to tyrants, yet his present conduct was an affectation of vices, and not the effect of nature, and he adopted it rather from cunning than from having lost the self-respect becoming a sovereign, having experienced how odious the names of tyrants are, even when they are deprived of power. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> He strove, therefore, to diminish the odium incurred from his past by the contemptibleness of his present life, not looking to honourable but to safe practices. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Yet amidst all these arts of dissimulation, he was accused of aspiring to the sovereignty, and was left at liberty only because he was despised. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="21.6">[21.6]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte21.html#6"> L</A>&nbsp; During these proceedings, the Carthaginians, alarmed at the rapid successes of Alexander the Great, and fearing that he might resolve to annex Africa to his Persian empire, sent Hamilcar, surnamed Rhodanus, a man remarkable for wit and eloquence beyond others, to sound his intentions; <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> for, indeed, the capture of Tyre, their own parent city, <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> and the founding of Alexandria, as a rival to Carthage, on the confines of Africa and Egypt, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> as well as the good fortune of the king, whose ambition and success seemed to know no limit, raised their apprehensions to an extreme height. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Hamilcar, obtaining access to the king through the favour of Parmenion, represented himself to Alexander as having been banished from his country, and as having fled to him for refuge, offering, at the same time, to serve as a soldier in the expedition against Carthage. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Having thus ascertained his views, he sent a full account of them to his countrymen, inscribed on wooden tablets, with blank wax spread over the writing. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> The Carthaginians, however, when he returned home after the death of Alexander, put him to death, not only ungratefully but cruelly, on pretence that he had offered to sell their city to the king.

<P> 	 <A CLASS="ref" NAME="22.2">[22.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte22.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> By the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/morgantina.html#1">Murgantines</A>, with whom he took refuge in his banishment, he was first, from hatred to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracusans</A>, made praetor, and afterwards general-in-chief:  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> in the war which he conducted for them, he both took the city of the  <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leontini.html#1">Leontines</A>, and proceeded to besiege his native city, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracuse</A>:  <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hamilcar.html#2">Hamilcar</A>, general of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/carthage.html#1">Carthaginians</A>, being entreated to aid it, laid aside his hatred as an enemy, and sent a body of troops thither.  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Thus, at one and the same time, Syracuse was both defended by an enemy with the love of a citizen, and attacked by a citizen with the hatred of an enemy.  <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/agathocles.html#1">Agathocles</A>, seeing that the city was defended with more vigour than it was assailed, entreated Hamilcar, through his deputies, to undertake the settlement of a peace between him and the Syracusans, promising him particular services in return for the favour.  <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Hamilcar, induced by such hopes, and by dread of his power, made an alliance with him, on condition that whatever assistance he furnished Agathocles against the Syracusans, he himself should receive as much for the augmentation of his power at home.  <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Not only peace, in consequence, was procured for Agathocles, but he was also appointed praetor at Syracuse;  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> and he then swore to Hamilcar that he would be faithful to the Carthaginians, the [sacred] fires, at the same time, being set forth, and touched by him.  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Some time after, having received from Hamilcar five thousand <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/africa.html#1">African</A> troops, he put to death the most powerful of the leading citizens;  <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> and then, as if intending to re-model the constitution, he ordered the people to be summoned to an assembly in the theatre, convoking the senate, in the meantime, in the Gymnasium, as though he designed to make some previous arrangements with them.  <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> His measures being thus taken, he sent his troops to surround the people, and caused the senate to be massacred,  <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> and, when he had finished the slaughter of them, cut off the richest and boldest of the commoners.
<P>  <A CLASS="ref" NAME="22.3">[22.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte22.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> These things being done, he made choice of troops, and embodied a regular army; with which, he suddenly attacked several of the neighbouring cities when they were under no apprehension of hostilities.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> He also disgracefully harassed, with the connivance of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hamilcar.html#2">Hamilcar</A>, certain allies of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/carthage.html#1">Carthaginians</A>, who, in consequence, sent complaints to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/carthage.html#1">Carthage</A>, not so much against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/agathocles.html#1">Agathocles</A> as against Hamilcar,  <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> accusing " the former, indeed, as an oppressor and tyrant, but the latter as a traitor, by whom the possessions of their allies, under a settled compact, were betrayed to the bitterest of enemies;  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> for as, at first, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracuse</A> (a city always hostile to the Carthaginians, and a competitor with Carthage for the dominion of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sicily.html#1">Sicily</A>) was delivered to Agathocles as a bond of union with Hamilcar, so, at the present time, the cities of the allies of Carthage were given up to the same tyrant under pretence of making peace.  <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> They warned them, therefore, that these proceedings would shortly come home to themselves, and that they would feel what mischief they had brought, not more upon Sicily than upon <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/africa.html#1">Africa</A> itself."  <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> At these complaints the senate was incensed against Hamilcar, but as he was in command of the army, they gave their votes concerning him secretly, and caused their several opinions, before they were openly read, to be put in an urn, and sealed up, until the other <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hamilcar.html#3">Hamilcar</A>, the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gisco.html#1">Gisco</A>, should return from Sicily.  <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> But the death of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hamilcar.html#2">Hamilcar</A> prevented all effects from these subtle contrivances and suppressed judgments, and he, whom his fellow citizens had unjustly condemned unheard, was freed from danger of punishment by the kindness of destiny.  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> The proceeding furnished Agathocles with a pretext for making war on the Carthaginians.  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> His first engagement was with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hamilcar.html#3">Hamilcar</A>, the son of Gisco, by whom he was defeated, and retired to Syracuse to prepare himself for war with fresh vigour.  <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> But the result of his second encounter was the same as that of the first.
<P>  <A CLASS="ref" NAME="22.4">[22.4]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte22.html#4"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> The victorious <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/carthage.html#1">Carthaginians</A>, in consequence, having invested <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracuse</A> with a close siege, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/agathocles.html#1">Agathocles</A>, perceiving that he was neither a match for them in the field, nor provided for enduring a blockade, and being deserted, moreover, by his allies, who were disgusted at his cruelties, resolved to transfer the war into <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/africa.html#1">Africa</A>;  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> a resolution formed with wonderful audacity, that he should make war on the city of a people for whom he was not a match in his own city; that he who could not defend his own country should invade that of others; and that one who had been conquered should brave his conquerors.  <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Nor was the secrecy of his plan less striking than the contrivance of it. Stating merely to the people, that " he had found out a way to victory, and that they had only to prepare their minds to endure a short siege, or that, if any of them were dissatisfied with their present circumstances, he gave them full liberty to depart,"  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> he proceeded, after one thousand six hundred had left him, to furnish the rest with provisions and money for the necessities of a blockade, taking away with him only fifty talents for present use, and intending to get further supplies rather from his enemies than his friends.  <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He then obliged all the slaves that were of age for war, after receiving their freedom, to take the military oath, and put them and the greater part of the soldiers, on ship-board, supposing that, as the condition of both was made equal, there would be a mutual emulation in bravery between them.

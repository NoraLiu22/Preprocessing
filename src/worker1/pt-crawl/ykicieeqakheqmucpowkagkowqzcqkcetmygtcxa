The original cause of all the revolutions was the tribunicial power, which, under the pretence of protecting the common people, for whose aid it was originally established, but in reality aiming at domination for itself, courted popular support and favour by legislation for the distribution of lands and corn<A CLASS="comment"

All these measures had some appearance of justice. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.2">2</A> For what could be fairer than that the commons should receive from the senate what was really their own, so that a people, who had been victorious over the nations and possessed the whole world, might not live banished from their own altars and hearths? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.3">3</A> What could be juster than that a people in want should be maintained from its own treasury? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.4">4</A> What could better conduce to secure equal liberty for all than that, while the senate controlled the provinces, the authority of the equestrian order should rest at least on the possession of judicial power? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.5">5</A> Yet these very measures resulted in the ruin of Rome, and the wretched State became, to its own destruction, an object of bargaining. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.6">6</A> For the transference of the judicial power from the senate to the equestrian order reduced the revenues, the ancestral wealth of the

The first flame of contention was kindled by Tiberius Gracchus, whose descent, personal attractions and eloquence made him undoubtedly the leading man of his time. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.2">2</A> Either because he was afraid of being involved in Mancinus' surrender&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="

Immediately after this Gaius Gracchus was fired with an equal zeal to avenge his brother's murder and to champion his proposals. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.2">2</A> By similar methods of disturbance and terrorism he incited the commons to seize the lands of their forefathers, and promised that the inheritance recently received from Attalus should be used to feed the people, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.3">3</A> and becoming headstrong and tyrannical on the strength of his second election to the tribunate, he was pursuing a successful course with the support of the common people. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.4">4</A> When, however, the tribune Minucius ventured to obstruct the passage of his proposals, relying on the help of his supporters he


<A ID="p227"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p227 </SPAN></A>seized the Capitol which had already proved so fatal to his family. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="15.5">5</A> Being driven thence, after the loss of his adherents, he betook himself to the Aventine, where, being assailed by a body of senators, he was put to death by the consul Opimius.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="

Apuleius Saturninus continued nevertheless to promote the Gracchan proposals; so great was the encouragement given him by Marius, always a bitter opponent of the nobility and relying, moreover, on his position as consul. Aulus Ninnius,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="

There was one, however, who preferred exile, namely, Metellus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.3">3</A> After his departure, when all the nobility were thoroughly cowed, Apuleius, now in the third year of his tyranny, became so utterly reckless that he even disturbed the consular elections&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="

<A ID="p229"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p229 </SPAN></A>insane policy, he ordered the murder of his opponent Gaius Memmius, and in the confusion which followed, heard himself with pleasure hailed as king by his followers. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.5">5</A> Then at last the senators leagued themselves against him, and Marius himself, now consul, finding that he could no longer protect him, turned against him, and the two parties faced one another under arms in the forum. Driven from the forum Apuleius seized the Capitol. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="16.6">6</A> When he was besieged there and the water-supply had been cut off, he made the senate believe, through his representatives, that he repented of what he had done, and coming down from the citadel with the chief men of his party was received in the senate house. Here the people, bursting their way in, overwhelmed him with sticks and stones and tore him to pieces at the very moment of his death.

Lastly, Livius Drusus, relying not only upon the powers of the tribunate but also upon the authority of the senate itself and the general agreement of all Italy, tried to carry out the same proposals, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.2">2</A> and by courting one party after another, kindled so violent a combustion that he could not withstand even its first outbreak, and carried off by sudden death, left the struggle as an inheritance to his successors. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.3">3</A> The Gracchi by their judiciary law had created a cleavage in the Roman people and had destroyed the unity of the State by giving it two heads. The Roman knights, relying on the extraordinary powers,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="

First of all Caepio, attacking the senate, singled out Scaurus and Philippus, the chief men of the nobility, and prosecuted them for bribery. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.6">6</A> In order to counteract this move, Drusus rallied the commons to his support by the bait of the Gracchan laws, and used the same means to rally the allies to the support of the commons by the hope of receiving the <SPAN CLASS="whole">citizen</SPAN>&shy;ship. A saying of his has survived, that "he had left nothing for anyone else to distribute, unless he wished to share out the mire or the air."&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="

Thereupon the allies immediately demanded the price of their support; but death carried off Drusus, who was unequal to the occasion and weary of the disturbance which he


<A ID="p233"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p233 </SPAN></A>had rashly aroused — a death opportune at such a crisis. But for all that the allies did not cease to demand from the Roman people by force of arms the privileges promised by Drusus.

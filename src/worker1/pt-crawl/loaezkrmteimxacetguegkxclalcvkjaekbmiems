contributing editor: he began contributing to the website in 2001 when he spent a month in  Singapore as a Visiting Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore.</p> 

<p>Born in Leeds in 1947, Philip emigrated with his family to Vancouver, 
British Columbia, Canada, and took his BA in 
Honours English (minors in Classical Studies and Theatre) at the University of British Columbia. Subsequently he entered the teacher
education program at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), University of 
Toronto, and taught at secondary schools in Etobicoke, Ontario, and Victoria, British
Columbia. With Master's degrees in Educational Administration and English from the 
University of Victoria, he applied to the doctoral program in English at U. B. C. in  1981. While working on his dissertation, he taught in the North Vancouver and Greater Victoria School Districts, notably at Balmoral Jr. Secondary in 
North Vancouver and at Mt. View, Esquimalt, and Oak Bay Secondary Schools in Victoria.</p>

<p>After receiving his doctorate for a thesis entitled <span class="book">The 
Dramatic Adaptations of "The Christmas Books" of Charles Dickens, 1844-1848: Texts and 
Contexts</span>, Philip moved on to a career in scholarly 
research, publication, and higher education in English and Education.  While working in the Examinations Branch of the B. C. Ministry of Education from 1988 to 1991, he taught survey courses in the novel, the Victorian novel, short fiction, and eight major British authors for the English Department at U. B. C.  While taking up various teaching positions, both there and, for example, at the College of the Rockies, Golden Campus, and also serving as an executive of the local teachers' union and of the British 
Columbia Teachers of English Language Arts (BCTELA), he published more than 
two dozen scholarly articles on Dickens and Hardy. These focussed on serial publication and 
illustration. They appeared in such journals as <span class="book">The Dickensian</span>, 
<span class="book">The Dickens Quarterly</span>, <span class="book">The Thomas Hardy 
Journal</span>, <span class="book">The Thomas Hardy YearBook</span>, and <span 
class="book">Nineteenth-Century Literature</span>. He also contributed to teacher guides for the  Global Shakespeare Series (ITP Nelson) editions of <span class="play">Julius  Caesar</span> and <span class="play">King Lear</span>.</p>

<p>In 2000, Philip was appointed as an 
assistant professor, Intermediate/Senior English Curriculum and Instruction, in the Faculty of 
Education at Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ontario, where he remained until retiring as an Emeritus Professor in 2016. Over the course of his tenure at Lakehead University he presented 
conference papers at the Canadian Society for Studies in Education at Laval, Quebec; the 
Society for Teaching and Learning at St. John's, Newfoundland; and the Dickens Society of 
America conferences at Roanoke, Virginia; Oakland University, Michigan; Springfield, 
Massachusetts; Queen's University, Belfast; Kingston-on-Thames; Aix-en-Provence; Dickens 
in Italy (Genoa); University of the Paris-Diderot, in the Dickens 2012 week-long series 
of lectures; St. Anselm’s College, Manchester, New Hampshire; Victoria College, 
University of Toronto; and Olstyn, Poland. In December 2001, he worked with Professor 
George Landow in the University Scholars Programme at the National University of 
Singapore in the capacity of Senior Fellow. There followed such important publications as 
"The Illustrations in <span class="book">The Haunted Man and The Ghost's Bargain</span>: 
Public and Private Spaces and Spheres" in the <span class="book">Dickens Studies 
Annual</span> (Vol. 36), "Dickens's <span class="book">A Tale of Two Cities</span> 
Illustrated: A Critical Reassessment of Hablot Knight Browne's Plates" (<span 
class="book">Dickens Studies Annual</span>, Vol. 33), and "Shadows in <span 
class="book">GreatExpectations</span>" in <span class="book">English Language 
Notes</span> 41, 3 (March 2004). On 19 December 2004 he was interviewed by Mary Hynes, the regular host of <span 
class="play">Tapestry</span>, on Canadian national radio (CBC), when he  discussed the origins of <span class="book">A 
Christmas Carol</span>.</p>

<p>Subsequently, he delivered conference papers at Lublin, Poland, and Beziers, France, 
on illustrations in <span class="book">Great Expectations</span>, 1860-1910, and on "The 
Sons of Empire" in Dickens's <span class="book">Christmas Stories</span> — this latter was published in fuller form as "Seasonal Tales, Far-flung Settings: 
The Unfamiliar Landscapes of The Christmas Books and Stories (1843–1867)" in <span 
class="book">Milli mála - Journal of Language and Culture</span>, University of 
Reykjavík, Iceland. He also delivered a plenary paper on the tensions between text and 
image in <span class="book">Oliver Twist</span> at the Polish Association for Studies in 
English (PASE) conference in Warsaw in September 2015. Philip has 
also been a consultant to <span class="book">English in Australia</span>, and, with the 
assistance of George Gorniak, Editor of <span class="book">The Dickens Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>After retirement, Philip and his wife moved to Victoria, British Columbia, on 
Vancouver Island. In the past several years, he has developed an online course on the 
eighteenth novel for Thompson Rivers University, taught "Chaucer to Milton" (English 2111) and "Shakespeare on Film" (English 3651) online for the same university, and has also taught English to foreign students for the 
Vancouver Public Education Alliance (VPEA) and Ouyang International, as well as giving an 
education course for Vancouver Island University.</p>

<p>Philip is a keen participant in local theatrical productions. For example, in August 2022 he appeared as Philario 
in the Cowichan Valley Players' production of Shakespeare's <span 
class="book">Cymbeline</span>; more recently, in the spring of 2024, he appeared as the King's Officer in Moliere's <span class="play">Tartuffe</span> with the Mercury Players in Duncan — as seen on the left here. Although technically retired, he is 
constantly looking for further adventures in literature. The next adventure awaits!</p>

         <p>The PubReader format was added to PMC in 2012 to make it easier to read full text articles on tablet, mobile, and other small screen devices.</p>
         <p><a href="#2022-03-22">In March 2022</a>, NCBI launched an updated PMC website. The updated website is mobile responsive, making it easy to read articles in PMC on any device. This makes some legacy  features, such as the PubReader view, no longer necessary.</p>
         <p>In January 2024, we will remove the PubReader links from the PMC website. You will temporarily still be able to access the PubReader format by appending "?report=reader" to any PMC article URL (e.g., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9825438/?report=reader">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9825438/?report=reader</a>).</p>
         <p>In May 2024, we will fully remove the PubReader functionality from the PMC website. Any link to the PubReader format will redirect to the standard, mobile responsive, PMC article view. For content in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books">Bookshelf</a>, PubReader view will continue to be available for the majority of titles, specifically those with unrestricted navigation. PubReader view is accessed from the Views menu on the right.</p>

                <h2>Update on Access to Coronavirus-related Articles in PubMed Central (PMC) COVID-19 Collection after end of Public Health Emergency </h2>
                
        <p>Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) <a href="https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/sites/default/files/COVID19%20Open%20Access%20Letter%20from%20CSAs.Equivalents_0.pdf">collaborated with publishers and scholarly societies</a> to expand access to coronavirus-related journal articles in PubMed Central (PMC). Through this collaboration, more than 50 publishers made more than 350,000 coronavirus-related articles accessible under various license terms through the <a href="../covid-19/">PMC COVID-19 Collection</a> (previously the PMC COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Initiative).</p>
<p>As COVID-19 emergency declarations expired in the United States and around the globe, so too did article-level license terms for use of some of these articles. Most of the articles deposited in the PMC COVID-19 Collection will remain available in PMC, and all citations will remain searchable in PubMed and available for bulk distribution and reuse through the PMC Open Access Subset. However, some publishers retained the right to remove their content and have requested to do so. </p>
<p>Details on changes to the licensing status or availability of content can be found in the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ja23/ja23_pmc_covid_collection.html">NLM Technical Bulletin</a>. More information, including a list of publishers and their licensing statuses, is available in the <a href="../covid-19-faq/">PMC COVID-19 Collection FAQs</a> and on the <a href="../covid-19/">PMC COVID-19 Collection webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of the second phase of the NIH Preprint Pilot with the addition of more than 700 new preprint records to PubMed Central (PMC) and PubMed. This second phase expands the scope of the Pilot to include preprints resulting from all NIH-funded research. Eligible preprints are those acknowledging direct support of an NIH award or authored by NIH staff and posted to bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, or Research Square, on or after January 1, 2023. NLM will automatically include the full text of the preprint (as license terms allow) and associated citation information in PMC and PubMed, respectively. New preprint records will be added on a weekly basis. Phase 2 of the pilot is expected to run through 2023. A project of NLM, the NIH Preprint Pilot was launched in 2020 to explore new approaches to increase the discoverability of NIH-supported research results, with the first phase focusing on NIH-supported research on COVID-19 and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

  <p>On August 4, 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) announced a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/04/a-call-for-public-access-to-monkeypox-related-research-and-data/">coordinated call to action</a> with the science and technology leaders of more than 20 countries, requesting that publishers voluntarily make mpox and other orthopox-related publications freely and immediately accessible in appropriate public repositories to support the ongoing public health emergency response efforts. The call specified that these articles be made available with broad reuse rights in both human- and machine-readable formats to allow access to full text content and metadata.</p>
  
<p>Publishers have responded to the call by volunteering to make their relevant articles accessible in PMC in formats and under license terms that facilitate text mining and secondary analysis. PMC-participating publishers can email PMC at <a href="mailto:pmc-phe@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">pmc-phe@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a> to notify us of their interest in collaborating on this effort.</p>

                <h2>Public Access in PMC Update</h2>
                
  <p>In 2021, PubMed Central (PMC) continued to grow and evolve in its role as a repository for research support by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partner funding agencies. Around 1.3 million articles have been made publicly accessible in PMC under the NIH Public Access Policy; and the volume of NIH-supported articles added to PMC with associated data content continues to increase annually (59% of articles in 2020 included supplementary material and/or a data availability statement vs. 27% in 2009). Other recent activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release of a <a href="https://youtu.be/UwIrhRTj8-M">new training video</a> that walks users through the NIH Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) system deposit workflow, as well as <a href="https://www.nihms.nih.gov/help/tutorials/">updated tutorials</a>.</li>
<li>Modifications to the NIHMS system to support new funder requirements (e.g., see the <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/hhmi-announces-open-access-publishing-policy">updated Howard Hughes Medical Institute Open Access Policy</a> that took effect January 1, 2022; a <a href="https://www.nihms.nih.gov/help/tutorials/">supplemental tutorial</a> is also now available for HHMI submitters).</li>
<li>Expansion of the <a href="https://www.healthra.org/hra-platforms/hra-open/">Health Research Alliance (HRA) Open</a> program to support the open access policies of The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration and IRIDIAN GENOMES.</li>
<li>New submissions to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/funder/nasa/">NASA PubSpace</a> have moved from the NIHMS system to the NASA Science and Technology Information Program. Further information is available on the <a href="https://sti.nasa.gov/submit-to-pubspace/">NASA STI Program website</a>.</li>
<li>Release of the <a href="../public-access/#funderlist">PMC Funder Deposit List</a> to help publishers, funders, and institutions identify the funded content that can be deposited in PMC and clarify the available submission routes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last year, PMC has also continued to <a href="../nihpreprints/">pilot the curation and ingest of NIH-support preprints reporting COVID-19 research</a>. There are now over 3,000 preprint records discoverable in PMC, accelerating and expanding discovery of NIH research.</p>

                <h2>New Directories and File Packages for Bulk Retrieval of the PMC Article Datasets</h2>
                
  <h3>[Story Updated April 1, 2022]</h3>

<p>PubMed Central (PMC) has made significant improvements to the bulk retrieval of two of the <a href="../../tools/textmining/">PMC Article Datasets</a> from our <a href="../../tools/ftp/">FTP service</a>. The improvements were made to bulk packages which include metadata and full text of articles in XML or plain text formats for the <a href="../../tools/openftlist/">PMC Open Access (OA) Subset</a> and the <a href="../authorms/#dataset">Author Manuscript Dataset</a>, which combined encompass more than half of the 7 million articles in PMC. To improve the usability of these two datasets, PMC has redesigned the bulk download directory structure and file packages on our FTP service. The new structure includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>baseline packages that contain all articles available in PMC as of the baseline date for each respective dataset or grouping; and</li>
  <li>daily incremental packages for each respective dataset or grouping that only contain articles that are new to the dataset or that have been updated since the baseline or previous incremental file was created.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The PMC Open Access Subset bulk packages have been divided into three groups based on available license terms:</p> 

  <ul>
    <li><b>Commercial Use Allowed</b> - CC0, CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-ND licenses;</li>
    <li><b>Non-Commercial Use Only</b> - CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-NC-ND licenses; and </li>
    <li><b>Other</b> - no machine-readable Creative Commons license, no license, or a custom license.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>The baseline packages for each of these PMC Open Access Subset usage groups and for the Author Manuscript Dataset have been further divided by PMCID range (e.g., a package with PMC004XXXXXX in its name means that any appropriate articles with PMCIDs falling between PMC4000000 and PMC4999999 are included in the package).</p>

<p><b>The previous bulk download directories and packages were moved to a new temporary location in December 2021 and were deleted on April 1, 2022</b>. This change does NOT impact the individual PMC Open Access Subset article directories and packages on the PMC FTP service, those will remain unchanged. Please also note that the datasets discussed in this update are also now available for <a href="../../tools/pmcaws/">retrieval and computing in the cloud</a>. </p>

<p>See the <a href="../../tools/ftp/">PMC FTP Service</a> page for more details. Please send your feedback and share more about how you are using the PMC Article Datasets to <a href="mailto:pubmedcentral@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">pubmedcentral@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>.</p>

                <h2>NIH Preprint Pilot Launched</h2>
                
    <p>On June 9, 2020, NLM launched the NIH Preprint Pilot. During the pilot, NLM will make preprints resulting from research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) available via PubMed Central (PMC) and, by extension, PubMed. The pilot aims to explore approaches to increasing the discoverability of early NIH research results. The pilot will run for a minimum of 12 months. Lessons learned during that time will inform future NLM efforts with preprints.</p>
        
           <p>To learn more about the pilot, see:</p>

                <h2>PMC Collaborating with Publishers in Response to COVID-19 Public Health Emergency</h2>
                
    <p>On March 13, 2020, the National Science and Technology Advisors from a dozen countries, including the United States, called on publishers to voluntarily agree to make their COVID-19 and coronavirus-related publications and associated data immediately accessible in PubMed Central (PMC) and other appropriate public repositories to support the ongoing public health emergency response efforts.</p>

           <p>For more information on which publishers have responded to this call and how to discover COVID-19 and coronavirus-related publications in PMC, see the main <a href="../about/covid-19">COVID-19 Initiative page</a>.</p>

    <p>Peer review documents, including review reports and editor decision letters, are increasingly being published along with the articles they review. This practice is intended to make the publishing process more transparent. To support these efforts,  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/dobs.html#dob-peerreviewdocs">PMC's Tagging Guidelines</a> have been updated to include the tagging of peer review documents.

                <h2>Unique Identifiers for Supplemental Material</h2>
                
      <p>PMC has updated the Associated Data box to display unique identifiers assigned to
        supplemental material files by the publisher when available (e.g., DOI; see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351104/">PMC6351104</a>). In cases
        where the publisher has not assigned a unique ID to a supplemental file, NLM will generate
        and display a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID; see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351564/">PMC6351564</a>). This update
        aims to support the reporting of datasets as well as the citation and discovery of this

      <p>On March 18, 2019, PMC will no longer provide bulk packages of Open Access (OA) Subset text
        and XML at the top level directory of the FTP Service. These files were superseded in August
        2016 by the Commercial Use and Non-Commercial Use bulk packages located in the oa_bulk
        subdirectory. One set comprises articles that may be used for commercial purposes (the
        Commercial Use Collection); the other contains articles that can be used only for
        non-commercial purposes. Anyone planning to use OA subset content for non-commercial
        purposes will need to download both "non_comm_use.*.tar.gz" and "comm_use.*.tar.gz" to
        access the complete collection. See the <a href="../../tools/openftlist.html">Open Access

                <h2>Discovering Associated Data in PMC</h2>
                
      <p>In the NLM Strategic Plan released earlier this year, we noted that "[c]reating efficient
        ways to link the literature with associated datasets enables knowledge generation and
        discovery." To that end, PMC is now aggregating data citations, data availability statements
        and supplementary materials, as available, in an Associated Data box. This box will only
        display on articles that have one or more of these features in the article.</p>
      <p><img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/associated_data_box.png" title="PMC Associated Data Box" alt="PMC Associated Data Box"/></p>
      <p>To limit your search to records with an Associated Data box, you can use the new

        to access manner, you will more readily find the datasets you need to further accelerate
        discovery and advance health. As part of our ongoing commitment to making <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/plan/lrp17/NLM_StrategicReport2017_2027.pdf">data

      <p>Collaboration with publishers and funders to ensure the openness and preservation of the
        scientific record is one of PMC's core principles. Open Access Week offers an opportunity to
        celebrate some of the recent outcomes of these collaborations: <ul>
          <li>In July 2018, the PMC corpus of publicly accessible articles hit 5 million
            articles.</li>
          <li>In May 2018, the <a href="../../tools/openftlist/">PMC Open Access Subset</a>
            surpassed the 2 million article mark.</li>
          <li>The <a href="../authorms/#dataset/">Author Manuscript Collection</a> now includes more
            than 500,000 papers for text mining.</li>
          <li>The <a href="../public-access/">PMC and Research Funder Policy page</a> underwent an
            update in September 2018 to increase transparency around funder support in PMC for
            publishers, authors, and the public.</li>
          <li>Funder policy support in PMC has been extended to the US Department of Homeland
            Security, in addition to several new US private research funders via the Health Research
            Alliance.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In FY2018 more than 200 new journals committed to archiving their complete contents in PMC,
        to be made publicly accessible in 12 months or less.</p>

      <p>PMC has <a href="../../pub/journalselect/">released expanded information</a> about its
        selection process for journals that apply for participation. The current review process has
        been in place <a href="../guidelines/#standards">since November 2014</a> and focuses
        on the scientific rigor and editorial quality of each journal that applies to participate in
        PMC. Some of the attributes taken into account as part of this process include the article
        content, journal policies, language quality, and presentation of content. The same
        assessment considerations are used for <a href="../guidelines/#standards">reevaluation
          of currently participating journals</a>. We encourage you to visit the <a href="../../pub/journalselect/">Journal Selection for PMC</a> page to learn more.</p>
      <p>Publishers and journals interested in submitting an application to PMC are also encouraged
        to review our <a href="../guidelines/#agreements">updated policies on agreement
          types</a>. These policies provide the eligibility criteria for each type of participation

                <h2>Data Filters in PMC and PubMed</h2>
                
      <p>Looking for journal articles with associated data sets? New search filters in PMC and
        PubMed aim to increase the discoverability of articles with associated data information.</p>
      <p>In PMC, users can now search on or append searches with filters to discover articles with
        specific types of associated data, i.e., to find</p>
      <ol>
        <li>articles with associated supplementary material, use <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=has+suppdata%5Bfilter%5D">"has suppdata"[filter]</a>;</li>
        <li>articles that include a data availability or data accessibility statement, use <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=has+data+avail%5Bfilter%5D">"has data avail"[filter];</a> or </li>
        <li>articles that include data citation(s), use <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=has+data+citations%5Bfilter%5D">"has data
          citations"[filter]</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Alternatively, users can run a search on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=has+associated+data%5Bfilter%5D">"has associated data"[filter]</a> to
        find all articles with any type of data section described above. </p>
      <p>In PubMed, users can now search on or append searches with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=data%5Bfilter%5D">data[filter]</a> to find articles with related
        data links in either the Secondary Source ID field or the LinkOut -- Other Literature
        Resources field (both located below the abstract). These data links may be to records in
        other NLM databases (e.g., GenBank) or external data repositories (e.g., figshare, Dryad). </p>
      <p>The provision and availability of associated datasets still varies widely from article to
        article, but it is our hope that this small step helps improve the discoverability of this
        material and supports wider community efforts to advance science in new directions. </p>

      <p>In collaboration with <a href="https://europepmc.org">Europe PMC</a>, PMC has rolled out
        several updates to our article display in order to enhance the transparency and readability
        of the content.</p>
      <p><img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/artdisplay_s1.png" title="PMC Article Display" alt="PMC Filter Options"/></p>
      <p>Navigating from the PMC record to the PubMed record has been made easier by the addition of
        hyperlinked PubMed IDs (PMIDs) in the upper right-hand corner of article records. Clicking
        the PMID link will take you to the corresponding citation record in PubMed.</p>
      <p>The PMC Disclaimer link has also been moved out of the Copyright and License information
        section for easier discovery and access. This page describes what content is included in PMC
        as well as other important NCBI and NLM disclaimer information.</p>

      <p><img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/artdisplay_s2.png" title="PMC Quick Author Search" alt="PMC Filter Options"/></p>
      <p>Additionally, two changes have been implemented to improve the functionality of author
        names. Users can now click on an author name to view the author's affiliation(s). Users also
        have the option of running a quick author name search in PMC by clicking the linked author
        name in "Find articles by [author name]". In the example pictured above, the search would be
        for "Sawyer SL"[Author].</p>
      <p><img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/artdisplay_s3.png" title="PMC Inline Image Display" alt="PMC Filter Options"/></p>
      <p>And finally, figures and tables have been moved inline in the article display. By moving
        away from the thumbnail display, PMC hopes to make it easier for users to view figure and
        table data as they read articles. Users may still click on the figure/table title or "Open
        in separate window" (as available) link for a closer look. </p>
      <p>We hope these updates improve the overall user experience in PMC and look forward to
        hearing your feedback. </p>

      <p>PMC Canada, sponsored by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), with
        operational support provided by the National Research Council (NRC), has been a valued
        partner in the <a href="../pmci/">PMC International</a> network since 2009. CIHR and
        NRC have now notified NLM of their decision to permanently take PubMed Central Canada (PMC
        Canada) offline on February 23, 2018. Details of this decision are available on the <a href="http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/static/aboutUs/">PMC Canada website</a>.</p>
      <p>The decision to decommission PMC Canada does not affect the status or operations of NIH's
        PubMed Central (US) or Europe PubMed Central. PMC Canada content will remain in the PMC

                <h2>Updated guidance on data deposit and linking in PMC</h2>
                
      <p>In response to the growing interest in the availability of data associated with articles,
        PMC is reviewing current practices around data and seeking feedback on how to best serve the
        data needs of the research community.</p>
      <p>As part of these efforts, the <a href="../guidelines/#suppm">PMC policy statement on
          supplementary data</a> was recently updated to more clearly articulate the requirement
        that any supplementary data (images, tables, video, or other documents / files) that are
        associated with an article must be deposited in PMC with an article. The search filter "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=has+suppdata%5Bfilter%5D">has
          suppdata[filter]</a>" can be used in PMC to discover records with associated supplementary
        data files.</p>
      <p>In addition to providing supplementary data with an article, NLM is also encouraging
        journals and authors to make research data available in a public repository and include the
        relevant data citation(s) in the paper. Guidance for PMC data providers on tagging data
        citations is available in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/dobs.html#dob-datacitations">Tagging
          Guidelines</a>. This guidance is based on the <a href="https://jats4r.org/data-citations">JATS4R recommendations on data citations</a>.</p>
      <p>Starting this month, the NIH Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) system will also accept deposits
        of small datasets accompanying deposits of funded author manuscripts for inclusion of PMC.
        (Guidance for authors is available in the <a href="https://support.nlm.nih.gov/knowledgebase/article/KA-05248/en-us">NIHMS FAQ</a>.)</p>
      <p>If you have suggestions on future directions in data for PMC to consider, please let us
        know at <a href="mailto:pubmedcentral@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov?subject=New%20In%20PMC%20Data%20Deposit">pubmedcentral@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>.</p>

                <h2>PMC Continues to Expand its Role as a Repository for Federally and Privately-funded
        Research </h2>
                
      <p>Since <a href="#2016-03-24">March 2016</a>, the <a href="https://www.nihms.nih.gov/">NIH
          Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) system</a> has added support for researchers from the
        following federal agencies to deposit in PMC any manuscripts that fall under the agency's
        public access policy: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR/HHS; intramural only at this
          time) </li>
        <li>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA; intramural only at this time) </li>
        <li>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA; intramural/civil servants and
          grantees) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Manuscript deposit support for all Administration for Community Living (ACL/HHS)
        researchers will be available in NIHMS by October 2017 and for Department of Homeland
        Security researchers in early 2018.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Open Access Policy now requires their
        grantees to make their published research results available in PMC immediately upon
        publication under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Manuscript deposit support
        is not provided in NIHMS for Gates-funded researchers; rather the final published version of
        any Gates-funded article is to be deposited directly to PMC by the publisher or a
        funder-supported data provider without author involvement. More information on this open
        access policy is available on the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Open-Access-Policy">Gates Foundation website</a>. </p>
      <p>PMC will continue to update the list of participating funding agencies at <a href="../public-access">Public Access and PMC</a> as support is implemented. </p>

                <h2>PMC Bulk Download via FTP is Now Using New Naming Conventions</h2>
                
      <p>A large-scale update of the file names used for articles available via the <a href="../../tools/ftp">PMC FTP service</a> for bulk download was undertaken in early January
        2017. The new file naming convention is PMCID-based (e.g., PMC4855680.tar.gz) rather than
        being built from article citation data (i.e., journal abbreviation_pub
        date_volume_issue_page). This update was made following user reports that the previous
        naming convention was resulting in missing contents in cases where citation data was
        duplicated across multiple articles. The new convention will ensure that file names are
        unique and that the corpus available via the FTP service is complete.</p>

                <h2>New Search Result Filters and Updated Reference List Display</h2>
                
      <p>As of August 2016, PMC is home to <b>four million</b> articles! To make this wealth of
        full-text content easier to navigate, PMC has rolled out a few updates:</p>
      <p><b>1) Search Result Filters</b><br/> On all search results pages, you will now see filters
        (similar to PubMed's filters) on the left-hand side that allow you to filter your results by
        article attributes, publication date, research funder, and search fields. These filters
        replace the Limits page and allow you to more readily:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>find open access articles (PMC has more than 1.35 million open access articles that can
          be reused according to their license statements),</li>
        <li>explore PMC's rich historical content from <a href="../scanning/">NLM's back issue
            digitization project</a>,</li>
        <li>browse research supported by <a href="../public-access/">PMC-participating funding
            organizations</a> (click "Customize" to view additional funder options),</li>
        <li>and much more. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can now also quickly add articles that are under a 12-month or less embargo in PMC to
        your search results by selecting the "Include embargoed articles" filter option under Text
        Availability. See the <a href="../userguide/#byarticleproperty">PMC User Guide</a> for
        more information on these filters. </p>
      <p><img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/filter_screenshot.png" title="PMC Filter Options" alt="PMC Filter Options"/></p>
      <p><b>2) Reference List Display</b><br/> Using related article data available in PMC,
        articles that cite papers that have been either retracted or named in a Findings of Research
        Misconduct issued by the HHS Office of Research Integrity and not yet retracted will now
        include a red hyperlink to the relevant notice directly from the article's reference list.
        This update will help users more easily identify post-publication updates to existing
        research. </p>

                <h2>FTP service update to improve access to text mining collections</h2>
                
      <p>PMC has reorganized its <a href="../../tools/ftp/">FTP Service</a> site for users interested
        in accessing the <a href="../../tools/textmining/">PMC Article Datasets</a>, which include
        the original Open Access (OA) Subset. New top-level FTP directories help users quickly
        locate the content available for bulk download that best suits their research needs. These
        directories include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_package/">oa_package</a> - article
          packages for individual OA articles</li>
        <li><a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/">oa_pdf</a> - individual PDFs for OA
          articles</li>
        <li><a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_bulk/">oa_bulk</a> - bulk packages of
          text from OA articles</li>
        <li><a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/manuscript/">manuscript</a> - author
          manuscripts collected under a funding agency's public access policy</li>
        <li><a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/historical_ocr/">historical_ocr</a> - select
          OCR texts from the <a href="../scanning/">PMC Back Issue Digitization</a>
          project</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To make it easier for users to identify and comply with the different licenses that apply
        to OA articles, new file lists have been created and the file lists for individual OA
        articles now include a "license-type" field for each article. Similarly, the bulk packages
        of OA article text have been divided into two sets. One set comprises articles that may be
        used for <b>commercial purposes</b> (the Commercial Use Collection); the other contains
        articles that can be used <b>only for non-commercial purposes</b>. See the <a href="../../tools/openftlist/">Open Access Subset page</a> for details.</p>

      <p>To allow regular users to transition to the new arrangement, the previous arrangement of
        files and directories will be maintained in parallel for at least four weeks (i.e., until
        the end of August 2016). </p>

                <h2>Public Access Expansion and PMC</h2>
                
      <p>Last month marked the third anniversary of the White House's Office of Science and
        Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum directing Federal agencies with more than $100 million
        in annual research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures to develop plans for increasing
        public access to the results of the research they support, including scholarly publications.
        As a result of this directive, in 2015, PMC started providing support as a public access
        repository for funding agencies beyond the <a href="https://publicaccess.nih.gov/">National
          Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) and <a href="../policies/open-access">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>
        (HHMI).</p>
      <p>As of March 2015, the following additional agencies are using the <a href="https://nihms.nih.gov">NIH Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) system</a> to facilitate
        the deposit in PMC of peer-reviewed manuscripts that fall under their public access
        policies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agency for Healthcare Research Quality (AHRQ/HHS)</li>
        <li>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/HHS), </li>
        <li>Food and Drug Administration (FDA/HHS), </li>
        <li>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and </li>
        <li>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, the following additional HHS and other federal agencies have announced public
        access plans and committed to using PMC as the repository for agency-funded
        publications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Administration for Community Living (ACL/HHS)</li>
        <li>Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR/HHS)</li>
        <li>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</li>
        <li>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>PMC will continue to update the list of participating funding agencies at <a href="../public-access">Public Access and PMC</a> as these agencies begin implementation of
        their policies.</p>

      <p>NIH-supported scientists have made over 300,000 author manuscripts available in PMC. Now
        NIH is making these papers accessible to the public in a format that will allow robust text
        analyses.</p>
      <p>You can download the PMC collection of NIH-supported author manuscripts as a package in
        either XML or plain-text format at <a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/manuscript/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/manuscript/</a>. The collection encompasses all NIH
        manuscripts posted to PMC that were published in July 2008 or later. While the public can
        access the manuscripts' full text and accompanying figures, tables, and multimedia via the
        PMC website, the newly available XML and plain-text files include full text only. In
        addition to text mining, the files may be used consistent with the principles of <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">fair use</a> under copyright law.</p>
      <p>Please note that these author manuscript files are not part of the PMC <a href="../../tools/openftlist/">Open Access Subset</a>.</p>
      <p>The NIH Office of Extramural Research developed this resource to increase the impact of NIH
        funding. Through this collection, scientists will be able to analyze these manuscripts,
        further apply NIH research findings, and generate new discoveries.</p>

                <h2>Updated PMC journal review process and minimum requirements</h2>
                
      <p>The <a href="intro">PMC Overview</a> and <a href="../faq/#q14">FAQ</a> have been updated to
        provide more information on the Scientific Quality Review Process for journals that apply to
        participate in PMC.</p>
      <p>In 2014, PMC implemented a scientific and editorial quality review procedure whereby expert
        consultants from outside the National Library of Medicine (NLM) conduct an independent
        review of journals seeking to participate in PMC. This was in response to a significant
        increase in new publishers and journals applying to participate in PMC, many of which are
        unknown to NLM in terms of quality and publishing practices. The independent review, which
        was approved by the <a href="nac">PMC National Advisory Committee</a> (see minutes from June
        10, 2014), follows an assessment by NLM that the journal meets NLM's criteria for its
        collection, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/index.html">Collection Development
          Manual</a>.</p>
      <p>PMC also recently updated the minimum requirement on the number of substantive,
        peer-reviewed articles needed before a journal can apply to PMC. The new <a href="../../pub/addjournal/#apply">25-article minimum</a> ensures that the reviewers have a
        sufficient amount of content on which to base their recommendation for inclusion in PMC. The
        new minimum article requirement takes effect on January 1, 2016. Publishers are encouraged
        to use the 25-article minimum as a guideline in the interim when submitting
        applications.</p>

      <p>PMC includes some journals published by US government agencies that make their articles
        available under a Creative Commons CC0 (public domain) license. Some other journals also
        apply a CC0 license to selected articles in PMC. All these articles may be used and
        reproduced without special permission. However, anyone using the material is requested to
        properly cite and acknowledge the source. </p>

      <p>You may now search for CC0 articles by using special filters in both PMC (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=cc0+license[filter]">cc0 license[filter]</a>) and PubMed (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=pmc+cc0+license[filter]">pmc cc0 license[filter]</a>). These filters
        are based on license information that is provided to PMC by publishers and encoded as
        machine-readable identifiers in the source XML of each article. For more information, see
        the FAQ titled <a href="faq/#license_search">How do I search for articles by Creative Commons license?</a> page. </p>

      <p>Please bear in mind that these articles, although made available under a CC0 license, may

        to download them into a format compatible with your bibliographic reference manager
        software.</p>
      <p>When viewing an Entrez search results page, each result summary will now include a
        "Citation" link. When, clicked, this will open a pop-up window that you can use to easily
        copy/paste citations formatted in one of three popular styles: AMA (American Medical
        Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), or APA (American Psychological
        Association). In addition, the box has links at the bottom that can be used to download the
        citation information in one of three machine-readable formats, which most bibliographic
        reference management software can import.</p>
      <p><img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/citation-exporter-feature.png" title="Citation Exporter Feature screenshot" alt="Citation exporter feature screenshot"/></p>
      <p>The same citation box can also be invoked from an individual article, either in classic
        view (with the "Citation" link among the list of formats) or the PubReader view, by clicking
        on the citation information just below the article title in the banner.</p>
      <p>These human-readable styled citations, and machine-readable formats, will be available
        through a public API, and we will be providing more details about that in another

      <p> PMC has just released an upgrade to our ID converter, now dubbed the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/idconv/"> PMCID - PMID -Manuscript ID - DOI Converter</a>. This utility
        allows you to start with the unique identifier for an article that is in PMC, and find
        additional unique identifiers that may apply to the article. Improvements include support
        for DOIs, auto-detection of the ID type based on its format, and enhanced output. It also
        provides output in any of several different formats: HTML, XML, JSON, or CSV. This tool uses
        an underlying web service, that is also publicly available for those needing programmatic
        access to this data. See the <a href="../../tools/id-converter-api">ID Converter API

        to query the subset, to find PDF or tgz (tarred-gzipped) format files, either by article ID,
        or by date/time ranges. More information, along with examples, is available from the

          articles</a>! The record-breaking article, which came from the <i>American Journal of

        PMC archive on June 23. This new PMC milestone has occurred almost three years to the day

      <p>PMC is pleased to announce the first of what we hope will be an annual series of
        conferences for users of the Journal Article Tag Suite, that is, for users of any of the
        “NLM DTDs”. The Journal Article Tag Suite Conference (JATS-Con) is a peer-reviewed
        conference that will feature a broad range of content on the Tag Suite—from the technical
        components to publishing theory—as well as the latest news on the Tag Suite. The conference
        will be hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National
        Library of Medicine on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland on November 1 &amp; 2, 2010. </p>
      <p>For more information on the conference, see <a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con">https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con</a>.</p>

                <h2>New URLs in PMC</h2>
                
      <p>PMC recently redesigned its URL format to allow for easier usability as well as consistency
        across the NCBI site. To implement this change, we moved the previous site,
          <strong>www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov</strong>, into the NCBI domain as a sub-site. You can
        now access the PMC home page at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc</a>.</p>
      <p>The primary advantage of the new format is to enable the PMC site to become more fully
        integrated with other NCBI resources. The new URLs are also more user-friendly—they no
        longer include technology-driven terminology, such as CGI script names and file extensions
        (Figure 1). </p>
      <p>
        <img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/URLsfig1.png" title="Old URL" alt="Old URL Screen Shot"/>
      </p>
      <h3>Figure 1 - Old URL for Journal Page with CGI Script Name</h3>
      <p>Instead, note that after the NCBI/PMC address, the URL first identifies the type of
        resource, e.g., the PMC journal list, with subsequent identification for a particular subset
        of that resource—in this case, the journal number (Figure 2). </p>
      <p>
        <img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/URLsfig2.png" title="New URL" alt="New URL Screen Shot"/>
      </p>
      <h3>Figure 2 - New URL for Journal Page with Journal Number</h3>
      <p>Additionally, you will have greater flexibility in accessing particular types of material
        because, in a number of cases, more than one URL can be used for the same resource. In these
        instances, one URL is considered to be canonical, or primary; however, using any of the
        ancillary URLs for that resource will redirect you back to the canonical one. For example
        (see Figure 3), although the first URL, which represents the PMCID, is considered to be the
        canonical URL, you may also access the article by using other identifiers, such as the pmid,
        doi, or the issn-volume-issue-page (ivip). </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Figure 3 - Canonical and Ancillary URLs for the Same Full-Text Article</h3>
      <p> Finally, with the roll-out of these more stable and standardized URLs, as in the table
        below (Figure 4), you will also find it easier to modify the web addresses in your browser.
        Note that the canonical URL is given first and is in bold; the ancillary URLs are listed
        below it. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Figure 4 - Table Display of all New URLs</h3>
      <p>Although the new URLs are firmly in place, please also note that we haven't completely
        discarded the old to bring in the new. If you do use an old URL, it's not a problem. Your
        browser will be redirected to the new location. </p>

                <h2>PMC Now Offers a &quot;Preview&quot; Table of Contents for Embargoed Issues</h2>
                
      <p>For any journal issue that has at least one open access or early access article, PMC is now
        displaying the table of contents (TOC) in advance of the whole issue becoming available. Not
        to worry, though—only those articles specified for early release are immediately viewable in
        PMC. As consistent with the terms of access in the journal agreement, the other articles
        will only become available on their specified release date, as shown in the TOC below.</p>
      <p>
        <img src="/core/assets/pmc/images/plantphystoc.png" title="Plant Phys TOC" alt="Plant Phys TOC Screen Shot"/>
      </p>
      <p>The journal's accessiblity, as indicated on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals">PMC Journal
          list</a> also has not changed; for example, Plant Physiology's embargo period is still 12
        months. What has changed is that the issues with "preview" TOCs now additionally appear on
        the journal's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/69">archive page</a>. Publishers and others can rest
        assured, however, that no access terms for any journal have been changed with the unveiling
        of this new format. </p>

        PMCID and date of availability at the bottom of the article citation, as indicated in the
        example below. <strong><i>Note: The PMC search option only includes articles with an initial
            embargo of up to 12 months. Articles with an embargo greater than 12 months are not
            compliant with the NIH Public Access Policy and will appear in search results only when
            the full text is free in PMC.</i></strong> For more information, see the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so09/so09_pmc_embargoed_articles.html">article</a> in the September-October issue of the NLM Technical Bulletin. </p>

        National Research Council's Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information
        (NRC-CISTI). Similar to UK PubMed Central, PMC Canada will include most of the health and
        life sciences literature available through the U.S. PMC. PMC Canada will also include
        research resulting from funding through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

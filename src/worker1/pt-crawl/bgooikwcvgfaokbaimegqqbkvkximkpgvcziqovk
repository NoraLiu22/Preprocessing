            TENDENCY TO ROMANTICIZE HER OWN LIFE</b> characterized Marie Curie 
            from girlhood on. In letters she wrote as a teenager she sometimes 
            presented herself as a tragic heroine. Similarly, in her 1923 biography 
            <i>Pierre Curie</i> and in the autobiographical notes appended to 
            it, she depicted herself and her husband as participants in a heroic 
            struggle. According to the self-portrait she propagated, Pierre and 
            Marie Curie, in their pursuit of scientific truth, had to overcome 
            not only poverty but also the indifference and even hostility of the 
            French establishment. </font>

              false, this image of herself and Pierre as solitary laborers in 
              search of knowledge is only part of the truth. For example, in her 
              biography <i>Pierre Curie,</i> Marie devotes paragraphs to describing 
              the miserable old shed in which she and Pierre made their significant 
              discoveries. What she does not tell the reader is that from early 
              on in their work the Curies received significant assistance from 
              collaborators in industry. For example, the gross treatment of the 
              first ton of pitchblende, donated to the Curies by the Austrian 
              government, was performed in the factory of the Central Chemical 
              Products Company, which marketed Pierre's scientific instruments. 
              Far from laboring entirely on their own, the Curies were allied 
              with the French radioelements industry that their research did so 
              much to develop. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">As for government 
              research grants and salaries, Marie and Pierre were treated as well 
              as most good scientists of their day. The real problem, Marie and 
              her friends insisted, was that science as a whole got far too little 
              funding.</font></p>

                      whole day mixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly 
                      as large as myself. I would be broken with fatigue at the

								<p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">The romantic image 
              of the struggling scientist had already been established a generation 
              earlier by Louis Pasteur and others. While reflecting real difficulties, 
              the image also served as a propaganda tool. At a time when Curie 
              hoped to secure funding for her Radium Institute, her emphasis on 
              the difficulties she faced as a scientist helped not only to arouse 
              public sympathy but also to raise significant philanthropic donations 
              and put pressure on the French government. If more money could be 
              won for basic research by emphasizing certain aspects of her past 
              and downplaying others, a larger truth would be served--scientists 
              everywhere could do far more for humanity if they had better funding. 
              &#147;All civilized groups,&#148; Marie wrote, &#147;have an absolute 
              duty to watch over the domain of pure science...and to provide [its 
              workers] with the support they need.&#148;</font></p>

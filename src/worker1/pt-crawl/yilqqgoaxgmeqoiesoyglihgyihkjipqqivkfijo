          Brian Grasso<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          ability to &#8216;move&#8217; has long been considered an innate skill 
          that athletes either posses or don&#8217;t. The notion that movement 
          aptitude or ability can in fact be taught, progressed and even perfected 
          over time remains a constant source of debate for many strength coaches.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More 
          over, several sport coaches often design drills and maneuvers within 
          the context of a given practice that are intended to enhance the specific 
          speed or movement proficiency of an athlete as it relates to a particular 
          pattern of motion found within the respective sport. More often than 
          not, the drill or sequence is demonstrated once, discussed briefly and 
          then executed by the individual athletes on the team.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phrases 
          such as &#8216;Get there!&#8217; and &#8216;FASTER!&#8217; are yelled 
          by the coach as he or she laments at the lack of speed or proficiency 
          with which the athletes are performing the drill in question. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          issue however, resides not in the fact that the athletes are lacking 
          anything in particular as the reason why they can&#8217;t seem to perfect 
          the drill to the level that the coach demands, rather it is the coach/trainer 
          who is lacking&#8230; Specifically, a well thought out and progressive 
          system intended to<br>
          gradually increase the level of ability in each athlete allowing for 
          adequate if not perfect execution.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          This remains one of several issues I feel are lost and missing on so 
          many coaches and trainers working with young athletes today &#8211; 
          Strength, speed, mobility, agility and even flexibility exercises are 
          skills that must be taught, reinforced and perfected through a progressive 
          and systematic means. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          feel strongly that this is at least partially attributable to the notion 
          that many of the best athletes in a given sport seldom become quality 
          coaches. It is the ability to understand the individual elements that 
          comprise a specific technique, how to break them down to their finer 
          parts and incorporate them into a methodical instructive process that 
          accounts for one&#8217;s ability as a coach. Very often, naturally talented 
          athletes lack this ability, as their skills were typically &#8216;unconscious&#8217;. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coaches 
          and trainers who don&#8217;t adopt an instructional system within their 
          training sessions are not allowing for optimal development of the skills 
          associated with the exercises they are prescribing and therefore not 
          reinforcing a lifetime adherence of ability to that drill.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
          example, Coach &#8216;A&#8217; takes his soccer players out on to the 
          field for a training session and creates a cone drill intended to improve 
          agility. Five to ten minutes are spent explaining the drill and he demonstrates 
          the movement sequence once. He then instructs the athletes to go through 
          the<br>
          drill as shown/discussed. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
          everyone has gone through the drill, he bemoans that his team did not 
          execute the drill to the level that he had expected. But what &#8216;level&#8217; 
          is he talking about? He only showed the drill once and discussed the 
          complexities of it for a few minutes. Is the level he was hoping to 
          see one that he &#8216;saw&#8217; in his head? Very often coaches and 
          trainers will know what a drill or exercise should look like, but struggle 
          with why their athletes aren&#8217;t performing it as such. In this 
          example, Coach &#8216;A&#8217; did not take the time to make his athletes 
          understand the finite characteristics of each motion within the movement 
          sequence, so adherence or demonstration of the drill is not going to 
          look like<br>
          the image he created. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Same 
          coach. Same team &#8211; two weeks later. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          time Coach &#8216;A&#8217; asks his team to perform the exact same drill 
          but is shocked to see that, although still not at the level he wanted 
          it to be, it is being executed poorly for different reasons now. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two 
          weeks ago when he first prescribed the drill, the kids were going through 
          the exercise reasonably well, but the speed and tempo were far too slow. 
          This time, the speed and tempo are much better, but the actual exeuction 
          of each &#8216;cut&#8217; and &#8216;change of direction&#8217; looks 
          very sloppy. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          the absence of a quality and orderly instructional method, young athletes 
          simply cannot adhere to a level of competency in performing a drill 
          or exercise because they do not have a grasp of the finite and fundamental 
          components of <strong>how</strong> to perform it. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Physical 
          elements such as &#8216;cutting&#8217;, &#8216;changing direction&#8217;, 
          &#8216;decelerating&#8217; and &#8216;accelerating&#8217; are items 
          that many coaches and trainers want their athletes to be good at, but 
          don&#8217;t realize that they are not inborn skills we simply posses. 
          They can however be taught and systematically perfected if the coach 
          in question develops and executes a well thought out and progressive 
          teaching model. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having 
          said all that, there are three fundamental reasons coaches and trainers 
          should teach movement skills as part of their curriculum:</font></p>

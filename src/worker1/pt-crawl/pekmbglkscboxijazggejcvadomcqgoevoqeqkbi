<p>Indira Nehru Gandhi was born on November 19, 1917 and would be the only child of
Jawaharlal and Kamala Nehru. Being influenced and inspired by her parents, Indira Gandhi
rose to power in India and eventually became prime minister. She dedicated her life to
progress in her country despite the overwhelming problems and challenges she encountered.</p>

<p>Her road to power and politics started when she turned twelve years of age. During the
time of British imperialism, many Indian National Congress workers from Allahabad did not
know when or if the British would arrest them or search their homes. In order to find out
when this would occur, the Monkey Brigade was formed. Although Indira claimed to have
thought of the idea, some asserted that the Monkey Brigade was the idea of the Congress.
In any event, Indira became the leader of this children's group whose purpose was to help
end British control in India. Being its leader, she delivered speeches while other
children actually warned the people who were going to be arrested. The Congress figured
that the British would not suspect children of participating in such involvement. Although
some deemed it a joke, Indira took her job very seriously. One of the most significant
actions of the Monkey Brigade involved Indira. The Congress party's top officials were
organizing a civil disobedience movement. After the meeting, the documents containing the
plans of the movement were placed in the trunk of a car with Indira in the back seat.
Before the car was ready to leave the area, a police inspector stopped the car in order to
search it. However, Indira pleaded with him not to inspect the car because the delay would
cause her to arrive late at school. Fortunately, the inspector believed her and the car
was not searched.</p>

<p>In 1938, Indira finally joined the Indian National Congress Party, something she always
longed to do. Soon afterwards in 1942, she married journalist Feroze Gandhi to whom she
eventually bore two sons. Soon after the couple was married, they were sent to prison on
charges of subversion by the British. Her first and only imprisonment lasted from
September 11, 1942 until May 13, 1943 at the Naini Central Jail in Allahabad. </p>

<p>Fortunately, India won its independence from Britain in 1947. In that same year,
Indira's father Jawaharlal Nehru became prime minister and served until his
death in 1964. Since her mother had died in 1936,
Indira acted as hostess and confidante and traveled with Nehru to meet famous political
figures. Later in 1959, Gandhi became the fourth woman elected president of the Indian
National Congress. After her father's death, the new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri
appointed Indira Gandhi as minister of information and broadcasting. This position was the
fourth highest ranking position in the Cabinet. Many Indians were illiterate. Therefore,
radio and television played a major part in informing them. As minister, she most
importantly encouraged the making of inexpensive radios and started a family planning
program.</p>

<p>After Shastri's death in 1966, Indira Gandhi served as prime minister until India held
the next election. She won that election, and in 1967, became one of the first
women ever elected
to lead a democracy. In 1971, Gandhi was re-elected by campaigning with the slogan
&quot;Abolish Poverty.&quot; However in 1975, Gandhi was found guilty of violating
election laws. Later, the conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of India. Also,
to control population growth, Gandhi implemented a voluntary sterilization program. As a
result, adversaries criticized her and her administration in general. To secure her power
and because of escalating riots, on June 26, 1975, Indira Gandhi declared a state of
emergency which limited the personal freedom of Indians. Also, she ordered the arrests of
the main opposition leaders. In her opinion, her dictatorship was for the good of
India. But she allowed free elections in 1977, and the Indian people voted her out of office. </p>

<p>She regained her position as prime minister in
1980.&nbsp; Unfortunately on October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards assassinated her.
They did so to avenge the storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Gandhi had ordered the
storming in June because of what her government considered terrorist activity of
extremist Sikhs who had occupied the Temple. </p>

<p>As prime minister, Gandhi tried to improve the lives of Indians. With her
neighbors, the Soviet Union and China, she improved relations.&nbsp; She also
promoted science and technology.&nbsp; In 1971, India sent its first satellite into space. Economically,
Indira Gandhi led India to become one of the fastest growing economies in the world toward the
end of her time as prime minister.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">Annotated Bibliography</h2>

<p><b>Ashby, Ruth and Deborah Gore Ohrn, eds. <u><i>Herstory</i></u>. New York: Viking, 1995.<br>
</b>This book features women who have had a profound impact on the world. It provides the
reader with concise biographies of 120 women from Queen Hatshepsut to contemporary women.
The editors divide it into three sections: the Dawn, From Revolution to Revolution, and
the Global Community. Although the first section mostly consists of royalty or the elite,
the other parts cover a wide variety of women, queens and subjects alike.<br>
One of the women presented is Indira Gandhi. Her biography includes her early years,
family life, and education. It also discusses her rise to fame by holding the positions of
president of the National Congress party, minister of information and broadcasting, and
finally prime minister of India.<br>
Even though the biography is brief, it highlights the main aspects of each
woman's
life. One doing research would want to further develop these points. Each biography also
contains information concerning the time the woman was born, a description of her family,
significant aspects of her life, and finally her death, if applicable, in a well-organized
fashion. Besides explaining famous women, the editors include brief descriptions on
women's life in general from prehistory to the present.<br>
In order to assist the reader, the editors arranged the index by geography and
occupation of the women.<br>
The most important purpose of this book is to inform that women did contribute to this
world and need to be recognized. Although nobody can dispute the significance of
men's
accomplishments, one must realize that women also impacted and continue to impact our
world. The editors, each involved in women's studies, commented that history is not
complete or accurate without women's history. The female editors and contributors
successfully describe women in history from women's perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Bhatia, Krishan. <u>Indira: A Biography of Prime Minister Gandhi</u>. New York:
Praeger, 1974.</b><br>
This book traces the life of Indira Gandhi. It describes her family life and the pain
she had to endure when her parents Jawaharlal and Kamala Nehru and her grandfather Motilal
Nehru were sent to prison as a result of the Indian freedom movement. The author also
discusses Indira Gandhi's education in India, Geneva and London. In addition, the author,
one of India's most respected journalists, includes how Nehru, who was extremely concerned
about the education of his only child, wrote Indira many letters about world history.
Since he was in jail at the time, Nehru could not teach her himself.<br>
The author also describes her marriage to Feroze Gandhi, a Parsi newspaper executive
and politician. Although the couple remained together, their busy schedules kept them
apart at times. He also describes how Indira served as her father's hostess and confidante
which gave her experience in politics. In becoming prime minister, Indira Gandhi needed to
fight to maintain her power and faced serious challenges in order to lead over 550 million
people.<br>
Although being famous to the world, Indira, as Bhatia concludes and she herself
commented, was a very private person. To write his book, Bhatia met with Indira Gandhi,
her supporters, and those who opposed her. He also explains both her successes and
failures in order to be as objective as possible.</p>

<p><b>D'Amico, Francine and Peter R. Beckman, eds. <i>Women in World Politics</i>. Westport:
Bergin and Garney, 1995.</b><br>
This book examines the effect that women have had on world politics and what women are
actually involved in politics. Besides discussing female world leaders, such as presidents
and prime ministers, the book also includes activists and revolutionaries and others not
directly appointed or elected to a specific political position. It also considers the
concept of gender and how it affects politics and what impact culture has on politics. All
of the contributors present different views on world politics and different perspectives
on how women participate in world politics.<br>
The editors divide the book into two sections. In the beginning of the book, the
contributors explain how individual women leaders and representatives rose to political
prominence and examine their policies, decisions, and leadership. In addition, the authors
include how society views women political leaders, and the affect that gender has on
acquiring and enforcing power. One famous politician that was written about was Indira
Gandhi. By exploring her political acumen, the author informs the reader of
Gandhi's rise
to prime minister of India. It also includes Gandhi's family background, path to power,
relations with the United States, efforts at regional hegemony, and Gandhi's perception of
herself. To further enhance this section, women who have participated in world politics
either as leaders or held prominent positions provide the reader with a first-hand
experience of political life. Each offers a different view on women in world politics. The
second half of the book explores how ordinary women influenced and affected politics.<br>
This book includes many tables that give the reader insightful information into how
men's political views compare and contrast to women's views. In addition, the book serves
as a guide to understanding female political figures.</p>

<p><b>Drieberg, Trevor. <i>Indira Gandhi</i>. New York: Drake, 1973.</b><br>
This book provides insightful knowledge into the life of Indira Gandhi. In order to
give the reader an accurate view, Trevor Drieberg, a political reporter in India, traces
the path of Gandhi's political life from its earliest beginnings until the early
seventies. He explains how the desire for independence from the British affected Indira
Gandhi in the early part of her life. In addition, this book emphasizes the role her
father Jawaharlal Nehru played in her life. She served as his hostess since her mother
died. In return, he served as her primary inspiration. By accompanying him on world tours
and public events, she learned world politics first hand.<br>
The author also explores Indira's rise to political fame by tracing her steps from
entering the Congress party, becoming minister of information and broadcasting, and more
importantly, her becoming prime minister.<br>
This book includes four appendixes to provide the reader with additional information
concerning Indira Gandhi. The first appendix contains selections from her speeches and
writing from 1966 until 1972. The second one includes a letter to President Richard Nixon.
The letter reveals India's problems with Pakistan and relations with the U.S. Appendix
three discusses the treaty of peace, friendship and cooperation between the Republic of
India and other foreign countries. Finally, appendix four lists the twelve points of the
Congress party's plan for progress in 1971.<br>
Drieberg believes that Gandhi is significant since she dominated Indian politics yet
was elected democratically and used the almost unlimited power in a democratic manner.
From the author's explanation and description of her political life, one can gain useful
information concerning Indira Gandhi.</p>

<p><b>Krishnan, Narayana Kalyana. &quot;The Elections and the Political Struggle in
India.&quot; <i>World Marxist Review</i>. 28(July 1985): 97-102.</b><br>
This article discusses and emphasizes the main factor that led to a victory in the
December 1984 election for the Indian National Congress party. The primary factor resulted
from the death of former prime minister, Indira Gandhi. As a result of her death, Indians
became aware of the threat to the unity and security of their country. Just before her
death, the government had the army storm Punjab because of Sikh extremists. Most Indians
became very concerned about their nation's unity, integrity, and security. This became the
central political factor in the parliamentary general elections. Therefore, the party that
could assure to create unity, integrity, and security would emerge victorious. As it
happened, the Indian people felt that the Indian National Congress could achieve this
goal. Rajiv Gandhi, son of Indira Gandhi, claimed that only the Indian National Congress
could accomplish this goal. Also, many Indians felt sympathetic to the Congress because of
Indira's death.<br>
The writer also points out that the Congress failed in such states as Andhra Pradesh,
Jammu and Kashmir and Sikkim. This resulted from the dislike of the undemocratic actions
of the Congress Central Governments.<br>
The people of India expected the Government to end their anguish and improve living
conditions. In addition, Rajiv Gandhi promised peace, non-alignment, and friendship with
countries and especially the Soviet Union. The author of this article, who is the
Secretary of the National Council of the Communist Party of India, said that his party
would work with the Rajiv Government to bring about these positive plans.<br>
This article gives insight into the election from someone who is active in politics.
The author, who is a communist, also provides the reader with information from past
elections and the reactions of the Communist Party. One can also gain a feeling of how
Indians felt shortly after Indira Gandhi's death.</p>

<p><b>Masani, Zareer. <u>Indira Gandhi</u>. New York: Crowell, 1976.</b><br>
This book presents the life of Indira Gandhi. The author, a historian, begins by
explaining her family life and ends with the events of 1975. In discussing her early
years, the author describes how Indira Gandhi was surrounded by politics and political
figures. Motilal Nehru, her grandfather, and also Jawaharlal Nehru, her father, were two
influential leaders in the campaign for Indian independence. Indira also had contact with
Mahatma Gandhi, the primary leader for independence.<br>
In 1947, India gained independence and Indira's father became prime minister. Indira
became her father's official hostess and political confidante. As a result, she acquired
an abundance of political knowledge. This proved helpful to her when she finally achieved
the position of prime minister of India. In this position, Gandhi encountered many
problems such as overpopulation, low food production, financial difficulties, and poor
foreign relations. Masani explores the hard times Indira Gandhi had to deal with and her
determination to end those problems as prime minister.<br>
This book is a thorough biography of the life of Indira Gandhi until 1975. One can gain
a strong sense of what factors influenced her political actions throughout her time as
prime minister. In addition, the author revised his book in order to include the Emergency
that occurred in the middle of 1975. To Masani, the Emergency resulted from economic and
political problems. He also called democracy in India a &quot;Western Liberal
Illusion.&quot; According to him, the masses were not properly represented. The book is
objective and provides the reader with even more insight into Indira Gandhi's political
life.</p>

<p><b>Moraes, Dom. <i>Indira Gandhi</i>. Boston: Little Brown, 1980.<br>
</b>This book describes the life of one of the world's most popular women, Indira Gandhi.
It gives a very informative and well-written portrayal of her. The author, a correspondent
and memoirist, divides the book into four sections: the inheritance, the ascent, the
pinnacle, and the descent of Indira Gandhi. Being the daughter of the active political
figure Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi was destined to play an active part in politics.
Just as Nehru, Indira, along with her husband Feroze Gandhi, was jailed because of
tensions with the British and struggle for independence. When independence was finally
gained and Nehru became Prime Minister of India in 1947, Indira was right by his side and
highly exposed to politics.<br>
Moraes also explains Gandhi's political life. In addition, he devotes an entire chapter
to Indira's son Sanjay. He describes Sanjay's four-point program. According to the author,
two points, sterilization and destruction of the slums, were factors in the downfall of
Indira Gandhi.<br>
Moraes initially wrote this book with the cooperation of Indira Gandhi and members of
her family. He provides the reader with insight into Indian life, culture, politics, and
its history. Overall, his book thoroughly explains the life of India's most famous woman.</p>

<p><b>&quot;Mrs. Gandhi is Dead, Long Live Gandhi.&quot; <i>Economist</i>, 3 November 1984,
35-6.<br>
</b>The writer of this article presents Indira Gandhi's assassination. The writer divides
the article into four parts. The first informs the reader of the assassination itself. Not
only does he mention the murder, but also the writer provides the reader with the event at
Amritsar that led to her assassination by her Sikh bodyguards. The writer also provides

Rajiv Gandhi. By including him, the writer informs the reader of what challenges Rajiv
Gandhi will face as new prime minister. The third section provides the reader with a brief
description of how India improved economically under Indira. Also, the writer includes how
Gandhi removed anyone who would challenge her political power. Finally, the writer

had to endure. In order to begin to understand India, one must understand this. The

<p><b>Sahgal, Nayantara. <i>Indira Gandhi: Her Road to Power</i>. New York: Frederick Ungar,
1982.</b><br>
This candid book primary focuses on the political life of Indira Gandhi. According to
the author, Gandhi's values differed from those of her father Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal
Bahadur Shastri, both of whom were her predecessors. Therefore, her style in dealing with
politics was contrary to theirs. To her predecessors, democracy was very important for the
growth and development of the nation. Even though Indira Gandhi believed that she was
democratic, she did not continue that democratic belief of her father and Shastri.
Instead, the writer stresses the fact that Gandhi created a highly centralized government
under her command. This can be best seen in the Emergency of 1975-1977. According to the
author, the emergency formed a one-party system, strong executive powers, and dynastic
succession. The writer also claims that Gandhi returned back to power in 1980 in order to
save Sanjay, one of her sons. Indira felt that the only way to rid the charges against him
was to become prime minister again.<br>
This book is very interesting especially since the author is related to Gandhi. It
provides insight into the political life of Indira Gandhi. The author is not afraid to
express her criticism of Gandhi. She also provides a useful list of Indian personalities
and a clear definition of these people. In addition, the writer translates a handful of
Indian words to assist the reader when reading.</p>

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.3">3</A>
But it is necessary to speak at greater length, and first of the parts about Aegypt, in order to proceed from those that are better known to those that come in order thereafter; for the Nile effects certain common results in this country and in that which is continuous with it and lies above it, I mean the country of the Aethiopians, in that it waters them at the time of its rise and also leaves also those parts of them habitable which have been covered during the overflows, and in that it merely passes through all the higher parts that are at a greater altitude than its current, leaving them uninhabited and desert on both sides because of the same lack of water. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T787a">787</A> <A NAME="1.3.2"></A>However, the Nile does not pass through the whole of Aethiopia, nor alone, nor in a straight line, but it alone passes through Aegypt, through the whole of it and in a straight line, beginning from the little cataract above Syenê and Elephantinê, which are the boundaries of Aegypt and Aethiopia, to its outlets on the sea-coast. <A NAME="1.3.3"></A>And


<A ID="p9"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p9 </SPAN></A>indeed the Aethiopians lead for the most part a nomadic and resourceless life, on account of the barrenness of the country and of the unseasonableness of its climate and of its remoteness from us, whereas with the Aegyptians the contrary is the case in all these respects; for from the outset they have led a civic and cultivated life and have been settled in well-known regions, so that their organisations are a matter of comment. <A NAME="1.3.4"></A>And they are commended in that they are thought to have used worthily the good fortune of their country, having divided it well and having taken good care of it; for when they had appointed a king they divided the people into three classes, and they called one class soldiers, another farmers, and another priests; and the last class had the care of things sacred and the other two of things relating to man; and some had charge of the affairs of war, and others of all the affairs of peace, both tilling soil and following trades, from which sources the revenues were gathered for the king. <A NAME="1.3.5"></A>The priests devoted themselves both to philosophy and to astronomy; and they were companions of the king. <A NAME="1.3.6"></A>The country was first divided into Nomes,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A1*.html#note7
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">7</A> the Thebaïs containing ten, the country in the Delta ten, and the country between them sixteen (according to some, the number of the Nomes all told was the same as that of the halls in the Labyrinth, but the number of these is less than thirty);&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A1*.html#note8
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">8</A> and again the Nomes were divided into other sections, for most of them were divided into


<A ID="p11"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p11 </SPAN></A>toparchies, and these also into other sections; and the smaller portions were the arourae.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="

The Nile flows from the Aethiopian boundaries towards the north in a straight line to the district called "Delta," and then, being "split at the head," as Plato says,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref13" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A1*.html#note13
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

<A ID="p15"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p15 </SPAN></A>navigated with such ease that some people even use earthenware ferry-boats.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref14" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

Now the ancients depended mostly on conjecture, but the men of later times, having become eyewitnesses, perceived that the Nile was filled by summer rains, when Upper Aethiopia was flooded, and particularly in the region of its farthermost mountains, and that when the rains ceased the inundation gradually ceased. <A NAME="1.5.2"></A>This fact was particularly clear to those who navigated the Arabian Gulf as far as the Cinnamon-bearing country, and to those who were sent out to hunt elephants&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref20" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A1*.html#note20
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">20</A> or upon any other business which may have prompted the Ptolemaic kings of Aegypt to despatch men thither. <A NAME="1.5.3"></A>For these kings were concerned with things of this kind; and especially the Ptolemy surnamed Philadelphus, since he was of an


<A ID="p19"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p19 </SPAN></A>inquiring disposition, and on account of the infirmity of his body was always searching for novel pastimes and enjoyments. <A NAME="1.5.4"></A>But the kings of old were not at all concerned with such things, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T790a">790</A> although they proved themselves congenial to learning, both they and the priests, with whom they spent the greater part of their lives; and therefore we may well be surprised, not only on this account, but also by the fact that Sesostris traversed the whole of Aethiopia as far as the Cinnamon-bearing country, and that memorials of his expedition, pillars and inscriptions, are to be seen even to this day. <A NAME="1.5.5"></A>Further, when Cambyses took possession of Aegypt, he advanced with the Aegyptians even as far as Meroê; and indeed this name was given by him to both the island and the city, it is said, because his sister Meroê — some say his wife&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref21" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">21</A> — died there. <A NAME="1.5.6"></A>The name, at any rate, he bestowed upon the place in honour of the woman. <A NAME="1.5.7"></A>It is surprising, therefore, that the men of that time, having such knowledge to begin with, did not possess a perfectly clear knowledge of the rains, especially since the priests rather meticulously record in their sacred books, and thus store away, all facts that reveal any curious information; for they should have investigated, for they made any investigations at all, the question, which even to this day is still being investigated, I mean why in the world rains fall in summer but not in winter, and in the southernmost parts but not in Thebaïs and the country round Syenê;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref22" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A1*.html#note22
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

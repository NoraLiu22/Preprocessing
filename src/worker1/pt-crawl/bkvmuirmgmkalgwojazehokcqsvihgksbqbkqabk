<h3>Passage Illustrated: The Urban Tory Chastises Trotty</h3>

<p class="one">The Alderman laughed, and winked; for he was a merry fellow, Alderman 
Cute. Oh, and a sly fellow too! A knowing fellow. Up to everything. Not to be imposed 
upon. Deep in the people’s hearts! He knew them, Cute did. I believe you!</p>

<p>"But who eats tripe?" said Mr. Filer, looking round. "Tripe is without an exception 
the least economical, and the most wasteful article of consumption that the markets of 
this country can by possibility produce. The loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to 
be, in the boiling, seven-eights of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other 
animal substance whatever. Tripe is more expensive, properly understood, than the 
hothouse pine-apple. Taking into account the number of animals slaughtered yearly within 
the bills of mortality alone; and forming a low estimate of the quantity of tripe which 
the carcases of those animals, reasonably well butchered, would yield; I find that the 
waste on that amount of tripe, if boiled, would victual a garrison of five hundred men 
for five months of thirty-one days each, and a February over. The Waste, the Waste!"</p>

<p>Trotty stood aghast, and his legs shook under him. He seemed to have starved a 
garrison of five hundred men with his own hand.</p>
<p>"Who eats tripe?" said Mr. Filer, warmly. "Who eats tripe?"</p>

<p>Trotty made a miserable bow. ["The First Quarter," pp. 33-35]</p>

<h3>Commentary: Cute Drawn from the Life</h3>

<p class="one">An early review of <span class="book">The Chimes</span> noted the local 
politician upon whom Dickens based Alderman Cute:</p>

<p class="lq">A character of another "order" will, doubtless, be identified among our 
civic neighbours [an allusion to Middlesex magistrate Sir Peter Laurie, who in 1841 had 
conducted a campaign against attempting to commit suicide among the urban poor]: it is 
that of one, who, by "putting down," in the story before us, contrives to perpetuate much 
mischief, as in the following scene of <em>Toby's Daughter and Alderman Cute</em>. [<span 
class="book">The Illustrated London News</span>, 21 December 1844, 395]</p>

<P>Marie-Louise-Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun was one of the most famous painters 
during her time.&nbsp; During her eighty seven-year life, which spanned from 
1755-1842, she created well over 600 pieces of artwork.&nbsp; In a time period where it was uncommon to be a female artist, Marie-Louise 
Elisabeth Vig&eacute;e-Lebrun put her best effort forth to overcome this 
adversity.&nbsp; Women painters were not recognized nearly as much as men 
painters, but Vigée-Lebrun's artwork had its own uniqueness that distinguished 
her artwork apart from others.&nbsp; She not only had to overcome the adversity 
of being a woman, but also had to escape the turmoil of the French 
Revolution.&nbsp; These were among some of the constant controversies she 
endured throughout her life.</P>
<P> Her father, who 
was also an artist, provided lessons for her in her youth, but she mostly 
self-taught herself how to be an artist.&nbsp; At the age of fifteen, Vigée-Lebrun had demonstrated such skill that she was able to provide support 
for herself, her widowed mother, and brother.&nbsp; At the age of twenty her 
mother pushed her into marrying their landlord, Jean Baptise Pierre Lebrun.&nbsp; He was a prestige art dealer and artist that she believed 
influenced most of her paintings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Aside from being influenced by her husband, she was blessed naturally with an 
exceptional talent to please people with her art, especially famous people such 
as Queen Marie Antoinette.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was so talented that in 1778, she was 
summoned to Versailles to become the official painter to Queen Marie 
Antoinette.&nbsp; Because they were the same age, they became friends and 
confidants.&nbsp; Throughout the next ten years, Vigée-Lebrun painted the Queen 
more than thirty times.&nbsp; In 1783, she was admitted to the French Academy of 
Arts, which was a great accomplishment because most women at the time were 
denied entry into such programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Several years later, after 1789, in the turmoil of the French Revolution, Vigée-Lebrun became in danger.&nbsp; Because she was in close ties with the 
court, she had to flee the country.&nbsp; She fled the country traveling to such 
places as Vienna, Prague, Dresden, London, and St. Petersburg.&nbsp; While 
traveling around Europe in exile, she became a member of the Academies of Rome, 
Florence, Bologna, St. Petersburg, and Berlin.&nbsp; At these places, she 
painted heads of state and other aristocrats to help support herself and her 
family.&nbsp; She continued supporting her family for twelve years, and in 1801, 
she moved back to Paris.&nbsp; However, because she disliked Parisian social 
life under Napoleon, she left for London where she painted pictures of the court 
and Lord Byron.&nbsp; She moved yet again to Switzerland, but did not stay long, 
and returned to her home of Paris, where she painted until her death in 
1842.</P>
<P>Vigée-Lebrun's independence is one of the main reasons that many people 
admire her.&nbsp; She is considered a role model, especially to female artists, 
because of her wide recognition of skills and gained admittance to academies 
that were closed to her sex.&nbsp; Her plethora of work ranges from history 
paintings to landscapes.&nbsp; But, the majority of her work were beautifully 
colored portraits of the most prominent aristocrats and royalty.&nbsp; Her 
unique and exceptional talent made her one of the most sought out painters of 
her time.&nbsp; She was blessed with a natural ability that people adored, even 
centuries later.</P>

</B>This website contains significant information of Vigée-Lebrun.&nbsp; It is 
provided and researched by Jim Lane who received his degree from Ohio 
University.&nbsp; His findings displayed on the website vividly highlight why Vigée-Lebrun was such an influential person, not only during her time, but even 
up until now.&nbsp; This website is especially recommended because it shows the 
legacy Vigée-Lebrun left behind.&nbsp; This is exemplified through a statement 
saying that a male artist noted when Vigée-Lebrun's work was compared along side 
his own work, that her portrait appeared to had been done by a man, while his 
looked done by a woman.&nbsp; She took this as one of the greatest compliments, 
and this shows the fact that her timeless artwork truly overcame the 
contradiction of her gender during the time she lived.</P>

<P><B>Sheriff, Mary D.&nbsp; <I>The Exceptional Woman: 
Elizabeth Vigée-Lebrun and the Cultural Politics of Art</I>. Chicago: Chicago 
Press, 1997.<br>
</B>In <I>The Exceptional Woman,</I> Mary D. Sheriff 
uses Vigée-Lebrun's career to explore the contradictory position of female 
painters in the moral, philosophical, professional, and medical debates about 
women in eighteenth-century France.&nbsp; Sheriff pays particular attention to 
painted and textual self-portraits.&nbsp; Sheriff also shows how Vigée-Lebrun's 
images and memoirs undermined the assumptions about women and the confining 
restraints imposed on women.&nbsp; Engaging&nbsp; modern feminism and art 
criticism, Sheriff's interpretations of Vigée-Lebrun's paintings challenge us to 
rethink the work and the world of this controversial woman artist.</P>

<I>Memoirs of Madame Vigée-Lebrun</I>.&nbsp; George Braziller, 1989.<br>
</B>Unfortunately, this is a reprint of the 1903 
translated version of Vigée Lebrun's <I>Souvenirs de Madame Vigée Le 
Brun</I>.&nbsp; This first-hand account, written later in life, appeared in 
three volumes.&nbsp; The first in volume was written in 1835, and the others 
were written in 1837.&nbsp; In the content, it displays that Lebrun was a fine 
artist primarily known as painter to Marie Antoinette and for having been 
elected to the French Academy.&nbsp; Her <I>Souvenirs</I> was reprinted, in two 
volumes, in 1869.&nbsp; Because the reprint and translation was not the best one 
for an English audience, in 1989 Strachey and Russell came out with this book 
that was one volume that included more illustrations than the 
originals.&nbsp; </P>

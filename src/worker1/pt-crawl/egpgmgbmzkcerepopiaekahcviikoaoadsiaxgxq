But as the colorful flower leis were draped over a towering golden statue of the warrior king on Friday, the people of the state remained divided over whether the federal government should grant recognition to Hawaii's native people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="697">The issue was dealt what may turn out to be a fatal blow by the Senate on Thursday, when a bill giving Native Hawaiians the same legal standing as American Indians and Native Alaskans failed to get the 60 votes required to bring it to the floor for debate. The tally was 56 to 41, with Republicans casting all 41 no votes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="389" data-total-count="1086">It has been nearly six years since Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii, first introduced the measure popularly known in the islands as the Akaka bill. Although modified since its first introduction in July 2000, the bill, titled the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, proposes to create a governing body for the estimated 400,000 Native Hawaiians in the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="1336">The new governing body would have the power to negotiate with the federal and state authorities over the disposition of thousands of acres of land and other resources taken by the United States when the federal government annexed the islands in 1898.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="3619">Richard Rowland of the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii said a poll conducted by his organization last month found that nearly 70 percent of more than 21,000 Hawaii residents contacted by telephone said they would support allowing people in the state to vote on the federal recognition bill before Congress considered it.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="117" data-total-count="3736" id="story-continues-4">Mr. Rowland said the poll "told us that our elected officials are completely out of touch with their constituencies."</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="3944">"It just affirmed the fact that the people want to vote on it," he said. "We found that two out of three residents of Hawaii are opposed to the Akaka bill, period. And last year we got almost the same thing."</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="4037">Mr. Rowland said he had not spoken to Mr. Akaka about putting the measure before the people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="4208">"It never crossed my mind," he said. "I think he's frozen in concrete in his approach. I think that no matter what happens, he's wedded to this idea, the Akaka bill idea."</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="109" data-total-count="4317">Mr. Akaka is meeting with his supporters to determine what to do next, said his spokeswoman, Donna Dela Cruz.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="4599">"Senator Akaka was more energized this week after the vote, which caught a lot of people by surprise," she said, adding that Mr. Akaka was thrilled to have a chance to explain the bill to his Senate colleagues. "It was a victory for him just to talk about this issue on the floor."</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="532" data-total-count="5131">Mr. Akaka had prepared to do that last fall, after lawmakers returned to Washington from their August break, but legislation providing aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina pushed discussion of the Hawaiian recognition bill to the side. Concerns were raised by the Bush administration at the time over the need to include language protecting military installations in Hawaii and prohibiting casino gambling. The bill was  amended so that the Pentagon would not face negotiations over its land and to prohibit gambling in the islands.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="5275">The sides also disagree about whether the bill is likely to be revived, either this session or next, when the new Congress convenes in January.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="5555">Meanwhile, on Friday, the golden statue of King Kamehameha I across the street from Iolani Palace, the nation's only royal residence, was draped with dozens of giant leis to mark the birthday of the king, the legendary monarch who united the Hawaiian Islands in the early 1800's.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="135" data-total-count="5690">Kamehameha Day each year is observed on June 11, although since that falls on a Sunday this year, the official state holiday is Monday.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">

<H2>Flick (2000)</H2>

<P>D: Fintan Connolly<BR>
S: David Murray, Isabelle Menke</P>

<P>Moody no-budget Irish feature film following the adventures of a disaffected
middle-class white small time Dublin drug dealer (David Murray) who finds
himself in over his head when his shortsighted partner (David Wilmot) hooks
them up with some real gangsters. Amid wanderings through Dublin night clubs
and other city hot spots for the casual drug trade, he meets a sexy German
girl (Isabelle Menke) with whom he strikes up a relationship which might
prove to be his redemption, if he survives the increasing attentions of
both the police and the Dublin underworld. For a film shot more or less
ad hoc on the streets of Dublin by writer/director Fintan Connolly (mostly
known for documentary work) with a minimum of technological sophistication,
<I>Flick</I> isn't half bad. It has a distinctive tone which is matched
by David Murray's smoothly self-involved performance as the central character.
One comes away with a definite feeling of the brooding angst of the new
entrepreneurial opt-out class in middle class Celtic Tiger Ireland, and
though it is really so much navel-gazing on the road to a silly resolution,
it works on its own terms.</P>

<P><I>Flick</I> is arguably as morally irresponsible as many recent gangster
films including Guy Ritchie's super-hyphenated frag fests <I><A HREF="lsb.htm">Lock,
Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</A></I> and <I><A HREF="snatch.htm">Snatch</A></I>.
Certainly its hero is a largely unrepentant drug dealer whose only mistake
is being unable to see what a fool his partner is. Though he gets knocked
about quite a bit in the course of the film, the character ultimately comes
away not so much morally redeemed as hounded out of his profession by circumstance.
There is never any sense of a deeper seated urgency about the film's study
of contemporary urban crime and criminals. It is not meant to be that type
of film, of course, which is just as well given the recent <A HREF="odc.htm"><I>Ordinary
Decent Criminal</I> </A>(shot at the same time on a much larger budget with
much less satisfying results). Yet it is careful to delineate the 'good'
drug dealers from the 'bad', as our hero deals only in hash and sells to
small groups of selected hip and trendy customers, doing no one any particular
harm, as it were. Meanwhile the heavies are archetypal psycho-killer maniacs
with dealings in the harder stuff in all senses of the word.</P>

<P>On the whole the script concentrates on action, evoking a sense of Dublin
at night that few foreign or indigenous films have attempted to capture
(no landmarks, no carefully composed and painstakingly lit shots of various
street corners and major buildings: but lots of night clubs, bars, alleys,
and, when the mood requires them, quiet backstreets). Part of the reason
for this is budget, of course, which is also why there is relatively little
dialogue during crowd scenes (the sound quality on the whole is fair to
poor). But this is also a case of working within ones limitations, and Connolly
has been clever about it rather than simply churning out a more amateurish-looking
version of a bigger-scale film. He has kept the action tightly focused on
the central character and so allows us to see the world through his (limited)
vision of the urban landscape.</P>

<P>There are one or two cringeworthy dialogue scenes though, especially
ones featuring Murray and his estranged girlfriend (which evoked widespread
unintended laughter at the screening I attended). The ending is particularly
bogus, employing hoary old Irish movie clich&eacute;s to wrap things up
which the film has otherwise been more or less careful to avoid. There are
one or two other points where the budgetary seams begin to show, such as
the long opening shot of a plane landing which seems too much like the director
trying to stretch the running time to feature length. It is not entirely
original: movies about wandering semi-remorseful low-lifes are part of a
long tradition in both European and American cinemas, but it does have the
benefit of being more or less the first Irish film of its kind and tone
arguably since Neil Jordan's <I>Angel</I> (which it vaguely resembles in
some ways). It is also interesting that the film features a drug dealer
who neither lives in a ghetto nor a palace, but spends as much time lounging
on his couch in the nice apartment he shares with his girlfriend on Dublin's
southside as he does politely meeting and greeting his customers in town.</P>

<P><I>Flick</I> is not a masterpiece, but in the manner of <I><A HREF="nov.htm">November
Afternoon</A> </I>or <I><A HREF="cheat.htm">How to Cheat in the Leaving
Certificate</A></I>, it has the merit of accomplishing what it sets out
to do. It is a modestly scaled, no-star, small crew production which works
considerably better than many of its more elaborate, higher budget equivalents.</P>

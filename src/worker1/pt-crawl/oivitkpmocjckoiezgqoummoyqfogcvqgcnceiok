<p><a name="bio">Anne Boleyn's in</a>volvement with King Henry VIII of England
helped to change the course of history.&nbsp; Such a remarkable role would not
have been foreseen at her birth.&nbsp; Historians can only conjecture that she
was born between 1501 and 1509, with a likely date of 1507. Her father, Thomas Boleyn, was a member of the Privy Council and
an important diplomat who served his king. It was Thomas' travels to France that earned
Anne, and her older sister Mary, a place at French court. Both of them spent time as
lady's maids to royal members of the French court. </p>

<p>Upon her return to England, her father had arranged for her to marry James Butler. This
would have been politically advantageous to her father as well as King Henry VIII. The
wedding never took place, however, due to Anne's attraction to Lord James Percy.
Anne was sent back to her father's native country of Ireland, only to be summoned back
in 1522 to
the English court as a lady in waiting to Henry's first wife, <a href="oldpgs/ocathyaragon.html">Queen
Catherine</a>.</p>

<p>While serving Catherine in about 1526, Anne caught the eye of King Henry, who
had already had an affair with her older sister Mary.&nbsp; Anne long resisted
Henry's pressure to become his mistress, preferring marriage.&nbsp; His desire
for Anne increased his efforts to secure an annulment from his marriage to
Catherine of Aragon. During their eighteen-year
marriage, Catherine had failed to
give Henry a male heir to the throne of England, only&nbsp; producing a daughter, Mary.
Henry wanted a male heir to prevent a civil war, like the Wars of the Roses
which his father, Henry VII had won to become king.&nbsp; So in 1527 Henry asked
the pope for an annulment of his marriage, similar to other annulments the pope
had granted kings and princes.&nbsp; Catherine on the
other hand had many sympathizers and supporters, including her nephew, Emperor
Charles V, whose armies threatened the pope in Rome.&nbsp; After theologians
argued that the pope lacked freedom to make a decision on the matter,&nbsp; in January
1533, Henry secretly wed Anne who was already pregnant with the
couple's first child Elizabeth.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Three months
before Henry and Catherine's marriage was officially declared invalid by the
Archbishop of Canterbury. Anne was only twenty-six years old and
Henry was forty-two. Still, Anne was an educated and independent woman. Many have compared her and
the recently deceased Diana, Princess of Wales (see below). While many
Roman Catholics
despised her, many Protestant Reformers hailed Anne and praised her. Anne's
protection helped the
Protestants further their cause.&nbsp; Henry crowned her queen on June 1,
1533.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a result of his marriage problems, Henry and his Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy in 1534, which proclaimed the king as head of the Church of England.&nbsp;
Although Henry VIII himself was a religious conservative, England slowly began
to create the branch of Christianity known as Anglicanism, which often considers
itself to have taken a middle road between Luther's and Calvin's Protestantism
and Roman Catholicism.&nbsp; It also closely involved Parliament in the key
decisions, including the Act of Succession, allowing representatives of the
people a vital role in choosing the next dynastic monarch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This change did not help Anne, though, since after three years of marriage
she had not provided a male heir (after two stillbirths).&nbsp; Henry began to be
disenchanted with Anne and took on another mistress, Jane Seymour. The ex-queen
Catherine had also died on January 7, 1536.&nbsp; On May 2, the king had Anne
arrested.&nbsp; The king made a barrage of charges made against Anne, including that
she was a witch (<a href="#witch">see below</a>).</p>

<p>Henry devised a plot with the assistance of Thomas Cromwell. Anne was
charged with adultery, including an incestuous relationship with her brother
George. Many researchers have argued, however, that these charges were false.
Her alleged suitors confessed to the charges under torture, leaving doubt that Anne was
really guilty. The charges of adultery brought against Anne were merely an
excuse to have Anne executed so that Henry would be free to marry Jane Seymour.
She was executed primarily because she did not produce a surviving male heir to the
throne. </p>

<p> Despite Anne's attempt to persuade the court to give her a fair trial, she
was found guilty, her marriage dissolved and her daughter Elizabeth a bastard.. Anne Boleyn was beheaded on May 19, 1536. Henry married Jane Seymour soon
following, and never spoke of Anne ever again. </p>

<p align="left">Jane Seymour gave Henry his long-desired male heir, but she died
after childbirth.&nbsp; Henry would go on and marry three other women: Anne of Cleves,
Anne's cousin Katherine Howard, and Katherine Parr, who outlived Henry.&nbsp;
Jane's son reigned a few years as King Edward VI, but he died young.&nbsp;
Catherine's daughter Mary became queen, and England did not suffer a serious
civil war as Henry had feared.&nbsp; But <a href="marytudor.html">Queen Mary</a>
gained a notorious reputation and also died after a few years.&nbsp; So, Anne's daughter Elizabeth
inherited the throne to become the great <a href="oldpgs/oelizabeth.html"> Queen Elizabeth I</a>,
who, ironically, was a more successful ruler than most monarchs, male or female.<br>

<p><b>&quot;<a name="witch">Anne Boleyn as a Witch</a>,&quot; by Brian A.
Pavlac.</b></p>

<p>Anne Boleyn's reputation for being a witch has been unfairly held against
her.&nbsp; In trying to find grounds to incriminate her, King Henry claimed that
she had used witchcraft to make him fall in
love with her.&nbsp; He also said he feared that she would harm him with
poison -- a common accusation against witches.&nbsp; Her enemies also repeated
charges of physical deformity, such as that she was too tall, had a sixth finger
(which was probably just an extra fingernail), and had strange warts and growths
on her body that could have been witch's teats.&nbsp; The allegedly deformed
male fetus of her last birth in 1536 was also used against her.&nbsp; While raised as an
issue at first, witchcraft did not end up among the charges used by the court which found her guilty of treason in conspiracy with her
alleged lovers (including her brother).&nbsp; That the first English law against witchcraft was passed just a
few years after her trial, in 1542, reflects the growing fears about witches in
England, in which Anne was also ensnared.&nbsp; On Anne and witchcraft, see especially the book
by <a href="#warnicke"> Warnicke</a>.&nbsp; For more on witches see <a href="witch/index.html">The Witch
Hunts (1400-1800)</a>.</p>

<p><b>&quot;<a name="prindi">Parallels of Anne Boleyn and Princess Di</a>:&nbsp;
Disposable Royal Wives&quot; by Brian A. Pavlac.</b></p>

<p>The most obvious parallel between Queen Anne (b.1507?-d.1536) and Princess Diana
(b. 1961-d.1997) is that both were cast
aside, when the monarchy no longer needed them.&nbsp; But how these women of
minor nobility became and lived as royal wives was very different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>King Henry VIII at first had a true passion for Anne, who, surprisingly, was
not eager to fall into the king's bed.&nbsp; Her reputation for virginity,
unlike her older sister whose sexual activity was less pure, made her a suitable
breeding candidate for royal offspring.&nbsp; Henry Tudor's tempting her with
marriage eventually overcame her resistance.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the scandal
created by his marrying her and annulling his first marriage with Catherine of
Aragon did not help Anne's popularity.&nbsp; Many with Roman Catholic sympathies
blamed her for the break with the papacy. And Anne had
no real public role, being only perceived as a sexual partner and a breeder--as
was typical of the 16th Century.&nbsp; The English people had little contact
with or love for her (except for
a few Protestant reformers).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anne's failure to bear an heir doomed
her.&nbsp; When Henry turned to another (Jane Seymour) for sex and breeding, he
needed to get rid of Anne as quickly and conveniently as possible.&nbsp;
Tortured conspirators and bribed or intimidated witnesses before a kangaroo
court expedited her execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the media manufactured a romance, Charles and Di never shared much
passion.&nbsp; Prince Charles Windsor seems to have used Lady Diana Spencer's
virtue of virginity as the main criteria for choosing her as a spouse (and like
Anne, Di had an older sister, Sarah, who had been involved with the prince, but
lacked the virtuous reputation).&nbsp; Charles, for his own reasons,
clearly never desired her as a sexual partner, turning to his old flame,
Camilla.&nbsp; Charles would hardly have been able to end the marriage, though,
since Diana was protected in her position by tradition, church law, and the
Queen's conservative attitudes on family.&nbsp; Most important, modern media had
granted her a unique public status as a
popular royal figure comparable to, if not surpassing, Charles and even Queen
Elizabeth II.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And Princess Di did fulfill her role as a breeder, begetting the
&quot;heir and the spare.&quot;&nbsp; But she refused to put up with a sham
marriage, and revealed her unhappiness to the sympathetic media, leading to a
formal marital separation.&nbsp; Because of the exposure of Di's own marital infidelity,
however, she embarrassed the monarchy.&nbsp; Although she
lost some public sympathy, her charm and popularity still&nbsp; protected her.&nbsp;
And, fortunately, by the late 20th Century divorce was a more acceptable means
of dumping adulterous royal wives than execution.&nbsp; The monarchy eventually
agreed to the end of the marriage in 1996.&nbsp; Her sudden and surprising death
in 1997 preserved her in public memory as a life cut short.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the idea of the execution method has been resurrected with
posthumous publications (by her butler among others) of Diana's alleged fear
that she would be murdered to make way for Charles to legitimately
remarry.&nbsp; Thus the historical connection between Princess Di and Queen Anne
Boleyn has become more noticeable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Albert, Marvin H. <i>The Divorce</i>. New York, N.Y.: Simon Shuster, 1965.</b><br>
Albert begins this book by examining the life of Henry VIII and his first wife
Catherine of Spain. The second portion of the book contains a major section dedicated to
Anne Boleyn. Boleyn is referred to as the &quot;other woman.&quot; The book also examines
the constant meddling by Cardinal Wolsey into both Anne's and Henry's lives. Also,
mentioned is how Henry's wish to divorce his first wife Catherine, was refused by Pope
Clement and how this situation would be a key factor in England's break from the Catholic
Church. The book also discusses the enemies Henry made by his divorce from Catherine and
the large number of supporters she would acquire. Anne Boleyn's downfall and the
accusations, including one of an incestuous relationship with her brother George, made
against her, are all discussed. This chapter is appropriately entitled, 'Sword for a
slender neck.' The work includes an index and bibliography to assist in further research
of Anne Boleyn and also providing evidence and support to Albert's work. Included are also
copies of handwritten letters from Catherine to Henry, and vice versa.</p>

<p><b>Bowle, John. <i>Henry VIII</i>. Boston, MA: Little, Brown and Company.
1964</b>.<br>
Although the book primarily concerns itself with the life of Henry VIII, it does not
fail to discuss and analyze the relationship between Henry and Anne Boleyn. It discusses
Henry's actions appointing Anne to the position of Marchioness of Pembroke, and the large
endowment she would receive with that title. After Anne Boleyn was married to Henry and
because she was the new Queen of England, she would face a great deal of unpopularity
especially from the peasants. They claimed that since Anne came in as Queen, the crops had
been terrible, and unemployment and inflation were getting worse (Bowle,176). Many had
perceived her as arrogant and cruel. The power that Anne held over Henry was also
mentioned. This power is what the author would claim to be his ruination. Henry's claims
that he had been seduced by witchcraft and that he was free to take another wife, was a
primary reason discussed as to why Henry would ultimately have his wife tried with
adultery and treason. This book is a good work written on the life of Henry VIII, but it
also provides the reader with some valuable insight on the life of Anne Boleyn. The book
includes an index to assist the reader in finding specific people and events in
Henry's
life as well as a valuable and extensive lineage chart of the royalty of Europe during

<p><b>Bruce, Marie Louise. <i>Anne Boleyn</i>. New York, N.Y.: Coward, McCann, and Geoghegan,
Inc., 1972<br>
</b>Bruce provides the reader with an in depth, thorough examination of Anne
Boleyn's life.
Anne was given contact to the Royal Court through her father, Thomas Boleyn, one of six of
Henry VII's Esquires. When Henry VII died, Thomas held on to his position in the royal
household. Anne received an education in France and as the author points out, &quot;her
education in France was influenced by two opposing attitudes in the King's Court, a
devout, almost monastic religious piety, and a rampant eroticism disguised by the gallant
conventions of 'courtly love'.&quot; Both attitudes were to have profound influence on
Anne's character and play a significant role in Anne's life. Upon her return from France,
Anne would enjoy a life in the court of Henry VIII and she was to wed James Butler as part
of an arrangement made by her father as well as the King, himself. The only problem was
that she had eyes for another man, Lord James Percy. An affair would soon ensue and Anne
would be exiled to Ireland, home country of her father. Anne, however, would eventually
return to England, becoming maid of honor to Queen Catherine, Henry's first wife. As a
result of closer contact to the King, it was said that Anne engaged in an affair with poet
and consultant to the King, Thomas Wyatt, as well as the King himself. When Catherine did
not produce a male heir to the throne, Henry sought a divorce from his wife of eighteen
years and to marry Anne. Anne would become Queen, producing only one surviving child,
Elizabeth. Anne would now also face a threat from the King's new mistress, Jane Seymour.
The King along with Sir Thomas Cromwell plotted a way to dispose of Anne. Anne would be
accused and found guilty of adultery, as well as treason. Anne would be held prisoner and
given an unjust trial and ultimately beheaded. Bruce includes an extensive section of many
useful notes and sources as well as an index, easily helping to further research on Anne
Boleyn. There is no doubt of the legitimacy of Bruce's work.</p>

</b>An entertaining article, although it fails to significantly mention Anne Boleyn. It
does however, use her name to compare the scandal surrounding her marriage to Henry VIII
and her death to many other scandals (especially those of sexual nature) to those of the
later royal families of England. It refers to those scandals surrounding Queen Victoria,
Princess Diana and Prince Charles. The article is used to entertain rather to provide any

Although the magazine in which this article was found is predominately a magazine of
book reviews, Dowling presents her critique in the form of a debate. She debates the work
of Retha Warnicke, <u>The Fall of Anne Boleyn</u>. Dowling challenges Warnicke's statement
regarding why Henry VIII chose to dispose of Anne Boleyn. Warnicke. Warnicke claims it was
based on witchcraft, however, Dowling feels she fails to provide enough evidence to
support this theory. Dowling also feels that the role Anne played in religion was not
adequately presented. This was an informative article presenting the sides of the story,
which Warnicke fails to address in her book.</p>

<p><b>Erickson, Carolly. <i>Mistress Anne</i>. New York, N.Y.: Summit Books, 1984.</b><br>
An in depth view into the life of Anne Boleyn, which pays particular attention to her
life as mistress of Henry VIII. It was important to the Boleyn family that their daughter,
marry into an influential family, that is why she was originally to wed James Butler. This
marriage would not only benefit the Boleyn family, but England and King Henry as well.
This book separates itself from other books written on Anne Boleyn's life, in that it
focuses on how Anne's relationships and status would benefit those closest to her. The
author also does not deny that Henry was infatuated with Anne but that she would also be
very beneficial by perhaps providing him with a male heir to the throne. This would
however not turn out to be true. The author also tries to present much of Anne's story in
her own words as well as the words of the people close to her. Quotations are frequently
used. There is also an interesting section dealing with the warnings that Henry gave Anne
about what his relationship to her was costing him in terms of new enemies and the loss of
friends. The book stressed that Anne was obligated to Henry. This book is useful in
examining the purpose to which Anne served Henry and others. There are many interesting
pictures included in this book as well as a thorough bibliography and index.</p>

<p><b>Hackett, Francis. <i>Henry The Eighth</i>. New York, N.Y.: Liveright Publishing
Corporation, 1957.</b><br>
This book on Henry's life provides the reader with a specific chapter dedicated to Anne
Boleyn, as to his other five wives. This book portrays Anne as a political pawn.
Henry's
relationship to Anne was said to have bore him two or more legitimate children, Queen
Elizabeth and the Church of England. The book focuses on Anne's refusal to remain as
Henry's mistress, she wanted to be the Queen of England. The book also discusses
unpopularity surrounding Henry's divorce from Catherine. Henry as well as Anne were viewed
unfavorably many especially women. Anne was said to have to, &quot;fly from an irate mob
of thousands of women (Hackett,219).&quot; Although the information concerning Anne Boleyn
is included in a brief section dedicated to her, the information is worth reading and
provides the reader with some interesting details surrounding the relationship between
Henry and Anne.</p>

<p><b>Ives, E.W. <i>Anne Boleyn</i>. New York, N.Y.: Basil Blackwel Ltd., 1986.</b><br>
This book begins by including extensive charts of titles as well as offices of the
royal houses of Europe. Ives includes thorough information regarding the background of
Anne Boleyn as well as the relationships she formed. Ives focuses particular attention to
Anne's death and the scandal surrounding it. An interesting section Ives includes regards
Anne's taste in art and the qualities that were important to Anne. These include beauty,
chastity, virtue, and nobility. Anne's badge, the crowned falcon, is also discussed in
detail. There is also a chapter discussing the role in which Anne played during the
Reformation. Anne was said to be very fond of the Christian Humanists of France. It also
examines what importance the Bible was to her. This book portrays Anne as a victim of the
court. This would lead to her untimely death. Ives gives the reader a lengthy, yet very
informative and useful book on Anne Boleyn. There is a good index included, to easily the
assist the reader.</p>

Rex discusses how Anne Boleyn's relationship with Henry proved to be a decisive factor
in the Protestant Reformation. It was a victory for Protestantism over Catholicism.
Henry's divorce was extremely unpopular and Catherine was soon cast as the wronged wife.
Women in particular were sympathetic towards Catherine. The divorce of Catherine and the
death of Anne proved that a king could overpower the Catholic Church. Episcopal
appointments during the reign of Anne Boleyn were predominately of evangelical patronage
reformers, helping to promote and protect Protestant ways. While this book is not a book

Warnicke gives complete backgrounds on Anne Boleyn and her family including family
allegiances. The book pays particular attention to the letters written between Henry VIII
and Anne while Henry was still married. These letters would be used against Henry during
the process of trying to obtain a divorce from Catherine of Aragon. There are multiple
pictures of Anne, Henry, and his court. The book frequently mentions Anne's patronage and
supporters. There is a great deal of attention paid to the sexual allegations, as well as
the allegations of witchcraft brought against Anne. Her deformity of a sixth finger was
attributed to witchcraft. The secret commission formed to investigate these allegations
included Anne's father, Thomas Cromwell and her uncle. Four commoners, her brother, and
herself would all be ultimately executed. Henry's marriage to Anne was declared invalid
freeing him to marry, Jane Seymour. The author also includes an interesting section about
Nicholas Sander, one of the first writers to portray Anne in a very negative light.
Warnicke has given counter evidence challenging those accusations made against the
Boleyn's, especially the accusation that Anne and her brother George were involved in an
incestuous affair. There are extensive notes included at the end of the book and an index.

<p><b>Weir, Alison. <i>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</i>. New York, N.Y.: Grove

This book begins with an extensive chronology concerning all of Henry's wives. It
includes the important events surrounding them. It is very useful and informative. The
first part of the book is dedicated to Katherine of Aragon. The second part is dedicated
to Anne Boleyn. The third part concerns itself with Henry's four remaining wives: Jane
Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Katherine Parr. The chapters dealing
specifically with Anne Boleyn, examine how many Catholics despised her but was seen as a
saintly queen by Protestant writers. In their eyes she did so much to further true
religion in England, gave her protection to the followers of Luther, and produced the
great Queen Elizabeth(p144). The book examines how Anne was certainly not a saint, but
neither an adulteress or guilty of incest with her brother. It traces the Boleyn family
history. The book looks at life at the court, the relationship between Anne and Henry
while he was still married to Katherine and her relationship to poet, Thomas Wyatt. The
book includes many excerpts of correspondences between Anne and Henry. The King's
'great matter' is discussed in detail and the challenges Henry faced in getting a divorce from
Katherine. Henry's need for an alliance with Spain and to make peace with Charles V,
nephew of Katherine of Aragon is also examined. Thomas Cromwell and the allegations made
against Anne and the conspiracy that transpired are also examined. The Queen's
decapitation is described and how King Henry would never speak of her again. The author
includes a thorough bibliography and index. There is also a section of genealogical tables
of Henry's as well as all of his wives families. Interesting pictures are also included.

Boleyn.</p>

<p><b>Weir, Alison. <i>The Children of Henry VIII</i>. New York, N.Y.: Ballantine Books,
1996.<br>
</b>While this book does not concentrate its attention upon Anne Boleyn, it does give
insight into her relationship with her daughter Elizabeth and stepdaughter Mary. Anne
possessed a great hatred for Mary and had even urged Henry to have her put to death. On
the other hand, Mary refused to acknowledge Anne as the Queen. Eventually Mary would serve
as caretaker and ad a role model to Elizabeth as she was growing up. Upon Anne's death,
Elizabeth would receive the harsh and cruel treatment that Mary had. Both of
Henry's
daughters had lived in uncertainty while their brother Edward, was always secure. There is
a helpful chart of the heirs of Henry VIII. This is not a useful book on Anne Boleyn but
it does help understand the relationship she had with her children.</p>

</b>The book does not focus a great deal upon the life of Anne Boleyn. It does, however,
mention the poor relationship that existed between Anne and her stepdaughter Mary who was
only eight years younger than Anne herself. The author also discusses the allegations that
Anne had an affair with dancing man, Mark Smeaton. Mary would accuse stepsister Elizabeth
of being the product of that affair. This book does not focus upon Anne Boleyn, it only
briefly mentions her in a sporadic fashion. It is however, an interesting book in
discussing the relationship between Anne's daughter Elizabeth, and stepsister half-sister
Mary. Mary let Elizabeth stay at the court and was a kind of role model to Elizabeth
during her younger years. Elizabeth was pronounced illegitimate as Mary had also been once
before. There is only a brief index and some pictures included. There is no bibliography
to further assist the reader and to also prove legitimacy to Williamson's work.</p>

<p><b>Zagorin, Perez. &quot;Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Court of Henry VIII.&quot; <i>The
Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies</i>, Winter 1993, 113-141.<br>
</b>Although the article deals basically with Thomas Wyatt and his life at the court of
Henry VIII, it does examine the relationship between Anne Boleyn and he. The article
refers to Castiglione's <u>Book of the Courtier</u>, and also those who condemned the life
of a courtship. Not only Wyatt, but also his family was part of the Tudor family service,
and they had profited substantially in doing so. The article examines the role Wyatt
played in the Privy Council and the allegations brought against him. He faced an
allegation of having an affair with Queen Anne Boleyn. Wyatt would not only face death in
this matter but once again with the fall of Thomas Cromwell, the same man responsible for
endangering his life in the first case. Wyatt's poetry is examined and the possibility
that some of it may have been dedicated to Anne Boleyn is explored. The author concludes
that Wyatt probably, at one point loved Boleyn, but that he actually had an affair with
her is hard to believe. This article is quite long and extensive. It is a valuable piece
written about Wyatt's life and it is also useful in examining the relationship between
Wyatt and Boleyn.</p>

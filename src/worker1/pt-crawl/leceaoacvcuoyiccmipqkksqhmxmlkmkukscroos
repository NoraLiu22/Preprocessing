<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">In Chicago, the public housing of Cabrini-Green
became synonymous with poverty and crime, and although all of the high-rise
apartment buildings of the housing project have been gone for more than a decade
now, the memory of that association remains. Writer/director Minhal Baig's <i>We
Grown Now</i> doesn't attempt to reform the legacy of the housing project, which
was a systematic failure of the city's government ignoring and actively
neglecting the needs of the people, mostly Black citizens, who lived there. It
does, however, shine a light on examples of those who surely must have the
overwhelming majority of the project's residents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The characters here are ordinary people, simply
trying to make a living, put food on the table, pay the bills, and, with their
homes dismissed as a kind of urban hellscape by the powers-that-be that could
have done something about it, dream of a life beyond these concrete towers.
Baig's screenplay makes this point a little too bluntly in the film, despite the
story's simple and compassionate slice-of-life aims and outlook. Even with those
qualms, though, the film's narrative still feels authentic and tunnels through a
scandalous piece of local history to find the humanity that has been buried
underneath it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">In a way, the film's on-the-nose approach to
its themes and ideas almost works in its favor, if only because of the
characters who are the heart of the story, set in 1992. They're two young boys,
Mailk (Blake Cameron James) and Eric (Gian Knight Ramirez), who have been best
friends for as long as either can remember, since their families live a floor
apart in one of the high-rise apartment buildings. Like any kids, the two try to
have fun any way they can, such as how the opening scene follows them
&quot;junking&quot; through an empty apartment, dragging a mattress down
hallways and stairs and the long stretch of pavement, and joining other children
leaping as high as they can and landing on a pile of bedding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">They have each other, and each boy also has his
family. Malik lives with his mother Dolores (Jurnee Smollett), grandmother Anita
(S. Epatha Merkerson), and sister. Dolores works at a company in the pay
department, and being constantly faced with how everyone in the office earns
more than her, even though she's putting in longer hours to cover expenses, is
starting to take its toll. Anita remembers a time when it wasn't like this in
Cabrini-Green, after she and her late husband, who died five years ago, moved to
Chicago from Mississippi. Jobs were more readily available, and families used to
spend time together out on the community porches of each high-rise level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Meanwhile, Eric lives with his father Jason (Lil
Rel Howery), who works at a pizza place and demands that his children excel at
school, and older sister Amber (Avery Holliday), who will soon be the first
member of the family to attend college. Eric's mother died recently, and the
still-grieving kid has become cynical and doubtful well-beyond his years as a
result.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">There's good reason for that, too, apart from
such a devastating loss. The boys live here, after all, and the death of a boy
their age or thereabouts, killed by stray gunfire while walking with his mother,
puts the entire neighborhood on police-mandated lockdown. Nothing like that is
depicted in the film, and indeed, Baig takes it a step further.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Outside of the current safety of their
apartments, Malik and Eric only see other children, if anyone at all after the
police order, because that—not gangs or drugs or violence—is the sole focus
of their lives, while ID checks and random police searches are the only thing
disrupting the domestic routine of their lives. The notion of a boy they knew
dying is so outside their comprehension that it's only until the funeral that
Malik really starts thinking in specific terms of one day living somewhere other
than this place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Those thoughts are portrayed both as fantasy
and in more tangible ways. Lying on mattresses in that abandoned apartment, the
boys can sometimes imagine seeing through the cracks of the concrete ceiling and
becoming surrounded by stars, and Malik begins seeing the movement of light and
shadow from the windows of his bedroom as akin to watching the landscape pass on
a train. More practically, the kids play hooky from school one day, after being
stuck in the routine of only traveling to and from school during the lockdown,
and head downtown. There, they're free to ride trains and buses, watch people go
about their everyday lives, and visit an art museum, where a painting of the
racially segregated South and the Great Migration North gets Malik thinking
about moving more than before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Baig tells this story with such visual clarity
and narrative simplicity that the gradual increase in characters explaining
these notions does become a bit distracting (It's especially jarring from the
kids, who talk about religious skepticism with the same ease as they do which
Chicago basketball player of the moment is the best). The strength of the film
is in its everyday, observational style, bolstered by the naturalistic
performances (James and Ramirez are wholly believable, and Smollett brings a
palpable, wearied determination to her character). The laying bare of the
story's thematic intentions, then, is redundant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Even so, <i>We Grown Now</i> does possess that
inherent potency of its storytelling and filmmaking. Like its young protagonists
calling out that they matter to anyone who will or refuses to hear, the film
shows us that the people of Cabrini-Green did matter and, at the time, should
have mattered more than the neighborhood's reputation.</font>

class="article-text">Some say Congress is a lot <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4269362-turner-speakership-chaos-congress-high-school/">like high school</a> — but who lawmakers vote with isn't necessarily who they sit with in the cafeteria. We were interested in whether members’ formal ideological caucus affiliations matched up with how they actually voted. Is every member of the Problem Solvers Caucus actually voting to advance bipartisan legislation? (Spoiler alert: No.) Do members of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition actually break with their party to side more often with Republicans? (Spoiler alert: Yes.) </br></br>A new 538 analysis of voting data reveals that while many members’ formal caucus affiliations matched up pretty well with their voting behaviors, some did not. We analyzed every House floor vote from the first year of the 118th Congress (2023) and applied an algorithm to divide representatives into eight clusters based on similarities in their voting records, using eight official ideological congressional caucuses as a comparison. We then dug into what these clusters say about which issues and votes set members apart, and how these divides fell along the lines of ideology, tenure, district partisanship and more. (See the <a href=#methodology>methodology</a> below for more details.) </br></br>We called these clusters “quiet caucuses” to reflect that they’re the unspoken voting cohorts that members align with, regardless of their declared affiliations or how they say they plan to legislate. </br></br>No matter how we tweaked the parameters, the algorithm produced five Republican clusters and three Democratic clusters, reflecting more division among the GOP conference than among the Democrats. And by including every floor vote in this analysis, from passage of major legislation to doomed “messaging” amendments that were defeated by 60-point margins, our analysis found that some of the biggest differences among Republicans were on messaging. </br></br>We’ve laid out these clusters in the interactive below, with each dot representing a member, color-coded by their formal caucus affiliations and sorted by their voting clusters. Below that, we’ve included detailed explanations for each cluster, along with key stats that help explain how members in that cluster differ from their colleagues. And finally, you can see how clusters varied in their support for, say, bipartisan amendments, passage of bills or adoption of rules, as we dig into how members in each cluster voted on various vote types in 2023. </br></br>Scroll down to read more about these “quiet caucuses” and explore how representatives’ words and voting records don’t always align in the ways you might expect. You can also <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/quiet-caucus-2024">download the data</a> and play with it yourself.</p></div><div class="overflow"><div class="container"

That’s notable given that it’s the second-most conservative group in the House. </br></br>The 55 members in this cluster are deep-red conservatives who, along with the <strong>Far-Right Obstructionists</strong> cluster, often broke with the rest of their party in their opposition to government spending bills. Of those who voted, less than 30 percent of members in this cluster supported <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023513">each</a> of <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023658">two</a> short-term funding extensions last fall, and only <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024102">15 percent</a> supported the final funding package last month. These two groups have also pushed the party posture to the right by largely voting in favor of messaging amendments offered by the <strong>Far-Right Obstructionists</strong> that put forth libertarian priorities, such as <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2023/09/28/house-amendment-would-end-fulbright-other-exchange-programs">stripping funding from international aid programs</a> and <a href="https://roy.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-roy-and-greene-introduce-amendment-put-kids-and-families-first-education">promoting school choice policies</a>. In a notable recent example, 81 percent of the <strong>Far-Right Establishment</strong> cluster opposed <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024151">this month’s Ukraine aid package</a>, compared to around a quarter of members across all three of the more moderate clusters.</br></br>A look at this group’s impressive roster shows us just how far right the GOP’s power center currently sits: In addition to being the largest of the party’s clusters, the overwhelming majority of House GOP leaders are a part of this group, including the entire floor leadership team — Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler — and seven committee chairs. Speaker Mike Johnson’s voting record would also align him most closely with this cluster.<a data-number=2 class=footnote-number tabindex=0 aria-label='Footnote 2. Select to expand footnote.'>2</a><span class='footnote-text'>Mike Johnson was not assigned a cluster in our analysis due to insufficient vote data, because speakers do not typically vote on the floor. Our analysis of the votes he did take before becoming speaker shows that he voted most closely with members of this cluster, according to agreement scores.</span class='footnote-text'> Also here are the heads of the major policy-setting arms of the party, House Republican Policy Committee Chair Gary Palmer and Rep. Kevin Hern, the head of the wide-ranging <span class=study>Republican Study Committee</span>. </br></br>While most of the hardline <span class=freedom>Freedom Caucus</span> landed in the <strong>Far-Right Obstructionists</strong> cluster, eight more landed here.

These two groups have also pushed the party posture to the right by largely voting in favor of messaging amendments offered by the <strong>Far-Right Obstructionists</strong> that put forth libertarian priorities, such as <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2023/09/28/house-amendment-would-end-fulbright-other-exchange-programs">stripping funding from international aid programs</a> and <a href="https://roy.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-roy-and-greene-introduce-amendment-put-kids-and-families-first-education">promoting school choice policies</a>. In a notable recent example, 81 percent of the <strong>Far-Right Establishment</strong> cluster opposed <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024151">this month’s Ukraine aid package</a>, compared to around a quarter of members across all three of the more moderate clusters.</br></br>A look at this group’s impressive roster shows us just how far right the GOP’s power center currently sits: In addition to being the largest of the party’s clusters, the overwhelming majority of House GOP leaders are a part of this group, including the entire floor leadership team — Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler — and seven committee chairs. Speaker Mike Johnson’s voting record would also align him most closely with this cluster.<a data-number=2 class=footnote-number tabindex=0 aria-label='Footnote 2. Select to expand footnote.'>2</a><span class='footnote-text'>Mike Johnson was not assigned a cluster in our analysis due to insufficient vote data, because speakers do not typically vote on the floor. Our analysis of the votes he did take before becoming speaker shows that he voted most closely with members of this cluster, according to agreement scores.</span class='footnote-text'> Also here are the heads of the major policy-setting arms of the party, House Republican Policy Committee Chair Gary Palmer and Rep. Kevin Hern, the head of the wide-ranging <span class=study>Republican Study Committee</span>. </br></br>While most of the hardline <span class=freedom>Freedom Caucus</span> landed in the <strong>Far-Right Obstructionists</strong> cluster, eight more landed here. This group includes a contingent of early Freedom Caucus members like Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais, who, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/29/house-republican-freedom-caucus-challenges-00023071">in 2022, called for</a> the caucus to “​​push our ideas in a civil manner.” There are also a few <em>former</em> caucus members in this group, like <a href="https://gazette.com/government/doug-lamborn-health-care-bill-s-failure-a-setback-not/article_03417e37-4c83-5907-b2de-7f99ad2e4b55.html">Rep.

Appropriately, this cluster diverged from its hardline colleagues in its willingness to take yes for an answer: Outside of critical spending bills, most members joined the rest of the party to support other bipartisan measures like the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023364">five-year Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill</a> and <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023708">a package</a> to <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/e-and-c-ways-and-means-ed-and-the-workforce-leaders-celebrate-passage-of-bipartisan-bill-to-lower-health-care-costs-and-increase-transparency">lower health care costs</a>.</p><div class="caucus-membership">Official Caucus Membership<div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="progressive" data-party="D"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">Congressional Progressive Caucus<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="new_dems" data-party="D"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">New Democrat Coalition<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="blue_dogs" data-party="D"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">Blue Dog Coalition<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="problem_solvers" data-party="All"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">Problem Solvers Caucus<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="RMSP" data-party="R"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">Republican Main Street Partnership<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="governance" data-party="R"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">Republican Governance Group<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="study" data-party="R"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">Republican Study Committee<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="freedom" data-party="R"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">Freedom Caucus<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div><div class="caucus-group" data-caucus="none" data-party="All"> <div class="caucus-size">00</div><div class="caucus-info">None<div class="caucus-viz"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cluster-explanation" id="explanation-3" data-cluster="3"><h3>Old Guard Republicans</h3><div class="cluster-exp-content"><p class="desktop">The <strong>Old Guard Republicans</strong> cluster is the second-largest GOP cluster and lies in the ideological center of the five.

More than half (22 members) of the similarly pragmatic-minded caucus called the <span class=governance>Republican Governance Group</span> also aligns with this cluster, including the caucus’s chair, David Joyce of Ohio, who <a href="https://joyce.house.gov/posts/joyce-elected-as-chair-of-the-republican-governance-group">described the group</a> in 2022 as “hellbent on breaking through Washington’s dysfunction” to “carve out a viable path forward for effective lawmaking.” </br></br>In modern times, Congress certainly does a lot of the opposite.

Max Miller was a member of the Freedom Caucus, based on the Pew Research Center's January 2023 analysis of the group. While Miller was endorsed by the Freedom Caucus's PAC in 2022, his office told 538 on Friday that he has never been a member of the Freedom Caucus, which does not publish a formal membership list.</p></div><p class="notes"><span class="readin"><strong>Methodology: </strong></span><span class="description">This analysis of clustering and caucus membership is based on congressional voting records of 719 votes in the first session of the 118th Congress (2023), obtained from <a href="https://voteview.com/data">VoteView</a>. We included all members who voted in at least 625 of these (i.e., missed 94 or fewer votes, or about 13 percent), even if they are no longer in office. There were 16 members serving at the end of the session who were not assigned a cluster because of insufficient data, though they were still included in the tally of caucus memberships: Gabe Amo, Cori Bush, John Carter, Emanuel Cleaver, Ruben Gallego, Chuy García, Sheila Jackson Lee, Mike Johnson, Mike Kelly, Anna Paulina Luna, Celeste Maloy, Kevin McCarthy, Jennifer McClellan, Mary Peltola, Dean Phillips and Greg Steube. We excluded non-voting members entirely from this analysis. To avoid double-counting districts, two members (David Cicilline and Chris Stewart) were excluded from the analysis because their replacements took office during the same session. (In both cases, neither these members nor their replacements voted enough times to be eligible for inclusion in the clustering analysis.) </br></br>


For voting records for a yea/nay vote, we coded a “yea” as 1, a “nay” as -1, and a “present” vote as 0. For any other type of vote (i.e., speaker election votes), a vote with the plurality was coded as 1 and a vote against the plurality as -1. On votes that a member did not participate in, we initially assigned a value of 0 to the missing vote. </br></br>


We then performed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering analysis</a> to produce eight clusters, in which the only data considered was the votes of each member of Congress. After producing the initial eight clusters and calculating their centroids, any missing votes for each member of Congress were replaced with the mean of the vote outcome of those members in the same assigned cluster who cast a vote on that particular item. We then recalculated the clusters using the actual vote data combined with the replacement approximation of missing vote data, and recalculated the centroids of these new clusters. We repeated these two steps (clustering followed by approximation of missing votes) until the resulting assignments of members to clusters no longer changed. We also repeated this process for multiple random initial centroids (i.e., seeds) to ensure that the clusters produced are representative of the various possible outcomes that could occur due to randomness of the initial centroid placements. </br></br>


To determine caucus membership, we used the official caucus websites, with the exception of the Freedom Caucus, which does not publicly confirm its membership. Instead, we used the Pew Research Center’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/01/23/freedom-caucus-likely-to-play-a-bigger-role-in-new-gop-led-house-so-who-are-they/">January 2023 analysis</a> of caucus membership, which was based on public statements and support from the Freedom Caucus-affiliated House Freedom Fund, and removed members who, based on reporting, had left or been removed from the group since that analysis was published. </br></br>


For each cluster, we calculated the averages for several metrics to produce a cluster characterization. We used the 2020 presidential margins for each House district from <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/11/14/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-2020">Daily Kos Elections</a>, which is based on the district lines that were used in the 2022 midterm elections. </br></br>


We defined each member’s length of service as the number of 2-year terms to which that member of Congress has been elected (including nonconsecutive terms). Members who are currently serving in the 118th Congress, as of April 30, were credited for the full 2-year term  ending Jan. 2, 2025. Each term is considered to begin on Jan. 3 of the year following the general election and conclude on Jan. 2 two years later, comprising 730 days of service (or 731 if the term includes a leap day). If a member of Congress served a partial term, either by being sworn in mid-term or by leaving office early, their length of service is calculated as a fraction. For example, Rep. Mike Garcia won a special election in 2020 and was sworn in on May 19, 2020. He served 229 days of the 731-day session that began on Jan. 3, 2019, and thus is credited with 0.313 terms for the 116th Congress. </br></br>


We used DW-NOMINATE scores from VoteView as a metric to estimate the ideology and “establishment” alignment of each member of Congress. Scores along the first dimension quantify a member’s ideological leanings on a traditional left-right spectrum. Scores along the second dimension have historically captured different kinds of intra-party differences, but have been used in recent years to quantify how establishment or insurgent a member is.


To analyze voting patterns on various types of amendments, we looked at how members voted on six categories of votes: Democratic amendments, Republican amendments, bipartisan amendments, rules, passage (suspension) and passage (non-suspension). Amendments were classified as Democratic, Republican or bipartisan based on whether the amendment was supported by more than half of the members voting in each party. If support for an amendment was positive among Democrats as a whole, but not among Republicans, it was counted as Democratic — and vice versa for Republican amendments. If less than half of members in both parties supported the amendment, it was classified as partisan if its support came almost entirely from one party, and bipartisan if support was about equal from both parties. Other vote types were classified using roll call vote information from the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes">House Clerk’s website</a>. </br></br>


Any analysis of support among members in one or multiple clusters on a given vote includes the share of members who voted “yea,” out of the total members voting (including any who voted “present”). </br></br>


Agreement scores were calculated as the percentage of a member’s votes (excluding votes where a member voted “present”) on which they agreed with the average vote of other members of their cluster. If the average member of the cluster voted yea on a particular vote, and the member under consideration also voted yea, that vote would be classified as an agreement, and likewise if both the average and the members’ votes were nay. If the cluster, on average, voted yea and the member voted nay, or vice versa, the vote was counted as a disagreement. For members who were not assigned a cluster because of insufficient voting data, such as Mike Johnson and Anna Paulina Luna, we used the same technique to determine how often they agreed with each cluster and find the cluster with which they had the highest agreement score.</span></p><div class="additional-credits"><p><strong>Additional credits:</strong> Story editing and project management by <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/author/kaleigh_rogers">Kaleigh Rogers</a>.

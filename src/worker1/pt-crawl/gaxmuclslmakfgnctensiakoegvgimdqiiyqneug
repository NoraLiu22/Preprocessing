                ADA Or Ardor: A Family Chronicle. By Vladimir Nabokov.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Cornell University, Vladimir Nabokov would always begin his first lecture by saying, &quot;Great novels are above all great fairy tales . . . literature does not tell the truth but makes it up.&quot; &quot;Ada,&quot; Nabokov&apos;s 15th novel, is a
                great fairy tale, a supremely original work of the imagination. Appearing two weeks after his 70th birthday, it provides further evidence that he is a peer of Kafka, Proust and Joyce, those earlier masters of totally unique universes of
                fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle&quot; (its full title) spans 100 years. It is a love story, an erotic masterpiece, a philosophical investigation into the nature of time. Almost twice as long as any previous Nabokov novel, its rich and variegated
                prose moves from the darkest to the lightest of sonorities as Nabokov sensually evokes the widest range of delights. Nabokov the lepidopterist once said that he was &quot;born a landscape painter,&quot; and he has never &quot;painted&quot;
                more luminous landscapes than in &quot;Ada.&quot; It is an extraordinarily visual book, teeming with allusions to painters and paintings, and many scenes are veritable
                <i>tableaux vivants</i> of works ranging from Beardsley&apos;s illustrations for &quot;Lysistrata&quot; to the idyllic landscapes of Monet and Prendergast. As the family chronicle to end all such chronicles, &quot;Ada&quot; is a kind of
                museum of the novel, and it employs parody to rehearse its own history.
            </p>
            <p>
                More specifically, &quot;Ada&quot; is presented as the memoir of Dr. Ivan (Van) Veen, psychologist, professor of philosophy and student of time, who chronicles his life-long love for Ada Veen. The story of the affluent and ingrown Veen family is not a
                simple one. The novel&apos;s first three chapters are difficult reading and the narrator himself addresses remarks to &quot;the reader.&quot; Two first cousins, &quot;Demon&quot; and Dan Veen, marry twin sisters, Aqua and Marina. On the
                prefatory Family Tree it appears that Aqua and Demon have produced Van (b. 1870) and that Ada (b. 1872) is the child of Dan and Marina. In fact, however, Van and Ada are the result of Demon and Marina&apos;s continuing affair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part One occupies almost half of &quot;Ada,&quot; and details Van&apos;s youth, travels and incestuous romance with Ada at Arcadian Ardis Hall, the opulent country-estate of his uncle. Part Two ends with Van forsaking Ada, following his father&apos;s
                implorations. In Part Three, after many amorous vicissitudes, Ada gets married and Van loses her for 17 years, finally regaining her in 1922 in Part Four, while he is working on his book, &quot;The Texture of Time.&quot; Part Five, a kind
                of coda, finds them together, with a small entourage, celebrating Van&apos;s 97th birthday and the virtual completion of the memoir at hand, which is to be published posthumously.
            </p>
            <p>
                Van&apos;s manuscript has been seen through the press by one of their entourage, self-effacing Ronald Oranger. He has not only assiduously indicated Van&apos;s changes in the text, but preserved the running commentaries which Van and Ada have addressed
                to one another, dramatic marginalia alternately sarcastic and loving, condescending and tender. Ada is not only Van Vee&apos;s muse, desire, tormentor and alter ego, but his severest critic and collaborator as well, sometimes even taking
                Van&apos;s place to write a page or two. Having shared so many years with him since the beginning of their love at Ardis Hall (he was 14, she 12), Ada comically assists him in his efforts to recollect and order the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to writing a memoir, philosopher Veen is trying to describe the nature of time. He incorporates in part Four 20 of the preliminary pages of &quot;The Texture of Time.&quot; Van attempts to divorce Time from tyrannic Space and thus deny the
                Future. He notes &quot;that we can not enjoy the <i>true</i> present, which is an instant of zero duration.&quot; &quot;To be eternal the Present must depend on the conscious spanning of an infinite expansure,&quot; and
                that expanse&#x2014;&quot;The flowering of the Present&quot;&#x2014;is equated with love.</p>
            <p>
                Van speaks of &quot;The direction of Time, the ardis [Greek; the point of the arrow] of Time,&quot; and Ada and the ardor of Ardis are the constants that unify past and present and deny the encroachments of &quot;the end.&quot; Working with metaphors,
                rather than mathematics, Van knows that his &quot;didactic&quot; efforts are a trap, an endless maze, and just as he is about to give up, he gets a letter from Ada saying that her husband is dead and she is on her way to rejoin him. Ardis
                restored, the present flowers and Van is able to complete &quot;The Texture of Time&quot; (1924), a great literary success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ada&apos;s return also contributes to the creation of &quot;Ada,&quot; since Van does not undertake his memoirs until 1957. The entire book can be said to spiral out of Part Four, and the &quot;earlier work,&quot; &quot;The Texture of Time.&quot; As Part
                Four concludes, Ada sympathizes with Van&apos;s efforts: &quot;We can never know Time. Our senses are simply not meant to perceive it. It is like&#x2014;.&quot; Part Four ends with Ada in mid-sentence, and her phrase &quot;It is like&#x2014;&quot;
                points back to the novel&apos;s first page, for the similes and metaphors she is about to grope for comprise the novel&apos;s first 532 pages, a considerably extended metaphor, a vast and enchanting fantasia. If &quot;Ada&quot; is a &quot;philosophical
                novel&quot; (and Van uses those qualifying quotation marks when thus describing his first book, &quot;Letters from Terra&quot;), it is one in which the novelist has found an esthetic form and poetic equivalent for the &quot;philosophy,&quot;
                a correlative for Ardis&apos;s eternal realm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of &quot;Ada&quot; is set in an imaginary world. Imaginary lands extend from five of Nabokov&apos;s untranslated Russian works (1924-1940) to Padukgrad in &quot;Bend Sinister&quot; (1947) to Zembla in &quot;Pale Fire&quot; (1962), reaching an apotheosis
                in &quot;Ada,&quot; where the entire universe has been re-imagined, including Space-Time. Go dis called &quot;Log&quot; in &quot;Ada,&quot; and the universe consists of two sibling planets, &quot;Antiterra&quot; (or &quot;Demonia&quot;),
                on which the action takes place, and &quot;Terra,&quot; the subject of endless debate. Only deranged minds accept the notion of Terra, and when in her madness Aqua Veen envisages a &quot;minor hymnist&apos;s paradise,&quot; her delusions
                depict life in our modern cities. A distorted version of Van Veen&apos;s first book, the speculative and totally ignored &quot;Letters from Terra&quot; (1891) is 50 years later (Part Five) made into a horrific science- fiction farce that
                rehearses the first half of 20th-century history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Van, whose favorite sport is dancing on his hands, extends his stunt and turns time upside down. Antiterra follows &quot;Veen&apos;s Time,&quot; while on &quot;Terra the Fair&quot; some objective order of time prevails. Except for certain literary matters,
                there is a variable gap of from 50 to 100 years between Antiterra and Terra, the &quot;distortive glass,&quot; and in the first three parts of &quot;Ada&quot; Nabokov has neatly folded back time. Details from life on Terra are anachronistically
                refracted in another &quot;nineteenth century&quot; on Antiterra. Dates as we know them are meaningless; although Nabakov does not put them in quotation marks, the reader would be well- advised to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                These details are drawn from Terra&apos;s future, as well as its earlier periods. The characters in &quot;Ada&quot; thus casually utilize such conveniences as &quot;hydrograms&quot; and &quot;Jiggers&quot; (flying carpets). Familiar machines have different
                names (&quot;Sonorolas&quot; [radios]), and the glories of recent periods on Terra are enjoyed in Antiterra&apos;s &quot;nineteenth century,&quot; including Cokes, bikinis, movies, Proust, Joyce and comic strips.
            </p>
            <p>
                This description makes &quot;Ada&quot; sound like science fiction, and in part it is. Van&apos;s first book is S.F., appropriately, since Nabokov himself has written several works of &quot;physics fiction,&quot; as Van Veen prefers to call his &quot;Letters
                from Terra,&quot; to distinguish it from trashy space-operas and &quot;topical utopias.&quot; Antiterra&apos;s startling geographic boundaries are the result of Nabokov&apos;s unique version of the &quot;What if&#x2014;?&quot; mode of
                S.F.&#x2014;the story that is based on an imaginary and dramatic reversal of history.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several such turns in &quot;Ada.&quot; Paramount is the fact that on Antiterra the Tartars were not defeated at the bale of Kulikova in 1380, and their great empire did not disintegrate in the next century. Instead, hordes of Russians have been
                driven into North America, or &quot;Estoty,&quot; an American province extending from the Arctic circle to the U.S. proper. Their descendants now live happily throughout the united &quot;Amerussia&quot; governed by Abraham Milton. Britain&apos;s
                annexation of France in 1815 spurred French immigration to the United States, and punning place names reflect Nabokov&apos;s melting-pot: Le Bras d&apos;Or, Akapulkovo, Goluba University [Columbia plus the Russian word for &quot;pigeon&quot;],
                and elegant New Chesire [Catskills].
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Ada&apos;s&quot; most intricate anachronisms are linguistic and literary. Given their circumstances, the characters are quite naturally trilingual; faithful to verisimilitude, Nabokov includes some Russian and French. The former is transinterated
                and usually translated, the latter is not translated. But the French affords no problem, since there is not much more of it than one would find in the average, run-of-the-mill Tolstoy novel. Just as Russian literature is collectively one
                of the heroes of &quot;The Gift&quot; (1937), Nabokov&apos;s last Russian novel, so too is Count Tolstoy one of the heroes of &quot;Ada&quot; and Nabokov pays him abundant tribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tolstoy appears frequently in the text and texture of &quot;Ada,&quot; as Nabokov celebrates through parody the old master&apos;s novelistic plenitude, his style and technique. Van&apos;s first sentence is a quotation of the famous beginning of &quot;Anna
                Karenina,&quot; and the opening pages of &quot;Ada&quot; are a parodic extension of Tolstoy&apos;s first page. The allusions to Tolstoy&apos;s &quot;Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth&quot; made by Van on the first and last pages of &quot;Ada&quot;
                are of no small significance. Like Tolstoy&apos;s trilogy, &quot;Ada&quot; is cast as an autobiographical novel. Van&apos;s short chapters, the leisurely pace of his narrative, and many of the lovingly described scenic details mimic Tolstoy&apos;s
                manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tolstoy looked forward to narrating &quot;the second and happier half of my youth,&quot; but he never wrote the last volume of his projected tetralogy. Part One of &quot;Ada,&quot; in itself book-length, is by way of Nabokov&apos;s completion of Tolstoy&apos;s
                reminiscences. As such, it is the last 19th-century Russian novel, just as the entire book is the first and only classic of &quot;Amerussian&quot; literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of an early chapter, &quot;Ada and Van met in the passage, and would have kissed at some earlier stage of the Novel&apos;s Evolution in the History of Literature.&quot; Nabokov confronts nothing less than that evolution, and &quot;Ada,&quot;
                a self-contained survey course suggests that to write a novel today after the example of the great 19th-century realists is as anachronistic as finding characters reading Joyce in &quot;1870,&quot; or driving away from a Chekhovian duel
                scene in a shiny new convertible (as happens at Ardis).
            </p>
            <p>
                Like those other great protean modernists, Joyce and Picasso, Nabokov uses parody to re-investigate the fundamental problems of this art. While Van in the early chapters is waiting to be born, so too is the great age of the novel. Van&apos;s concluding
                &quot;blurb&quot; notes that &quot;the story proceeds at a spanking pace,&quot; but the pace is sometimes purposefully slow, befitting an infancy of sorts, as Van plots time&apos;s texture and parodies the realist&apos;s efforts to limn
                &quot;reality.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                Van ponders &quot;Empty formulas befitting the solemn novelists of former days who thought they could explain everything.&quot; Since most readers still want packaged and clearly labelled explanations how frustrating it is to encounter a story about a
                psychologist&apos;s incest that offer neither &quot;psychological&quot; explanations nor guilt, but an abundance of &quot;philosophy&quot; and even a happy ending (in the fairy tale spirit). Tolstoy the moralist would certain not approve,
                as Nabokov well knows. Civic leaders, scout masters, ministers and parents (none of whose vigils should cease) may wonder &quot;What is Nabokov&apos;s moral attitude toward incest?&quot; He would no doubt grant that it does complicate
                matters in a good many ways, but that prose fiction should do more than make such easy judgments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nabokov is the most allusive and linguistically playful writer in English since Joyce, and like &quot;Pale Fire&quot; and &quot;Lolita,&quot; his new novel abounds in delightful minor parodies and pastiches, countless multilingual puns and literary jokes.
                But, however much it is about literature, and however literary it may be, &quot;Ada&quot; is primarily about life &#x2014; &quot;death-padded life,&quot; as Nabokov calls it in &quot;Pale Fire.&quot; At the age of 97, even a philosopher
                who has negated the Future may be prompted to explore the subject further.</p>
            <p>
                In Part Five, living in Switzerland (as Nabokov and his wife do now), their fantasia suspended. Ada and Van Veen contemplate their prospects for the future. Death is imagined as eternal pain, a form of madness. But word-smith Ada &quot;know[s] there&apos;s
                a Van in Nirvana. I&apos;ll be with him in the depths <i>moego ada,</i> of my Hades,&quot; she says, pointing to the etymology of her name. <i>Ad</i> is a Russian masculine noun for hell, <i>muki ada</i> are the torments
                of hell, and <i>ad</i> is of course contained in &quot;Adam.&quot; &quot;This is a. . .howl <i>iz ada</i> (out of Hades),&quot; write Ada in a letter to Van.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hers is but one of several howls audible throughout the novel, even in Ardis, since death casts a shadow in Arcady too. &quot;I may die tonight,&quot; says the narrator one-third of the way into the book, and the reader is constantly made aware of the
                &quot;crotchety gray old word man on the edge of a hotel bed.&quot; In Part Five, the nocturnal torments and terrors of old age move into the foreground of the novel.
            </p>
            <p>
                These final pages are as deeply pleasureful as they are moving. Their comic eschatologies are consistent with the spirit that informs all of &quot;Ada,&quot; the spirit that is underscored by the last syllable in Ada&apos;s name when it is pronounced
                correctly in &quot;the Russian way with two deep, dark &apos;a&apos;s&quot; &#x2014; <i>da!</i> Yes, the name includes both Eden and Hades, and the ardor of Nabokov&apos;s art, the exuberance and luminosity of his prose,
                is equal to the infinite riches of consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I, Van Veen, salute you, life,&quot; proclaims Van in the opening sentence of Part Five, speaking for his creator as well. The titles of many of Nabokov&apos;s novels and stories are evoked throughout &quot;Ada,&quot; for while Van Veen is commemorating
                those summer &quot;trips to the magic islet&quot; of Ardis, a network of authorial self-references succeeds in revealing the omnipresence of Van Veen&apos;s maker [V. V. &#x2014; Vladimir Vladimirovich], a Prospero who magically summons
                up the creations of a lifetime. And like &quot;the Tempest,&quot; an earlier physics fiction, &quot;Ada&quot; is a culminating work, an act of accommodation that in the face of darkness asserts joy. It is a great work of art, a necessary
                book, radiant and rapturous, affirming the power of love and imagination, &quot;and much, much more,&quot; to quote Van Veen&apos;s concluding but open-ended self-endorsement.
            </p>

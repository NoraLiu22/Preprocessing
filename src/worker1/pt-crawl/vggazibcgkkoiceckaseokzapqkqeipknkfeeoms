Don't believe that unfettered trade creates U.S. jobs
</h3></center>
CLINTON: I voted for a multinational trade agreement, but I opposed CAFTA because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America. I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, I was holding out hope that it would
be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for. Once I saw the outcome, I opposed it. We are 55 of the world's population. We have to trade with the other 95%.<p>SANDERS: I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which
works for the middle class and working families, not just large multinational corporations. I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA. We heard people tell us how many jobs would be created. I didn't believe that for a second because I understood
what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage. This is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements

Q: President Obama is for the Asian trade deal known as TPP.  Is President Obama, based on this policy, a progressive? <p>SANDERS: If we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs lost monthly, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit, the
financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama has done a fantastic job. Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, but I disagree with him on issues including the trade agreement, but I think he has done an excellent job.

I will take on corporations that take their jobs to China

There are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.
I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.

I have strongly criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Defense of Marriage Act since a certain presidential couple enacted them back in the 90's. Six months ago, when
I began my campaign and announced we were going to take on these types of legislation, as well as the political and economic establishment of this country, very few people knew who I was. Well, in the last six months, things have changed.

Does not support ANY free trade agreements
</h3></center>
Q: What do you think about the new TPP trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership?<p>SANDERS: I voted against NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China. I think they have been a disaster for the American worker. A lot of corporations that shut down here move abroad.
Working people understand that after NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China we have lost millions of decent paying jobs. Since 2001, 60,000 factories in America have been shut down. We're in a race to the bottom, where our wages are going down.
Is all of that attributable to trade? No. Is a lot of it? Yes. TPP was written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street. That's what this trade agreement is about. I do not want American workers to competing against people in
Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour for a minimum wage.<p>Q: So basically, there's never been a single trade agreement this country's negotiated that you've been comfortable with?<p>SANDERS: That's correct.

China trade has led to loss of 3M American jobs so far
</h3></center>
Q: What does Bernie's track record look like with regard to Chinese trade policy?<p>A: Time and time again, Bernie has voted against free trade deals with China. In 1999, Bernie voted in the House against granting China "Most Favored Nation" status.
In 2000, Bernie voted against Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China which aimed to create jobs, but instead lead to the loss of more than 3 million jobs for Americans.<p>Q: Maybe these trade agreements aren't all great for Americans, but don't
they provide millions of jobs for Chinese workers?<p>A: Bernie firmly rejects the idea that America's standard of living must drop in order to see a raise in the standard of living in China.<p>Q: So what does Bernie propose we do?<p>
A: Instead of passing such trade deals again and again, Bernie argues we must "develop trade policies which demand that American corporations create jobs here, and not abroad."

<h3><center>
Priority of trade deals should be helping American workers
</h3></center>
Bernie Sanders believes that the top priority of any trade deal should be to help American workers. Unfortunately, as Bernie has warned year after year, American trade policy over the last 30 years has done just the opposite.  Multinational corporations-
who have helped to write most of these trade deals--have benefited greatly while millions of American jobs have been shipped overseas. American trade policy should place the needs of American workers and small businesses first.

<h3><center>
Base trade policy on working families, not multinationals
</h3></center>
Q: The president says that expanding trade helps service industries & opens new markets. You talk about workers that would lose their job from trade. They say this will open up markets that will increase jobs.<p>SANDERS: I have been hearing that argument
for the last 25 years. I heard it about NAFTA. I heard it about CAFTA. I heard it about permanent normal trade relations with China. Here is the fact. Since 2001, we have lost almost 60,000 factories and millions of good-paying jobs. I'm not saying
trade is the only reason, but it is a significant reason why Americans are working longer hours for low wages and why we are seeing our jobs go to China and other low-wage countries. And, finally, what you're seeing in Congress are Democrats and some
Republicans beginning to stand up and say, maybe we should have a trade policy which represents the working families of this country, that rebuilds our manufacturing base, not than just representing the CEOs of large multinational corporations.

<h3><center>
Wrong, wrong, wrong that trade deals create jobs here
</h3></center>
Q: As secretary of state, Clinton said she favored a trade deal with our 11 Pacific partners & fast track authority to make that happen. Is that an issue for you?<p>SANDERS: In the House and Senate, I voted against all of these terrible trade agreements,
NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent normal trades relations with China. Republicans and Democrats, they say, "oh, we'll create all these jobs by having a trade agreement with China." Well, the answer is, they were wrong, wrong, wrong. Over the years, we have lost
millions of decent paying jobs. These trade agreements have forced wages down in America so the average worker in America today is working longer hours for lower wages.<p>Q: So, is that a litmus test for you, to see whether or not Clinton is going to
come out against the TPP?<p>SANDERS: I hope very much the secretary comes out against it. I think we do not need to send more jobs to low wage countries. I think corporate America has to start investing in this country and create decent paying jobs here.

End disastrous NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China
</h3></center>
Since 2001 we have lost more than 60,000 factories in this country, and more than 4.9 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs. We must end our disastrous trade policies (NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, etc.) which enable corporate America to shut
down plants in this country and move to China and other low-wage countries. We need to end the race to the bottom and develop trade policies which demand that American corporations create jobs here, and not abroad.

<h3><center>
How can we compete against people who make 23 cents an hour?
</h3></center>
Are American workers going to be able to compete against desperate people who make 23 cents an hour?<p>I asked the guy who was in charge of all the Walmarts in Asia--I asked him a simple question: Tell me, how many of these American company products
are actually manufactured in the United States?<p>He was a little bit sheepish and a little bit hesitant and he said: Well, about 1 percent. Obviously, what everybody knew, it is a lot cheaper for the American companies to set up plants in China, hire
Chinese workers at 50 cents an hour, 75 cents an hour, whatever it is, and have them build the product for the Chinese markets than it is to pay American workers $15 an hour, $20 an hour, provide health insurance, deal with the union, deal with the
environment. That is not a great revelation. I think anybody could have figured that one out. But the big money interests around here pushed it and Congress and President Clinton, at that time, signed it and we were off and running.

48,000 US factories shut down under Bush due to trade
</h3></center>
They want to expand--and it is not only Republicans here, some Democrats as well--our disastrous trade policies so large companies can continue their efforts to outsource American jobs to China and other low-wage countries.  Any objective analysis of our
trade policies has shown it has been a grotesque failure for ordinary Americans. It is hard to calculate exactly, but I think it is fair to say we have lost millions of decent-paying jobs. During the Bush years alone, some 48,000 factories shut down.
We went from 19 million manufacturing jobs to 12 million manufacturing jobs. Historically, in this country, manufacturing jobs were the backbone of the working class. That is how people made it into the middle class.
That is how they had decent health care benefits and pensions. Every day we are seeing those jobs disappear because corporate America would prefer to do business in China or other low-wage countries.

<h3><center>
Disastrous trade policies lead to collapse of middle class
</h3></center>
I think one of the reasons unemployment is so high, one of the reasons the middle class is collapsing, has a lot to do with these disastrous trade policies. All this stuff emanates from corporate leaders whose sense of responsibility is such that they
want themselves to become richer, they want more and more profits for their company, but they could care less about the needs of the American people.<p>I remember there was one CEO of a large, one of our largest American corporations, and he said: "When
I look at the future of General Electric, I see China, China, China, and China." By the way, we ended up bailing out that particular corporation. He didn't look to China to get bailed out, he looked to the taxpayers of this country.<p>But the word has to
get out to corporate America, they are going to have to start reinvesting in the United States of America. They are going to have to start building the products and the goods the American people need rather than run all over in search of cheap labor.

<h3><center>
US trade policies represent interests of corporate America
</h3></center>
I am certainly not a big fan of Bill Clinton's politics. As a strong advocate of a single-payer health care system, I opposed his convoluted health care reform package. I have helped lead the opposition to his trade policies, which represent the
interests of corporate America and which are virtually indistinguishable from the views of George Bush and Newt Gingrich.
I opposed his bloated military budget, the welfare reform bill that he signed, and the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which he supported. He has been weak on campaign finance reform and has caved in far too often on the environment.
Bill Clinton is a moderate Democrat. I'm a democratic socialist. <p>Yet, without enthusiasm, I've decided to support Bill Clinton for president. If Bob Dole were to be elected president, there would be an unparalleled war against working people.

Although I agree with his critique of American trade policy and his opposition to NAFTA, I am no great fan of Ross Perot. There's no way he would be a major political leader if he weren't a billionaire.
But I think that he is getting a bum rap from the media when they refer to his half-hour speeches as "infomericals" and make fun of his use of charts.
Instead of putting 30-second attack ads on the air, he is trying to seriously discuss some of the most important issues facing the country.
You may not agree with his analysis or his conclusions, but at least he's treating the American people with some respect. What's wrong with that?

NAFTA was a sellout to corporate America
</h3></center>
At the very same time as health care was on the congressional agenda. Clinton pushed another issue to the forefront. And on the major initiative, Clinton was just plain wrong--very wrong. His support for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
was a sellout to corporate America. Pure and simple, it was a disaster for the working people of this country.<p>The US currently has a trade deficit of $114 billion. Economists tell us that $1 billion of investment equates to about
18,000 (often decent-paying) jobs. Connect the dots. Our current trade deficit is causing the loss of over 2 million jobs. Over the last 20 years, while the US has run up over a trillion dollars in trade deficits, millions of American workers have
been thrown into the streets.<p>The function of trade agreements like NAFTA is to make it easier for American companies to move abroad, and to force our workers to compete against desperate people in the Third World.

NAFTA, GATT, and MFN for China must be repealed
</h3></center>
What about the hemorrhage of jobs abroad? Can we do anything about the disastrous effects of the global economy on American workers? According to the experts, no. But the experts echo the message their employers want us to hear.<p>
We need to address the issue of trade forthrightly and understand that our current trade policy is an unmitigated disaster. Our current record-breaking merchandise trade deficit of $112 billion is costing us over 2 million decent paying jobs.
NAFTA, GATT, and Most Favored Nation status with China must be repealed, and a new trade policy developed.<p>Let's look at some of the components of a sensible trade policy. First, we must recognize that trade is not an end in itself.
The function of American trade policy must be to improve the standard of living of the American people. America's trade policy must be radically changed, by committing ourselves to a "fair" rather than "free" trade policy.

Voted NO on promoting free trade with Peru.
</h3></center>
Approves the Agreement entered into with the government of Peru. Provides for the Agreement's entry into force upon certain conditions being met on or after January 1, 2008. Prescribes requirements for:<ul><li>enforcement of textile and apparel rules of origin; <li>certain textile and apparel safeguard measures; and <li>enforcement of export laws governing trade of timber products from Peru. </ul><p><b>Proponents support voting YES because:</b><p> Rep. RANGEL: It's absolutely ridiculous to believe that we can create jobs without trade. I had the opportunity to travel to Peru recently. I saw firsthand how important this agreement is to Peru and how this agreement will strengthen an important ally of ours in that region. Peru is resisting the efforts of Venezuela's authoritarian President Hugo Chavez to wage a war of words and ideas in Latin America against the US. Congress should acknowledge the support of the people of Peru and pass this legislation by a strong margin. 
<p><b>Opponents recommend voting NO because:</b><p>Rep. WU: I regret that I cannot vote for this bill tonight because it does not put human rights on an equal footing with environmental and labor protections. <p>Rep. KILDEE: All trade agreements suffer from the same fundamental flaw: They are not self-enforcing. Trade agreements depend upon vigorous enforcement, which requires official complaints be made when violations occur. I have no faith in President Bush to show any enthusiasm to enforce this agreement. Congress should not hand this administration yet another trade agreement because past agreements have been more efficient at exporting jobs than goods and services. I appeal to all Members of Congress to vote NO on this. But I appeal especially to my fellow Democrats not to turn their backs on those American workers who suffer from the export of their jobs. They want a paycheck, not an unemployment check.

<h3><center>Rated 33% by <a href='../Note-CATO.asp'>CATO</a>, indicating a mixed record on trade issues.</h3></center>
Sanders scores 33% by CATO on senior issues <p>
The mission of the Cato Institute Center for Trade Policy Studies is to increase public understanding of the benefits of free trade and the costs of protectionism. <p>The Cato Trade Center focuses not only on U.S. protectionism, but also on trade barriers around the world. Cato scholars examine how the negotiation of multilateral, regional, and bilateral trade agreements can reduce trade barriers and provide institutional support for open markets. Not all trade agreements, however, lead to genuine liberalization. In this regard, Trade Center studies scrutinize whether purportedly market-opening accords actually seek to dictate marketplace results, or increase bureaucratic interference in the economy as a condition of market access. <p>Studies by Cato Trade Center scholars show that the United States is most effective in encouraging open markets abroad when it leads by example. 
The relative openness and consequent strength of the U.S. economy already lend powerful support to the worldwide trend toward embracing open markets. Consistent adherence by the United States to free trade principles would give this trend even greater momentum. Thus, Cato scholars have found that unilateral liberalization supports rather than undermines productive trade negotiations.<p>Scholars at the Cato Trade Center aim at nothing less than changing the terms of the trade policy debate: away from the current mercantilist preoccupation with trade balances, and toward a recognition that open markets are their own reward.<p>The following ratings are based on the votes the organization considered most important; the numbers reflect the percentage of time the representative voted the organization's preferred position.

<h3><center>Review free trade agreements biennially for rights violation.</h3></center>
Sanders signed H.R.3012 <p>
<ol>Trade Reform, Accountability, Development, and Employment Act or the TRADE Act: <li>review biennially certain free trade agreements (including Uruguay Round Agreements) between the US and foreign countries to evaluate their economic, environmental, national security, health, safety, and other effects; and<li>report on them to the Congressional Trade Agreement Review Committee (established by this Act), including analyses of specified aspects of each agreement and certain information about agreement parties, such as whether the country has a democratic form of government, respects certain core labor rights and fundamental human rights, protects intellectual property rights, and enforces environmental laws.</ol><ol>
Declares that implementing bills of new trade agreements shall not be subject to expedited consideration or special procedures limiting amendment, unless such agreements include certain standards with respect to: <li>labor; <li>human rights; <li>environment and public safety; <li>food and product health and safety; <li>provision of services; <li>investment; <li>procurement; <li>intellectual property; <li>agriculture; <li>trade remedies and safeguards; <li>dispute resolution and enforcement; <li>technical assistance; <li>national security; and<li>taxation. </ol>Requires the President to submit to Congress a plan for the renegotiation of existing trade agreements to bring them into compliance with such standards. Expresses the sense of Congress that certain processes for U.S. trade negotiations should be followed when Congress considers legislation providing special procedures for implementing bills of trade agreements.

<h3><center>Impose tariffs against countries which manipulate currency.</h3></center>
Sanders signed Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act <p>
<ul><li>Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to include as a "countervailable subsidy" requiring action under a countervailing duty or antidumping duty proceeding the benefit conferred on merchandise imported into the US from foreign countries with fundamentally undervalued currency. <li>Defines "benefit conferred" as the difference between:<ol><li>the amount of currency provided by a foreign country in which the subject merchandise is produced; and<li>the amount of currency such country would have provided if the real effective exchange rate of its currency were not fundamentally undervalued.</ol><li>Determines that the currency of a foreign country is fundamentally undervalued if for an 18-month period: <ol><li>the government of the country engages in protracted, large-scale intervention in one or more foreign exchange markets<li>the country's real effective exchange rate is undervalued by at least 5%<li>the country has experienced significant and persistent global current account 
surpluses; and<li>the country's government has foreign asset reserves exceeding the amount necessary to repay all its debt obligations. </ul><p><b><i><big>[Explanatory note from Wikipedia.com "Exchange Rate"]:<p></b></i></big>Between 1994 and 2005, the Chinese yuan renminbi was pegged to the US dollar at RMB 8.28 to $1. Countries may gain an advantage in international trade if they manipulate the value of their currency by artificially keeping its value low. It is argued that China has succeeded in doing this over a long period of time. However, a 2005 appreciation of the Yuan by 22% was followed by a 39% increase in Chinese imports to the US. In 2010, other nations, including Japan & Brazil, attempted to devalue their currency in the hopes of subsidizing cheap exports and bolstering their ailing economies. A low exchange rate lowers the price of a country's goods for consumers in other countries but raises the price of imported goods for consumers in the manipulating country.

<h3><center>Rated 13% by the <a href='../Note-USAE.asp'>USAE</a>, indicating support for trade sanctions.</h3></center>
Sanders scores 13% by USA*Engage on trade issues <p>
Ratings by USA*Engage indicate support for trade engagement or trade sanctions. The organization's self-description: "USA*Engage is concerned about the proliferation of unilateral foreign policy sanctions at the federal, state and local level. Despite the fact that broad trade-based unilateral sanctions rarely achieve our foreign policy goals, they continue to have political appeal. Unilateral sanctions give the impression that the United States is 'doing something,' while American workers, farmers and businesses absorb the costs."
<ul>USA*Engage at Work<li>Developing the Case: USA*Engage explains the benefits of economic engagement, and the high cost of sanctions for American exports, investment and jobs. <li>Education: We recruit respected foreign policy and economic experts to speak out against sanctions, actively engage the media and provide outreach to key target states and Congressional districts.<li>Contacting Government Officials: USA*Engage directly contacts Congressional, Administration, state and local officials. </ul> <p>VoteMatch scoring for the USA*Engage ratings is as follows : <ul><li>0%-49%: supports trade sanctions; <li>50%-74%: mixed record on trade engagement;<li>75%-100%: supports trade engagement.</ul>

<h3><center>No MFN for China; condition trade on human rights.</h3></center>
Sanders adopted the Progressive Caucus Position Paper: <p>
The Progressive Caucus opposes awarding China permanent Most Favored Nation trading status at this time. We believe that it would be a serious setback for the protection and expansion of worker rights, human rights and religious rights. We also believe it will harm the US economy. We favor continuing to review on an annual basis China�s trading status, and we believe it is both legal and consistent with US WTO obligations to do so. The Progressive Caucus believes that trade relations with the US should be conditioned on the protection of worker rights, human rights and religious rights. If Congress gives China permanent MFN status, the US will lose the best leverage we have to influence China to enact those rights and protections. At the current time, the US buys about 40% of China�s exports, making it a consumer with a lot of potential clout. So long as the US annually continues to review China�s trade status, we have the ability to debate achievement 
of basic worker and human rights and to condition access to the US market on the achievement of gains in worker and human rights, if necessary. But once China is given permanent MFN, it permanently receives unconditional access to the US market and we lose that leverage. China will be free to attract multinational capital on the promise of super low wages, unsafe workplace conditions and prison labor and permanent access to the US market.<p>Furthermore, giving China permanent MFN will be harmful to the US economy, since the record trade deficit with China (and attendant problems such as loss of US jobs, and lower average wages in the US) will worsen. For 1999, the trade deficit is likely to be nearly $70 billion. Once China is awarded permanent MFN and WTO membership, the trade deficit will worsen.

<H2>Divorcing Jack (1998)</H2>

<P>D: David Caffrey<BR>
S: David Thewlis, Rachel Griffiths, Jason Isaacs</P>

<P>Immensely satisfying comic thriller from the novel by Colin Bateman demonstrating
many of the same qualities as <A HREF="cycv.htm"><I>Cycle of Violence</I>,</A>
only with more energy. Belfast journalist David Thewlis finds himself embroiled
in a Hitchcockian convolution of plots within plots when following an affair
with a young student (Laura Fraser) who is later murdered, he finds himself
the subject of a manhunt involving both nationalist and loyalist paramilitaries,
the RUC, the British Army and the public at large. Encounters with a variety
of lowlifes and characters in of Northern Ireland's underworld provide him
with temporary shelter as the trail leads ever higher until it reaches the
doors of a man about to become the first Prime Minister (Robert Lindsay).</P>

<P>The details of the plot are best left to its viewing, given that the
film hinges upon a murder mystery, but suffice to say that much of its humour
comes from its vivid portrayal of familiar and unfamiliar types and its
play on convention and genre. Like <I><A HREF="cycv.htm">Cycle of Violence</A></I>,
it is the combination of a well worked story with interesting characters
which uses its Northern Irish setting to its advantage. All black comedy
comes from the inappropriateness of making light of subjects deemed too
serious for such treatment. The conflict within Northern Ireland has long
been ripe for this, and, as novelist and now screenwriter, Bateman has taken
the initiative. He is assisted here by a funny performance by David Thewlis
and good support from a variety of others (Rachel Griffiths of <A HREF="msf.htm"><I>My Son, The Fanatic</I> </A>fame has a showy but amusing role
as a nurse who is a nunogram at night, Br&oacute;na Gallagher is hilarious
as a taxi driver) and slick, often stylish direction by first timer David
Caffrey.</P>

<P>This BBC funded film has little of the stodginess which sometimes dogs
their big screen releases (<A HREF="regen.htm"><I>Regeneration</I> </A>leaps
to mind). It has plenty of pace and humour and does a beautiful job of using
genuine locations to enhance the action. Caffrey directs smoothly and with
due attention for timing and dramatic development, and only in the closing
minutes does he surrender the screen to a long speech by Thewlis which spells
out the message. Still the film is splendidly realised and hugely enjoyable.</P>

<P>The film is sometimes violent and generally very profane, but uses its
occasional outbursts of graphic nastiness to its advantage. The tone of
danger is maintained throughout, leaving us in some suspense as to the fate
of the characters. This works well because rather than knowing all will
turn out well in the end (as in <I><A HREF="iwd.htm">I Went Down</A></I>),
we are left wondering just who will survive and what state they will be
in if they do so. This keeps us involved right up to the end, and the film
resolves itself with a final black comic flourish.</P>

<P>This is not a film for everyone, but it is fresh and entertaining in
a way that many films coming out of the Island of Ireland are not (this
is a British/Northern Irish film rather than one from the Republic). After
<A HREF="iwd.htm"><I>I Went Down</I> </A>and <A HREF="cycv.htm"><I>Cycle
of Violence</I>,</A> <I>Divorcing Jack</I> finally realises the potential
for well made movies which offer the public something more than sombre reflection,
but which has a brisk and original voice of its own.</P>

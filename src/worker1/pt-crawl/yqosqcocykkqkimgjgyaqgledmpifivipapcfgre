On the side of his mother Lucilia he was of senatorial stock. He was distinguished by a personal beauty, not of the sort which gives the bloom of youth its charm, but stately and unchanging, as


<A ID="p113"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p113 </SPAN></A>befitted the distinction and good fortune of his career, and this beauty attended him to the last day of his life. He was a man of exceptional purity of life, of great uprightness of character, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.3">3</A> of but moderate oratorical talent, ambitious of such power as might be conferred upon him as a mark of honour, but not that which had to be forcibly usurped. In war a resourceful general, in peace a citizen of temperate conduct except when he feared a rival, constant in his friendships, easily placated when offended, loyal in re-establishing terms of amity, very ready to accept satisfaction, never or at least rarely abusing his power, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.4">4</A> Pompey was free from almost every fault, unless it be considered one of the greatest of faults for a man to chafe at seeing anyone his equal in dignity in a free state, the mistress of the world, where he should justly regard all citizens as his equals. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.5">5</A> From the day on which he had assumed the toga he had been trained to military service on the staff of that sagacious general, his father, and by a singular insight into military tactics had so developed his excellent native talent, which showed great capacity to learn what was best, that, while Sertorius bestowed the greater praise upon Metellus, it was Pompey he feared the more strongly.

The personality of Pompey had now turned the eyes of the world upon itself, and in all things he was now regarded as more than a mere citizen. As consul he made the laudable promise, which he also kept, that he would not go from that office to any province. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.2">2</A> But, two years afterwards, when the pirates were terrifying the world, not as heretofore by furtive marauding expeditions but with fleets of ships in the manner of regular warfare, and had already plundered several cities of Italy, Aulus Gabinius, a tribune, proposed an enactment&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref76" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

onMouseOver="return Ebox('80 km',WIDTH,60)"
onMouseOut="nd();">•</A>fifty miles from the sea. By this decree the command of almost the entire world was being entrusted to one man. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.3">3</A> Seven years before, it is true, like power had been decreed to Marcus Antonius as praetor.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref77" HREF="

In the case of Antonius people had looked upon his position with no concern. For it is not often that we begrudge honours to those whose power we do not fear. On the other hand men shrink from conferring extraordinary powers upon those who seem likely to retain them or lay them aside only as they themselves choose, and whose inclinations are their only check. The optimates advised against the grant to Pompey, but sane advice succumbed to impulse.

The sterling character of Quintus Catulus and his modesty on this occasion are worthy of record. Opposing the law before the assembled


<A ID="p119"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p119 </SPAN></A>people he had said that Pompey was without question a great man, but that he was now becoming too great for a free republic, and that all powers ought not to be reposed in one man. "If anything happens to Pompey," he added, "whom will you put in his place?" The people shouted with one accord, "You, Catulus." Then, yielding to the unanimous desire of the people for the proposed law and to this honourable tribute of his fellow-citizens, he left the assembly. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.2">2</A> At this point one would fain express admiration for the modesty of the man and the fairness of the people; in the case of Catulus, because he ceased his opposition, and, in the case of the people, because it was unwilling to withhold from one who was speaking against the measure in opposition to them this real evidence of their esteem.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.3">3</A> About the same time Cotta divided service upon the juries equally between the senatorial and equestrian orders. Gaius Gracchus had taken this privilege from the senate and given it to the knights, while Sulla had again transferred it from the knights to the senate. Otho Roscius by his law restored to the knights their places in the theatre.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref78" HREF="

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.4">4</A> Meanwhile Gnaeus Pompey enlisted the services of many illustrious men, distributed detachments of the fleet to all the recesses of the sea, and in a short time with an invincible force he freed the world from the menace of piracy. Near the Cilician coast he delivered his final attack upon the pirates, who had already met with frequent defeats in many other places, and completely routed them.

When the war with the pirates was drawing to a close, Pompey was assigned to the command against Mithridates in place of Lucius Lucullus. Seven years before this, Lucullus, at the conclusion of his <SPAN CLASS="whole">consul</SPAN>&shy;ship, had obtained the <SPAN CLASS="whole">proconsul</SPAN>&shy;ship of Asia, and had been placed in command against Mithridates.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref80" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">80</A> In this post he had performed some great and notable exploits, having defeated Mithridates several times in different regions, freed Cyzicus by a brilliant victory, and conquered Tigranes, the greatest of kings, in Armenia. That he had not put an end to the war was due, one might say, to lack of inclination rather than of ability; for although in all other respects he was a man of laudable character and in war had scarcely ever been defeated, he was a victim to the love of money. He was still engaged in carrying on the same struggle when Manilius, tribune of the people, a man of venal character always, and ready to abet the ambitions of others, proposed a law that Pompey should be given the chief command in the Mithridatic war. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.2">2</A> The law was passed, and the two commanders began to vie with each other in recriminations, Pompey charging Lucullus with his unsavoury greed for money, and Lucullus taunting Pompey with his unbounded ambition for military power. Neither


<A ID="p123"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p123 </SPAN></A>could be convicted of falsehood in his charge against the other. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.3">3</A> In fact Pompey, from the time when he first took part in public life, could not brook an equal at all. In undertakings in which he should have been merely the first he wished to be the only one. No one was ever more indifferent to other things or possessed a greater craving for glory; he knew no restraint in his quest for office, though he was moderate to a degree in the exercise of his powers. Entering upon each new office with the utmost eagerness, he would lay them aside with unconcern, and, although he consulted his own wishes in attaining what he desired, he yielded to the wishes of others in resigning it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.4">4</A> As for Lucullus, who was otherwise a great man, he was the first to set the example for our present lavish extravagance in building, in banquets, and in furnishings. Because of the massive piles which he built in the sea, and of his letting the sea in upon the land by digging through mountains, Pompey used to call him, and not without point, the Roman Xerxes.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref81" HREF="

During the same period the island of Crete was brought under the sovereignty of the Roman people by Quintus Metellus. For three years this island, under the <SPAN CLASS="whole">leader</SPAN>&shy;ship of Panares and Lasthenes who had collected a force of <SPAN CLASS="whole">twenty-four</SPAN> thousand men, swift in their movements, hardened to the toils of war, and famous in their use of the bow, had worn out the Roman armies. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.2">2</A> Gnaeus Pompeius could not refrain from coveting some of this glory also,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref82" HREF="

Syria and the other provinces which Mithridates had seized were wrested from him. Some were restored to the Roman people, and others were then for the first time brought under its sway — Syria, for instance — which first became a tributary province at this time.

The following story, however, may be told as a presage of his future greatness. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="42.2">2</A> On the night following the day on which his ransom was paid by the cities of Asia — he had, however, compelled the pirates before payment to give hostages to these cities — although he was but a private citizen without authority, and his fleet had been collected on the spur of the moment, he directed his course to the rendezvous of the pirates, put to flight part of their fleet, sank part, and captured several ships and many men. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="42.3">3</A> Well satisfied with the success of his night expedition he returned

When Juncus, whose former inactivity had now given way to jealousy, refused, and said that he would sell the captives as slaves, Caesar returned to the coast with incredible speed and crucified all his prisoners before anyone had had time to receive a dispatch from the consul in regard to the matter.

Caesar, on his side, having got into his power Domitius and the legions that were with him at Corfinium, immediately released this commander and all others who so wished, and allowed them to join Pompey, whom he now followed to Brundisium, making it clear that he preferred to put an end to the war while the state was uninjured and negotiation still possible, rather than to crush his fleeing enemy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.2">2</A> Finding that the consuls had crossed the sea he returned to the city, and after rendering to the senate and also to the assembly of the people an account of his motives and of the deplorable necessity of his position, in that he had been driven to arms by others who had themselves resorted to arms, he resolved to march on Spain.

Pompey fled with the two Lentuli, both ex-consuls, his own son Sextus, and Favonius, a former praetor, friends whom chance had gathered about him as his companions. Some advised him to take refuge with the Parthians, others in Africa, where he had in King Juba a most loyal partisan; but, remembering the favours which he had conferred upon the father of Ptolemy, who, though still between boyhood and manhood, was now reigning at Alexandria, he decided to repair to Egypt. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="53.2">2</A> But, in adversity who remembers past services?

The loyalty of the king, and of those by whose influence he was controlled, was no greater towards Caesar than it had been toward Pompey.

Fidelity to my promise of brevity reminds me how rapidly I must pass over the details of my narrative. Caesar, following up his success, passed over to Africa, of which the Pompeian armies now held possession since the death of Gaius Curio, the leader there of the Caesarian party.

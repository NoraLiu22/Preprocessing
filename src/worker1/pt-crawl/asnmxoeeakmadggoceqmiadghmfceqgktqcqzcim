<H2>Borstal Boy (2000)</H2>

<P>D: Peter Sheridan<BR>
S: Shawn Hatosy, Danny Dyer</P>

<P>Good adaptation of Brendan Behan's autobiographical tale which charts
the experiences of a young Irish boy imprisoned in a British borstal during
WWII. A staunch republican on a bombing mission, young Brendan (portrayed
by American Shawn Hatosy) initially rejects all attempts to reach him by
the relatively benign Governor (Michael York) and especially a British sailor
convicted of theft (Danny Dyer). But as the narrative progresses he comes
to see things differently. As his relationships with other inmates begin
to grow and he is exposed to a world he has literally never known, he eventually
comes to realise the ambiguity of his personal and political beliefs. A
fascination with Oscar Wilde and a slowly growing homoerotic attraction
to young Dyer forces him to redefine himself and see the world from a different
point of view. He also finds himself entranced by the Governor's daughter
(Eva Birthistle), a free-thinking artist who encourages him to explore his
creative side, something which will eventually result in a short but brilliant
career as an author and playwright (though this is not part of the actual
film).</P>

<P><I>Borstal Boy</I> is a film with simple ambitions. It is well crafted
in every respect. It is capably performed by a sincere cast, solidly written
by Nye Heron and director Peter Sheridan 'inspired by' the original novel,
lushly scored by Stephen McKeon, crisply photographed by Ciar&aacute;n Tanham,
and nicely decked out by production designer Crispian Sallis, art director
Michael Higgins, and costume designer Marie Tierney. It is a solid piece
of cinematic storytelling which makes good use of all of the materials at
its disposal. It is not especially visually exciting, but it escapes the
trap of being stagebound or excessively TV movie-ish as so many Irish films
are largely because of its pace and variety of action. There are many familiar
prison-camp scenes, including the usual personal, political, and sexual
power struggles between inmates, escape attempts, and even some 'unity through
sports' action (when the prisoners take on the local army in a rugby match).
There are also many references to the context of the action set by the war
itself, embodied in the Canadian and Jewish boys among the population, and
the uneasy truce struck between Brendan and the authorities at the end of
the film, so it is not without a sense of politics or precedent.</P>

<P>A UK/Irish co-production, the film may represent some kind of meaningful
meditation on relations between the countries on a deeper level, but this
is not its most interesting or pronounced feature (and anyway, the setting
sixty years ago makes such apposition somewhat fanciful). It is more deliberately
concerned with the shift in perspective which makes Behan into a writer,
and, interestingly, particularly the questions of sexual orientation which
crystallises the issue. Like in the recent <I><A HREF="tmr.htm">The Talented
Mr. Ripley</A></I> homosexuality (or even bisexuality) is not so much an
'issue' as it is a metaphorical anchor around which many of the concerns
of the film revolve. Whether or not this has anything to do with Ireland
or even with Brendan Behan himself is beside the point. The film successfully
articulates its point of view in what amounts to one of the most curious
rites-of-passage films we've seen in a while. It is a film about embracing
of alternative readings both of one's self and other people, and as such
it works well regardless of what other meanings are ascribed to it.</P>

<P>Hatosy is physically ideal in the lead, gruff and unforgiving without
falling completely into the  stereotype of the Irish thug. He does a creditable
job with not only the accent, but the halting stutter which characterises
young Brendan in the early scenes, and delivers a performance of great subtlety
in spite of the outward appearance of obstinance. He is neatly matched by
Dyer (<I>Human Traffic</I>) as the homosexual sailor, again playing a role
with more complexity than the outline suggests. Support from the rest of
the young cast is generally good, with Birthistle (<I><A HREF="crud.htm">Drinking
Crude</A></I>, <I><A HREF="saltw.htm">Saltwater</A></I>) making a fetching
upper class English girl. Michael York adds a veteran face to the proceedings
although his character is lacking the kind of detail needed to make him
stand out dramatically.</P>

<P>Overall <I>Borstal Boy</I> is a very solid, very watchable first feature
for director Peter Sheridan. It doesn't stretch its audience, but it is
not without interesting, coherent, and articulated thematic threads. Though
unlikely to inspire wide admiration, it is very much the kind of medium-budget
film which will find extensive distribution via television, which may, in
the final analysis, be its most natural home despite the formerly fearsome
reputation of this particular author and tale in Irish literary culture.</P>

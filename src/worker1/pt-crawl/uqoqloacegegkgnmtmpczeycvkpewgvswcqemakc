<P> <I>Theopompos was a friend of Julius Caesar. &nbsp; In November 45 B.C., a treaty was agreed between Knidos and Rome (see <A HREF="inscr_4.html">inscription 4</A>), and Theopompos and his sons were present in Rome for this agreement. Artemidoros remained in Rome until March 44 B.C., when he was involved in the events leading up to the assassination of Caesar (see Plutarch, <A HREF="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#65">Caes_65</A> ). No doubt the family returned to Knidos soon after the death of Caesar, and after the death of Theopompos a monument was set up in their honour, which is the source of inscriptions <B>B-F</B>. Artemidoros may have used his influence in Rome to obtain further privileges for Knidos, perhaps after the battle of Actium - although this is not mentioned elsewhere; at any rate, exceptional honours were voted for him in <B>G</B>, which may be a later copy of a decree passed in his lifetime.</I>  

<P> <I>Theopompos became a man of much influence in the Greek world. The city of Laodikeia in Syria set up a statue of him in Knidos (inscription <B>A</B>), probably in acknowledgement of his assistance in winning concessions from Caesar after the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pharsalus">Battle of Pharsalus</A>. Laodikeia adopted the name 'Julian', and began a new era which was used on its coins, in 47 B.C.; see G.M. Cohen, &quot;The Hellenistic Settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa&quot;, pp.112-3 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=480lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA112">Google Books</A> ).</I>

<P> <I>The inscriptions in honour of Theopompos and his family have been discussed in French by G. Thériault. &quot;Évergétisme grec et administration romaine: la famille cnidienne de Gaios Ioulios Théopompos&quot; (Phoenix, 2003/57, pp. 232-256); and in German by Chr. Bruns-Özgan, &quot;Eine feine Familie: Theopompos von Knidos und seine Nachkommen,&quot; ( <A HREF="https://ifa.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/IfA/EpiAna_pdfs/042103.pdf">PDF</A> ). For the 'god-like' honours awarded to Artemidoros in inscription <B>G</B>, see J. Strubbe, &quot;Cultic honours for benefactors in the cities of Asia Minor&quot;, p. 324 ( <A HREF="https://brill.com/downloadpdf/book/edcoll/9789004401655/BP000018.pdf?pdfJsInlineViewToken=1247138021&inlineView=true">PDF</A> ).</I>

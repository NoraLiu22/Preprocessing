</p>

<p class="one">The <span class="website">Victorian Web</span> welcomes submissions of original
unpublished work that is not currently under consideration for
publication elsewhere; and of work that has already been peer-reviewed
and published but is currently out of print and for which the author
holds copyright or can obtain permission to republish.</p>

<p><strong>How to submit work</strong>: Submissions should be emailed to jackie@victorianweb.org. 
Material submitted for assessment should be saved as a Microsoft Word file (.doc or .docx) or Mac pages.</p>

<p><strong>What we acquire</strong>: If your article is accepted for publication, the
<span class="website">Victorian Web</span> acquires first world electronic and archival rights as
well as the right to publish translations of your article on the
<span class="website">Victorian Web</span>. After publication, you retain the copyright and are free
to republish; however, you should be aware that some publishing houses
and academic journals will not republish work that has already appeared
online. Material published on the <span class="website">Victorian Web</span> will be archived there
at the discretion of the editors and will not be removed except under
extraordinary circumstances (e.g., the work is found to be plagiarized).</p>

<p>Please do not submit work that is under consideration for publication
elsewhere, and do not submit previously published work for which you
have not secured the copyright.</p>

<p>We ask that you refrain from submitting the same piece to multiple
section editors at once.  Our all-volunteer editorial team appreciates
your cooperation.</p>

<p><strong>On the use of algorithmic and AI tools</strong>: An AI program 
cannot be an author of anything published on <span class="website">Victorian Web</span>.</p>

<p>Text generated from algorithmic tools such as ChatGPT must not be used in material published 
on <span class="website">Victorian Web</span>. Submissions making undisclosed use of such tools will be 
rejected. Material published on <span class="website">Victorian Web</span> and subsequently found to be in 
violation of this policy will be removed.</p>

<p>Authors using algorithmic tools to create graphics must adhere to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authors submitting material created with the assistance of algorithmic 
tools must disclose the use of such tools at the time of submission of the material for publication</li>
<li>AI-generated material must be clearly marked, accurate, true, and not plagiarized from another source</li>
<li>The use of AI and the specific tool used must be acknowledged in a separate acknowledgments section</li>
<li>The author must fully specify the AI used (name, version, model, source) and
how the AI-generated material has been used in the submitted material</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What to expect</strong>: Once contributions are accepted, contributors are, as a
rule, expected to format articles in HTML according to our guidelines
and to prepare the work for publication according to <span class="website">Victorian Web</span> 
<a href="housestylecss1.html">house
style</a>. (Exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and an
editor may be available to assist, if necessary.) </p>

<p>Contributors should expect to be edited. Contributions related to
matters outside the expertise of the editorial team will be sent for
peer review; we ask for your patience as this process can take a while.
In the course of preparing your work for publication, an editor may
raise questions related to argument, evidence, point of view, voice,
tone, and style.</p>

<p>Bibliographic references must be complete, accurate, and formatted in
HTML in Chicago style (17th edition). Additional instructions for
preparing your materials are described in the documents linked here:

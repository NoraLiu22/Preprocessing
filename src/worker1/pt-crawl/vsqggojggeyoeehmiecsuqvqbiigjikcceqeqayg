		<p>The political momentum behind visa-free travel between Russia and the European Union is growing. It is supported by the big European countries and the European Parliament, and has the enthusiastic support of the Russian leadership.<span id="more-16715"></span> Speaking in Krasnoyarsk recently, Vladimir Putin, Russia&#8217;s prime minister, said that the majority of EU countries back the idea: those that oppose it did so for “political” reasons.<br/>
The issue is really about two things. Should Russia get a deal that is better (perhaps dramatically better) than what is on offer to the countries of the ‘Eastern Partnership&#8217;, such as Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova? The EU has repeatedly criticised the Russian policy of “passportisation” in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two breakaway regions of Georgia where ties with Moscow have been bolstered by the generous provision of Russian passports. Second is the rule of law. To have a visa-free deal, Russia needs at the minimum to issue biometric passports, to accept international conventions on the repatriation of illegal immigrants, and to treat EU citizens visiting Russia fairly – in particular by abolishing the infamous registration requirement.<br/>
A wider question is whether the Russian authorities share, even remotely, European values on questions of civic freedoms and human rights.</p>

Martonyi and Stubb note that Russia is their strategic partner and a major player in many areas.<span id="more-16726"></span> Russia is also a European country and our close neighbour. They states that the time is ripe to give a new boost to European Union-Russian relations, while continuing open and sincere dialogue based on common interests and values.  Finland and Hungary share a long history with Russia, and both have joined the EU rather recently. In future relations with Russia, they see three priority goals. The first relates to the economy, where currently the most pressing issue is Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. They argue that the ultimate goal is a free-trade area between Russia and the EU. Second, they call for interaction between people, with visa-free travel. And thirdly, in the foreign arena, partnership can only be successful in the long run if it is value-based and pursued in the spirit of mutual respect and confidence.  Martonyi and Stubb call on the EU to be more united and act faster. They suggest that a strategic discussion on Russia within the EU would be very welcome. And a modern, legally binding basis for the relationship is necessary; with more effective working structures. They conclude that the most important factor in building a strong EU-Russian relationship is mutual trust and playing by the same rules. On many issues, the ball is now in Russia’s court, but the EU is ready to play.</p>

		<p>Konstantin Sonin, a professor at the New Economic School in Moscow, comments that one reason Russia’s economic policy often falls short of the mark is because the government believes that it is unable to carry out the recommendations it receives from economists.<span id="more-16719"></span> It decides that ignoring the recommendations is better than implementing half-measures. He suggests that this may be the reason Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to hold an auction to allocate frequencies for Russia’s fourth-generation radio networks. It is well known that participants reach secret agreements beforehand, eliminating the competitive aspect of the bidding. With only one exception, all major privatisation auctions have suffered from this problem. These auctions were carried out English-style, not through sealed bids, and the item on the block went to the person who made the highest verbal bid. Controlling stakes in the two main production assets of YUKOS – Slavneft and Yuganksneftegaz – were sold at auction this way in 2000 [Note: Correct YUKOS auction date is 2007]. Neither auction was competitive.</p>

		<p>Lukoil accounts for almost 20% of Russia’s total oil production and has the largest international upstream portfolio among the Russian majors. However, the company does not deserve to trade at such cheap valuations given that its growth potential around the world is one of the best in the industry.<span id="more-16717"></span> Lukoil states that it is a privately-owned corporation committed to Western-style capitalism in a formerly Communist country that under Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is moving back towards a state-controlled economy. Investing Daily notes that whilst admirable, this makes Lukoil an underdog in Putin country, which is famous for bankrupting YUKOS, jailing Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and confiscating its energy assets. Putin didn’t like Khodorkovsky’s calls for greater democracy. So far, Lukoil has escaped YUKOS’ fate. The publication concludes by asking whilst Lukoil is cheap, if ConocoPhillips, a company with many years of experience doing business in Russia, is jumping ship, is it really wise to jump on board Lukoil right now?</p>

		<span class="Tags">
			<b>09 Sep 2010</b>
								</span>
		<p>The EU-Russia Centre and the Polish Centre for International Relations (CIR) organised a half-day conference on the above theme in Warsaw on 7 September 2010. The two panels covered trends in Russian foreign policy and the prospects for the modernisation agenda. Many Polish speakers noted the positive change in Polish-Russian relations and the accompanying disappointment with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Opening the conference, former Foreign Minister, Adam Rotfeld, said that one had to distinguish between Russian official statements and doctrines, usually aimed at domestic audiences, and practice. There was little intellectual coherence in using terms such as ‘sovereign democracy’ while Russians tied themselves in knots trying to justify a special sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. Russia was trying to secure as much assistance from the EU as it could with only minimal changes to its political system. It would be a mistake for the EU to go down this path without securing real change.</p>
<p>Eugeniusz Smolar, Senior Fellow, CIR, and chair of the first panel asked whether the recent changes in Russian foreign policy were genuine. One could not separate foreign and domestic policy and here the situation remained disturbing. There was still no rule of law in Russia as the Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky cases showed.</p>
<p>Georgy Bovt, co-chair, ‘Right Deed’, doubted whether the current elite was really committed to a fundamental reform of Russia, as this would affect their interests. He was also sceptical about the attitude of the bureaucracy and thought a new generation in the key ministries would be necessary to bring about change. On EU-Russia relations, Bovt considered that there needed to be a much bigger increase in people-to-people contact. Visa liberalisation would be very helpful, although he recognised the problems.</p>
<p>Fraser Cameron, Director of the EU-Russia Centre, said that it was wrong to depict the West as having tried to weaken Russia in the 1990s. Mistakes were made but there was a genuine attempt to bring Russia closer to the West e.g. admittance to the Council of Europe and G8. In the early 2000s Russia assumed that its increased wealth thanks to oil and gas would automatically ensure a return to Great Power status. But, after September 2008, Russia was hit severely by the global crisis and this prompted a change in Russian attitudes. The Obama re-set button and the elections in Ukraine also helped change attitudes. For the EU, the question was whether Russia was interested in a comprehensive modernisation agenda, including the rule of law and fighting corruption, or just bolstering the status quo.</p>
<p>Erhard Busek, President of the EURC, noted that President Medvedev was trying to establish a Russian ‘Silicon Valley.’ This could only be successful if private investors were given a free rein – it was not something that could be done top down. Marek Dobrowski, Professor of Economics, Warsaw, said that Russia had suffered severely as a result of the global crisis. The economy was slowly improving, inflation was down and tax revenues rising. But the stabilisation fund was running out and there were few foreign investors coming back. The absence of any real plan to ensure energy efficiency was worrying.</p>
<p>Hilde Hardeman, Head of Russia Unit in the European Commission, outlined the background to the modernisation partnership. What had impressed EU leaders last autumn was President Medvedev calling for a comprehensive reform agenda. The EU was keen to support Medvedev’s ideas and had put forward a number of proposals for follow-up. The modernisation partnership could also give a boost to the PCA negotiations. There had been ten rounds of talks with four working groups: Political, Justice and Home Affairs, Economic, and Cultural, Education and Sport. The EU had just proposed a trade and investment chapter to the Russians. The talks were likely to continue for some time, perhaps years. In response to a question as to whether the modernisation partnership would succeed, Ms Hardeman said it was impossible to answer. Despite the rhetoric, there was not much evidence of real change regarding the rule of law (Khodorkovsky, Magnitsky, attitude to human rights demonstrators, etc). There was also little sign of public support for the modernisation agenda. As regards the EU budget for Russia, Ms Hardeman said that it had been reduced to 3m Euros – mainly for educational exchanges and support.</p>
<p>Alan Riley, Professor at the City University, said Russia was at a crossroads. Until recently, Gazprom was in a very dominant position in many parts of Europe. Now the gas supply situation was changing fast, mainly as a result of unconventional gas finds. Total gas reserves in Russia were 47 tcm compared to China 144 tcm, US 240 tcm, EU 35 tcm). Fifty per cent of US gas production today was from unconventional fields. LNG production was also rising rapidly. For Gazprom this was all bad news. It was likely to lose market share and was struggling to find finance for new fields.</p>
<p>Janusz Onyszkiewicz (CIR) noted the numerous problems facing Russia &#8211; demographic trends, health care, education, banking system, corruption – and speculated whether the country would stay together. There were only seven million Russians in the Far East. Kaliningrad might demand autonomy as well as the republics in the North Caucasus, taking South Ossetia and Abkhazia as examples.</p>
<p>In the discussion there were numerous questions about the rule of law in Russia, which all participants agreed was key to successful modernisation.  Riley noted that the court in Strasbourg was becoming like the supreme court for many Russians. Mr Hardeman agreed that the Council of Europe was beginning to have some positive effects on Russia.</p>

		<p>It deals in three articles with pipeline projects Nabucco and South Stream and its political importance. In an interview Germany’s former foreign minister Joschka Fischer – who is now a Nabucco-lobbyist – states that with South Stream Russia follows the political motives to end the transit of Russian gas via the Ukraine.<span id="more-16704"></span> Fischer believes that gas supply should not be applied as pressure to force the Ukraine in a closer relationship with the Kremlin. He concludes that Russia should free its economic interest of political ambitions. Premier Putin and Fischer are “grim rivals” as Putin is trying to torpedo Nabucco with all means. Recently the Russian premier declared that Nabucco had still no guaranteed gas suppliers and that it was a bad investment opportunity. The Kremlin fears to lose its monopoly on gas exports to the west, therefore Russia tries to interfere with potential Nabucco suppliers like Turkmenistan or Azerbaijan. In its editorial article the paper argues that Premier Putin is making a mistake as now everyone can see that Russia makes politics with gas and wants to drive Europe into dependence. Nabucco would be an important step to decrease the dependence on Russian gas. Therefore the EU should try to involve countries like Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine or Iraq more closely. Under Putin Russia is not a friend, but an aggressive rival which is not interested in an equal partnership.</p>

As examples here is named the recent media campaign against Belarus’ President Lukashenko or the support for the opposition in Kyrgyzstan.</p>

		<p>Here is published an article on the worsening Lithuanian Polish relationship. Warsaw’s ostentatious disappointment with Vilnius’ decision not to support the Russo-Polish initiative to lift the visa regime for the residents of Kaliningrad region may mark the beginning of a freeze in the relations between Lithuania and Poland.<span id="more-16700"></span><br/>
Russia still does not have an accurate list of the Kaliningrad region dwellers. The Lithuanians convinced that this is a matter of the national security. One of the core concerns for Vilnius during negotiations in 2002 for the EU membership was to achieve that the EU would not grant a preferential visa treatment for any other third country, that is Russia and for Kaliningrad. The EU Commission has warned Lithuania and Poland from the trilateral negations and agreements. Especially, having in mind that Lithuania and Poland are unhappy about the French and German similar practices. The Kaliningrad visa facilitation problem has been created by Warsaw intentionally in order to highlight the fact to the Russians and the Polish public that there the strategic relation between Lithuania and Poland has ended.<br/>
It is probably no accident that at the same time when the Polish foreign minister in Kaliningrad was making promises to the Russians, Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius together with the cabinet’s ministers was riding on a bike through Belarus. They were welcomed like representatives of the best friend and ally of Belarus.</p>

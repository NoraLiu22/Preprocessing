<div class="note" topic="miscellaneous"><span class="heading centered smallCaps">Message of the President</span>
<p>To the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/congress" occur="5" src="named_federal_agencies">Congress</span> of the United States:</p>
<p>I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the <a href="/topn/reorganization_act_of_1949">Reorganization Act of 1949</a>, as amended.</p>
<p>In my message of <span class="date" date="1953-02-02">February 2, 1953</span>, I stated that I would send to the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/congress" occur="6" src="named_federal_agencies">Congress</span> a reorganization plan defining a new administrative status for Federal activities in health, education, and social security. This plan carries out that intention by creating a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare as one of the executive departments of the Government and by transferring to it the various units of the Federal Security Agency. The Department will be headed by a Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, who will be assisted by an Under Secretary and two Assistant Secretaries.</p>
<p>The purpose of this plan is to improve the administration of the vital health, education, and social-security functions now being carried on in the Federal Security Agency by giving them departmental rank. Such action is demanded by the importance and magnitude of these functions, which affect the well-being of millions of our citizens. The programs carried on by the Public Health Service include, for example, the conduct and promotion of research into the prevention and cure of such dangerous ailments as cancer and heart disease. The Public Health Service also administers payments to the States for the support of their health services and for urgently needed hospital construction. The Office of Education collects, analyzes, and distributes to school administrators throughout the country information relating to the organization and management of educational systems. Among its other functions is the provision of financial help to school districts burdened by activities of the United States Government. State assistance to the aged, the blind, the totally disabled, and dependent children is heavily supported by grants-in-aid administered through the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/social_security_administration" occur="2" src="named_federal_agencies">Social Security Administration</span>. The old-age and survivors insurance system and child development and welfare programs are additional responsibilities of that Administration. Other offices of the Federal Security Agency are responsible for the conduct of Federal vocational rehabilitation programs and for the enforcement of food and drug laws.</p>
<p>There should be an unremitting effort to improve those health, education, and social-security programs which have proved their value. I have already recommended the expansion of the social-security system to cover persons not now protected, the continuation of assistance to school districts whose population has been greatly increased by the expansion of defense activities, and the strengthening of our food and drug laws.</p>
<p>But good intent and high purpose are not enough; all such programs depend for their success upon efficient, responsible administration. I have recently taken action to assure that the Federal Security Administrator’s views are given proper consideration in executive councils by inviting her to attend meetings of the Cabinet. Now the establishment of the new Department provided for in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 will give the needed additional assurance that these matters will receive the full consideration they deserve in the whole operation of the Government.</p>
<p>This need has long been recognized. In 1923, President Harding proposed a <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/department_of_education" occur="2" src="named_federal_agencies">Department of Education</span> and Welfare, which was also to include health functions. In 1924, the Joint Committee on Reorganization recommended a new department similar to that suggested by President Harding. In 1932, one of President Hoover’s reorganization proposals called for the concentration of health, education, and recreational activities in a single executive department. The President’s Committee on Administrative Management in 1937 recommended the placing of health, education, and social-security functions in a Department of Social Welfare. This recommendation was partially implemented in 1939 by the creation of the Federal Security Agency—by which action the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/congress" occur="7" src="named_federal_agencies">Congress</span> indicated its approval of the grouping of these functions in a single agency. A new department could not be proposed at that time because the <a href="/topn/government_reorganization_act">Reorganization Act of 1939</a> prohibited the creation of additional executive departments. In 1949, the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government proposed the creation of a department for social security and education.</p>
<p>The present plan will make it possible to give the officials directing the Department titles indicative of their responsibilities and salaries comparable to those received by their counterparts in other executive departments. As the Under Secretary of an executive department, the Secretary’s principal assistant will be better equipped to give leadership in the Department’s organization and management activities, for which he will be primarily responsible. The plan opens the way to further administrative improvement by authorizing the Secretary to centralize services and activities common to the several agencies of the Department. It also established a uniform method of appointment for the heads of the three major constituent agencies. At present, the Surgeon General and the Commissioner of Education are appointed by the President and confirmed by the <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/cong_senate" occur="7" src="named_federal_agencies">Senate</span>, while the Commissioner for Social Security is appointed by the Federal Security Administrator. Hereafter, all three will be Presidential appointees subject to <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/cong_senate" occur="8" src="named_federal_agencies">Senate</span> confirmation.</p>
<p>I believe, and this plan reflects my conviction, that these several fields of Federal activity should continue within the framework of a single department. The plan at the same time assures that the Office of Education and the Public Health Service retain the professional and substantive responsibilities vested by law in those agencies or in their heads. The Surgeon General, the Commissioner of Education, and the Commissioner of Social Security will all have direct access to the Secretary.</p>
<p>There should be in the Department an Advisory Committee on Education, made up of persons chosen by the Secretary from outside the Federal Government, which would advise the Secretary with respect to the educational programs of the Department. I recommend the enactment of legislation authorizing the defrayal of the expenses of this Committee. The creation of such a Committee as an advisory body to the Secretary will help insure the maintenance of responsibility for the public educational system in State and local governments while preserving the national interest in education through appropriate Federal action.</p>
<p>After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the <a href="/topn/reorganization_act_of_1949">Reorganization Act of 1949</a>, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that by reason of these reorganizations, it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the new officers specified in sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the reorganization plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p>Although the effecting of the reorganizations provided for in the reorganization plan will not in itself result in immediate savings, the improvement achieved in administration will in the future allow the performance of necessary services at greater savings than present operations would permit. An itemization of these savings in advance of actual experience is not practicable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/cpd/executiveorder/14031">Ex. Ord. No. 14031</a>, <span class="date" date="2021-05-28">May 28, 2021</span>, <a aria-label="86 F.R. 29675" href="/rio/citation/86_FR_29675">86 F.R. 29675</a>, provided:</p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Section</span> 1. Policy. Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) individuals and communities are irrefutable sources of our Nation’s strength. These communities have molded the American experience, and the achievements of AA and NHPI communities make the United States stronger and more vibrant. The richness of America’s multicultural democracy is strengthened by the diversity of AA and NHPI communities and the many cultures and languages of AA and NHPI individuals in the United States.</p>
<p>Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities together constitute the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and make rich contributions to our society, our economy, and our culture. Yet for far too long, systemic barriers to equity, justice, and opportunity put the American dream out of reach of many AA and NHPI communities. Many AA and NHPI individuals face persistent disparities in socioeconomic, health, and educational outcomes. Linguistic isolation and lack of access to language-assistance services continue to lock many AA and NHPI individuals out of opportunity. Too often Federal data collection practices fail to measure, reflect, and disaggregate the diversity of AA and NHPI experiences. These practices contribute to often painful and enduring stereotypes about Asian Americans as a “model minority” and obscure disparities within AA and NHPI communities.</p>
<p>Our Nation has also seen again that anti-Asian bias, xenophobia, racism, and nativism have deep roots in our Nation. Tragic acts of anti-Asian violence have increased during the COVID–19 pandemic, casting a shadow of fear and grief over many AA and NHPI communities, in particular East Asian communities. Long before this pandemic, AA and NHPI communities in the United States—including South Asian and Southeast Asian communities—have faced persistent xenophobia, religious discrimination, racism, and violence. The Federal Government must provide the moral leadership, policies, and programs to address and end anti-Asian violence and discrimination, and advance inclusion and belonging for all AA and NHPI communities.</p>
<p>At the same time, many AA and NHPI communities, and in particular Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities, have also been disproportionately burdened by the COVID–19 public health crisis. Evidence suggests that Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are three times more likely to contract COVID–19 compared to white people and nearly twice as likely to die from the disease. On top of these health inequities, many AA and NHPI families and small businesses have faced devastating economic losses during this crisis, which must be addressed.</p>
<p>As I directed in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/cpd/executiveorder/13985">Executive Order 13985</a> of <span class="date" date="2021-01-20">January 20, 2021</span> (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government) [<a aria-label="5 U.S.C. 601" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu//uscode/text/5/601">5 U.S.C. 601</a> note], the entire Federal Government must advance equity and racial justice for underserved communities, which include AA and NHPI communities. As I established in the Presidential Memorandum of <span class="date" date="2021-01-26">January 26, 2021</span> (Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States) [<a aria-label="34 U.S.C. 30501" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu//uscode/text/34/30501">34 U.S.C. 30501</a> note], it is the policy of my Administration to address and confront racism, xenophobia, and intolerance. The purpose of this order is to build on those policies by establishing the President’s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.

<h3>Introduction: Arthur Burdett Frost (1851-1928)</h3>
<a href="eakins.jpg"><img src="eakins.jpg" height="250" border="0" class="floatright"/></a>
<p class="one">According to Frederic G. Kitton in <span class="book">Dickens and His 
Illustrators</span> (1899), Arthur Burdett Frost (1851-1928) was a member of the group of 
nine (generally British) illustrators commissioned by the London publishers 
<a href="../../../authors/wmt/pegasus/ch3a.html">Chapman and Hall</a> to provide 
"entirely fresh" (p. 221) plates for the a completely new, uniform series of volumes of 
the work of <a href="../../../authors/dickens/index.html">Charles Dickens</a> to be known 
as the <a href="../barnard/household.html">Household Edition</a>, issued between 1871 and 
1879. Frost, however, was an American painter of portraits and landscapes; to him fell 
the Harper & Bros. commission for all illustrations for <span class="book">Sketches by 
Boz</span> in their version of the Household Edition volume, in which New York political 
cartoonist <a href="../nast/index.html">Thomas Nast</a> provided the wood-engravings 
dropped into the letterpress of <span class="book">American Notes for General 
Circulation</span> and <span class="book">Pictures from Italy</span>. Moreover, Frost 
supplied twelve illustrations for the Ward, Lock, & Co. <span class="book">Pickwick 
Papers</span> issued simultaneously (perhaps for the sake of copyright) in London and New 
York. In the December 1897 issue, <span class="book">Scribner's Magazine</span> 
reproduced one of the best in that series, <span class="illustration">The Slide</span>, 
illustrating the scene of Pickwick on ice in Chapter 13 of that still vastly popular 
novel.</p>

<p>Arthur Burdett Frost (17 January 1851 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; — 22 June 
1928), although often regarded as a leading lithographer and graphic artist in the 
late-nineteenth century "Golden Age of American Illustration," was both humourist and a 
prolific painter. As in his full-page illustration for Dickens's 
<a href="3.html"><span class ="illustration">"The Tuggses at Ramsgate"</a></span> of 
Cymon Tuggs on a runaway donkey, his works often incorporate dynamic motion and sequence. 
Despite being colour-blind, Frost illustrated over ninety books and produced hundreds of 
paintings; his fort&eacute; in illustration was realistic hunting and shooting prints.</p>

<p>In 1876, the New York publishing house of Harper and Brothers, who had just signed an 
agreement with London's Chapman and Hall to produced a uniform illustrated edition of the 
complete works of the recently-deceased Dickens, hired Frost as part of the design team. 
At Harper's, he worked alongside such eminent illustrators as Thomas Nast, Howard Pyle, 
E. W. Kemble, Frederic Remington, and <a href="../reinhart/index.html">Charles Stanley 
Reinhart</a>, putting his cartooning skills to good use and developing the 
"photorealistic" style of painting. The following year, he travelled to London to study 
the cartooning techniques of British graphic artists. In 1878, he returned to his native 
Philadelphia to study the painting techniques of Thomas Eakins and William Merritt Chase 
at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.</p>

<p class="one">Clearly the publishers on either side of the Atlantic could not agree on 
the publication format for Dickens's largely non-fiction, journalistic pieces, and 
therefore made different publication decisions. Chapman and Hall, aware of the iconic 
status of Dickens's London sketches, issued these in a separate volume and elected to 
have this selection of fiction and non-fiction articles illustrated with thirty-four 
wood-engravings by their lead artist in the Household Edition project, Fred Barnard. 
Harper and Brothers of New York took a very different approach, amalgamating the three 
early works, and commissioning two very different illustrators. The well-known American 
cartoonist and political satirist Thomas Nast, who had already illustrated the American 
<span class="book">Pickwick</span> used his hyperbolic style, so well suited to 
pillorying Tammany Hall politics in New York, for <span class="book">American 
Notes</span> and <span class="book">Pictures from Italy</span>. Since so much of the 
record of the 1842 travelogue is social and political commentary, Nast's approach works 
surprisingly well as he foils the traditional society exemplified by the British Lion 
versus the radical experiment of American democracy, as symbolised by an eagle dressed as 
if he were Uncle Sam, in short jacket and striped trousers. On the other hand, his 
somewhat fanciful and cartoonish approach to <span class="book">Pictures from 
Italy</span>, which is less successful than the realistic portraiture of 
<a href="../mstone/index.html">Marcus Stone</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Although "Scenes" contains twenty-five sketches and "Our Parish" seven, neither Frost 
nor Barnard in the Household Editions appears to have been much interested in these 
essentially non-fiction articles. In Frost's 28 illustrations, he devotes only three to 
"Our Parish," but fully twelve  to "Tales," which contains twelve short stories. 
Similarly, of Barnard's thirty-four illustrations, only eleven concern the twenty-five 
sketches in "Scenes," but Barnard places an emphasis on illustrating Dickens's short 
fiction: he devotes sixteen illustrations to the twelve selections in "Tales." Sadly, 
Frost's work on <span class="book">Sketches by Boz</span> is far inferior to most of 
Barnard's much more ample illustrations for the same work. However, the American in 
London, working on <span class="book">American Notes for General Circulation</span> 
produced some inspired, highly realistic realisations of Dickens's descriptions of Yankee 
culture and mores.</p

			  </div>
	
	<p class="summary">On April 29, 2005, The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  released the first ever comprehensive and systematic review of all 169 volcanoes in the United States. The report, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070210050433/http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1164/">An Assessment of Volcanic Threat and Monitoring Capabilities in the United States: Framework for a National Volcano Early Warning System</a>, establishes a framework for a National Volcano Early Warning System (NVEWS), "which calls for a 24-hour seven-day-a-week Volcano Watch Office and enhanced instrumentation and monitoring at targeted volcanoes". Each of the 169 volcanoes were divided into five threat groups: Very High, High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070210050433/http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=699">USGS press release on NVEWS</a> summarizes the 37 volcanoes in the Very High threat group and mentions an additional 21 under-monitored volcanoes. Yellowstone is one of the 21 under-monitored volcanoes in the High threat group. <b>This does not mean that the geologic conditions at Yellowstone have changed.</b> The activity at Yellowstone remains consistent with historical levels.</p>

    <p class="summary">Yellowstone has experienced several giant volcanic eruptions in the past few million years, as well as many smaller eruptions and steam explosions. To improve our understanding of the volcanic, seismic, and hydrothermal hazards, scientists study and monitor activity at Yellowstone.

Swarms can occur on volcanoes or in tectonically active areas. There have been many swarms recorded over the past 40 years at Yellowstone.

	    Park Biologists Discover Five Dead Bison</a></div>
    <div class="post">03/10/2004</div>
			  </div>
			  <p class="summary">On March 10, 2004, Yellowstone Park biologists discovered 5 dead bison along the Gibbon River near Norris geyser basin. The bison appeared to have died about one week earlier due to inhalation of toxic geothermal gases. The gases, most probably CO<sub>2</sub> and/or H<sub>2</sub>S, likely accumulated in a low area due to very cold windless conditions. Though such events are rare, over the Park's 132-year history similar animal kills have occurred several times.  Visitors can safely view Yellowstone's thermal areas by staying on designated trails and boardwalks.

	<center>WHY THIS RESOURCE IS FREE</center>
<P>
Lately, we've been asked by a disturbing number of people why we don't
restrict access to this site.  Some institutions have even suggested
that money would be more forthcoming if we agreed to do this, or at
least to cooperate with their plans for a new e-print system in which
the user pays for anything not current.
<P>
We don't think it would improve service to be less helpful to the public.

<P>
For the last several centuries, the trend in libraries has been to
admit more and more people, and to charge them, as individuals,
nothing.  ``Free to All,'' as it says on the Victorian fa&ccedil;ade of 
the public library here in Boston (and of every Carnegie-endowed
library in the country).  Why change this just when a world library
comes within reach?
<P>
If older e-prints were to be withdrawn from free circulation upon 
publication in journals, and access thereafter restricted to paying
subscribers, science would be taking a huge step backwards.  It is
true that large rich universities in wealthy countries might buy site
licenses for all their students and faculty---but why should this 
elite be the only group to benefit from the cheapest publishing
system in history?
<P>
Free access to literature is not a revolutionary, hare-brained idea.
It is the conservative ideology of Marian the Librarian.  Support 
traditional values:  keep knowledge free.

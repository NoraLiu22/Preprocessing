        <h1>Gastronomical map of Cyprus</h1>
        <p>Halloumi Halloumi (fresh and mature) is a type of cheese produced from sheep or goat milk or a mixture of the two, with or without cowmilk. Halloumi production has been known in Cyprus since the old days. A plethora of Cyprus-related written sources refer to the product, most evidently the manuscript of Duke Leonardo Dona, dated to 1556, that makes reference to“calumi”. Halloumi is registered as a PDO since 13/4/2021. Gastronomy: The particularity of Halloumi not to melt at high temperatures allows it to be consumed both as it is as well as fried, grilled etc. Furthermore, Halloumi is consumed with watermelon, grated onto pasta or supplements soups (mostly Trahanas). It is also used as an ingredient in various baked goods, e.g. Halloumi pies and Bourekia. Anari Anari is soft whey cheese, a by-product derived from the production of Halloumi. Made all year round, it is available as both fresh and dried cheese, either salted or unsalted. Anari has been typically linked to the history of Halloumi. It is, nevertheless, a separate product, which holds a special place in the daily life of the Cypriots from days of old. Gastronomy: Fresh Anari may be served as part of a cheese platter and be consumed as such. Unsalted Anari may be pairedwith honey, carob syrup, epsima or sugar for breakfast or as afternoon dessert. Itmay also be used for the production of sweet desserts such as Bourekia, Anari-pie etc. Salted dry Anari is used as grated cheese for pasta. Trahanas Trahanas is a dried fermented product produced during the summer fromsour sheep and/or goat milk andwheat. The soup obtained fromboiling the driedproduct inwater is also calledTrahanas. Because of its rough texture, theword“Trahanas” most probably originates from the word “trahonas”, meaning rough-textured soil. Gastronomy: Consumed as a soup, especially during winter, Trahanas is often cooked in chicken broth with pieces of Halloumi. Cyprus table olives (Kypriaki epitrapezia elia) The olive tree and its products have always played a primary role in the Cypriot household as part of the usual diet, religious rituals, etc. 1 2 3 4 Indications of table olive exports are innumerable since ancient times. The Cyprus table olive is produced by the processing of the Cypriot local variety which is cultivated throughout the island. Gastronomy: Part of the daily diet of the Cypriots, it is served as part of breakfast, as a side dish or as a constituent in salads and other appetizers. It is also used in pastry and bakery. Cyprus extra virgin olive oil (Kypriako extra partheno eleolado) Cyprus olive oil is extra-virgin oil produced by the processing of the Cypriot local variety. The main olive-producing areas are scattered throughout the island up to an altitude of about 700 m. Gastronomy: It is used in appetizers, salads, as a spread on bread, for frying and also to marinate meat. It is also used in various foods and sweets. Cyprus blossom honey (Kypriako meli antheon) Honey is a food item produced by bees as they collect nectar or honeydew from the live parts of plants, carry it, enrich it and store it in their honeycombs until maturation – which is how it is distinguished between flower honey and honeydewhoney. The Cypriot honey exclusively denotes flower honey. Thyme, citrus fruit and fishbone thistle (wild rosemary) etc. are considered important bee-friendly plants. Cypriot honey has a long history, its fine quality being renowned since days of old, as evidenced by a plethora of bibliographical references as well as by archaeological finds. Gastronomy: Honey is part and parcel of the Cypriot gastronomical tradition. It may be consumed paired with other desserts such as yoghurt, fresh Anari, roasted Halloumi etc. It can also be used as a sweetener in beverages or as a spread on bread. Honey is also used in cooking and pastry, for instance in a variety of traditional syrup sweets such as anari-pie, tsippopitta, dahtyla and pites-tis-satzis but also to impart a sweet taste to various food products. Spoon sweets (Glyka tou koutaliou) Spoon sweets are made from almost every fresh fruit and vegetable, preserved in thick syrup. The sweets maintain the flavour and fragrance of the product from which they are made. Their name derives from the way in which they are served: in earlier times, spoon sweets were served in a dish surrounded by teaspoons. Each guest would use a teaspoon to collect the dessert, wishing the hostess “bless your hands”and drinking cool water. On other occasions, spoon sweets were offered separately to each guest in a small dish with the teaspoon placed upon a glass of cold water. Spoon sweets appear to have become part of the lives of the Cypriots when sugarcane cultivation and sugar production were introduced to the island during Frankish rule. Gastronomy: Spoon sweets are consumed on their own as desserts and they are also offered as treats to guests or used in pastry-making. 5 6 7 Traditional pastries Cypriot gastronomy includes a rich collection of baked food made of flour and water (dough). This is due to the fact that since antiquity wheat and barley were primary agricultural and exportable products. Necessary for survival, on several occasions they were also rich in symbolism, connected as they were to religious celebrations, social events and other aspects of the daily life of the Cypriots. The following are the most distinctive products: Spit pasta or pasta-on-a-spit (Makaronia tis Smilas) or holey (Trypita) or “rovanata”: Traditional pasta with a hole running through the centre. Its name derives from the tool used for making it, namely the spit made of cane or “sklinidjin”, around which dough was wrapped. When the spit was removed, it left behind a hole, which explains the name “holey”. Spit pasta was mainly a festive food itemmade and consumed during weddings or during the Carnival period [“Sikoses”] or Sunday lunch. When intended for a social event such as a wedding it was made collectively by the women of the village. Gastronomy: Spit pasta is made in the traditional way to this day. It is also available for purchase and consumed like any other type of pasta. “Tertziellouthkia” or “koullourouthkia” or “loullouthkia”: Traditional pastries consumed mainly as sweet desserts. Their name derives from the way they were stamped into shape by housewives (“tertzelli”denotes a small bagel, a flower) which varied according to the region. They were made and consumed mostly during fasting as well as on other occasions such as carob harvesting etc. Gastronomy: The “tertziellouthkia” are also offered for sale in the retail trade. They may be consumed as dessert once baked in waterthinned honey, epsima or carob honey. They are served in a deep dish with some of the sweet broth in which they are baked. Glydjista: A type of dessert made from dough, its shape varies across regions: it can either resemble a rhombus, a baklava or a bow. The glydjistaweremainly associatedwith significant events such as weddings or births or religious feasts. Also, during the Carnival period, every familywould traditionallymake its own glydjista. Of note is the fact that since 2017 the Glydjista have been included in the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Gastronomy: Today, the glydjista are served as a sweet dessert at various events or local celebrations. Flaouna Flaouna is a baked good, its main ingredients being Flaouna cheese and eggs. It is made during Easter throughout Cyprus. Flaouna has a square, triangular or round shape and can be either sweet or salty. In the villages of the Pafos district, the “Paskia” variety is made, namely round, palm-sized Flaouna containing small pieces of fried meat with herbs. Gastronomy: Consumed either warm or cold, accompanying various beverages. 9 8 Zalatina (brawn) Zalatina is a traditional Cypriot delicacy made of small pieces of boiled pork in light semiset jelly of an off-white colour. Zalatina, of a pleasantly sour taste, is also called “tremoura”, meaning“shaky”, because of the trembling impression it gives when held with a fork. In days of old, when there were no refrigerants, the making of zalatina was a way to preserve meat for long periods of time. Gastronomy: Zalatina is served as a type of meze, mostly during winter months, especially during the period before Lent. Soutzioukkos, Ppalouzes, Kkiofterka, Epsima, Portos These five traditional sweets are made in every vine-cultivating area across Cyprus from grape juice that is sieved and boiled (“moustos”). The main ingredient for soutzioukkos, ppalouzes and kkiofterka is “moustalevria”, namely grape must (grape juice gradually mixed with flour while boiling until it sets). Soutzioukkos: Almonds or walnuts, immersed in hot grape must (ppalouzes), are kneaded on threads with a needle and the two edges of each thread are tied to a tree branch (V shape). Each time the threads are immersed in the mixture, they are hung to cool and dry. This immersion / hanging procedure is repeated 4–5 times until enough of the mixture sticks around the nuts in layers. Ppalouzes: Grape is placed in trays to cool down. Crushed almonds or walnuts are sprinkled on the surface. Kkiofterka: Small, either square or rectangular sun-dried pieces of Ppalouzes. Epsima: Viscous syrup created when the grape juice is left to set after boiling. Portos: Crushed wheat is added to the hot grape juice. With constant stirring and warming, Portos is formed. Roasted sesame can be added. Gastronomy: Soutzioukkos/Ppalouzes/Kkiofterka are often served with drinks, especially Zivania. Ppalouzes is also consumed either cold or warm as a dessert. Epsima is used for the production of various sweets or as a substitute to honey and sugar. Portos belongs to the category of jams. Pafos peanuts (Pafitiko fystiki) Pafos peanuts are the edible seed of the plant Arachis hypogaea, commonly known as Arabian peanut or “fistouki” in the Cypriot dialect. Its fruit, grown underground, is a pod that looks like soft straw; when pressed between 11 12 10 the fingers, it is cracked open to reveal edible seeds (peanuts). Today, peanuts are mostly grown in the coastal lowlands of Pafos, more specifically in the villages of Acheleia, Anarita, Geroskipou, Kouklia, Mandria, Nikokleia, Timi. Production corresponds to approximately 120 tons. Gastronomy: Pafos peanuts are largely consumed roasted and salted, paired with alcoholic drinks. They are also used in confectionery. A quite unique usagewould be their combination with carob honey or honey for the production of “pasteli” with dried nuts (“kounnes”) or “pastelaki”as is known in Cyprus. Pafos gum (Pafitiki pissa) Pafos gum is produced from the resin of the pistachio tree (Pistaciaatlanticasubsp. Cypricola). It is hard, with the distinctively strong taste of resin. According to Giovani Mariti, who lived on the island between 1760-1767, the Cypriot gum was collected from pistachio trees mainly in Pafos and was of great repute, especially in Venice. Today, resin is imported. The production centre for Pafos gum is Geroskipou, where one can find small factories still largely following the traditional production method. Gastronomy: Used exclusively for chewing. Pafos cheese (Pafitiko tyri) Pafos cheese is produced during Easter in the Pafos district. It is made of sheep or goat milk or a mixture of the two, and has a hard and yellowish outer texture with the characteristic imprints of the“talari” (the container in which it is cooked).

<H2>Wild About Harry (2001)</H2>

<P>D: Declan Lowney<BR>
S: Brendan Gleeson, Amanda Donohoe</P>

<P>Mildly funny and dramatically obvious comedy from the pen of Colin Bateman
(<I><A HREF="divj.htm">Divorcing Jack</A></I>, <I><A HREF="cycv.htm">Cycle
of Violence</A></I>), pleasant enough, well acted, and generally entertaining,
but not especially inspiring. Popular TV Chef Harry McGee (Brendan Gleeson)
is at the end of his marriage and in the midst of a divorce when he is attacked
by restless youths and loses his memory. After a breakdown on screen in
which he disgraces a local politician (James Nesbitt), he awakes in hospital
convinced that he is eighteen years old and still dating his wife Ruth (Amanda
Donohoe). Is this a second chance for them both? Likable and optimistic,
Harry is now open to suggestion, and is convinced by Ruth that he is a clean
living good guy instead of the boorish, drunken swine he really is. But
as evidence mounts, not least of all the hostility of his son, Harry begins
to explore his relationships from the outside and sees himself more clearly
than ever. Can he win back his wife? Will the disgraced politician get revenge?
Is this an allegory for the peace process in Northern Ireland?</P>

<P>Stop the lights. What was that last one? Well, <I>Wild About Harry</I>
is probably best understood relative to the politics of Northern Ireland,
because as an emotional and psychological drama, it falls somewhere between
a sitcom and a TV movie. If read as a film which reflects socially and politically
concurrent attempts to reconcile quarrelling factions, it becomes a bit
more interesting, if no less obvious. It is not particularly difficult to
find oneself pushed in the direction of reading it as allegory, not least
of all given the representation of the city of Belfast in its post-sectarian
phase, with City Hall a brightly-lit blue-tinged Eurocity icon bereft of
its 'Ulster Says No' banner. In fact, this is the least political of the
Colin Bateman films to date, and the one which offers the least amount of
challenges to either the viewer or the country in which it is set.</P>

<P>The dramatic core of the film is the question of what constitutes a second
chance. The ethical dilemma Ruth faces is that in moulding her husband to
her ideal, she is not facing up to the reality of her past experience. Her
skeptical solicitor (Bronagh Gallagher) keeps reminding her that she has
Harry on the ropes, and that her suffering at his unfaithful, drunken hands
was not conducive to a happy future regardless of his apparent change of
attitude. Meanwhile Harry is faced with the dilemma of knowing that he has
been given this chance to win her back on borrowed time. It is only a matter
of technicalities that keeps him in their house, and there really is no
reason why his past should be forgotten. Again, it does not take much thinking
before one finds oneself seeing how this applies to the turbulent politics
of the island of Ireland. Though Bateman may not have been trying to make
it this into a political statement, it does eventually read like a kind
of metaphorical contribution to the debate, somewhat like <I><A HREF="ald.htm">A
Love Divided</A></I>.</P>

<P>None of this makes the film any better. It just makes it easier to talk
about in context. As a comedy, <I>Wild About Harry</I> has one or two funny
scenes, one or two good one liners, and a couple of amusing characters.
It lacks the verve and sparkle of the other Bateman adaptations, and certainly
has none of the ferocity of <I><A HREF="divj.htm">Divorcing Jack</A>.</I>
It is a deliberately mild-mannered movie in which the few moments of outrageous
farce stand out all too glaringly from the rest. It is held aloft by well-meaning
performances from all concerned. Gleeson handles both the early and later
scenes with a winning balance of believable humanity, never condescending
to pathos in spite of the opportunities. Donohoe comes across as strong
and smart in a way which carries the role past the unlikely contrivance,
and this pays off particularly well at the film's resolution. Supporting
turns from Adrian Dunbar and Bronagh Gallagher are able enough, as is a
turn from George Wendt as Harry's long-suffering producer. Nesbitt doesn't
have his finest hour here, but he does get to portray a series of scenes
of mounting comic-hysterical madness which pay off with a cross-dressing
incident which provides the film with its climax.</P>

<P>Again with something of the timbre of a sitcom or TV movie, the whole
thing is professionally done and fills the time easily enough. <I>Wild About
Harry</I> is not likely to generate much genuine admiration though, other
than a mild round of applause for a job capably done. Bateman has done better,
and he probably knows it. At least he keeps working, which of course means
that he can always do better again.</P>

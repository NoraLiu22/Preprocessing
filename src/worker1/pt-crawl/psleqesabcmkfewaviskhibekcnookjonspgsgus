<p class="one">Cartoonist, caricaturist, and illustrator 
famous for his work for <a href="../../../periodicals/punch/pva44.html"><span
class="book">Punch</span></a>, Leech was educated at <a href="../../../history/education/charterhouse.html">Charterhouse</a>, and then studied 
medicine, but turned to art. From 1841 he contributed hundreds of sketches of 
middle-class life and political cartoons to <span class="book">Punch</span>, as well as 
to the <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/intro.html"><span class="book">Illustrated 
London News</span></a> (1843 onward) and 
<a href="../../../periodicals/onceaweek.html"><span class="book">Once a Week</span></a>
(1859-62). He illustrated several books, including Dickens's 
<a href="../carol/gallery.html"><span class="book">A Christmas Carol</span> (1843) and 
the sporting novels of R. S. Surtees.</p>

<p> John Leech, the son of a coffee house proprietor, was born in London on 29 August, 
1817. He was educated at Charterhouse, while <a href="../../../authors/wmt/wmtov.html">W. 
M. Thackeray</a> was still a student there, and at the age of sixteen he went to St.
Bartholomew's Hospital to study medicine. Leech's teachers soon became aware of Leech's
superb anatomical drawings and began commissioning him to paint portraits. He was one of
the artists considered to replace <a href="../seymour/index.html">Robert Seymour</a> for 
<a href="../../../authors/dickens/pickwick/index.html"><span class="book">The 
Pickwick Papers</span></a> (1836-37) and, although not selected, Leech left medical 
school and in order to make a living from drawing and painting. His first known published 
work was a pamphlet called <span class="book">Etchings and Sketchings, By A Pen, 
Esq.</span> (1835), which included drawings of street characters such as cabmen, 
policemen, and street musicians — the very sort of people who inhabit the early 
<span class="book">Sketches by Boz</span>. Over the next few years he produced a series 
of humourous pamphlets including the <span class="book">Comic Latin Grammar</span>, <span 
class="book">The Fiddle-Faddle Fashion Book</span> and <span class="book">The Children of 
Mobility</span>. His work during this early period also included illustrations for the 
magazine <span class="book">Bell's Life in London</span>. Although influenced by the satirical 
work of James Gillray and <a href="../cruikshank/index.html">George Cruikshank</a>, Leech's 
humour was as one critic pointed out "less grotesque, less boisterous, less exaggerated, nearer to 
the truth and to ordinary experience."</p>

<p> In 1840 Leech was employed by the <span class="book">London Magazine</span> to supply
illustrations. The following year he was recruited by a new journal of humour, founded by
Mark Lemon and Henry Mayhew. Leech's comic drawings proved extremely popular, and were 
one of the main reasons why the new magazine, 
<a href="../../../periodicals/punch/pva44.html"><span class="book">Punch</span></a>, 
became such a great success. Over the next twenty-three years <span 
class="book">Punch; or, The London Charivari</span> published some 3,000 of Leech's 
drawings and 600 cartoons. J. A. Hammerton (1910) notes that "Leech was a great 
attraction of <span class="book"> Punch</span> in those days, and his unrivalled power of 
graphic humour largely contributed to the successful founding of that unique journal" 
(14). A significant percentage of Leech's drawings dealt with political issues. Like the 
editors of the magazine, Lemon and Mayhew, Leech held fairly radical views. Between 1842 
and 1845 Leech produced a series of cartoons such as <span class="illustration">Cheap 
Clothing</span> and <span class="illustration">The Agricultural Question</span>, which 
are critical of the dubious morality of the capitalist system. In the cartoon 
<a href="101.html"><span class="book">Mr. Punch's Big Cut, Cartoon, No. I: Substance 
and Shadow</span></a> (1843), often regarded as the world's first political cartoon, 
Leech by implication criticized contemporary artists for ignoring social issues such as
poverty. One may assume that his depiction of <a href="../carol/6.html">Ignorance and 
Want</a> in <a href="../../../authors/dickens/xmas/index.html"><span class="book">A 
Christmas Carol</span></a> (1843) is a graphic exemplar of how the artist with a social
conscience may address such issues.</p>

<H1> Lives of the Hellenistic Poets </H1>
<BR>

<P><I> These short biographies were attached to the ancient commentaries (<I>Scholia</I>) on the poets.  In most cases, the lives have been preserved in several different versions in the manuscripts.  In their final form, they all date from the Byzantine period, but their content is derived from earlier biographies.</I>

<P><I> There are lives of <A HREF="#apollonius0">Apollonius of Rhodes</A> , <A HREF="#aratus0">Aratus of Soli</A> , <A HREF="#lycophron0">Lycophron</A> , <A HREF="#menander0">Menander</A> , <A HREF="#nicander0">Nicander</A> and <A HREF="#theocritus0">Theocritus</A> .</I><BR><BR>

<LI> <I>The lives are translated from the Greek text in C.Wendel's edition of the Scholia. </I>
<LI> <I>The list of the directors of the library at Alexandria was found in a papyrus fragment of the 2nd century A.D. (POxy_1241).</I>

<P><B><A NAME="apollonius1">1.</A> The family of Apollonius, the poet who wrote the <I>Argonautica</I> </B>

<P> The family of Apollonius, the poet who wrote the <I>Argonautica</I>, lived in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexandria.html#1">Alexandria</A>, and belonged to the Ptolemais tribe.  He was the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/silleus.html#1">Silleus</A>, or according to some of Illeus.  He lived at the time of the third <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#3">Ptolemy</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[246-222 B.C.]</FONT>, and was a pupil of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/callimachus.html#3">Callimachus</A>.  At first, together with Callimachus his teacher ... later in life he turned to writing poems.
<P> It is said that when Apollonius was still a youth, he published a version of the <I>Argonautica</I>, but met with an unfavourable reaction.  He could not bear his dishonour amongst the citizens, or the reproaches and criticism of his fellow poets; so he left his homeland and went off to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhodes.html#1">Rhodes</A>.  There he polished up his poem and improved it; when he published it in its new form, he was held in the highest esteem, and therefore in the title of the poem he calls himself a Rhodian.  He became a distinguished teacher at Rhodes, and was rewarded by the Rhodians with citizenship and great honour.

<P><B><A NAME="apollonius2">2.</A> The life of Apollonius </B>

<P> The family of the poet Apollonius lived in Alexandria.  His father was Silleus or Illeus, and his mother was Rhode.  He was a pupil of the grammarian Callimachus at Alexandria, where he composed this poem and published it.  But the poem was a complete failure, and in his embarrassment he went off to Rhodes.  There he made his home and taught rhetoric; therefore he is called a Rhodian.  While he was staying there, he polished up his poem, and when he published it he was held in the highest esteem, so that the Rhodians rewarded him with citizenship and great honour.
<P> Some say that he returned to Alexandria, and published the poem again there to such acclaim, that he was appointed to be [? the head] of the libraries and the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/museium.html#1">Museium</A>; and he was buried next to Callimachus himself.

<P><B><A NAME="aratus1">1.</A> The family and life of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aratus.html#1">Aratus</A> </B>

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> The father of the poet Aratus was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenodorus.html#3">Athenodorus</A>, and his mother was Letophila.  He had three brothers, called Myris, Caliondas and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenodorus.html#4">Athenodorus</A>, who had the same name as his father.  Aratus mentions his brothers in the letters which are attributed to him.  <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asclepiades.html#10">Asclepiades</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apameia.html#4">Myrleia</A> in the eleventh book of his "About Grammarians" says that Aratus came from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarsus.html#1">Tarsus</A>, and not from Soli.  But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/callimachus.html#3">Callimachus</A>, a learned and trustworthy writer, says that he came from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/soli.html#1">Soli</A>, in the following lines:
<BR><I> I suspect that the poet of Soli
<BR> Has skimmed off only the sweetest of his verses</I>
<BR> - and almost all other writers agree with him.

<P> Soli was a very distinguished city in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cilicia.html#1">Cilicia</A>, the home of many excellent men; it is now called Pompeiopolis.  There is another city called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/soli.html#2">Soli</A> in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cyprus.html#1">Cyprus</A>; but the inhabitants of the Cyprian city were called <I>Solioi</I>, whereas the inhabitants of the Cilician city were called <I>Soleis</I>, as is made clear by the quotation from Callimachus above.  <FONT CLASS="green"> [<I>There follows a discussion about how adjectives are formed from city names.</I>] </FONT>

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/solon.html#1">Solon</A> mentions [Cyprian Soli] in his elegies addressed to king Cypranor, who was advised by Solon to found the city, and in gratitude for this advice named the city Soli after him.  This is what Solon says:
<BR><I> But now may you and your family long dwell
<BR> In this city as lords of the Solians,
<BR> And may <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aphrodite.html#1">Cypris</A> of the violet crown give me a safe journey
<BR> From this famous island in a swift ship.</I>

<P> Aratus lived during the reign of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#2">Antigonus</A> Gonatas, the king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonia</A>.  Antigonus was the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demetrius.html#1">Demetrius</A> Poliorcetes, and he was married to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phila.html#5">Phila</A>, the daughter of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#1">Seleucus</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stratonice.html#2">Stratonice</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT>  Because he was a lover of literature and very fond of poetry, he was eager to bring together many cultivated writers, including Aratus.  When Aratus joined the king, he was well received on account of his learning and his poetry, and he was instructed by the king to write the <I>Phaenomena</I>.  The king gave him a copy of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eudoxus.html#1">Eudoxus</A>' book entitled "Mirror" (<I>Katoptron</I>) and asked him to put Eudoxus' prose description of the stars into verse.  The king said, "You will make Eudoxus more famous (<I>eudoxoteron</I>) by putting his discoveries into verse".

<P> Antigonus was [king] in the 125th <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympiad.html#1">Olympiad</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[280-277 B.C.]</FONT>, at which time Aratus and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#15">Alexander</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aetolia.html#1">Aetolia</A> were in their prime.  In his own letters Aratus mentions the "Mirror" of Eudoxus, Antigonus, Alexander of Aetolia, and how he was requested by the king to write [the <I>Phaenomena</I>].

<P> Aratus is said to have been a student of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#9">Dionysius</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heracleia.html#1">Heracleia</A>.  He produced an edition of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/odyssey.html#1">Odyssey</A>, and so this is called the "edition of Aratus", similarly to the editions of Aristarchus and Aristophanes.  Some say that he went to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syria.html#1">Syria</A> and stayed with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#1">Antiochus</A>, who asked him to produce an edition of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/iliad.html#1">Iliad</A>, because it had been contaminated by many others.

<P> Others says that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicander.html#1">Nicander</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/colophon.html#1">Colophon</A> was a contemporary of Aratus and Antigonus; that Aratus did not know anything about astronomy and Nicander did not know anything about medicine, but nevertheless Antigonus commanded Aratus, who was a doctor, to write the <I>Phaenomena</I> and Nicander, who was an astronomer, to write the <I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/theriaca.html#1">Theriaca</A></I> and <I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexipharmaca.html#1">Alexipharmaca</A></I>; and that therefore both of them made mistakes in the technical details of their subjects.  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> But those who say this are mistaken.  They do nor realise that Nicander was not a contemporary of Aratus, but lived many years later.  For Antigonus, in whose reign Aratus lived, was king at the same time as the first and second <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#2">Ptolemy</A>; but Nicander lived during the reign of the fifth <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#5">Ptolemy</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[204-180 B.C.]</FONT>.  Callimachus mentions Aratus as being older than himself, not only in his epigrams, but also in his [letters] to Praxiphanes; he is full of praise [for Aratus] as an erudite and outstanding poet.

<P> Aratus was an admirer of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hesiodus.html#1">Hesiodus</A>, as Callimachus indicates in the epigram about him:
<BR><I> The subject and the style belong to Hesiodus; but though he is not
<BR> (?) The least of poets, I suspect that the poet of Soli
<BR> Has skimmed off only the sweetest of his verses; hail,
<BR> Subtle utterances, the earnest endeavours of Aratus.</I>

<P> Aratus wrote other books, about <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/homer.html#1">Homerus</A> and the Iliad, a Description of Bones, Medicinal Properties, a Hymn to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pan.html#1">Pan</A>, Weather Signs, <I>Scythicon</I> and other minor works; but the <I>Phaenomena</I> was his most successful poem, so much so that its fame far surpasses all other writers.  For Eudoxus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cnidus.html#1">Cnidus</A> wrote a book called <I>Phaenomena</I>, as did <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lasus.html#1">Lasus</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/magnesia.html#1">Magnesia</A> (not Lasus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hermione.html#1">Hermione</A>, but a different writer with the same name), Hermippus, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hegesianax.html#1">Hegesianax</A>, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Aristophanes of Byzantium and many others.  King Ptolemy mentions them in his "Personalities", as follows:
<BR><I> Hegesianax, Hermippus and many others

<P> There were many other distinguished men called Aratus, such as the historians, Aratus of Cnidus, author of historical works about Egypt, and (thirdly) the famous <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aratus.html#2">Aratus</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sicyon.html#1">Sicyon</A>, who wrote the "Multi-book history", containing more than 30 books.
<P> Almost all writers agree that the letters attributed to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aratus.html#1">Aratus</A>, which we mentioned above, were written by him and are genuine.  But Apollonides (?) Cepheus in the eighth book of his "Historical Fakes" says that they were written by Sabirius Pollio, and not by Aratus.  Apollonides says that Sabirius Pollio also wrote the letters which are attributed to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/euripides.html#1">Euripides</A>.

<P><B><A NAME="aratus2">2.</A> The family of the poet Aratus </B>

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> The family of the poet <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aratus.html#1">Aratus</A> lived at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/soli.html#1">Soli</A> in Cilicia.  His father was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenodorus.html#3">Athenodorus</A> and his mother was Letophila.  His father belonged to a distinguished family, who had many claims to fame, and had given good service in war.  They had even liberated their homeland on several occasions.
<P> Aratus lived at the time of king [Ptolemy] Philadelphus <FONT CLASS="green">[282-246 B.C.]</FONT>.  He was a contemporary of Alexander of Aetolia and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philetas.html#1">Philetas</A>; and also of Dionysius the philosopher, who deserted his school for a life of pleasure.  Aratus wrote an account of Dionysius' teachings.
<P> Aratus wrote various minor works; but there are four which are worthy of mention:
<UL>
<LI> Medicinal properties
<LI> The (?) cutting of the rule (<I>Kanonos Katatome</I>)
<LI> <I>Phaenomena</I>
<LI> On the rising [of the sun] - some say this was written by Hegesianax, and not by Aratus
</UL> 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Some writers think that Aratus was a doctor by training; and that he was a close friend of Nicander, an astronomer, to whom he gave the Theriaca which he had written.  In return, he received the <I>Phaenomena</I> from Nicander, and presented it as his own work.

<P> His <I>Phaenomena</I> is divided into three parts: constellations, the risings and settings of the stars, and weather signs.

<P> In the composition of the poem, he followed the style of Homerus; but some say that he was more influenced by Hesiodus.  For just as Hesiodus at the start of the "<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_and_Days">Works</A> and Days" began with a hymn to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zeus.html#1">Zeus</A>:
<BR><I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/muses.html#1">Muses</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierian_Mountains">Pieria</A>, who give praise in song, come speak of Zeus,</I>
<BR> so Aratus at the beginning of his poem said
<BR><I> Let us start with Zeus. </I>
<BR> Aratus copied Hesiodus in his account of the Golden Age, and in many other myths.  Boethus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sidon.html#1">Sidon</A> in the first book of his "On Aratus" says that he imitated Homerus rather than Hesiodus; for Aratus is much grander than Hesiodus in his style of writing.

<P> Many other writers composed <I>Phaenomena</I>, including Cleopater, Sminthes, Alexander of Aetolia, <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Alexander of Ephesus, Alexander Lycaites, Anacreon, Artemidorus and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hipparchus.html#6">Hipparchus</A>; but the brilliant power of Aratus' poem puts them all in the shade.  Aratus used the force of the natural philosophers; he said that there is one power which controls the details of the universe, including the years, the months, the days, the hours, and the risings and settings of the sun, the moon and the five planets.  He says that the earth has the shape of a spherical body in the universe; it is motionless, and its size is 252,000 stades.

<P> Some say that Aratus did not write the present introduction to the poem, but it was added later.  They say that the original start of the poem was as follows:
<BR><I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ancleides.html#1">Ancleides</A>, holy offshoot of strangers </I> <FONT CLASS="green">[ see <A HREF="#Aratus5">comment on line 733</A> ]</FONT>

<P> This is the end of our account of Aratus' life, family, education, prowess and contemporaries.

<P><B><A NAME="aratus3">3.</A> The family of Aratus </B>

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Aratus' father was Athenodorus, and his mother was Letophila.  His family lived at Soli in Cilicia, which was named after <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/solon.html#3">Solon</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lindus.html#1">Lindus</A>.  He had three brothers, Lyres, Calliondas and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenodorus.html#4">Athenodorus</A>.  According to Euphranor, this Athenodorus wrote a reply to the calumnies of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zoilus.html#1">Zoilus</A>. 

<P> Aratus became famous while he was staying with Antigonus, king of Macedonia.  Antigonus became king in the following fashion. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> After the death of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A>, Macedonia was ruled by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philippus.html#7">Philippus</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arrhidaeus.html#1">Arrhidaeus</A>.  When Arrhidaeus died, he was succeeded by Seleucus Nicanor, who was killed by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#17">Ptolemy</A> Ceraunus, the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A> Soter and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eurydice.html#3">Eurydice</A>.  <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#17">Ptolemy</A> became king of Macedonia, but he was killed by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gaul.html#1">Gauls</A>.  Then the Macedonians  
chose <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sosthenes.html#1">Sosthenes</A> as their leader, after whom <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#1">Antigonus</A> the son of Philippus became their king.  Antigonus' son was Demetrius Poliorcetes, and Demetrius' son was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#2">Antigonus</A> Gonatas.  It was this Antigonus with whom Aratus stayed, along with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persaeus.html#1">Persaeus</A> the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoic</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antagoras.html#1">Antagoras</A> of Rhodes (the author of the <I>Thebais</I>) and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#15">Alexander</A> of Aetolia, as Antigonus himself relates in his [letter] to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hieronymus.html#3">Hieronymus</A>.  After joining the king, Aratus first read to him his poem to Pan of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arcadia.html#1">Arcadia</A>, and then at the king's command he wrote the <I>Phaenomena</I>. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Aratus was an associate of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A> the Stoic, and he wrote a letter to Zenon.  He wrote very many works, according to Callimachus.

<P> Dositheus the politician says in his [letter] to Diodorus that Aratus also went to Antiochus the son of Seleucus, and stayed with him for some time.

<P> Antigonus provided Aratus with the subject matter for the <I>Phaenomena</I>; he gave him Eudoxus' book and told him to use it as his guide.  Because of this, some of the less intelligent commentators have thought that Aratus had no knowledge of astronomy. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> They suppose that the <I>Phaenomena</I> of Eudoxus was Aratus' sole source of information for the poem.  This is the opinion of Hipparchus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/bithynia.html#1">Bithynia</A>, who tries to prove it in his book "On Eudoxus and Aratus".  A similar opinion is expressed by Dionysius ... [and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/poseidonius.html#1">Poseidonius</A>] in his "Comparison of Aratus and Homerus in matters of astronomy", who says:
<BR><I>We would not consider him a doctor for writing &quot;Medicinal Properties&quot;, nor will we consider him an astronomer for writing a poem which contains nothing except what can be found in Eudoxus' book.</I>

<P> These writers are exaggerating considerably.  It takes some understanding of astronomy to know how to express the ideas; and we can find many instances in which Aratus' understanding was better than that of Eudoxus.  Callimachus, who lived at about the same time as Aratus, <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> already says "connected to the endeavours of Aratus" when talking of the study of astronomy, because of Aratus' careful observations. Many other writers wrote <I>Phaenomena</I> after Aratus, but none of them are considered worthy of note.

<P> This is the end [of our remarks] about him.

<P><B><A NAME="aratus4">4.</A> The family of Aratus </B>

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Aratus' father was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenodorus.html#3">Athenodorus</A>, and his mother was Letodora; they lived at Soli in Cilicia.  They say that the city was named after Solon of Lindus, and it is now called Pompeiopolis.  Aratus lived at the time of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#2">Ptolemy</A> Philadelphus, and he was a student of Dionysius of Heracleia.  He resided with Antigonus the king of Macedonia and his wife Phila, and he was a contemporary of Alexander of Aetolia, Callimachus, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menander.html#3">Menander</A> and Philetas.  <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> Aratus had three brothers, Myris, Calondas and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenodorus.html#4">Athenodorus</A>.  This Athenodorus is said to have been the first to reply to Zoilus' attacks on the poetry of Homerus.

<P> Aratus was a student of the philosopher Persaeus at Athens, and he accompanied Persaeus when he was summoned to Macedonia by Antigonus.  He was present at the wedding of Antigonus and Phila, where he was well received, and he spent the rest of his life in Macedonia.

<P> Antigonus was the son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and he became king in about the (?) 125th Olympiad <FONT CLASS="green">[280-277 B.C.]</FONT>, when Ptolemy Philadelphus was king of Egypt.  So the story that is put about by some, that Aratus lived at the same time as Nicander of Colophon, the writer of the <I>Theriaca</I>, is shown to be false, [that they made an agreement, Aratus to work on the <I>Phaenomena</I>, and Nicander on the <I>Theriaca</I>], because Nicander is shown to have lived twelve whole Olympiads later than Aratus.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> Some say that Aratus was the son of Mnaseas, and he was taught by an astronomer called Aristotherus.  He was trained as a doctor, and was a poet at the court of Antigonus.  He met [Callimachus] of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cyrene.html#1">Cyrene</A> when Callimachus was an old man, and was chosen to be the subject of one of his epigrams.  He was a contemporary of the astronomer Nicander, who was also one of Antigonus' circle.  Some say that Aratus was an imitator of Homerus, but others say he was more an imitator of Hesiodus.

<LI> This Lycophron
</UL>
Though some wrongly say that there were others in the Pleias.

<P> These poets lived at the time of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A> Philadelphus <FONT CLASS="green">[282-246 B.C.]</FONT> and Berenice <FONT CLASS="green">[? <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arsinoe.html#2">Arsinoe</A>]</FONT>, who were both children of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A>, son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lagus.html#1">Lagus</A>, and of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/berenice.html#1">Berenice</A>, daughter of Antigonus.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Note that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#15">Alexander</A> of Aetolia and Lycophron of Chalcis were appointed by Ptolemy Philadelphus to correct the texts of the dramatists.  Lycophron worked on the comedies, and Alexander worked on the tragedies, along with the satyr plays.  <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> Ptolemy was a great lover of literature. With the help of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demetrius.html#9">Demetrius</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phalerum.html#1">Phalerum</A> and other distinguished men, he used the royal funds to buy books from all over the world, and gathered them in two libraries in Alexandria.  The outer library had 42,800 volumes; the library inside the palace complex had 400,000 mixed volumes, and 90,000 unmixed single volumes.  <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/callimachus.html#3">Callimachus</A> later compiled a catalogue of these books.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> The king entrusted Eratosthenes, a contemporary of Callimachus, with the management of this library.  The books which were collected there came not only from the Greeks, but from all other nations, including the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrews.html#1">Hebrews</A>.  The king appointed wise men from each of the other nations, who had a good knowledge both of their own language and of the Greek language, for the purpose of translating their books into Greek.

<P> As I said previously, Alexander and Lycophron corrected the texts of the dramatists; the texts of the poets were corrected first by Zenodotus, and later by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristarchus.html#4">Aristarchus</A>.  <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> The text of the Homeric poems, which previously had existed in various different forms, was established by 72 grammarians when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/peisistratus.html#1">Peisistratus</A> was tyrant of Athens; but later the text was revised by Aristarchus and Zenodotus, who were two of the other scholars who corrected texts at the time of Ptolemy.

<P> <I>Because this list of famous writers of comedy is of general interest, it is translated here in its entirety. The Greek text is in "Scholia in Aristophanem", edited by W.Koster.</I>

<P> They say that comedy was invented by <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susarion">Susarion.</A> Some writers say that it derived its name from the villages [<FONT CLASS="Greek">&kappa;&#974;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</FONT>]; because they used to go round the villages, singing and presenting shows, when people were living in villages, before cities came into existence. Other writers deny this; they say that the Athenians used to call their villages <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deme">demes</A>, not <FONT CLASS="Greek">&kappa;&#974;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</FONT>, and comedy was so named because they held a festival [<FONT CLASS="Greek">&#7952;&kappa;&#974;&mu;&alpha;&zeta;&omicron;&nu;</FONT>] in the streets. Another name for it was <FONT CLASS="Greek">&tau;&rho;&upsilon;&gamma;&omega;&delta;&#943;&alpha;</FONT>, either because the victors at the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lenaea.html#1">Lenaea</A> were given new wine, which they called <FONT CLASS="Greek">&tau;&rho;&#973;&xi;</FONT>, or because before masks were invented the actors used to smear their faces with the lees from new wine. There were three styles of comedy: Old Comedy, New Comedy and Middle Comedy. The poets of the Old Comedy did not have a serious purpose, but held their contests in pursuit of simple amusement. In total, 365 plays are attributed to these poets, including some plays that are spurious. The most illustrious of these poets were <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicharmus.html#1">Epicharmus,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnes_(comic_poet)">Magnes,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cratinus.html#3">Cratinus,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crates.html#1">Crates,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pherecrates.html#1">Pherecrates,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phrynichus.html#2">Phrynichus,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eupolis.html#1">Eupolis</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristophanes.html#1">Aristophanes.</A>

<P> {Epicharmus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracuse}</A> was the first to revive comedy, when it had fallen into disarray, and he made many improvments. He lived about the 73rd <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympiad.html#1">Olympiad</A> [<I>488-485 B.C.</I>]; and in his poetry he was fond of maxims, inventive and artistic. 40 of his plays have survived, of which 4 are disputed.

While the women were talking {the old man, who} had become suspicious, and especially in consequence of the information of his servant that there was a difference in personal appearance, addresses the younger of his neighbour's sons as his own. The youth discerning his mistake intimidates his brother in advance by saying that the old man was mad and was declaring every young man to be his son. Accordingly when the old man subsequently learned the truth and addressed the elder as his son the latter sends him away as being mad. At the same time ... the old man having recovered his son marries the priestess, and the son receives the daughter of his foster-parents and the younger and true son of the neighbours receives the daughter of the priestess whom he had loved, and the marriages of all three pairs are celebrated . . .

<P> The family of Theocritus, the bucolic poet, lived in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracuse</A>.  His father was Simichus, as he himself says:
<BR> <I> Son of Simichus, where are you treading in the middle of the day?</I>

He lived at the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus <FONT CLASS="green">[282-246 B.C.]</FONT>, the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A> son of Lagus.  He became extremely famous for his skill in composing bucolic poetry.  According to some, he was originally called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moschus.html#2">Moschus</A>, but was later  given the name Theocritus.

<P> Note that this Theocritus was a contemporary of Aratus, Callimachus and Nicander.  He lived at the time of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#2">Ptolemy</A> Philadelphus.

<P><B> 1 <FONT SIZE="-1">B</FONT>. The invention of bucolic poetry </B>

<P> They say that bucolic poetry was invented at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Sparta</A>, and was held in great esteem, for the following reason.  At the time of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persia.html#1">Persian</A> wars, when the whole of Greece was in a state of fear, the festival of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/artemis.html#1">Artemis</A> Caryatis was due to be celebrated.  The maidens hid themselves away, because of the alarm caused by the war, but some men from the countryside entered the temple and sang their own songs in honour of Artemis.  The goddess was pleased by their unusual music, and so the tradition was established and preserved.

<P> Others says that bucolic poetry was first performed at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyndaris.html#1">Tyndaris</A> in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sicily.html#1">Sicily</A>.  When <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/orestes.html#1">Orestes</A> took the image of Artemis away from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tauris.html#1">Tauris</A> in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythia</A>, he received an oracle, that he should wash himself in seven rivers flowing from one source.  Therefore Orestes went to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhegium.html#1">Rhegium</A> in Italy, and washed away the curse in the so-called "separated" rivers.  Then he crossed over to Tyndaris in Sicily, where the inhabitants sang their local songs in honour of the goddess, and this was the origin of the tradition.

<P> But the truth is as follows.  Once there was political discord at Syracuse, and many of the citizens were killed.  When the people came back into harmony, it seemed that Artemis had been the cause of their reconciliation.  The countrymen brought gifts to the goddess, and in their celebrations they sang songs to her.  Afterwards the songs of the countrymen became an established tradition.

<P> They say that when the men sang, they prepared a loaf with many images of wild animals on it, a pouch full of all kinds of seeds, and wine in a goatskin, to pour out as an offering for those they met.  They wore a garland, with the antlers of a deer [on their head], and a staff in their hands.  The victor in the contest received the loaf of the man he had vanquished; and the victor remained in the city of Syracuse, while the losers went out to the surrounding villages to collect food for themselves.  They sang songs full of fun and laughter, and added the following propitious words:
<BR><I> Receive good fortune,
<BR> Receive good health,
<BR> Which we bring from the goddess,

<P> The family of Theocritus, the bucolic poet, lived in Syracuse.  His father was Praxagoras, and his mother was Philina.  For the same "Simichidas" is said not to be derived from his father, but to be a nickname, because he was snub-nosed (<I>simos</I>).  Theocritus was a pupil of Philetas and Asclepiades, both of whom he mentions.  He lived at the time of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A> son of Lagus.

<P> At the festival of Adonis, the inhabitants of Alexandria used to adorn the statues of Adonis and escort them in traditional fashion down to the sea.  When the Syracusan women leave their house, they are astonished by the crowd and by what is happening in the crowd. 

<P> Theocritus wrote this poem while he was staying at Alexandria, to please the queen.  He describes the violent commotion of the men, and the singer who in her song extols the lavishness of Arsinoe.

<P><B><A NAME="theocritus16"> Idyll 16 </A> </B>

<P> This idyll is addressed to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hieron.html#2">Hieron</A> son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hierocles.html#1">Hierocles</A>, the last tyrant of Syracuse.  Hieron came to power after he was appointed general by the citizens, and he destroyed the forces [of their enemies]; as a result, he was proclaimed tyrant.  [After him, Hieronymus the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gelon.html#3">Gelon</A> was ruler of Sicily.] 

<P> Because Theocritus received nothing from Hieron, he composed this idyll, which has as its title "The <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/graces.html#1">Graces</A>" [or "The Favours"].  It tells the story of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/simonides.html#1">Simonides</A>' boxes.  It is said that Simonides had two boxes, one of favours, and one of sponsors.  When someone came to ask him for a favour, Simonides told him to bring the boxes and open them up for inspection.  The box of favours was found to be empty, and the box of sponsors was full; and in this way he rebuffed the man who asked for a favour.   

<P><B><A NAME="theocritus17"> Idyll 17 </A> </B>

<P> This idyll is addressed to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#2">Ptolemy</A> Philadelphus, who was the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A>, son of Lagus, and of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/berenice.html#1">Berenice</A>.  Therefore <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/munatius.html#1">Munatius</A> is wrong to make [<A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#4">Ptolemy</A>] Philopator a contemporary of Theocritus, when there is such a difference in time between them. 

<P> There were three kings called Ptolemy:
<UL>
<LI> Ptolemy [son of] Lagus
<LI> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#1">Ptolemy</A> Soter
<LI> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#2">Ptolemy</A> Philadelphus
</UL>
The poem is about the third of these kings.

<P> "himself and his excellent wife" : Ptolemy Philadelphus was married first to Arsino&#275; daughter of Lysimachus, who bore his children, Ptolemy and Lysimachus and Berenic&#275;.  He discovered that she was plotting <I>against him</I>, along with with Amyntas and Chrysippus the Rhodian doctor.  He put the men to death, and sent her away to Coptus in the Thebaid.  <I>Then</I> he married his own sister Arsino&#275;, and let her adopt the children who he had by the previous Arsino&#275;; for <I>Arsino&#275;</I> Philadelpus died childless.

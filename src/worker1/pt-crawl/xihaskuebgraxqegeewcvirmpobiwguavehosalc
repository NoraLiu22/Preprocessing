<P> <I><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonides_of_Smyrna">Apollonides</A> was a Greek poet who lived in the early part of the 1st century A.D.</I> 

<P> <I>All of his surviving epigrams are shown here, in the order that they appear scattered throughout the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Anthology">Greek Anthology</A>.  The labels in <FONT CLASS="ref">red</FONT> at the start of each epigram are their numbers within the Anthology.  The labels in <FONT CLASS="green">green</FONT> are the numbers assigned to the epigrams in the edition by A.S.F.Gow &amp; D.L.Page, &quot;The Greek Anthology: The Garland of Philip and Some Contemporary Epigrams&quot;. </I>

<P> <I>The translations are taken from the edition by W.R.Paton (1916-18), but have been modified to remove some of the archaic language.

When he had escaped from the burning house, straightway <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zeus.html#1">Zeus</A> launched at his head the all-powerful name of his thunderbolt.

<P>  A timid troop of horned deer, when the frozen mountain tops were covered by the snow clouds, sought refuge, poor creatures, in the river, setting off there in the hope of warming their swift limbs in the moist exhalations of the stream.

A crowd of countrymen feasted on the unsnared game that had often escaped the net and its stakes.

<P>  And when then, tell me, Sea, shall you give safe passage to ships, if we are to weep even in the days of the halcyons, the halcyons for whom the deep has ever lulled the waves to so steady a calm that they deem it more trustworthy than the land ? <FONT CLASS="green">*</FONT> &nbsp; Even now, when you boast of being a nurse stilling the pangs of child-birth, you have sunk Aristomenes with his cargo.

<P> <I>On a Statue of Pan</I> 
 
<P> I am the country-folk's god. Why do you shed for  me offerings from cups of gold, and pour me out  strong Italian wine, and bind to the stone the curved  necks of bulls ? Spare your pains ; I take no pleasure  in such sacrifices. I, Pan, the dweller on the mountains, carved from a tree-trunk, am a feaster on mutton, and drink my must from a bowl of clay.

<P> <I>On a Statue of Priapus</I>  

<P> Anaxagoras set me up here, a Priapus not standing on my feet, but resting both knees on the ground.  Phylomachus made me ; but seeing lovely Charito <FONT CLASS="green">*</FONT> &nbsp;  standing beside me, you will wonder no longer why I fell on my knees.

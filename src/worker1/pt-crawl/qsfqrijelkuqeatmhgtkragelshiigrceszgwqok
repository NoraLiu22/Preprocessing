<A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T703x">(703)</A><A NAME="T703"></A> He says, then, that the population of India is divided into seven castes:&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref53" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note53
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">53</A> the one first in honour, but the fewest in number, consists of the philosophers; and these philosophers are used, each individually, by the people making sacrifice to the gods or making offerings to the dead, but jointly by the kings at the Great Synod, as it is called, at which, at the beginning of the new year, the philosophers, one and all, come together at the gates of the king; and whatever each man has drawn up in writing or


<A ID="p69"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p69 </SPAN></A>observed as useful with reference to the prosperity of either fruits or living beings or concerning the government, he brings forward in public; and he who is thrice found false is required by law to keep silence for life, whereas he who has proved correct <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T704a">704</A> is adjudged exempt from tribute and taxes.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.40">40</A>
The second caste, he says, is that of the farmers, who are not only the most numerous, but also the most highly respected, because of their exemption from military service and right of freedom in their farming; and they do not approach a city, either because of a public disturbance or on any other business; at any rate, he says, it often happens that at the same time and place some are in battle array and are in peril of their lives against the enemy, while the farmers are ploughing or digging without peril, the latter having the former as defenders. <A ID="land_ownership"></A>The whole of the country is of royal <SPAN CLASS="whole">owner</SPAN>&shy;ship; and the farmers cultivate it for a rental in addition to paying a fourth part of the produce.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref54" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note54
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">54</A>

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.41">41</A>
The third caste is that of the shepherds and hunters, who alone are permitted to hunt, to breed cattle, and to sell or hire out beasts of burden; and in return for freeing the land from wild beasts and seed-picking birds, they receive proportionate allowances of grain from the king, leading, as they do, a wandering and tent-dwelling life. No private person is permitted to keep a horse or elephant. The possession of either is a royal privilege, and there are men to take care of them.

	<P CLASS="justify" ID="p71"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p71 </SPAN>
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.42">42</A>
The chase of the elephant is conducted as follows: they dig a deep ditch round a treeless tract about four or five stadia in circuit and bridge the entrance with a very narrow bridge; and then, letting loose into the enclosure three or four of their tamest females, they themselves lie in wait under cover in hidden huts. Now the wild elephants do not approach by day, but they make the entrance one by one at night; and when they have entered, the men close the entrance secretly; and then, leading the most courageous of their tame combatants into the enclosure, they fight it out with the wild elephants, at the same time wearing them down also by starvation; and, once the animals are worn out, the boldest of the riders secretly dismount and each creeps under the belly of his own riding-elephant, and then, starting from here, creeps under the wild elephant and binds his feet together; and when this is done, they command the tamed elephants to beat those whose feet have been bound until they fall to the ground; and when they fall, the men fasten their necks to those of the tamed elephants with thongs of raw ox-hide; and in order that the wild elephants, when they shake those who are attempting to mount them, may not shake them off, the men make incisions round their necks and put the thongs round at these incisions, so that through pain they yield to their bonds and keep quiet. Of the elephants captured, they reject those that are too old or too young for service and lead away the rest to the stalls; and then, having tied their feet to one another and their necks to a firmly planted pillar, they subdue them by hunger; <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T705a">705</A> and then they restore them with green cane and grass. After this the elephants are


<A ID="p73"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p73 </SPAN></A>taught to obey commands, some through words of command and others through being charmed by tunes and drum-beating. Those that are hard to tame are rare; for by nature the elephant is of a mild and gentle disposition, so that it is close to a rational animal; and some elephants have even taken up their riders who had fallen from loss of blood in the fight and carried them safely out of the battle, while others have fought for, and rescued, those who had crept between their fore-legs. And if in anger they have killed one of their feeders or masters, they yearn after him so strongly that through grief they abstain from food and sometimes even starve themselves to death.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.43">43</A>
They copulate and bear young like horses, mostly in the spring. It is breeding-time for the male when he is seized with frenzy and becomes ferocious; at that time he discharges a kind of fatty matter through the breathing-hole which he has beside his temples.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref55" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note55
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">55</A> And it is breeding-time for the females when this same passage is open. They are pregnant eighteen months at the most and sixteen at the least; and the mother nurses her young six years. Most of them live as long as very long-lived human beings, and some continue to live even to two hundred years, although they are subject to many diseases and are hard to cure. A remedy for eye diseases is to bathe the eyes with cow's milk; but for most diseases they are given dark wine to drink; and, in the case of wounds, melted butter


<A ID="p75"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p75 </SPAN></A>is applied to them (for it draws out the bits of iron), while ulcers are poulticed with swine's flesh. Onesicritus says that they live as long as three hundred years and in rare cases even as long as five hundred; but that they are most powerful when about two hundred years of age, and that females are pregnant for a period of ten years. And both he and others state that they are larger and stronger than the Libyan elephants; at any rate, standing up on their hind feet, they tear down battlements and pull up trees by the roots by means of the proboscis. Nearchus says that in the hunt for them foot-traps also are put at places where tracks meet, and that the wild elephants are driven together into these by the tamed ones, which latter are stronger and guided by riders; and that they are so easy to tame that they learn to throw stones at a mark and to use weapons; and that they are excellent swimmers; and that a chariot drawn by elephants is considered a very great possession, and that they are driven under yoke like camels;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref56" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note56
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">56</A> and that a woman is highly honoured if she receives an elephant as a gift from a lover. But this statement is not in agreement with that of the man who said that horse and elephant were possessed by kings alone.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref57" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note57

	<P CLASS="justify">

Nearchus says that the skins of gold-mining ants are like those of leopards. But Megasthenes speaks of these ants as follows: <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T706a">706</A> that among the Derdae, a large tribe of Indians living towards the east and in the mountains, there is a plateau approximately three thousand stadia in circuit, and that


<A ID="p77"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p77 </SPAN></A>below it are gold mines, of which the miners are ants, animals that are no smaller than foxes, are surpassingly swift, and live on the prey they catch. They dig holes in winter and heap up the earth at the mouths of the holes, like moles;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref58" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note58
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">58</A> and the gold-dust requires but little smelting. The neighbouring peoples go after it on beasts of burden by stealth, for if they go openly the ants fight it out with them and pursue them when they flee, and then, having overtaken them, exterminate both them and their beasts; but to escape being seen by the ants, the people lay out pieces of flesh of wild beasts at different places, and when the ants are drawn away from around the holes, the people take up the gold-dust and, not knowing how to smelt it, dispose of it unwrought to traders at any price it will fetch.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.45">45</A>
But since, in my account of the hunters and of the wild beasts, I have mentioned what both Megasthenes and others have said, I must go one to add the following. Nearchus wonders at the number of the reptiles and their viciousness, for he says that at the time of the inundations they flee up from the plains into the settlements that escape the inundations, and fill the houses; and that on this account, accordingly, the inhabitants not only make their beds high, but sometimes even move out of their houses when infested by too many of them; and that if the greater part of the multitude of reptiles were not destroyed by the waters, the country would be depopulated; and that the smallness of some of them is troublesome because it is difficult to guard against them, and the huge ones because of their strength,


<A ID="p79"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p79 </SPAN></A>inasmuch as vipers even sixteen cubits long are to be seen; and that charmers go around who are believed to cure the wounds; and that this is almost the only art of medicine, for the people do not have many diseases on account of the simplicity of their diet and their abstinence from wine; but that if diseases arise, they are cured by the Wise Men. But Aristobulus says that he saw none of the animals of the huge size that are everywhere talked about, except a viper nine cubits and one span long. And I myself saw one of about the same size in Aegypt that had been brought from India. He says that you have many much smaller vipers, and asps, and large scorpions, but that none of these is so troublesome as the slender little snakes that are no more than a span long, for they are found hidden in tents, in vessels,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref59" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note59
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">59</A> and in hedges;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref60" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note60
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">60</A> and that persons bitten by them bleed from every pore with anguish, and then die unless they receive aid immediately; but that aid is easy because of the virtue of the Indian roots and drugs. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T707a">707</A> He says further that crocodiles, neither numerous nor harmful to man, are to be found in the Indus, and also that most of the other animals are the same as those which are found in the Nile except the hippopotamus. Onesicritus, however, says that this animal too is found in India. And Aristobulus says that on account of the crocodiles no sea-fish swim up into the Nile except the <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">thrissa</SPAN>,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref61" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note61
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note63
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

<A ID="p81"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p81 </SPAN></A>large number of different fish in the Indus. Of the <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">carides</SPAN>,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref64" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">65</A> but the large ones as far as the confluence of the Indus and the Acesines. So much, then, is reported about the wild animals. Let me now return to Megasthenes and continue his account from the point where I left off.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.46">46</A>
After the hunters and the shepherds, he says, follows the fourth caste — the artisans, the tradesmen, and the day-labourers; and of these, some pay tribute to the state, whereas the armour-makers and ship-builders receive wages and provisions, at a published scale, from the king, for they work for him alone; and arms are furnished the soldiers by the <SPAN CLASS="whole">commander-in‑chief</SPAN>, whereas the ships are let out for hire to sailors and merchants by the admiral.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.47">47</A>
The fifth caste is that of the warriors, who, when they are not in service, spend their lives in idleness and at drinking-bouts, being maintained at the expense of the royal treasury; so that they make their expeditions quickly when need arises, since they bring nothing else of their own but their bodies.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.48">48</A>
The sixth is that of the inspectors,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref66" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note66
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">66</A> to whom it is given to inspect what is being done and report secretly to the king, using the courtesans as colleagues, the city inspectors using the city courtesans and the camp inspectors the camp courtesans; but the best and most trustworthy men are appointed to this office.

	<P CLASS="justify" ID="p83"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p83 </SPAN>
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.49">49</A>
The seventh is that of the advisers and councillors of the king, who hold the chief offices of state, the judgeships, and the administration of everything. It is not legal for a man either to marry a wife from another caste or to change one's pursuit of work from one to another; nor yet for the same man to engage in several, except in case he should be one of the philosophers, for, Megasthenes says, the philosopher is permitted to do so on account of his superiority.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.50">50</A>
Of the officials, some are market commissioners, others are city commissioners,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref67" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note67
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note69
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">69</A> as in Aegypt, and inspect the closed canals from which the water is distributed into the conduits, in order that all may have an equal use of it. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T708a">708</A> <A NAME="1.50.3"></A>The same men also have charge of the hunters and are authorized to reward or punish those who deserve either. <A NAME="1.50.4"></A>They also collect the taxes&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref70" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.51">51</A>
The city commissioners are divided into six groups of five each. One group looks after the arts of the handicraftsmen. Another group entertains strangers, for they assign them lodgings, follow closely their behaviour, giving them attendants,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref71" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#note72
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">72</A> of those who die; and they take care of


<A ID="p85"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p85 </SPAN></A>them when they are sick and bury them when they die. The third group is that of those who scrutinize births and deaths, when and how they take place, both for the sake of taxes and in order that births and deaths, whether better or worse, may not be unknown. The fourth group is that which has to do with sales and barter; and these look after measures and the fruits of the season, that the latter may be sold by stamp.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref73" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">73</A> But the same man cannot barter more than one thing without paying double taxes. The fifth group is that of those who have charge of the works made by artisans and sell these by stamp, the new apart from the old; and the man who mixes them is fined. The sixth and last group is that of those who collect a tenth part of the price of the things sold; and death is the penalty for the man who steals.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref74" HREF="

After the city commissioners there is a third joint administration, in charge of military affairs, which is also divided into six groups of five each.

These also furnish the menials, I mean

All Indians live a simple life, and especially when they are on expeditions; and neither do they enjoy useless disturbances; and on this account they behave in an orderly manner. But their greatest self-restraint pertains to theft; at any rate, Megasthenes says that when he was in the camp of Sandrocottus, although the number in camp was forty thousand, he on no day saw reports of stolen articles that were worth more than two hundred drachmae; and that too among a people who use unwritten laws only. For, he continues, they have no knowledge of written letters,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref79" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

Now these things tend to sobriety; but no man could approve those other habits of theirs — of always eating alone and of not having one common hour for all for dinner and breakfast instead of eating as each one likes; for eating in the other way is more conducive to a social and civic life.

But, contrary to their simplicity in general, they like to adorn themselves; for they wear apparel embroidered with gold, and use ornaments set with precious stones, and wear gay-coloured linen garments, and are accompanied with sun-shades; for, since they esteem beauty, they practise everything that can beautify their appearance. Further, they respect alike virtue and truth; and therefore they give no precedence even to the age of old men, unless these are also superior in wisdom. They


<A ID="p91"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p91 </SPAN></A>marry many wives, whom they purchase from their parents, and they get them in exchange for a yoke of oxen, marrying some of them for the sake of prompt obedience and the others for the sake of pleasure and numerous offspring; but if the husband does not force them to be chaste, they are permitted to prostitute themselves. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T710a">710</A> No one wears a garland when he makes sacrifice or burns incense or pours out a libation; neither do they cut the throat of the victim, but strangle it, in order that it may be given to the god in its entirety and not mutilated. Anyone caught guilty of false-witness has his hands and feet cut off, and anyone who maims a person not only suffers in return the same thing, but also has his hands cut off; and if he causes the loss of a hand or an eye of a craftsman, he is put to death. But although Megasthenes says that no Indian uses slaves, Onesicritus declares that slavery is peculiar to the Indians in the country of Musicanus, and tells what a success it is there, just as he mentions many other successes of this country, speaking of it as a country excellently governed.

Now the care of the king's person is committed to women, who also are purchased from their fathers; and the body-guards and the rest of the military force are stationed outside the gates. And a woman who kills a king when he is drunk receives as her reward the privilege of consorting with his successor; and their children succeed to the throne. Again, the king does not sleep in daytime; and even at night he is forced to change his bed from time to time because of the plots against him. Among the non-military departures he makes from his palace, one is that to the courts, where he spends


<A ID="p93"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p93 </SPAN></A>the whole day hearing cases to the end, none the less even if the hour comes for the care of his person. This care of his person consists of his being rubbed with sticks of wood, for while he is hearing the cases through, he is also rubbed by four men who stand around him and rub him. A second departure is that to the sacrifices. A third is that to a kind of Bacchic chase wherein he is surrounded by women, and, outside them, by the spear-bearers. The road is lined with ropes; and death is the penalty for anyone who passes inside the ropes to the women; and they are preceded by drum-beaters and gong-carriers. The king hunts in the fenced enclosures, shooting arrows from a platform in his chariot (two or three armed women stand beside him), and also in the unfenced hunting-grounds from an elephant; and the women ride partly in chariots, partly on horses, and partly on elephants, and they are equipped with all kinds of weapons, as they are when they go on military expeditions with the men.

Now these customs are very novel as compared with our own, but the following are still more so. For example, Megasthenes says that the men who inhabit the Caucasus have intercourse with the women in the open and that they eat the bodies of their kinsmen; and that the monkeys are stone-rollers, and, haunting precipices, roll stones down upon their pursuers; and that most of the animals which are tame in our country are wild in theirs. And he mentions horses with one horn and the head of a deer; and reeds, some straight up thirty fathoms in length, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T711a">711</A> and others lying flat on the ground fifty fathoms, and so large that some are three cubits and others six in diameter.

At all events, all he said, according to Onesicritus, tended to this, that the best teaching is that which removes pleasure and pain from the soul; and that pain and toil differ, for the former is inimical to man and the latter friendly, since man trains the body for toil in order that his opinions may be strengthened, whereby he may put a stop to dissensions and be ready to give good advice to all, both in public and in private; and that, furthermore, he had now advised Taxiles to receive Alexander, for if he received a man better than himself he would be well treated, but if inferior, he would improve him. Onesicritus says that, after saying this, Mandanis inquired whether such doctrines were taught among the Greeks; and that when he answered that Pythagoras taught such doctrines, and also bade people to abstain from meat, as did also Socrates and Diogenes, and that he himself had been a pupil of Diogenes, Mandanis replied that he regarded the Greeks as sound-minded if, but that they were wrong in one respect, in that they preferred custom to nature; for otherwise, Mandanis said,

And Onesicritus goes on to say that they inquire into numerous natural phenomena, including prognostics, rains, droughts, and diseases; and that when they depart for the city they scatter to the different market-places; and whatever they chance upon anyone carrying figs or bunches of grapes, they get fruit from that person as a free offering; but that if it is oil, it is poured down over them and they are anointed with it; and that the whole of a wealthy home is open to them, even to the women's apartments, and that they enter and share in meals and conversation; and that they regard disease of the body as a most disgraceful thing; and that he who suspects disease in his own body commits suicide through means of fire, piling a funeral pyre; and that he anoints himself, sits down on the pyre, orders it to be lighted, and burns without a motion.

Nearchus speaks of the sophists as follows: That the Brachmanes engaged in affairs of state and attend the kings as counsellors; but that the other sophists investigate natural phenomena; and that Calanus is one of these; and that their wives join them in the study of philosophy; and that the modes of life of all are severe. As for the customs of the rest of the Indians, he declares as follows: That their laws, some public and some private, are unwritten, and that they contain customs that are strange as compared with those of the other tribes; for example, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T717a">717</A> among some tribes the virgins are set before all as a prize for the man who wins the victory in a fist-fight, so that they may marry the victor without dowry; and


<A ID="p117"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p117 </SPAN></A>among other tribes different groups cultivate the crops in common on the basis of kinship, and, when they collect the produce, they each carry off a load sufficient for sustenance during the year, but burn the remainder in order to have work to do thereafter and not be idle. Their weapons, he says, consist of bow and arrows, the latter three cubits long, or a javelin, and a small shield and a broad sword three cubits long; and instead of bridles they use nose-bands, which differ but slightly from a muzzle;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref105" HREF="

Nearchus, in explaining the skill of the Indians in handiwork, says that when they saw sponges in use among the Macedonians they made imitations by sewing tufts of wool through and through with hairs and light cords and threads, and that after compressing them into felt they drew out the inserts and dyed the sponge-like felt with colours; and that makers of <A CLASS="glossary" HREF="

Among the statements made concerning India is also the following, that it is the custom, instead of making obeisance, to offer prayers to the kings and to all who are in authority and of superior rank.

As an example of the lack of agreement among the historians, let us compare their accounts of Calanus. They all agree that he went with Alexander and that he voluntarily died by fire in Alexander's presence; but their accounts of the manner in which he was burned up are not the same, and neither do they ascribe his act to the same cause. Some state it thus: that he went along as a eulogiser of the king, outside the boundaries of India, contrary to the common custom of the philosophers there, for the philosophers attend the kings in India only, guiding them in their relations with the gods, as the Magi attend the Persian kings; but that at Pasargadae he fell ill, the first illness of his life, and despatched himself during his <SPAN CLASS="whole">seventy-third</SPAN> year, paying no attention to the entreaties of the king; and that a pyre was made and a golden couch placed on it, and that he laid himself upon it, covered himself up, and was burned to death. But others state it thus: that a wooden house was built, and that it was filled with leaves and that a pyre was built on its roof, and that, being shut in as he had bidden, after the procession which he had accompanied, flung himself upon the pyre and, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T718a">718</A> like a beam of timber, was burned up along with the house. But Megasthenes says that suicide is not a dogma among the philosophers, and that those who commit suicide are judged guilty of the impetuosity of youth; that some who are by nature hardy rush to meet a blow or over precipices; whereas others, who shrink from suffering, plunge into deep waters;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref108" HREF="

<A ID="p121"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p121 </SPAN></A>and others, who are much suffering, hang themselves; and others, who have a fiery temperament, fling themselves into fire; and that such was Calanus, a man who was without self-control and a slave to the table of Alexander; and that therefore Calanus is censured, whereas Mandanis is commended; for when Alexander's messengers summoned Mandanis to visit the son of Zeus and promised that he would receive gifts if he obeyed, but punishment if he disobeyed, he replied that, in the first place, Alexander was not the son of Zeus, inasmuch as he was not ruler over even a very small part of the earth, and, secondly, that he had no need of gifts from Alexander, of which there was no satiety,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref109" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">109</A> and, thirdly, that he had no fear of threats, since India would supply him with food while he was alive, and when he died he would be released from the flesh wasted by old age and be translated to a better and purer life; and that the result was that Alexander commended him and acquiesced.

The following statements are also made by the historians: that the Indians worship Zeus and the Ganges River and the local deities.

But one must get the rest of the description from Cleitarchus.

Perhaps the more natural interpretation of the Greek would be, "the farmers cultivate it for wages, on condition of receiving a fourth part of the produce," whether "wages" and "fourth part" are appositional, or "on condition of" means, as it might, "in addition to." But Diodorus Siculus

§ 1.70</A>, yet notice there that "drugs" renders <SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">φαρμάκων</SPAN>, and "witchery" actually occurs in the Greek text, as <SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">γοητεία</SPAN>. Here, in the very next few words, Strabo goes on to use <SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">φαρμάκων</SPAN> twice, very unambiguously to mean drugs; and Prof. Jones has translated "medicaments".

As a former professional interpreter, I couldn't agree more.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
"Three interpreters", when you would think after all that one would suffice, clearly indicates that Mandanis and Onesicritus were communicating by what is called "relay interpreting": when no interpreter can be found who speaks both languages, one can work around the problem by finding a chain of interpreters, the shorter the better, who can get the conversation across; in this case, say, one guy who speaks Pali and Sanskrit, a second who speaks Sanskrit and Persian, a third Persian and Greek. The quality of the communication is decreased by the sum of each interpreter's approximations and errors: by the time you get thru a three-interpreter relay, yes, it's like talking thru mud.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 justify">
But more importantly, Mandanis points out that interpreters know their languages — but don't often have a proper understanding of the underlying subject matter they're called to interpret: and this causes horrific errors and ambiguities even when just one interpreter is involved; more mud, in sum. Back in my own professional days, I would often have to point out to prospective clients that to get decent results out of me, they'd be wise, before I ever saw the party they wanted me to interpret for, to give me at least a basic course in the subject matter: after all, they were the experts, and I was not. Some clients understood immediately; others I got to see the light; the third group were fools ("Just translate what's in front of you") and I didn't take them on; no doubt they went out and found someone giving themselves out as an interpreter, blissfully unaware of the problem (or very hungry); on at least one occasion I know they did, because months later I was called on to fix the mess!

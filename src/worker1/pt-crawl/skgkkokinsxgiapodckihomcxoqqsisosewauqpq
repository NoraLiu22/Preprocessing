<P> <b> Abstract: </b> 
When a message is transformed into a ciphertext in a way 
designed to protect both its privacy and authenticity,
there may be additional information, such as a packet header,
that travels alongside the ciphertext (at least conceptually)
and must get authenticated with it. 
We formalize and investigate this 
<i>authenticated-encryption with associated-data</i> (AEAD) problem.
Though the problem has long been addressed in cryptographic practice, 
it was never provided a definition or even a name.
We do this, and go on to look at efficient solutions for AEAD,
both in general and for the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB.
For the general setting we study two simple ways to turn an 
authenticated-encryption scheme that does not support associated-data 
into one that does:
<i>nonce stealing</i> and <i>ciphertext translation</i>
For the case of OCB 
we construct an AEAD-scheme
by combining OCB and the pseudorandom function PMAC, 
using the same key for both algorithms.
We prove that, despite "interaction"
between the two schemes when using a common key, 
the combination is sound.
We also consider achieving AEAD by the generic composition of 
a nonce-based, privacy-only encryption scheme and a pseudorandom function.

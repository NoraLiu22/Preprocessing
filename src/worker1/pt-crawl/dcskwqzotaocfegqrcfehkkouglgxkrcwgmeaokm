<h2>Publications</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society publishes a journal, <em>Heraldry in Australia</em>, three times a year, and a newsletter, <em>The Red Escutcheon</em>, six times a year.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Heraldry in Australia:</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society's journal, known as Heraldry News prior to 2017, has been published in hard copy since 1990. It is published three times a year, with feature illustrations in colour or black and white, and is A5 in size. Articles are written by members and non-members, often, but not exclusively, with an Australian focus.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>The Red Escutcheon:</h2>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society's newsletter, known simply as the Members Circular prior to issue No 183, is electronically published at least once every two months, is richly illustrated, A4 in size, and generally consists of eight pages of information and brief articles. Members are kept abreast of heraldic developments both in Australia and overseas.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Australian Municipal Heraldry:</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>Edited by Joseph P Morton, and published in 1988 by the Society (then known as the Heraldry Society - Australian Branch). This work is now out of print, but is available to members to consult or borrow from our library.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Library</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society maintains a library of published works on heraldry and related sciences. The library is stored in a storage facility in Ultimo, NSW and is presently being sorted and catalogued. The Society also maintains a small library in central Melbourne.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society swaps or otherwise receives journals and other publications from sibling societies. These are kept in our library collections, and available for members’ perusal. Some of the better-known journals collected are:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Canada: Heraldry in Canada | L’Heraldique au Canada</div>
<div> </div>
<div>England: The Heraldry Gazette</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Scotland: Tak Tent</div>
<div> </div>
<div>USA: The Armigers’ News</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Research Papers &amp; Archives</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Australian Heraldry Society's members have written a significant number of learned papers on the field of heraldry. These are often printed in our newsletters and other publications, and a larger selection is maintained within our library.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Members and others with an interest in heraldry are invited and encouraged to donate copies of their heraldic and related research papers (whether published or unpublished) to the Society's library.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The papers can be made accessible to Society members and bona fide researchers. Please contact the Secretary, in the first instance, who will happily assist you.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Archives</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society’s archival holdings include some original primary materials relating to earlier heraldry societies, such as minute books; papers and memorabilia from the collections of early heraldists and heraldic painters in Australia; and the non-current administrative records of the Society.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>These are unique or rare documents, and can be made accessible to bona fide researchers. Please contact the Secretary, in the first instance, who will happily assist you.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Online Presence</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society has the following web presences:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AustralianHeraldry</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Homepage: http://www.heraldryaustralia.org</div>

<div> </div>
<h2>Our Projects</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>The Society has a number of projects which are underway. As a volunteer-run organisation with limited resources some of these projects are inactive, simply waiting for the right person or people to pick up and continue them. Some of these projects include but are not limited to the following:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Recording of all Australian grantees of arms with grants from England, Scotland or Ireland. The vast majority of grants of arms to Australian residents or citizens and Australian-based corporate entities have come from the British Isles. Publication of details of such grants is patchy and it is not known how many have been made. Since 2004 a list of Australian Armigers by Year of Grant has been maintained, an ever-evolving document which lists the name of the grantee, the source of the grant, and where information about the grant can be found. New armigers are always being recorded. Planning is underway for an <strong>Australian Heraldic Register</strong> which it is hoped will include a record of these grants together with other arms of Australian relevance or connection.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The establishment of an Australian Heraldic Authority or similar arms granting and recording body – see further below under “Heraldic Authority in Australia” for more information about this campaign.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The John Lane Mullins Bookplate Collection Cataloguing Project – This project was begun jointly with The New Australian Bookplate Society and with the co-operation of The State Library of New South Wales, which holds the fifty or so volumes that comprise this valuable collection of bookplates and related material. While there are a number of pictorial or typographic bookplates, the majority are armorial in nature, and those Australian provenance are vital evidence of heraldic use and display in Australia. Currently in abeyance, this project will be revived as soon as volunteers become available.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Assistance to persons wishing to adopt arms in Australia or obtain a grant of arms from an overseas heraldic authority - see here for more information.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Heraldry for the Rambler</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>Heraldry is all around us, often more than we realise. The keen heraldist will, however, with a little practice and patience, develop an ‘eye’ for heraldry wherever they may be walking, driving, daydreaming or otherwise taking in the views. Some of the more common places you might find some heraldry are:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On buildings: look above street level to the pediments, parapets, over awnings, as well as in or around main entrances and gates.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In cemeteries, notably on headstones and other grave markers as well as columbaria plaques and monuments.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stained glass windows, especially in civic, church and other religious buildings, universities, schools and other educational institutions, local council buildings, buildings and structures associated with any of the armed forces, and some private houses.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Book plates and similar labels for identifying the ownership of books and other publications.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>China, pottery and similar earthenware, often for decoration but also to indicate ownership, especially of specific purpose collections such as dinner sets.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Silver plate and objects made with other precious metals, with heraldry for both decoration and to indicate ownership.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maps and charts, usually to identify the cartographer or cartographic authority, typically around the edges, near label blocks, and sometimes in ‘blank’ spaces such as extensive water bodies.</div>
<div> </div>

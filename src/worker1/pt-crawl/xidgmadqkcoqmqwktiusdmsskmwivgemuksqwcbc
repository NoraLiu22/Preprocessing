Plaintiff is the Estate of Elvis Presley (hereafter the Estate) located in Memphis, Tennessee, created by the Will of Elvis Presley and is, under the laws of the State of Tennessee, a legal entity with the power to sue and be sued. (Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 35-618; Exhibit P 26). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="18" id="pa18"> 2. The Estate came into being upon the death of Elvis Presley on August 16, 1977. (Parker, Affidavit). <span page-number="1345" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1345"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="19" id="pa19"> 3. During his career, Elvis Presley established himself as one of the premier musical talents and entertainers in the United States, Europe and other areas of the world. He was the major force behind the American Rock and Roll movement, and his influence and popularity has continued to this day. During Presley's legendary career, his talents were showcased in many ways. He performed in concert, setting attendance records and selling out houses in Las Vegas and other cities in which his tour appeared. He starred in numerous motion pictures including one entitled Viva Las Vegas, which is also the name of the movie's title song which Presley sang. He made records which sold over one million copies and appeared on television programs and in television specials made from his tour programs. (Jarvis Testimony, Tr. pp. 42-63). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="20" id="pa20"> 4. The Elvis Presley tours were billed as "Elvis in Concert," and his nightclub performances were billed as the Elvis Presley Show, while Elvis Presley shows in Las Vegas were billed simply as "Elvis." Most of Elvis Presley's record albums used the name ELVIS on the cover as part of the title. One of his albums was entitled ELVIS IN CONCERT. (Hanks, Affidavit; Jarvis Testimony, Tr. pp. 45, 49, 63; Exhibits, P 10, 12, 16). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="21" id="pa21"> 5. Elvis Presley adopted the initials TCB along with a lightning bolt design to identify entertainment services provided by him. This insignia appeared on letterheads, jackets for personnel associated with the show, a ring worn by Presley while performing, and tails of Presley's airplanes. Also, Presley's band was identified as the TCB band. (Jarvis Testimony, Tr. pp. 45-46, 53-57; Exhibits, P 17A, 17B). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22"> 6. Elvis Presley's nickname was "THE KING." (Jarvis Testimony, Tr. p. 57). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="23" id="pa23"> 7. Although Elvis Presley exhibited a range of talents and degrees of change in his personality and physical make-up during his professional career, he, in association with his personal manager, Thomas A. (Col.) Parker, developed a certain, characteristic performing style, particularly as to his live stage shows. His voice, delivery, mannerisms (such as his hips and legs gyrations), appearance and dress (especially a certain type of jumpsuit and a ring), and actions accompanying a performance (such as handing out scarves to the audience), all contributed to this Elvis Presley style of performance. (Jarvis Testimony, Tr. pp. 45-53; Exhibits P 10, 12, 16). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="24" id="pa24"> 8. One particular image or picture of Presley became closely associated with and identifiable of the entertainment provided by Elvis Presley. This image (hereafter referred to as the "Elvis pose") consisted of a picture or representation of Elvis Presley dressed in one of his characteristic jumpsuits with a microphone in his hand and apparently singing. (Exhibits P 10, 12, 16). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="25" id="pa25"> 9. Elvis Presley exploited his name, likeness, and various images during his lifetime through records, photographs, posters, merchandise, movies, and personal appearances. (Exhibits P 1, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 27; Jarvis Testimony, Tr. pp. 44-64). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="26" id="pa26"> 10. As a result of Presley's own talent, as well as of the various promotional efforts undertaken on his behalf, the popularity of Elvis Presley and his entertainment services, as identified by certain trademark and service marks, reached worldwide proportions. Elvis Presley productions achieved a reputation for a certain level of quality and performance. Goodwill attached to Presley's performances and the merchandise bearing his name and picture. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="27" id="pa27"> 11. From nearly the beginning of his life as an entertainer, Elvis Presley was represented in his career by Thomas A. (Col.) Parker. (Exhibit P 25; Parker Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="28" id="pa28"> 12. On March 26, 1956, Elvis Presley having reached age 21 entered into an agreement with Col. Parker, amending an agreement entered into in 1955 between Col. Parker and Elvis Presley and his parents, making Parker Elvis Presley's "sole and exclusive Advisor, Personal Representative and Manager in any and all fields of public and private entertainment." (Exhibit P 25). <span page-number="1346" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1346"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="29" id="pa29"> 13. Throughout Presley's professional career, Parker continued to supervise and authorize the commercialization of Presley's name, image, picture, and/or likeness. He granted different entities the right to use Elvis' name, image, picture or likeness on such merchandise as posters, statues, and buttons, for a limited time in return for a percentage on the sales of the articles involved. (Parker Affidavit). On July 26, 1956, Col. Parker, with Presley's approval, entered into an agreement with Special Projects, Inc. granting to it for a term of one (1) year a commercial license for the use of the name, photograph and likeness of Elvis Presley "in connection with the sale, marketing and exploitation of consumer items." (Exhibit P 27). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="30" id="pa30"> 14. The working relationship between Presley and Parker begun in 1955 appears to have continued throughout Presley's career. Although there are some gaps in the documents showing this relationship during the next 22 years, the evidence presented sufficiently supports their continuing association. (Parker Affidavit; Davis Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="31" id="pa31"> 15. In particular, on January 22, 1976, Elvis Presley entered into an agreement (Exhibit P 1) with Col. Parker, d/b/a All Star Shows, whereby he authorized Parker to set up tours, promotion, merchandising sales and any other medium involving the artistry of Elvis Presley and to generally act as his agent for merchandising projects, personal appearances, motion picture performances, and "any other projects involving the personal services, name, photo or any likeness of the Artist," Elvis Presley. The agreement also sets forth the responsibilities of Presley and Parker with respect to the shows. "Presley is responsible for the presentation of the stage performance" and Col. Parker handles the "advertising and promotion of the show." Thus, Presley did not authorize any rights associated directly with the performances and how they were to be conducted. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="32" id="pa32"> This agreement which recognizes Presley's existing contracts did not preclude Elvis Presley from arranging any activities, including merchandising or performing, on his own behalf. The terms of the agreement appear to negate any implication of an "assignment," which would necessarily preclude Elvis Presley himself from entering into agreements pertaining to the use of his name, likeness and image. The agreement, which was limited to a seven (7) year period, gave Parker supervision of merchandising projects and a power of attorney-in-fact for specified purposes, but did not assign or sell the rights of Elvis Presley to his name, likeness or image. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="33" id="pa33"> 16. In 1974, Boxcar Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated. Col. Parker and Elvis Presley were two of the original subscribers to the stock in the corporation. According to the charter of the corporation, it was formed for the purpose of, <i>inter alia,</i> publishing music, managing entertainers, producing records, producing motion pictures, producing entertainment, selling merchandise and otherwise generally engaging in the broad range of activities corporations may undertake. Col. Parker, Elvis Presley, and Tom Diskin, the President of Boxcar, did subscribe to shares in the corporation, for which shares Elvis Presley gave a consideration of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00). (Hanks Affidavit and Exhibits; Diskin Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="34" id="pa34"> 17. Col. Parker is the majority shareholder in and Chairman of the Board of Boxcar Enterprises, Inc. and he, under the terms of his agreement with Elvis Presley, licensed or sublicensed Boxcar Enterprises, Inc. to act on behalf of Elvis Presley to create and promote merchandise and articles using the name, likeness and image of Elvis Presley. (Exhibits P 5; Diskin Affidavit; Parker Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="35" id="pa35"> 18. There have been no licenses or assignments by Elvis Presley to Boxcar Enterprises, Inc. There have been only letters setting in writing the agreed division of the royalties and income from the sale of merchandise by Boxcar Enterprises, Inc. (Diskin Affidavit; Exhibit P 5. <i>See</i> Parker Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="36" id="pa36"> 19. The right to the commercial use of the name, likeness and image which Boxcar <span page-number="1347" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1347"></span> Enterprises has is derived from the license or sublicense granted to Boxcar by Col. Parker. Col. Parker's rights derive from the January 22, 1976 contract (Exhibit P 1) he entered into with Elvis Presley which will terminate in 1983. It is understood that the Parker-Boxcar agreement terminates at the same time. (Exhibit P 6; Diskin Affidavit. <i>See</i> Parker Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="37" id="pa37"> 20. In a letter dated August 23, 1977, one week after Elvis Presley's death, Vernon Presley, Elvis' father and the executor of Elvis' estate, asked Col. Parker to "carry on according to the same terms and conditions" of the agreement between Elvis Presley and Col. Parker dated January 22, 1976. (Exhibit P 3). In June 1979, after Vernon Presley's death, the Estate of Presley, through its representatives again reaffirmed the agreement between Col. Parker and Elvis Presley. (Exhibit P 4). The Estate's continued desire to have Col. Parker market the name, likeness and image of Elvis and, thus, obtain income for the estate is based on the Estate's position that Parker "could probably make the most of the opportunity that was there plus maintain the quality that he and Elvis had maintained throughout the period of their relationship." (Hanks Testimony Tr. pp. 22-26). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="38" id="pa38"> 21. Boxcar Enterprises, Inc. and the Estate agreed by letter dated August 24, 1977, to Boxcar's continued payment to the Estate of royalties from the sale of merchandise. (Exhibit P 2). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="39" id="pa39"> 22. Two days after Elvis Presley's death, on August 18, 1977, Boxcar Enterprises, Inc. granted an exclusive license to Factors Etc., Inc. (Factors) to use the name, likeness, characters, symbols, designs and visual representations of Elvis Presley, termed the "Feature," on merchandise throughout the world for a period of eighteen (18) months, renewable for four (4) one-year periods thereafter. The license specifically reserved to the licensor the right, title and interest to the Feature and specifically stated that the rights granted were not an assignment but only a license. The license sets forth quality control provisions for standards for the merchandise and specifically states that the rights licensed shall revert to the licensor upon the termination of the license. (Exhibit P 6; Turner Testimony, Tr. pp. 67-68). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="40" id="pa40"> 23. As an inducement for Factors Etc., Inc. to enter into the license agreement with Boxcar Enterprises, Inc., Vernon Presley as Executor of the Estate, executed the agreement on a separate page, confirming "the truth of the representations and warranties of Boxcar contained in the agreement." (Exhibit P 6). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="41" id="pa41"> 24. In the license between Boxcar and Factors, Boxcar sets forth that it "has exclusive ownership of all rights to the use of the Feature," that it is "the sole owner of the entire right, title and interest in the Feature when used in connection with . . . merchandise," and that it has the "full right, authority and power to enter into this Agreement." (Exhibit P 6). Because of Boxcar's arrangement with Col. Parker, his control of Boxcar and his exclusive representation contract of Elvis Presley for seven years (or until 1983) (Exhibit P 1; Hanks Affidavit, Minutes of First Meeting of Incorporation), these representations, considering the time period of the license to Factors, though not completely accurate, were true as far as necessary for Factor's protection to operate under the license. No one else had the license rights for merchandise but Col. Parker/Boxcar. Given the time frame of the execution of the agreement (two days after Elvis Presley's death) and knowing of the agreement (Exhibit P 1) between Elvis Presley and Col. Parker, Vernon Presley's signature as "an inducement" cannot be considered an assignment of rights or a confirmation of an assignment, but rather an affirmation of Col. Parker's/Boxcar's exclusive <i>license</i> rights for a period of years. The continued understanding of the parties confirms that there has been no assignment of rights by Elvis Presley or his Estate but merely the licensing of the right to exploit commercially Elvis Presley's name, likeness and image for merchandise for a limited period of time. (Turner Testimony, Tr. p. 67; <i>see</i> Diskin Affidavit). <span page-number="1348" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1348"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="42" id="pa42"> 25. Elvis Presley's popularity did not cease upon his death. His records and tapes are still sold in considerable dollar and unit amounts and Elvis Presley movies are still shown in theaters and on television. Elvis Presley merchandise is still in demand and sold. Also, many people travel to Memphis, Tennessee to visit Presley's gravesite and to see Graceland Mansion, his former home. The extent of Presley's continued popularity and the value and goodwill associated with him and his performances on, for example, records, film, and tape, is evidenced by the over seven (7) million dollars in royalty and licensing payments which Presley's estate received in the first two years of its existence. (Hanks Affidavit; Hanks Testimony, Tr. p. 19; Parker Affidavit. <i>See</i> Davis Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="43" id="pa43"> 26. The agreements, including the Box-car-Factors contract, relative to the commercial use of Elvis Presley's name, likeness and image are terminable. Upon their termination the existing rights to the name, likeness and image of Elvis Presley revert ultimately to the Estate. (Turner Testimony, Tr. p. 67; Diskin Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="44" id="pa44"> 27. Further, the Estate, during the existence of the agreements, that is, prior to their termination, has an interest in protecting the licensed rights not only for their value upon their reversion to it, but also to protect its continued royalties, which it receives from the licensees' sales of records, movies, merchandise and television performances of Elvis Presley. The Estate's licensees advertise and promote the marks identifying Presley's entertainment services and licensed merchandise to maintain their commercial value and goodwill. (Exhibit P 2; Hanks Testimony, Tr. pp. 18-20, 76-77). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="45" id="pa45"> 28. The Estate has entered into a license agreement for the use of the logo TCB and the lightning bolt design to identify a band composed of the members of Elvis Presley's back-up band. The Estate receives royalties. (Exhibit P 23; Jarvis Testimony, Tr. p. 55; Hanks Testimony, Tr. pp. 76-77). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="46" id="pa46"> 29. The Estate, with the agreement of Col. Parker, has entered into a movie contract with Warner Bros. Studio for a movie about Elvis Presley. (Exhibit P 22; Hanks Testimony, Tr. p. 76). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="47" id="pa47"> 30. The Estate and its licensees and sub-licensees, and during his lifetime, Elvis Presley and his representatives and those with whom he had contracts or licenses have taken actions to protect the rights of the Estate and of the licensees. (Parker, Affidavit; Davis Affidavit; Hanks Testimony, Tr. pp. 82-83). For example, the Estate has filed an opposition against the registration by defendant Russen of a trademark (Hanks Testimony, Tr. pp. 82-83) and Factors Etc., Inc. has instituted law suits.

THE BIG EL SHOW is a stage production patterned after an actual Elvis Presley stage show, albeit on a lesser scale, and featuring an individual who impersonates the late Elvis Presley by performing in the style of Presley. The performer wears the same style and design of clothing and jewelry as did Presley, hands out to the audience scarves as did Presley, sings songs made popular by Presley, wears his hair in the same style as Presley, and imitates the singing voice, distinctive poses, and body movements made famous by Presley. (Exhibit P 11, 12, 14, 15; Exhibit D to Defendant's Answer; Jarvis Testimony, Tr. pp. 45-53; Russen Deposition, pp. 27-28, 54-55, 59). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="51" id="pa51"> 33.

THE BIG EL SHOW production runs for approximately ninety minutes. The show opens with the theme from the movie "2001 &mdash; A Space Odyssey" which Elvis Presley also used to open his stage shows. (Exhibit D to Defendant's Answer; Jarvis Testimony, Tr. p. 62). The production centers on Larry Seth, "Big El," doing his Elvis Presley impersonation and features musicians called the TCB Band. The TCB Band was also the name of Elvis Presley's band; however THE BIG EL SHOW TCB Band does not consist of musicians from Presley's band. (Jarvis Testimony, Tr. pp. 53-57; Exhibits P 11, 14, 15, 17A-C, 23; Russen Deposition, pp. 53-54). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="53" id="pa53"> 35. From the inception of THE BIG EL SHOW, the star was Larry Seth. Seth, who is under a long-term contract with THE BIG EL SHOW, recently "retired" from the show; but he may return. (Russen Affidavit; <i>see</i> Russen Deposition, p. 171). THE BIG EL SHOW has continued its performances by using replacements for Seth. (Russen Deposition, pp. 91-92). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="54" id="pa54"> 36. THE BIG EL SHOW was first presented in 1975 (Russen Affidavit; Russen Deposition, p. 22; Exhibit D to Defendant's Answer) and has been performed in the United States and Canada. For example, performances have been given in cities and towns in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Nevada (one engagement at a Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas). (Russen Deposition, pp. 28-33, 37, 91; Exhibits P 14, 19, 17C; Exhibit D to Defendant's Answer). In addition, Larry Seth as the star of THE BIG EL SHOW has appeared on television talk shows in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, and on the David Suskind Show, a nationally syndicated program. (Exhibit P 17C; Russen Deposition, pp. 55-56, 167). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="55" id="pa55"> 37. Russen has advertised the production as THE BIG EL SHOW and displayed a photograph of the star, Larry Seth, or an artist's rendering of Seth dressed and posed as if in performance. The advertisements make such statements as "Reflections on a Legend . . . A Tribute to Elvis Presley," "Looks and Sounds LIKE THE KING," "12 piece Las Vegas show band." (Russen Deposition, p. 176; Exhibits P 14, 15). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="56" id="pa56"> 38. Although the various pictures and artist's rendering associated with THE BIG EL SHOW are photographs of Larry Seth, or based on such photographs (Russen Affidavit; Exhibit P 28), a reasonable viewer upon seeing the pictures alone would likely believe the individual portrayed to be Elvis Presley. Even with a side-to-side comparison of photographs of Larry Seth as Big El and of certain photographs of Elvis Presley, it is difficult, although not impossible, to discern any difference. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="57" id="pa57"> 39. On October 18, 1978, Russen applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register the name THE BIG EL SHOW and the design feature, of that name, <i>i.e.,</i> an artist's rendition of Larry Seth as Big El, as a service mark. (Exhibit P 28). Plaintiff did prepare and timely file its Notice of Opposition in the United States Patent and Trademark Office to contest the defendant's right to register the mark. (Exhibit F to Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction). The proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has been stayed by the Board pending the results in the suit before this court. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="58" id="pa58"> 40. Russen has produced or had produced for him records of THE BIG EL SHOW (including two albums and three 45 RPMs). (Russen Deposition, pp. 72-74; <i>see</i> Exhibits P 11, 13, 18). Only a limited number of these records were pressed, and they were made for sales and promotional purposes. (Russen Deposition, pp. 73-74). One record album, entitled "Viva Las Vegas" (Exhibit P 11), has on the cover of the jacket only the title and an artist's sketch which upon reasonable observation appears to be of Elvis Presley. It is only on the back of the jacket in a short blurb and in the credits that the name BIG EL SHOW appears. It is also indicated that the show stars Larry Seth as Big El and features the TCB Band. The other album (Exhibit P 13) is entitled BIG <span page-number="1350" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1350"></span> EL SHOW "In Concert" and also features an artist's drawing, ostensibly of Big El, but which looks like Elvis Presley, with microphone in hand, singing. Only one of the 45s has been presented to this court. THE BIG EL SHOW insignia (Exhibit P 28) appears on both sides. The artists are designated as Larry Seth and TCB Orchestra, on Side I, and Larry Seth and PCB [sic] Orchestra on Side II. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="59" id="pa59"> 41. In addition to selling records at performances of THE BIG EL SHOW, Russen sold Big El pendants and a button with the picture of Larry Seth as Big El. (Russen Deposition, pp. 77-78). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="60" id="pa60"> 42. Russen began to produce THE BIG EL SHOW and to use his certain identifying marks, such as THE BIG EL SHOW logo, after Presley had become famous as one of the premier performers in the world and had used and established certain marks as strongly identifying his services and the merchandise licensed or sub-licensed by him. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="61" id="pa61"> 43. Russen has never had any authorization from, license or contractual relation with Elvis Presley or with the Estate of Elvis Presley in connection with the production of THE BIG EL SHOW.

Seldin,</i> <a href="/case/warth-v-seldin#p498" class="raw-ref">422 U.S. 490, 498-99</a>, <a href="/case/warth-v-seldin#p2205" class="raw-ref">95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205</a>, <a href="/case/warth-v-seldin" class="raw-ref">45 L.Ed.2d 343</a> (1975) (emphasis in original). Plaintiff has shown that it has an economic interest in the protection of the rights it asserts, for it receives royalty or percentage payments from those who sell merchandise using the name, likeness and image of Elvis Presley. Further, it receives payments from record sales, has entered into motion picture contracts and has licensed the TCB logo. ( <i>Cf. Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/factors-etc-inc-v-pro-arts-inc-5#p222" class="raw-ref">579 F.2d 215, 222</a> (2nd Cir. 1978) (". . . income interest, continually produced from Boxcar's exclusive right of commercial exploitation should inure to Presley's estate at death like any other intangible property right.")). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="65" id="pa65"> Perhaps an even more compelling reason for granting standing than the Estate's income from the current licensing agreements, is the Estate's protection of and future ability to generate income from those property rights, such as the use of trademarks or service marks, associated with Elvis Presley's entertainment services which became owned by Presley's estate after his death. <i>See generally</i> Trademarks and Tradenames, 74 Am.Jur.2d, &sect; 25 (1974).<a note-disclosure="2" href="#2f0a7fc6-9f61-46ac-bc0b-1627deb050c1-fn2"></a> It has been shown that those parties who have entered into agreements with Elvis Presley, or with his Estate, to make use of the name, likeness and image of Presley have been licensees. None of the agreements between Elvis Presley and others, including his manager and agent, Thomas A. (Col.) Parker, indicate that Presley assigned his right, title and interest to those property rights connected with his name, likeness and/or image. While the terms, "assignment," "exclusive license," and "license" are frequently used by courts and practitioners interchangeably, the differences are significant. An assignment passes legal and equitable title to the property while a license is mere permission to use. Assignment is the transfer of the whole of the interest in the right while in a license the owner retains the legal ownership of the property. Vandenburgh, <i>Trademark Law and Procedure,</i> 2d Ed. &sect; 7.31; Gilson, <i>Trademark Protection and Practice</i>&sect; 6.01.  </p><div note-container="2" id="2f0a7fc6-9f61-46ac-bc0b-1627deb050c1-fn2"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="66" id="pa66"> <i>See</i> the discussion, <i>infra,</i> concerning the Estate's ownership of certain trademarks and service marks.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="67" id="pa67">  <blockquote id="bq68" bq-id="68"> An assignment presupposes the transfer of the entire interest in a trademark, while a license involves the transfer of something less than the entire interest, <span page-number="1351" pagination-id="513 F.

The assignee becomes the new owner while the licensee is a mere user. <i>If the grant of an exclusive use of a trademark is limited as to duration or area, it will not confer title thereto upon the licensee</i> or upon the party who purchases the trademarked article for resale. The licensee acquires only the right to a limited use of the trademark, for the title to the reversionary interest in that use remains with the owner. . . . The licensor is merely estopped from challenging the licensee's use of the mark under the agreement. In principle, an assignment is permanent and perpetual, while a license is temporary, provisional or conditional.

Thus, even if Presley had licensed certain property rights such as service marks, the ownership of these rights and standing to protect them, remained with Presley, and, after his death became part of the assets of his estate. If, as is alleged by the plaintiff, the defendant's use of certain logos or advertising is likely to have a negative impact on these intangible property rights or on the goodwill associated with Presley or his Estate, then a sufficient reason for granting standing exists. As it has been noted with respect to trademark infringement, "[s]tanding to sue exists in anyone who `is or is likely to be damaged' by the defendant's use of the disputed mark, and the parties need not be direct competitors. <i>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v.

Our review of the available evidentiary sources indicates certain unsettled facts; however, we cannot conclude that the defendant has met his burden of proving, for the purposes of this preliminary injunction motion, laches or acquiescence. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="73" id="pa73"> In the first place, the defendant has not made a sufficient showing of implicit or explicit consent or inexcusable delay by the plaintiff. Although there is evidence that THE BIG EL SHOW, with Larry Seth starring, has been performed since 1975 (Findings of Fact # 35, # 36, <i>supra</i>), Russen's application to register the mark THE BIG EL SHOW and DESIGN states that the first use of the mark was in June of 1978. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="74" id="pa74"> Of more importance, there is a significant question as to the "knowledge and acquiescence" of the Estate or its representatives or of Elvis Presley or his representatives. Russen stated that Presley and his manager, Col. Parker, were aware of the existence of THE BIG EL SHOW, that he, Russen, had spoken via telephone with Col. Parker, in June of 1977, and that Col. Parker had indicated that neither he nor Presley had any objection to THE BIG EL SHOW being performed or using the name THE BIG EL SHOW. (Russen Affidavit). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="75" id="pa75"> This purported acceptance by Parker is apparently contradicted by Parker's statement that "[a]t no time was defendant granted any rights by me, Boxcar Enterprises or anyone on behalf of Elvis Presley, to use Elvis' name, image, picture or likeness in any theatrical or entertainment endeavor." (Parker Affidavit). In addition, Joseph Hanks, a co-executor of the Estate of Elvis Presley, indicated that the Estate's files contained no references to Russen or THE BIG EL SHOW and that neither he nor any of the co-executors authorized or approved any uses by the defendant of Elvis Presley's name or image. (Hanks Affidavit; Hanks Testimony, Tr. p. 79). Finally, as noted above, the Estate of Elvis Presley and its licensee, Factors Etc., Inc., have taken steps, in addition to the present suit, to protect the rights of the Estate. The Estate did file a timely Notice of Opposition to Russen's application to register THE BIG EL SHOW and DESIGN as a service mark (Exhibit P 28; Exhibit F to Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction), and Factors has instituted different legal actions. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="76" id="pa76"> Russen has also failed to show adequately that he was prejudiced by the delay. Although we assume Russen may have made some expenditures to produce and promote THE BIG EL SHOW and a limited number of records, Russen has failed to establish that his activities constituted the necessary prejudice. <i>See Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v.

"There is no reason why, upon a celebrity's death, advertisers should receive a windfall in the form of freedom to use with impunity the name or likeness of the deceased celebrity who may have worked his or her entire life to attain celebrity status.

In a recent law journal article, the authors conducted an extensive and thorough analysis of the cases and theories <span page-number="1356" pagination-id="513 F.

Felcher Rubin, Privacy, Publicity, and the Portrayal of Real People by the Media, [hereinafter "Portrayal"] 88 Yale L.J. 1577, 1596 (1979). They concluded that "[t]he primary social policy that determines the legal protection afforded to media portrayals<a note-disclosure="11" href="#2097ef81-1267-4bf8-9b6b-d736bbc7e05a-fn11"></a> is based on the First Amendment guarantee of free speech and press." <i>Id.</i> at 1596. Thus, the purpose of the portrayal in question must be examined to determine if it predominantly serves a social function valued by the protection of free speech. If the portrayal mainly serves the purpose of contributing information, which is not false or defamatory, to the public debate of political or social issues or of providing the free expression of creative talent which contributes to society's cultural enrichment,<a note-disclosure="12" href="#9486ebeb-0ac4-4ec8-b078-dbb9828c9cba-fn12"></a> then the portrayal generally will be immune from liability.

These three policies emphasize that a showing of identifiable harm, either non-economic or economic, supports recovery for unauthorized media portrayals where the portrayal is predominantly exploitative and not protected by First Amendment considerations. <i>Id.</i> at 1608-16. <br> Taking the two sets of principles (First Amendment concerns and identifiable harm) into account, the authors have proposed a two-step process whereby: <br>  <blockquote id="bq116" bq-id="116"> The first step is to determine whether the portrayal in question is exploitative [in that it does not serve a recognized social function of an informative or cultural nature].

Although the right of publicity is not the same as a right in a copyright, there are similarities, particularly where a personality's likeness or name is closely connected with a distinctive style of performance. In some respects this situation is similar to a copyright in a character. <i>See Wait Disney Productions v. Air Pirates,</i> <a href="/case/walt-disney-productions-v-air-pirates-2" class="raw-ref">581 F.2d 751</a> (9th Cir. 1978).

Scripps-Howard,</i> <a href="/case/zacchini-v-broadcasting-company#p573" class="raw-ref">433 U.S. 562, 573, 575-77</a>, <a href="/case/zacchini-v-broadcasting-company#p2857" class="raw-ref">97 S.Ct. 2489, 2857-2858</a>, <a href="/case/zacchini-v-broadcasting-company" class="raw-ref">53 L.Ed.2d 965</a> (1976). <br> The doctrine of fair use may provide guidance as to what types of uses of a name or likeness should be allowed. Fair use has been described as a "privilege in others than the owner of a copyright to use the copyright material in a reasonable manner without his consent, notwithstanding the monopoly granted to the owner. . . ." Ball, Copyright and Literary Property 260 (1944). (Quoted approvingly in <i>Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v.

As a general proposition, fair use cannot be invoked unless there is a substantial similarity between the two works in question. <i>See</i> Nimmer on Copyright, &sect; 13.05[A] (1979). Once this barrier is overcome, the purpose for which the work is being used is considered.

Thus, in this case, Ohio has recognized what may be the strongest case for a "right of publicity" &mdash; involving, not the appropriation of an entertainer's reputation to enhance the attractiveness of a commercial product, but the appropriation of the very activity by which the entertainer acquired his reputation in the first place.</blockquote>  <i>Id.</i> at 576, <a href="/case/zacchini-v-broadcasting-company#p2857" class="raw-ref">97 S.Ct. at 2857-2858</a>; and that the "protection [of the right of publicity] provides an economic incentive for the performer to produce a performance of interest to the public." <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="146" id="pa146"> In the present case, although the defendant has not shown a film of an Elvis Presley performance, he has engaged in a similar form of behavior by presenting a live performance starring an imitator of Elvis Presley.

After Presley's death the rights in these marks were acquired by the plaintiff, which is entrusted with the preservation and management of the property and rights of the decedent, Elvis Presley, for the benefit of Presley's heirs. The plaintiff points out that, in the fulfillment of its obligations, it has entered into a number of agreements licensing the use of the marks in various ways, including records, movies, merchandise and television performances of Presley, and that the licensees have continued to promote these trademarks and service marks. Thus, the plaintiff claims that since the service marks or trademarks are property rights and have continued to be used to identify the musical entertainment services of Presley, these marks have been inherited by and continue to exist in the plaintiff estate. Finally, the plaintiff argues that the defendant's uses of the name THE BIG EL SHOW, the logo composed of THE BIG EL SHOW name and the likeness ostensibly of Larry Seth as he appears in THE BIG EL SHOW, the term THE KING, the initials TCB with or without a lightning bolt, and all likenesses of Elvis Presley (whether or not they are really of Larry Seth as he appears or appeared in THE BIG EL SHOW) to identify his production, constitute infringements of plaintiff's marks. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="154" id="pa154"> Each of plaintiff's points will be evaluated in seriatim in the context of the requirements for an infringement claim.<a note-disclosure="30" href="#16460c3a-9f0f-4ca3-b961-9e8c06a28341-fn30"></a>  </p><div note-container="30" id="16460c3a-9f0f-4ca3-b961-9e8c06a28341-fn30"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="155" id="pa155"> This analysis is being undertaken, assuming arguendo that the defendant has a right to present a production like THE BIG EL SHOW.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="156" id="pa156"> a. <i>Validity of Marks</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="157" id="pa157"> A service mark is defined as "a word, name, symbol, device or any combination thereof adopted and used in the sale or advertising of services to identify the service of the entity and distinguish them from the services of others." <i>Caesars World, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/caesars-world-inc-v-caesars-palace#p822" class="raw-ref">490 F.

Our review of the record indicates that the first three names have not been used only to identify a particular individual, Elvis Presley. Rather they have been used in advertising, such as for performances, concerts, and on records, to identify a service. They have appeared in close association with a clear reference ( <i>i.e.,</i> IN CONCERT OR SHOW) to entertainment services of Presley. Thus, they have attained service mark status. <i>See Five Platters, Inc., supra</i> (the name "The Platters" functions as a service mark to identify the services of a singing and entertainment group); <i>In re Carson, supra</i> (the name JOHNNY CARSON functions as a service mark to identify entertainment services rendered by John W.

The record reveals that Elvis Presley's nickname was The King. However, plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence as to how the name was used to identify services, <i>see Hirsch v. S.C.

For example, the logo was used on Presley's letterhead and on business cards, <i>see, e.g., Re Reichold Chemicals, Inc.,</i> 167 U.S.P.Q. 376 (TMT App. Bd. 1970); <i>Re Pierce,</i> 164 U.S.P.Q. 369 (TMT App. Bd. 1970); 1 McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition, &sect; 16:11, and it appeared on the tails of Presley's airplanes. <i>See generally Boston Professional Hockey Ass'n, supra; Fotomat Corp., supra.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="165" id="pa165"> (3). <i>Likeness and Image</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="166" id="pa166"> The plaintiff asserts that the likeness and image of Elvis Presley serves as a service <span page-number="1364" pagination-id="513 F.

Rather, the record only supports a conclusion that a picture or illustration of Elvis Presley dressed in one of his characteristic jump-suits and holding a microphone in a singing pose is likely to be found to function as a service mark. This particular image (hereinafter referred to as the "Elvis Pose") has appeared in promotional and advertising material for concerts and on record albums. Thus, even though the "Elvis Pose" identifies the individual performer, we find it also has been used in the advertising and sale of Elvis Presley entertainment services to identify those services. <i>See generally Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema,</i> <a href="/case/dallas-cowboys-cheerleaders-v-pussycat-cinema" class="raw-ref">467 F.

The court recognizes that the "Elvis Pose" has appeared in somewhat different forms; for example, the color of the outfit or the direction of the face has been altered. We do not find such changes to be determinative. Rather, we find the following idea persuasive reasoning for treating the "Elvis Pose" as a service mark: </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="167" id="pa167">  <blockquote id="bq168" bq-id="168"> "It is settled that a person may change the display of a mark at any time because whatever rights he may possess in the mark reside in the term itself rather than in any particular form or arrangement thereof. . . . The only requirement in these instances is that the mark be modified in such a fashion as to retain its trademark impact and symbolize a single and continuing commercial impression. That is, a change which does not alter its distinctive characteristics represents a continuity of trademark rights. Thus, where the distinctive character of the mark is not changed, the mark is, in effect, the same and the rights obtained by virtue of the earlier use of the prior form inure to the later form.

Inherently distinctive trademarks or service marks, such as fanciful or arbitrary or non-descriptive, but suggestive, words and symbols, gain protected status upon their first adoption and use; while, non-inherently distinctive marks only achieve protection if the mark is shown to have secondary meaning. <i>See McCarthy, supra,</i> &sect;&sect; 15:1, 16:2; <i>Scott Paper Co. v.

In view of our earlier discussion concerning the protectibility of plaintiff's marks, it is not necessary to conduct an extensive inquiry. For the purposes of this motion we find that plaintiff's service marks (ELVIS, ELVIS PRESLEY, ELVIS IN CONCERT, TCB with the lightning bolt and, to a lesser degree, without the lightning bolt, and the "Elvis Pose") have acquired great distinctiveness, in the eyes of the public and strongly identify Elvis Presley entertainment services and the source, although not necessarily known by name, of those services. <i>See generally</i> 1 McCarthy, <i>supra,</i> &sect;&sect; 3:1-3, 11:1-24. However, we do consider the TCB logo to be somewhat weaker than the others since it has received less public exposure. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="184" id="pa184"> (2). <i>Similarity of the Marks</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="185" id="pa185"> It is well-recognized that the greater the similarity between plaintiff's and defendant's marks, the greater the likelihood of confusion.

An evaluation of similarity generally entails a comparison with respect to similarity of appearance, pronunciation, and meaning. <i>See Caesars World, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/caesars-world-inc-v-caesars-palace#p824" class="raw-ref">490 F. Supp. at 824</a>; 2 McCarthy, <i>supra,</i> &sect; 23:4; Restatement of Torts, &sect; 729(a) (1938). In the present case, appearance is the most dominant element, and similarity of appearance is determined "on the basis of the total effect of the designation, rather than on a comparison of individual features." Restatement of Torts &sect; 729, comment b (1938). Using these general guidelines, we reach the following conclusions. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="186" id="pa186"> The defendant's first mark can be considered the initials TCB. The defendant's logo of TCB with the lightning bolt, and, to a slightly lesser degree, without the lightning bolt, is essentially identical to plaintiff's corresponding mark. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="187" id="pa187"> The second of the defendant's marks can be characterized as any of the artist's renderings or pictures, which are purportedly of the performer Larry Seth as he appears in THE BIG EL SHOW, standing alone without being part of THE BIG EL SHOW logo. ( <i>See, e.g.,</i> Exhibit P. 11). We find that such pictures are highly similar to the image of Elvis Presley portrayed in the "Elvis Pose." The use of an artist's rendering or sketch rather than a photograph does not diminish the resemblance. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="188" id="pa188"> The third mark, the name THE BIG EL SHOW, which is the name of defendant's production, is not as similar to one of the plaintiff's marks as the first two are. The plaintiff's marks ELVIS and ELVIS IN CONCERT provide the closest bases for comparison. Using the factors of appearance and pronunciation, we find that there is some similarity between plaintiff's marks and defendant's mark but the extent of similarity is less than for the first two marks. The resemblance results because the EL in THE BIG EL SHOW is the first two letters of Elvis, and it sounds similar, and the defendant's EL appears in the same type of blocked, capital letters as does plaintiff's ELVIS. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="189" id="pa189"> The fourth mark in question, and perhaps the most important, is the defendant's logo composed of the words THE BIG EL SHOW and the artist's rendering (Exhibit P. 28). Considering the total effect conveyed by this mark, we find there is a high degree of similarity with plaintiff's "Elvis Pose" and a slightly lower degree of similarity with the names ELVIS and ELVIS IN CONCERT. ( <i>See</i> discussion, <i>supra</i>). The connection in defendant's logo of the <span page-number="1368" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1368"></span> name THE BIG EL SHOW with the picture that looks like Elvis Presley results in the letters EL being more suggestive in meaning of the marks ELVIS and ELVIS PRESLEY. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="190" id="pa190"> (3). <i>Defendant's Intent</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="191" id="pa191"> Although the intent of the defendant in adopting a mark is only one of the factors, <i>see Q-Tips, Inc., supra,</i> if a plaintiff can demonstrate that a defendant adopted a mark with the intent of obtaining unfair commercial advantage from the reputation of the plaintiff, then "that fact alone `may be sufficient to justify the inference that there is confusing similarity.'

We have no doubt that a reason for Russen's starting his show was to capitalize on the popularity of Elvis Presley. It is also quite apparent that the show, the service in question, was designed to simulate or imitate a performance by Elvis Presley. The available evidence bearing on the defendant's reasons for adopting his marks must be considered in light of the nature of the production. It is possible that producer Russen adopted his marks in order to tell the public something about the production and to promote the show. On the other hand, such marks could have been designed mainly to deceive the public and to trade on the good will associated with plaintiff's marks. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="193" id="pa193"> Because the record contains a relative paucity of information bearing on defendant's intent, it is difficult to draw many strong conclusions. Based on our review, we make the following observations as to intent. Russen was well aware of Presley's TCB mark and adopted the same mark because of its connection to the Elvis Presley organization. <i>See Caesars World, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/caesars-world-inc-v-caesars-palace#p825" class="raw-ref">490 F. Supp. at 825</a> (defendant's claim of innocent adoption negated by evidence of defendant's prior awareness of plaintiff's mark). He stated that he got the idea to use TCB as the name of his band because it is the name of Elvis Presley's fan clubs and serves as Presley's motto. We find that the use of TCB in connection with defendant's production was totally unnecessary and was done only to benefit from the good will which attached to Presley and his performances and organization. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="194" id="pa194"> As to the name THE BIG EL SHOW and the artist's rendering or picture of the performer Larry Seth as he appears in the show, we are unable to conclude that the defendant adopted these marks <i>mainly</i> to "bask in the reflected popularity" generated by plaintiff's marks. <i>See Q-Tips, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/q-tips-inc-v-johnson-johnson#p147" class="raw-ref">206 F.2d at 147</a> (3rd Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 346 U.S. 867, 74 S.Ct. 106, 98 L.Ed. 377 (1953). The defendant indicated that the name, THE BIG EL SHOW, was thought up by Larry Seth, the star of the production, and agreed to by the defendant Russen. The defendant also indicated that the artist's rendering or pictures were all of Larry Seth as the BIG EL. The plaintiff has not offered any other evidence, beyond the marks themselves, to prove improper motive. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence that the defendant adopted the name or used the pictures predominantly for the purpose of misleading or deceiving the public rather than for suggesting the nature of THE BIG EL SHOW production. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="195" id="pa195"> (4). <i>Similarity of Services</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="196" id="pa196"> As a rule, "[t]he greater the similarity between the products and services [provided by the defendant and plaintiff], the greater the likelihood of confusion." <i>Exxon Corp. v.

In the present case, the services of the plaintiff and of the defendant cannot be considered identical, but they are very similar. In general terms, each party's services can be described as musical entertainment provided by one singer or performer with instrumental or vocal background provided by others. There is some difference in the <span page-number="1369" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1369"></span> forms of presentation, since plaintiff's entertainment is provided mainly in the forms of records, film, video tape, and audio tape, while defendant's entertainment mainly appears as live, stage productions.<a note-disclosure="34" href="#d9f82d9c-94f0-4c7c-8ec5-07394fec19f3-fn34"></a> The defendant, however, has also produced records, albeit in limited numbers, of THE BIG EL SHOW. In addition, both parties have engaged in forms of licensing or sub-licensing their marks to appear on such merchandise as photographs, pendants, and buttons.  </p><div note-container="34" id="d9f82d9c-94f0-4c7c-8ec5-07394fec19f3-fn34"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="197" id="pa197"> However, the defendant could make a film or video tape of THE BIG EL SHOW which conceivably could be shown on television or in the movie theaters. Under these circumstances, the form of presentation of the defendant's entertainment service would be the same as the form of the plaintiff's.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="198" id="pa198"> A more specific reason for finding strong similarity is that both parties' entertainment services involve Elvis Presley. The plaintiff provides actual performances of Presley, while the defendant provides an imitation of an Elvis Presley performance. The fact that the plaintiff does not provide live stage performances of Presley, admittedly an impossibility due to Presley's current state, makes identical services virtually impossible and does lessen the similarity somewhat. In any event, direct competition or identity of services or products is not required to prove likelihood of confusion. <i>Great Atlantic Pacific Tea Co., supra.</i>  <blockquote id="bq199" bq-id="199"> <i>See Scarves by Vera, Inc. v.

By drawing some reasonable inferences from the available information and speculating on certain points, we have concluded that there is some similarity between the trade channels and marketing campaigns and that there is more similarity between the purchasers of the two services. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="203" id="pa203"> The enterprises of Presley, and more recently of plaintiff, have been national, including the New Jersey, Pennsylvania region, and international in scope and distribution. Since Presley's death, his performances as embodied in records and tapes have continued to be sold in major retail outlets. In addition, plaintiff's licensees and sublicensees have conducted marketing campaigns in order to sell a variety of merchandise. Plaintiff has also indicated that a movie about Presley has been filmed and will be released; however, the evidence does not reveal how much of the actual Presley performances will be included in the movie or when and where the movie will be exhibited. Plaintiff has not provided any other evidence that it is currently presenting any entertainment services in theaters or nightclubs. Plaintiff, however, has introduced a license agreement allowing Presley's former band to use the TCB logo on a record and in association with personal appearances. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="204" id="pa204"> The defendant's show has had a much smaller and more localized market. Although THE BIG EL SHOW has appeared in different American towns and cities, including <span page-number="1370" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1370"></span> Las Vegas, it basically has been localized in the Northeast generally and the New Jersey-Pennsylvania region specifically. The performances usually have been presented in smaller nightclubs, although there was an engagement at a Las Vegas hotel, and the show has been advertised on a local basis. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="205" id="pa205"> One particularly important aspect of the defendant's advertising is the emphasis placed on the disputed marks in the records, ads, and promotional materials themselves. The picture or artist's rendering, which we have already found to have an extremely close resemblance to plaintiff's mark, is highlighted along with the name THE BIG EL SHOW, except on one of the album covers which only has a sketch of the performer. The name and the written material, such as "A TRIBUTE TO ELVIS PRESLEY," does suggest the production is a type of simulation or imitation intended to honor Presley, but does not reveal the name of the star or any information as to the producer or sponsor of the show. In essence, there is nothing to negate the reasonable impression that the artist's rendering or picture is of Elvis Presley. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="206" id="pa206"> The marketing of limited quantities of THE BIG EL SHOW records and merchandise also appears to be on a highly localized and small scale basis. Most of the records were given away for promotional purposes. Those records which have been sold were distributed in a few stores in the New Jersey-Pennsylvania region; while the merchandise was sold mainly at THE BIG EL SHOW performances. Interestingly, Elvis Presley merchandise was also sold at THE BIG EL SHOW performances, and the evidence shows this to be the only side-by-side sale outlet of plaintiff's and defendant's products. In addition, another similarity exists in that both parties utilized a TCB logo with a lightning bolt on their stationery. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="207" id="pa207"> Based on the sketchy information in the record, we conclude that there is only some similarity between the marketing campaigns and the trade channels. <i>See DeCosta, supra.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="208" id="pa208"> The similarity between the predominant purchasers is greater than that between the marketing campaigns and trade channels. Because defendant's enterprise, THE BIG EL SHOW, is a stylized imitation of an Elvis Presley performance, it seems likely that it would appeal to many of the same members of the public who are interested in and patronize plaintiff's entertainment services. These purchasers could be called members of the Elvis Presley consuming public. Of course, there are also significant areas of difference between the "customers." For example, since the defendant's production usually has been presented in nightclubs, the customers may attend mainly for the nightclub aspect and not the production; while plaintiff's services, because of their current forms of presentation, would appeal more to home entertainment consumers (but the release of the movie could extend the appeal of plaintiff's services to members of the public who patronize nightclubs and theaters.) </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="209" id="pa209"> (6). <i>Actual Confusion</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="210" id="pa210"> Plaintiff has not presented any evidence of actual confusion by members of the consuming public. Plaintiff has not shown, for example by survey evidence, that people seeing THE BIG EL SHOW or advertisements for it thought the production was associated with the plaintiff or with Elvis Presley entertainment services. Although a showing of actual confusion could be significant, such evidence is not necessary to a finding of likelihood of confusion, <i>see, e.g., Amstar Corp., supra; Caesars World, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/caesars-world-inc-v-caesars-palace#p825" class="raw-ref">490 F.

Fleming,</i> <a href="/case/mclean-v-fleming#p251" class="raw-ref">96 U.S. 245, 251</a>, <a href="/case/mclean-v-fleming" class="raw-ref">24 L.Ed. 828</a> <span page-number="1371" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1371"></span> (1878), including people whose purchasers are motivated by appearance and general impressions, <i>Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Heraeus Engelhard Vacuum, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/dresser-industries-v-heraeus-engelhard-vacuum#p462" class="raw-ref">395 F.2d 457, 462</a> (3rd Cir. 1968), <i>cert. denied,</i> 393 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 293, 21 L.Ed.2d 270 (1968)." <i>Fotomat Corp.,</i> <a href="/case/fotomat-corp-v-photo-drive-thru-inc#p703" class="raw-ref">425 F. Supp. at 703</a>. An analysis of likelihood of confusion can be a complex process because of the variety of factors to be considered and because of the subjective and conjectural nature inherent in the process. In formulating our final conclusions we have used the perspective of the "ordinary purchaser" as our guide in balancing the extent and strength of the similarities against those of the dissimilarities. Based both on our evaluations of defendant's marks in light of the multiple factors and on our general sense impressions we have reached the following conclusions. The defendant's uses of both the initials TCB with or without the lightning bolt and of any artist's rendering or picture which resembles the "Elvis Pose," alone or as part of THE BIG EL SHOW logo, as service marks or trademarks to identify the defendant's production, records, or merchandise create a likelihood of confusion as to source or sponsorship. Although our analysis of the various factors provides ample support for our conclusion, we are especially persuaded by the strength of plaintiff's marks in the entertainment industry and the virtual equivalence of these two marks of the defendant with the corresponding marks of the plaintiff. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="213" id="pa213"> In making our decision, it is not necessary to conclude that the public be led to believe that defendant's show is composed of actual Elvis Presley performances or is produced by the plaintiff. It is not even necessary that the public know who the plaintiff is. What is required and what we find is that the ordinary purchaser generally familiar with plaintiff's marks is likely to believe that defendant's show is somehow related to, associated with, or sponsored by the same people or entity that provides the actual Elvis Presley entertainment services identified by its own marks. It is not at all unreasonable for the public to believe that this entity, which is the plaintiff, the Estate of Elvis Presley, has decided to license or sponsor a form of entertainment closely related to its other entertainment services. The public, realizing that an actual Elvis Presley live stage show is now impossible, might assume that the plaintiff's only alternative in order to enter this specific area of the entertainment field was to produce or sponsor an imitation of a real Elvis Presley performance, perhaps by using members of the actual Presley performing troupe or production staff or by supplying costumes or other official Presley items. It is also highly possible that consumers seeing the defendant's TCB logo or the advertisements highlighting the likeness of Elvis Presley might believe that the show is a multimedia presentation and incorporates films or recordings of actual Elvis Presley performances. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="214" id="pa214"> Our decisions with respect to the name THE BIG EL SHOW alone and in association with any pictures or artist's renderings resembling the "Elvis Pose" are closer. After careful consideration of the various factors, we have concluded that the use of the name THE BIG EL SHOW by itself does not create a likelihood of confusion, but its use as part of the logo or in connection with misleading pictures does create such confusion. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="215" id="pa215"> By attaching the artist's rendering to the name THE BIG EL SHOW to form the logo, the defendant has gone beyond allowable bounds. The likelihood of confusion associated with the artist's rendering is not sufficiently diminished by the use of the name with it. The picture, which certainly appears to be of Elvis Presley, provides the major triggering mechanism for the appeal to the public. The purchasing public seeing the picture and the name is likely to have a very similar reaction to the logo, believing the picture to be of Elvis, as it would if the picture were presented alone. The addition of the name may help to confirm that the production is an imitation of an actual Presley performance, but it really does not dispel any confusion as to plaintiff's association with or sponsorship of the production. <span page-number="1372" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1372"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="216" id="pa216"> Thus, based on the current state of the record, we have found a likelihood of confusion with respect to the defendant's marks of TCB with or without the lightning bolt, any artist's renderings or pictures which resemble the "Elvis Pose," and the logo. The plaintiff has established the likelihood of its ultimate success on the merits of its infringement claims as to these marks. The plaintiff has not established the same likelihood as to the defendant's use of THE BIG EL SHOW, alone, as the name or mark for its production. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="217" id="pa217"> 3. <i>Common Law Unfair Competition</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="218" id="pa218"> Plaintiff has alleged that the defendant's use of the names THE BIG EL SHOW, THE BIG EL SHOW IN CONCERT, THE KING, TCB (with or without the lightning bolt), the pictures resembling Elvis Presley and the presentation of the production imitating an Elvis Presley performance itself constitute common law unfair competition. Plaintiff claims that defendant's show, in combination with his advertising and promotion, should give rise to legal restraints because the defendant has "by unfair means usurped[ed] the goodwill and distinctive attributes of the business so constructed by [plaintiff]." <i>House of Westmore, Inc. v. Denney,</i> <a href="/case/house-of-westmore-v-denney#p265" class="raw-ref">151 F.2d 261, 265</a> (3rd Cir. 1945). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="219" id="pa219"> The claim of common law unfair competition, which is governed in this case by New Jersey law, covers a broader spectrum of behavior than trademark or service mark infringement. "In fact the common law of trademarks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition." <i>Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf,</i> <a href="/case/hanover-milling-co-v-metcalf#p413" class="raw-ref">240 U.S. 403, 413</a>, <a href="/case/hanover-milling-co-v-metcalf#p360" class="raw-ref">36 S.Ct. 357, 360</a>, <a href="/case/hanover-milling-co-v-metcalf" class="raw-ref">60 L.Ed. 713</a> (1916). Unfair competition "may be distinguished from infringement in that it does not involve the violation of the exclusive right to use a word, mark or symbol, but rather involves any violation of a right arising from the operation of an established business." <i>House of Westmore v. Denney,</i> <a href="/case/house-of-westmore-v-denney#p265" class="raw-ref">151 F.2d at 265</a>. The focus in trademark litigation is on whether an alleged symbol or name functions to identify and distinguish one's goods or services and whether the usage by another of the same or similar mark is likely to confuse customers. Under unfair competition, the focus, generally, is on the buyer's likely confusion between two products or services based on an examination of everything that is likely to have an impact upon the purchaser. 1 McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition &sect; 2:2 (1973). Many types of behavior are capable of constituting unfair competition. As one New Jersey court has noted: <blockquote id="bq220" bq-id="220">. . . equity broadly concerns itself with the suppression of injurious deception and fraud whatever the means by which they are wrongfully accomplished. It must be realized that injunctive relief is not confined to the protection of those having trademarks and trade-names. It reaches beyond to encompass all cases in which it is evident that fraud and deception are practiced by one in disparaging or capturing the trade of a competitor. The ingenuity of the unfair competitor thus eludes classification but not always the restraint of a court of equity.</blockquote>  <i>American Shops, Inc. v.

Thus, our earlier decisions regarding likelihood of confusion and probable success on the merits also hold for the unfair competition claims. Because there are fewer restrictions for a showing of unfair competition and more leeway in the exercise of our equitable powers, we conclude that our findings of likelihood of confusion are even stronger. As Judge Gerry has explained, "[i]t is possible to be guilty of unfair competition even when trademark infringement is not present, if use of a similar but noninfringing mark or device is combined with unfair practices in a manner which is likely to deceive purchasers regarding the origin of goods [or services] under all the circumstances.

Therefore, even assuming the names ELVIS, ELVIS PRESLEY, and ELVIS IN CONCERT, the TCB logo, and the "Elvis Pose" have not functioned as service marks, the current uses by the defendant of THE BIG EL SHOW logo (words and Presley likeness), the pictures resembling Presley, and the initials TCB in his advertising and business and promotional materials are still likely to deceive the public as to the origin or sponsorship of the show itself. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="227" id="pa227"> As to the defendant's uses of the name THE BIG EL SHOW, without any accompanying photographs or artist's renderings, and the term THE KING, we still do not find a likelihood of confusion or deception. The plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing of unfair practices or other circumstances to convince us that the defendant's proper use of these two items constitutes unfair competition. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="228" id="pa228"> In addition to its claims against the defendant's use of certain names or symbols in its business, advertising, or promotional materials, the plaintiff argues that the defendant's production, itself, constitutes unfair <span page-number="1374" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1374"></span> competition. The plaintiff asserts that the packaging together of the image, dress, and style of Elvis Presley into an hour and one-half production designed to simulate an actual Elvis Presley production results in unfair competition since the audience viewing the performance is necessarily deceived into believing it is dealing with a service of the Estate of Elvis Presley. Plaintiff mainly relies on a type of unfair competition known as "unreasonable" or unprivileged imitation. As the Third Circuit recently noted in <i>S K F, Co. v. Premo Pharmaceutical Lab.,</i> <a href="/case/skf-co-v-premo-pharmaceutical-lab" class="raw-ref">625 F.2d 1055</a> (3rd Cir. 1980), the New Jersey cases define this tort "in roughly the same manner as did the First Restatement of Torts." <i>Id.</i> at 1062.

Unlike an outside appearance of a store, the presentation of the defendant's production, itself, which occurs in a theater or club, cannot act to mislead customers into attending a performance of the defendant's show in the mistaken belief that it is associated with the plaintiff.

However, the success of the production or service should depend on the quality of the production, itself, and not on the ability of the defendant to deceive the public and to benefit unfairly from the goodwill attached to plaintiff's entertainment services of actual Elvis Presley performances. The defendant would have to make clear in all communications (including, but not limited to, advertising and promotional materials, theater programs or playbills, and record covers) to the consuming public that his production is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or in any other way connected with the same people who provide actual Elvis Presley entertainment services. In this respect, the defendant's current advertisements and promotional materials ( <i>see</i> Exhibits P. 14, <span page-number="1378" pagination-id="513 F. Supp. 1339" id="p1378"></span> 15, 19), as well as the album covers ( <i>see</i> Exhibits P. 11, 13) and labels on the 45 RPM records ( <i>see</i> Exhibit P. 18), are not adequate. They highlight those items, THE BIG EL SHOW logo and pictures or artist's renderings which appear to be of Elvis Presley,<a note-disclosure="44" href="#5a71d754-e6b9-4530-aff6-3da11b71a826-fn44"></a> which we already have concluded are likely to cause confusion. The use by the defendant only of phrases such as "REFLECTIONS ON A LEGEND . . . A TRIBUTE TO ELVIS PRESLEY," "Looks and Sounds like The KING," and "LIVE ON STAGE" does not diminish the confusion engendered by the use of the logo or artist's renderings to identify the production. In order to reduce this confusion, the defendant's representations and communications to the consuming public should incorporate in some manner the following ideas: that the production, or recording of the production, is a stage show, called THE BIG EL SHOW, which stars Larry Seth (or whoever is currently starring); that THE BIG EL SHOW is an attempted imitation of a performance or stage show of the late Elvis Presley; who the producer of THE BIG EL SHOW and of the record is; that neither THE BIG EL SHOW nor any recording is authorized or sponsored or licensed by the Estate of Elvis Presley; and that no one involved in the production of actual Elvis Presley performances or films or records is involved in THE BIG EL SHOW or the records of the show. In addition, in order to properly apprise potential customers that the star of THE BIG EL SHOW actually looks like Elvis Presley, the defendant should be able to use properly identified and legally obtained photographs of Elvis Presley to compare with photographs of the star of THE BIG EL SHOW.<a note-disclosure="45" href="#f9dbd556-a4a1-4f11-8c33-58a3b50620cd-fn45"></a>   </p><div note-container="44" id="5a71d754-e6b9-4530-aff6-3da11b71a826-fn44"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="263" id="pa263"> One of the albums portrays only an artist's rendering, without even the name, THE BIG EL SHOW, on the front of the cover.

Because the doctrine of the right of publicity emphasizes the protection of the commercial value of the celebrity's name or likeness, the plaintiff must demonstrate sufficiently that the defendant's use of the name and likeness of the celebrity has or is likely to result in an identifiable economic loss. In contrast, in the context of the service mark infringement, unfair competition, and &sect; 43(a) of the Lanham Act claims, we found that irreparable injury could result even in the absence of economic harm per se.<a note-disclosure="46" href="#f3b587ef-e039-4b22-9367-b409494df0b6-fn46"></a> One reason for this difference in approach stems from the public deception which is part of the latter three causes of action, but not part of the right of publicity claim. As a result of such public deception or confusion as to source, the plaintiff is being harmed. The plaintiff is being unfairly compelled to place the control of the good will attached to its entertainment services in the hands of the defendant.  </p><div note-container="46" id="f3b587ef-e039-4b22-9367-b409494df0b6-fn46"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="269" id="pa269"> <i>See</i> &sect; III.B.2., <i>infra,</i> addressing Irreparable Injury and the claims of Service Mark Infringement, Common Law Unfair Competition, and &sect; 43(a) of the Lanham Act.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="270" id="pa270"> In addition, and perhaps even more importantly, the close relationship in this case between the right of publicity and the societal considerations of free expression supports <span page-number="1379" pagination-id="513 F.

This principle is generally subordinated to the first; if a portrayal is found to serve an informative or cultural function, it will generally be immune from liability, even if it causes substantial harm. If a portrayal is simply exploitative, however, the issue of harm will be likely to control the court's decision.</blockquote>   <blockquote id="bq273" bq-id="273"> This principle, which is a relatively common one in tort law, is also influenced by First Amendment considerations. A clearly exploitative portrayal is not protected by the First Amendment; courts tend, however, to avoid imposing liability when there is even a possibility of such protection on the ground that First Amendment rights require "breathing space." As a result, they grant recovery in cases in which exploitation is found only if a clear showing of objectively determinable harm has been made. The types of harm that will qualify are derived from the countervailing social policies that support suits against the media &mdash; the encouragement of individual freedom, honest commercial practices, and creativity.</blockquote>  </p> </div><div note-container="48" id="8130c843-a0ec-45b8-b7e8-a4401d20276d-fn48"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="274" id="pa274"> <i>See</i> &sect; III.A.1.b., <i>supra,</i> addressing the Likelihood of Success on the Merits on the issue of Theatrical Imitations and The Right of Publicity.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="275" id="pa275"> In light of these comments, we find that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing that the presentation of this particular production, THE BIG EL SHOW, has resulted in any loss of commercial benefits to the plaintiff or will result in an irreparable commercial harm in the near future.

If the defendant were allowed to continue to use those names or symbols (THE BIG EL SHOW logo, the initials TCB with or without a lightning bolt, and pictures or artist's renderings which closely resemble Elvis Presley) previously found to engender confusion as to source, the plaintiff would be harmed seriously by the deprivation of its ability to control the nature and quality of a service which the public believes it provides.

Since the plaintiff is not currently sponsoring or licensing any type of stage show, or even a movie incorporating Elvis Presley performances, it does not appear that customers attending THE BIG EL SHOW are being or would be diverted from plaintiff's services. Also, there are not a sufficient number of BIG EL SHOW records on the market to constitute an irreparable injury through loss of trade. However, as we have noted, other forms of damage aside from economic harm per se can result in irreparable injury where service mark (or trademark) infringement, common law unfair competition, or violation of &sect; 43(a) of the Lanham Act is involved.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="289" id="pa289"> C. <i>The Balance of Equities</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="290" id="pa290"> Recognizing our earlier conclusions as to likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable injury, we find that the hardships to the defendant in complying with a preliminary injunction would not outweigh the harm to the plaintiff resulting from a failure to grant a preliminary injunction. Since the preliminary injunction would not prevent the defendant from using the name THE BIG EL SHOW or from presenting the production itself, the harm to the defendant should not be significant. This conclusion actually is supported by the defendant's own arguments as to the equities. The defendant claims only two equitable considerations: that THE BIG EL SHOW is his and his family's major source of income and that THE BIG EL SHOW has generated its own good will with the public. Although we feel the defendant has not made an adequate showing of both of these claims,<a note-disclosure="53" href="#f198668c-d8d4-4b35-bdaf-ca449b8b66cc-fn53"></a> it is not necessary to consider this in our decision. Since our preliminary injunction would not stop the production or the use of the name THE BIG EL SHOW, the defendant's main concerns are alleviated. The defendant has not indicated that changing the advertising and promotional material and the logo or discontinuing the use of TCB will cause any real financial damage or have any other adverse impact. The effect of an injunction on defendant's sales of records also would not have any significant financial impact because of the limited number of records and extent of distribution. Finally, any loss in trade to the defendant should be due only to the fact that the defendant will no longer be using confusion to trade on the good will and reputation of the plaintiff. Any expenses incurred by the defendant in complying with the preliminary injunction could be easily calculated and adequately compensated by an award of monetary damages if the defendant ultimately prevails. <i>See Louis Rich, Inc. v. Horace W. Longacre, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/louis-rich-inc-v-horace-w-longacre-inc#p1340" class="raw-ref">423 F. Supp. 1327, 1340</a> (E.D.Pa. 1976).

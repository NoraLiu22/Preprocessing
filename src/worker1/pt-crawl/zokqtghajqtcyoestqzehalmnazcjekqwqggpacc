<p class="one">oseph Clayton Clarke, who is best known by his pseudonym “Kyd,” was born in  1857 in Onchan on the Isle of Man. He was 
 versatile an artist who  attempted all sorts of subjects, from brilliant editorial cartoons with political satire to 
 collections of watercolours of Dickens's quirky character In personal appearance, the artist affected the style of Dickens's Micawber, including spats and gloves. However, as rising income permitted him to move his growing family out of the metropolis in 1892, he moved not to "Dickens-land" (Rochester, Kent), but to the charming West Sussex town of Chichester.  </p>

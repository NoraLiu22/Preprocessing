<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>The TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board is responsible for ensuring there is as much uniformity and consistency in applying the Parental Guidelines as possible. The Monitoring Board does this by reviewing complaints and other public input and by facilitating discussion about the application of ratings among members of the Board and other relevant industry representatives. The Monitoring Board typically meets annually or more often, if necessary, to consider and review complaints sent to the Board, discuss current research, and review any other relevant issues. The Board also facilitates regular calls among industry standards and practices executives to discuss pending and emerging issues in order to promote ratings consistency across companies.</p>

<p>In addition to the chairman, the Board includes 18 industry representatives from the broadcast, cable and creative communities appointed by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), NCTA – The Internet and Television Association, and the Motion Picture Association (MPA), and five public interest members, appointed by the Board chairman.</p>

<h4>Our History</h4>

<div class="timeline" style="background-color:#fff;"><br><br>
<div class="container left">
<div class="content">
<h2>February 8, 1996</h2>
<p>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 is signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The law called upon the entertainment industry to establish a voluntary television rating system to provide parents with information about material in television programming that would work the V-Chip. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container right">
<div class="content">
<h2>February 29, 1996</h2>
<p>All segments of the entertainment industry — led by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), NCTA - The Internet &amp; Television Association and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) — voluntarily pledged to create a television ratings system. The industry formed a Working Group, under the leadership of then-MPAA President Jack Valenti, that represented all segments of the entertainment industry. The Group conducted regional focus groups and a national poll seeking information on what parents might want in a television rating system. They also met and consulted with scores of parental, medical, religious, child advocacy and educational groups to listen to their views on how the parental guidelines system should be structured.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container left">
<div class="content">
<h2>December 19, 1996</h2>
<p>The television industry announced the creation of the TV Parental Guidelines, a voluntary system of guidelines providing parents with advance, cautionary information to help them make more informed choices about the television programs their families watch. A TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board (Monitoring Board), comprised of TV industry experts, was also created to help ensure accuracy, uniformity and consistency of the guidelines and to consider public questions and complaints about the guidelines applied to a particular program.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container right">
<div class="content">
<h2>January 17, 1997</h2>
<p>The television industry submitted the TV Parental Guidelines to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for consideration. In the spring of 1997, then-Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain (R-AZ) held a hearing on the ratings system and received testimony from child advocacy experts and members of the entertainment industry. Additionally, then-House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) held a field hearing in Peoria, Illinois. The comments received at the FCC and in these congressional hearings overwhelmingly supported providing additional content information as part of the ratings system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container left">
<div class="content">
<h2>Spring/Summer of 1997</h2>
<p>The television industry, in consultation with the medical and child advocacy community, discussed potential options for revising the TV Parental Guidelines. The following organizations participated in these discussions: the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Medical Association (AMA), the American Psychological Association (APA), the Center for Media Education (CME), the Children’s Defense Fund (CDF), Children Now, National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), the National Education Association (NEA), and the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container right">
<div class="content">
<h2>July 10, 1997</h2>
<p>The television industry and the public advocacy community <a href="http://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/0797Release.pdf" target="_blank">announced a revised</a> TV Parental Guideline System consisting of age- and content-based ratings. Download the announcement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container left">
<div class="content">
<h2>August 1, 1997</h2>
<p>NAB, NCTA and MPAA submitted the revised ratings system to the FCC for review. Under this revised system, television programming would continue to fall into one of the six ratings categories (TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA).  Additionally, content descriptors of D (suggestive dialogue), L (language), S (sexual content), V (violence) and FV (fantasy violence — exclusively for the TV-Y7 category) would be included in the ratings where appropriate. Industry also committed to inserting rating icons and associated content symbols for 15 seconds at the beginning of all rated programming, and increasing the size of the icons. Finally, the revised proposal called for the addition of five representatives of the advocacy community to the Monitoring Board. The revised guidelines were supported by leading family and child advocacy groups, as well as television broadcasters, cable systems and networks, and television production companies. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container right">
<div class="content">
<h2>March 12, 1998</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/0398Release.pdf" target="_blank">FCC found</a> that the Industry Video Programming Rating System was acceptable and subsequently adopted the technical requirements for the V-Chip.</p>

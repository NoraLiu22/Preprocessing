              a few of months after Roentgen's discovery, French physicist Henri 
              Becquerel reported to the French Academy of Sciences that uranium 
              compounds, even if they were kept in the dark, emitted rays that 
              would fog a photographic plate. He had come upon this discovery 
              accidentally. Despite Becquerel's intriguing finding, the scientific 
              community continued to focus its attention on Roentgen's X-rays, 
              neglecting the much weaker Becquerel rays or uranium rays.<br>

              begin experimental work on them immediately. The director of the 
              Paris Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry, where 
              Pierre was professor of physics, permitted her to use a crowded,

            and his older brother, Jacques, had invented a new kind of electrometer, 
            a device for measuring extremely low electrical currents. Marie now 
            put the Curie electrometer to use in measuring the faint currents 
            that can pass through air that has been bombarded with uranium rays. 
            The moist air in the storeroom tended to dissipate the electric charge,

      <font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">With numerous experiments 
      Marie confirmed Becquerel's observations that the electrical effects of 
      uranium rays are constant, regardless of whether the uranium was solid or 
      pulverized, pure or in a compound, wet or dry, or whether exposed to light 
      or heat. Likewise, her study of the rays emitted by different uranium compounds 
      validated Becquerel's conclusion that the minerals with a higher proportion 
      of uranium emitted the most intense rays. She went beyond Becquerel's work, 
      however, in forming a crucial hypothesis: the emission of rays by uranium 
      compounds could be an atomic property of the element uranium--something 
      built into the <a href="unstable.htm">very structure of its atoms</a>. </font> 
      <p><img src="images/Morange.gif" width="33" height="29" align="LEFT" alt="M"><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif"><b>ARIE'S 
        SIMPLE HYPOTHESIS</b> would prove revolutionary. It would ultimately contribute 
        to a fundamental shift in scientific understanding. At the time scientists 
        regarded the atom--a word meaning <i>undivided</i> or <i>indivisible</i> 
        -- as the most elementary particle. A hint that this ancient idea was 
        false came from the discovery of the electron by other scientists around 
        this same time. But nobody grasped the complex inner structure or the 
        immense energy stored in atoms. Marie and Pierre Curie themselves were 
        not convinced that radioactive energy came from within atoms--maybe, for 
        example, the earth was bathed in cosmic rays, whose energy certain atoms 
        somehow caught and radiated? Marie's real achievement was to cut through 
        the complicated and obscure observations with a crystal-clear analysis 
        of the set of conclusions that, however unexpected, were logically possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Marie tested all the known 
        elements in order to determine if other elements or minerals would make 
        air conduct electricity better, or if uranium alone could do this. In 
        this task she was assisted by a number of chemists who donated a variety 
        of mineral samples, including some containing very rare elements. In April 
        1898 her research revealed that thorium compounds, like those of uranium, 
        emit Becquerel rays. Again the emission appeared to be an atomic property. 
        To describe the behavior of uranium and thorium she invented the word 
        <font color="#FF3300">&#147;radioactivity&#148;</font> --based on the 
        Latin word for ray.</font> </p>

<H1>4 Maccabees </H1> 
<BR>

<BR> <I> The <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Maccabees">"Fourth Book of Maccabees"</A> was written in the first century B.C. or the first century A.D.  It is a philosophical treatise about two episodes which occurred during the persecution of the Jews by Antiochus Epiphanes: the death of Eleazar (see <A HREF="2macc.html#6">2Maccabees, 6'18-31</A>) and the death of seven brothers (see <A HREF="2macc.html#7">2Maccabees, 7'1-42</A>).

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="1">[1]</A> The subject that I am about to discuss is most philosophical, that is, whether devout reason is sovereign over the emotions. So it is right for me to advise you to pay earnest attention to philosophy. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> For the subject is essential to everyone who is seeking knowledge, and in addition it includes the praise of the highest virtue - I mean, of course, rational judgment. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> If, then, it is evident that reason rules over those emotions that hinder self-control, namely, gluttony and lust, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> it is also clear that it masters the emotions that hinder one from justice, such as malice, and those that stand in the way of courage, namely anger, fear, and pain. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Some might perhaps ask, "If reason rules the emotions, why is it not sovereign over forgetfulness and ignorance?" Their attempt at argument is ridiculous! <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> For reason does not rule its own emotions, but those that are opposed to justice, courage, and self-control; and it is not for the purpose of destroying them, but so that one may not give way to them. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> I could prove to you from many and various examples that reason is dominant over the emotions, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> but I can demonstrate it best from the noble bravery of those who died for the sake of virtue, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eleazar.html#2">Eleazar</A> and the seven brothers and their mother. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> All of these, by despising sufferings that bring death, demonstrated that reason controls the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> On this anniversary it is fitting for me to praise for their virtues those who, with their mother, died for the sake of nobility and goodness, but I would also call them blessed for the honour in which they are held. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> For all people, even their torturers, marvelled at their courage and endurance, and they became the cause of the downfall of tyranny over their nation. By their endurance they conquered the tyrant, and thus their native land was purified through them. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> I shall shortly have an opportunity to speak of this; but, as my custom is, I shall begin by stating my main principle, and then I shall turn to their story, giving glory to the all-wise <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A>. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Our inquiry, accordingly, is whether reason is sovereign over the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> We shall decide just what reason is and what emotion is, how many kinds of emotions there are, and whether reason rules over all these. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> Now reason is the mind that with sound logic prefers the life of wisdom. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Wisdom, next, is the knowledge of divine and human matters and the causes of these. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> This, in turn, is education in the law, by which we learn divine matters reverently and human affairs to our advantage. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> Now the kinds of wisdom are rational judgment, justice, courage, and self-control. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Rational judgment is supreme over all of these, since by means of it reason rules over the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> The two most comprehensive types of the emotions are pleasure and pain; and each of these is by nature concerned with both body and soul. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> The emotions of both pleasure and pain have many consequences. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> Thus desire precedes pleasure and delight follows it. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> Fear precedes pain and sorrow comes after. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> Anger, as a man will see if he reflects on this experience, is an emotion embracing pleasure and pain. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> In pleasure there exists even a malevolent tendency, which is the most complex of all the emotions.  <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> In the soul it is boastfulness, covetousness, thirst for honour, rivalry, and malice; <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> in the body, indiscriminate eating, gluttony, and solitary dining. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> Just as pleasure and pain are two plants growing from the body and the soul, so there are many offshoots of these plants, <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> each of which the master cultivator, reason, weeds and prunes and ties up and waters and thoroughly irrigates, and so tames the jungle of habits and emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> For reason is the guide of the virtues, but over the emotions it is sovereign. Observe now first of all that rational judgment is sovereign over the emotions by virtue of the restraining power of self-control. <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> Self-control, then, is dominance over the desires. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> Some desires are mental, others are physical, and reason obviously rules over both. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> Otherwise how is it that when we are attracted to forbidden foods we abstain from the pleasure to be had from them? Is it not because reason is able to rule over appetites? I for one think so. <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> Therefore when we crave seafood and fowl and animals and all sorts of foods that are forbidden to us by the law, we abstain because of domination by reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> For the emotions of the appetites are restrained, checked by the temperate mind, and all the impulses of the body are bridled by reason. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="2">[2]</A> And why is it amazing that the desires of the mind for the enjoyment of beauty are rendered powerless? <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> It is for this reason, certainly, that the temperate <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/joseph.html#1">Joseph</A> is praised, because by mental effort he overcame sexual desire. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> For when he was young and in his prime for intercourse, by his reason he nullified the frenzy of the passions. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Not only is reason proved to rule over the frenzied urge of sexual desire, but also over every desire. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Thus the law says [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Deuteronomy#Chapter_5">Deuteronomy, 5'21</A>], "You shall not covet your neighbour's wife...or anything that is your neighbour's." <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> In fact, since the law has told us not to covet, I could prove to you all the more that reason is able to control desires. Just so it is with the emotions that hinder one from justice. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Otherwise how could it be that someone who is habitually a solitary diner, a glutton, or even a drunkard can learn a better way, unless reason is clearly lord of the emotions? <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Thus, as soon as a man adopts a way of life in accordance with the law, even though he is a lover of money, he is forced to act contrary to his natural ways and to lend without interest to the needy and to cancel the debt when the seventh year arrives. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> If one is greedy, he is ruled by the law through his reason so that he neither gleans his harvest nor gathers the last grapes from the vineyard. In all other matters we can recognize that reason rules the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> For the law prevails even over affection for parents, so that virtue is not abandoned for their sakes. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> It is superior to love for one's wife, so that one rebukes her when she breaks the law. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> It takes precedence over love for children, so that one punishes them for misdeeds. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> It is sovereign over the relationship of friends, so that one rebukes friends when they act wickedly. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Do not consider it paradoxical when reason, through the law, can prevail even over enmity. The fruit trees of the enemy are not cut down, but one preserves the property of enemies from the destroyers and helps raise up what has fallen. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> It is evident that reason rules even the more violent emotions: lust for power, vainglory, boasting, arrogance, and malice. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> For the temperate mind repels all these malicious emotions, just as it repels anger - for it is sovereign over even this. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> When <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moses.html#1">Moses</A> was angry with Dathan and Abiram [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Numbers#Chapter_16">Numbers, 16'1-44</A>], he did nothing against them in anger, but controlled his anger by reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> For, as I have said, the temperate mind is able to get the better of the emotions, to correct some, and to render others powerless. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Why else did <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jacob.html#1">Jacob</A>, our most wise father, censure the households of Simeon and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/levi.html#1">Levi</A> for their irrational slaughter of the entire tribe of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/shechem.html#1">Shechemites</A>, saying [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Genesis#Chapter_49">Genesis, 49'7</A>], "Cursed be their anger"? <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> For if reason could not control anger, he would not have spoken thus. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> Now when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A> fashioned man, he planted in him emotions and inclinations, <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> but at the same time he enthroned the mind among the senses as a sacred governor over them all. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> To the mind he gave the law; and one who lives subject to this will rule a kingdom that is temperate, just, good, and courageous. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> How is it then, one might say, that if reason is master of the emotions, it does not control forgetfulness and ignorance? 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3">[3]</A> This notion is entirely ridiculous; for it is evident that reason rules not over its own emotions, but over those of the body. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> No one of us can eradicate that kind of desire, but reason can provide a way for us not to be enslaved by desire. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> No one of us can eradicate anger from the mind, but reason can help to deal with anger. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> No one of us can eradicate malice, but reason can fight at our side so that we are not overcome by malice. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> For reason does not uproot the emotions but is their antagonist. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Now this can be explained more clearly by the story of King <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/david.html#1">David</A>'s thirst [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/2_Samuel#Chapter_23">2Samuel, 23'13-17</A>]. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> David had been attacking the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philistines.html#1">Philistines</A> all day long, and together with the soldiers of his nation had slain many of them. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Then when evening fell, he came, sweating and quite exhausted, to the royal tent, around which the whole army of our ancestors had encamped. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Now all the rest were at supper, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> but the king was extremely thirsty, and although springs were plentiful there, he could not satisfy his thirst from them. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> But a certain irrational desire for the water in the enemy's territory tormented and inflamed him, undid and consumed him. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> When his guards complained bitterly because of the king's craving, two staunch young soldiers, respecting the king's desire, armed themselves fully, and taking a pitcher climbed over the enemy's ramparts. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Eluding the sentinels at the gates, they went searching throughout the enemy camp <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> and found the spring, and from it boldly brought the king a drink. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> But David, although he was burning with thirst, considered it an altogether fearful danger to his soul to drink what was regarded as equivalent to blood. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Therefore, opposing reason to desire, he poured out the drink as an offering to God. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> For the temperate mind can conquer the drives of the emotions and quench the flames of frenzied desires; <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> it can overthrow bodily agonies even when they are extreme, and by nobility of reason spurn all domination by the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> The present occasion now invites us to a narrative demonstration of temperate reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> At a time when our fathers were enjoying profound peace because of their observance of the law and were prospering, so that even <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#1">Seleucus</A> Nicanor, king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#2">Asia</A>, had both appropriated money to them for the temple service and recognized their commonwealth - <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> just at that time certain men attempted a revolution against the public harmony and caused many and various disasters. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="4">[4]</A>  Now there was a certain <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/simon.html#4">Simon</A>, a political opponent of the noble and good man, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/onias.html#3">Onias</A>, who then held the high priesthood for life. When despite all manner of slander he was unable to injure Onias in the eyes of the nation, he fled the country with the purpose of betraying it. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> So he came to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollonius.html#7">Apollonius</A>, governor of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syria.html#1">Syria</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phoenicia.html#1">Phoenicia</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cilicia.html#1">Cilicia</A>, and said [<A CLASS="help" HREF="2macc.html#3">2Maccabees, 3'5</A>], <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> "I have come here because I am loyal to the king's government, to report that in the Jerusalem treasuries there are deposited tens of thousands in private funds, which are not the property of the temple but belong to King <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#4">Seleucus</A>." <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> When Apollonius learned the details of these things, he praised Simon for his service to the king and went up to Seleucus to inform him of the rich treasure. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> On receiving authority to deal with this matter, he proceeded quickly to our country accompanied by the accursed Simon and a very strong military force. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> He said that he had come with the king's authority to seize the private funds in the treasury. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> The people indignantly protested his words, considering it outrageous that those who had committed deposits to the sacred treasury should be deprived of them, and did all that they could to prevent it. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> But, uttering threats, Apollonius went on to the temple. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> While the priests together with women and children were imploring <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A> in the temple to shield the holy place that was being treated so contemptuously, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> and while Apollonius was going up with his armed forces to seize the money, angels on horseback with lightning flashing from their weapons appeared from heaven, instilling in them great fear and trembling. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Then Apollonius fell down half dead in the temple area that was open to all, stretched out his hands toward heaven, and with tears besought the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrews.html#1">Hebrews</A> to pray for him and propitiate the wrath of the heavenly army. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> For he said that he had committed a sin deserving of death, and that if he were delivered he would praise the blessedness of the holy place before all people. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Moved by these words, Onias the high priest, although otherwise he had scruples about doing so, prayed for him lest King Seleucus suppose that Apollonius had been overcome by human treachery and not by divine justice. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> So Apollonius, having been preserved beyond all expectations, went away to report to the king what had happened to him. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> When King Seleucus died, his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A> Epiphanes succeeded to the throne, an arrogant and terrible man, <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> who removed Onias from the priesthood and appointed Onias's brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jason.html#3">Jason</A> as high priest. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Jason agreed that if the office were conferred upon him he would pay the king three thousand six hundred and sixty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A> annually. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> So the king appointed him high priest and ruler of the nation. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Jason changed the nation's way of life and altered its form of government in complete violation of the law, <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> so that not only was a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_%28ancient_Greece%29">gymnasium</A> constructed at the very citadel of our native land, but also the temple service was abolished. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> The divine justice was angered by these acts and caused Antiochus himself to make war on them. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> For when he was warring against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#6">Ptolemy</A> in Egypt, he heard that a rumour of his death had spread and that the people of Jerusalem had rejoiced greatly. He speedily marched against them, <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> and after he had plundered them he issued a decree that if any of them should be found observing the ancestral law they should die. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> When, by means of his decrees, he had not been able in any way to put an end to the people's observance of the law, but saw that all his threats and punishments were being disregarded, <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> even to the point that women, because they had circumcised their sons, were thrown headlong from heights along with their infants, though they had known beforehand that they would suffer this - <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> when, then, his decrees were despised by the people, he himself, through torture, tried to compel everyone in the nation to eat defiling foods and to renounce Judaism. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="5">[5]</A> The tyrant Antiochus, sitting in state with his counsellors on a certain high place, and with his armed soldiers standing about him, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> ordered the guards to seize each and every <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrew.html#1">Hebrew</A> and to compel them to eat pork and food sacrificed to idols. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> If any were not willing to eat defiling food, they were to be broken on the wheel and killed. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> And when many persons had been rounded up, one man, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eleazar.html#2">Eleazar</A> by name, leader of the flock, was brought before the king. He was a man of priestly family, learned in the law, advanced in age, and known to many in the tyrant's court because of his philosophy. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> When Antiochus saw him he said, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> "Before I begin to torture you, old man, I would advise you to save yourself by eating pork, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> for I respect your age and your grey hairs. Although you have had them for so long a time, it does not seem to me that you are a philosopher when you observe the religion of the Jews. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Why, when nature has granted it to us, should you abhor eating the very excellent meat of this animal? <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> It is senseless not to enjoy delicious things that are not shameful, and wrong to spurn the gifts of nature. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> It seems to me that you will do something even more senseless if, by holding a vain opinion concerning the truth, you continue to despise me to your own hurt. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Will you not awaken from your foolish philosophy, dispel your futile reasonings, adopt a mind appropriate to your years, philosophize according to the truth of what is beneficial, <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> and have compassion on your old age by honouring my humane advice? <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> For consider this, that if there is some power watching over this religion of yours, it will excuse you from any transgression that arises out of compulsion." 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> When the tyrant urged him in this fashion to eat meat unlawfully, Eleazar asked to have a word. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> When he had received permission to speak, he began to address the people as follows: <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> "We, O Antiochus, who have been persuaded to govern our lives by the divine law, think that there is no compulsion more powerful than our obedience to the law. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Therefore we consider that we should not transgress it in any respect. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> Even if, as you suppose, our law were not truly divine and we had wrongly held it to be divine, not even so would it be right for us to invalidate our reputation for piety. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Therefore do not suppose that it would be a petty sin if we were to eat defiling food; <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> to transgress the law in matters either small or great is of equal seriousness, <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> for in either case the law is equally despised. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> You scoff at our philosophy as though living by it were irrational, <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> but it teaches us self-control, so that we master all pleasures and desires, and it also trains us in courage, so that we endure any suffering willingly; <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> it instructs us in justice, so that in all our dealings we act impartially, and it teaches us piety, so that with proper reverence we worship the only real God. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> "Therefore we do not eat defiling food; for since we believe that the law was established by God, we know that in the nature of things the Creator of the world in giving us the law has shown sympathy toward us. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> He has permitted us to eat what will be most suitable for our lives, but he has forbidden us to eat meats that would be contrary to this. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> It would be tyrannical for you to compel us not only to transgress the law, but also to eat in such a way that you may deride us for eating defiling foods, which are most hateful to us. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> But you shall have no such occasion to laugh at me, <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> nor will I transgress the sacred oaths of my ancestors concerning the keeping of the law, <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> not even if you gouge out my eyes and burn my entrails. <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> I am not so old and cowardly as not to be young in reason on behalf of piety. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> Therefore get your torture wheels ready and fan the fire more vehemently! <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> I do not so pity my old age as to break the ancestral law by my own act. <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> I will not play false to you, O law that trained me, nor will I renounce you, beloved self-control. <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> I will not put you to shame, philosophical reason, nor will I reject you, honoured priesthood and knowledge of the law. <FONT CLASS="verse">36</FONT> You, O king, shall not stain the honourable mouth of my old age, nor my long life lived lawfully. <FONT CLASS="verse">37</FONT> The fathers will receive me as pure, as one who does not fear your violence even to death. <FONT CLASS="verse">38</FONT> You may tyrannize the ungodly, but you shall not dominate my religious principles either by word or by deed." 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="6">[6]</A> When Eleazar in this manner had made eloquent response to the exhortations of the tyrant, the guards who were standing by dragged him violently to the instruments of torture. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> First they stripped the old man, who remained adorned with the gracefulness of his piety. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> And after they had tied his arms on each side they scourged him, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> while a herald opposite him cried out, "Obey the king's commands!" <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> But the courageous and noble man, as a true Eleazar, was unmoved, as though being tortured in a dream; <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> yet while the old man's eyes were raised to heaven, his flesh was being torn by scourges, his blood flowing, and his sides were being cut to pieces. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> And though he fell to the ground because his body could not endure the agonies, he kept his reason upright and unswerving. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> One of the cruel guards rushed at him and began to kick him in the side to make him get up again after he fell. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> But he bore the pains and scorned the punishment and endured the tortures. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> And like a noble athlete the old man, while being beaten, was victorious over his torturers; <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> in fact, with his face bathed in sweat, and gasping heavily for breath, he amazed even his torturers by his courageous spirit. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> At that point, partly out of pity for his old age, <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> partly out of sympathy from their acquaintance with him, partly out of admiration for his endurance, some of the king's retinue came to him and said, <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> "Eleazar, why are you so irrationally destroying yourself through these evil things? <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> We will set before you some cooked meat; save yourself by pretending to eat pork." <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> But Eleazar, as though more bitterly tormented by this counsel, cried out: <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> "May we, the children of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/abraham.html#1">Abraham</A>, never think so basely that out of cowardice we feign a role unbecoming to us! <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> For it would be irrational if we, who have lived in accordance with truth to old age and have maintained in accordance with law the reputation of such a life, should now change our course <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> become a pattern of impiety to the young, in becoming an example of the eating of defiling food. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> It would be shameful if we should survive for a little while and during that time be a laughing stock to all for our cowardice, <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> and if we should be despised by the tyrant as unmanly, and not protect our divine law even to death. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> Therefore, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion! <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> And you, guards of the tyrant, why do you delay?" 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> When they saw that he was so courageous in the face of the afflictions, and that he had not been changed by their compassion, the guards brought him to the fire. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> There they burned him with maliciously contrived instruments, threw him down, and poured stinking liquids into his nostrils. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> When he was now burned to his very bones and about to expire, he lifted up his eyes to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A> and said, <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> "You know, O God, that though I might have saved myself, I am dying in burning torments for the sake of the law. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> Be merciful to your people, and let our punishment suffice for them. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs." <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> And after he said this, the holy man died nobly in his tortures, and by reason he resisted even to the very tortures of death for the sake of the law. <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> Admittedly, then, devout reason is sovereign over the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> For if the emotions had prevailed over reason, we would have testified to their domination. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> But now that reason has conquered the emotions, we properly attribute to it the power to govern. <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> And it is right for us to acknowledge the dominance of reason when it masters even external agonies. It would be ridiculous to deny it. <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> And I have proved not only that reason has mastered agonies, but also that it masters pleasures and in no respect yields to them. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7">[7]</A> For like a most skilful pilot, the reason of our father <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eleazar.html#2">Eleazar</A> steered the ship of religion over the sea of the emotions, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> and though buffeted by the stormings of the tyrant and overwhelmed by the mighty waves of tortures, <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> in no way did he turn the rudder of religion until he sailed into the haven of immortal victory. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> No city besieged with many ingenious war machines has ever held out as did that most holy man. Although his sacred life was consumed by tortures and racks, he conquered the besiegers with the shield of his devout reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> For in setting his mind firm like a jutting cliff, our father Eleazar broke the maddening waves of the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> O priest, worthy of the priesthood, you neither defiled your sacred teeth nor profaned your stomach, which had room only for reverence and purity, by eating defiling foods. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> O man in harmony with the law and philosopher of divine life! <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Such should be those who are administrators of the law, shielding it with their own blood and noble sweat in sufferings even to death. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> You, father, strengthened our loyalty to the law through your glorious endurance, and you did not abandon the holiness which you praised, but by your deeds you made your words of divine philosophy credible. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> O aged man, more powerful than tortures; O elder, fiercer than fire; O supreme king over the passions, Eleazar! <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> For just as our father <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aaron.html#1">Aaron</A>, armed with the censer, ran through the multitude of the people and conquered the fiery angel [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Numbers#Chapter_16">Numbers, 16'46-48</A> & <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/wisdom/wisdom18.htm">Book of Wisdom, 18'21-25</A>], <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> so the descendant of Aaron, Eleazar, though being consumed by the fire, remained unmoved in his reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Most amazing, indeed, though he was an old man, his body no longer tense and firm, his muscles flabby, his sinews feeble, he became young again <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> in spirit through reason; and by reason like that of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isaac.html#1">Isaac</A> he rendered the many-headed rack ineffective. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> O man of blessed age and of venerable grey hair and of law-abiding life, whom the faithful seal of death has perfected! <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> If, therefore, because of piety an aged man despised tortures even to death, most certainly devout reason is governor of the emotions. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Some perhaps might say, "Not every one has full command of his emotions, because not every one has prudent reason." <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> But as many as attend to religion with a whole heart, these alone are able to control the passions of the flesh, <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> since they believe that they, like our patriarchs Abraham and Isaac and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jacob.html#1">Jacob</A>, do not die to God, but live in God. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> No contradiction therefore arises when some persons appear to be dominated by their emotions because of the weakness of their reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> What person who lives as a philosopher by the whole rule of philosophy, and trusts in God, <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> and knows that it is blessed to endure any suffering for the sake of virtue, would not be able to overcome the emotions through godliness? <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> For only the wise and courageous man is lord of his emotions. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="8">[8]</A> For this is why even the very young, by following a philosophy in accordance with devout reason, have prevailed over the most painful instruments of torture. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> For when the tyrant was conspicuously defeated in his first attempt, being unable to compel an aged man to eat defiling foods, then in violent rage he commanded that others of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrew.html#1">Hebrew</A> captives be brought, and that any who ate defiling food should be freed after eating, but if any were to refuse, these should be tortured even more cruelly. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> When the tyrant had given these orders, seven brothers - handsome, modest, noble, and accomplished in every way - were brought before him along with their aged mother. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> When the tyrant saw them, grouped about their mother as if in a chorus, he was pleased with them. And struck by their appearance and nobility, he smiled at them, and summoned them nearer and said, <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> "Young men, I admire each and every one of you in a kindly manner, and greatly respect the beauty and the number of such brothers. Not only do I advise you not to display the same madness as that of the old man who has just been tortured, but I also exhort you to yield to me and enjoy my friendship. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Just as I am able to punish those who disobey my orders, so I can be a benefactor to those who obey me. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Trust me, then, and you will have positions of authority in my government if you will renounce the ancestral tradition of your national life. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> And enjoy your youth by adopting the Greek way of life and by changing your manner of living. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> But if by disobedience you rouse my anger, you will compel me to destroy each and every one of you with dreadful punishments through tortures. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Therefore take pity on yourselves. Even I, your enemy, have compassion for your youth and handsome appearance. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Will you not consider this, that if you disobey, nothing remains for you but to die on the rack?" 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> When he had said these things, he ordered the instruments of torture to be brought forward so as to persuade them out of fear to eat the defiling food. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> And when the guards had placed before them wheels and joint-dislocators, rack and hooks and catapults and cauldrons, braziers and thumbscrews and iron claws and wedges and bellows, the tyrant resumed speaking: <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> "Be afraid, young fellows, and whatever justice you revere will be merciful to you when you transgress under compulsion." <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> But when they had heard the inducements and saw the dreadful devices, not only were they not afraid, but they also opposed the tyrant with their own philosophy, and by their right reasoning nullified his tyranny. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Let us consider, on the other hand, what arguments might have been used if some of them had been cowardly and unmanly. Would they not have been these? <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> "O wretches that we are and so senseless! Since the king has summoned and exhorted us to accept kind treatment if we obey him, <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> why do we take pleasure in vain resolves and venture upon a disobedience that brings death? <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> O men and brothers, should we not fear the instruments of torture and consider the threats of torments, and give up this vain opinion and this arrogance that threatens to destroy us? <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> Let us take pity on our youth and have compassion on our mother's age; <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> and let us seriously consider that if we disobey we are dead! <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> Also, divine justice will excuse us for fearing the king when we are under compulsion. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> Why do we banish ourselves from this most pleasant life and deprive ourselves of this delightful world? <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> Let us not struggle against compulsion nor take hollow pride in being put to the rack. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> Not even the law itself would arbitrarily slay us for fearing the instruments of torture. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> Why does such contentiousness excite us and such a fatal stubbornness please us, when we can live in peace if we obey the king?" <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> But the youths, though about to be tortured, neither said any of these things nor even seriously considered them. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> For they were contemptuous of the emotions and sovereign over agonies, <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> so that as soon as the tyrant had ceased counselling them to eat defiling food, all with one voice together, as from one mind, said: 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="9">[9]</A> "Why do you delay, O tyrant? For we are ready to die rather than transgress our ancestral commandments; <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> we are obviously putting our forefathers to shame unless we should practice ready obedience to the law and to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moses.html#1">Moses</A> our counsellor. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Tyrant and counsellor of lawlessness, in your hatred for us do not pity us more than we pity ourselves. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> For we consider this pity of yours which insures our safety through transgression of the law to be more grievous than death itself. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> You are trying to terrify us by threatening us with death by torture, as though a short time ago you learned nothing from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eleazar.html#2">Eleazar</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> And if the aged men of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrews.html#1">Hebrews</A> because of their religion lived piously while enduring torture, it would be even more fitting that we young men should die despising your coercive tortures, which our aged instructor also overcame. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Therefore, tyrant, put us to the test; and if you take our lives because of our religion, do not suppose that you can injure us by torturing us. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> For we, through this severe suffering and endurance, shall have the prize of virtue and shall be with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A>, for whom we suffer; <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> but you, because of your bloodthirstiness toward us, will deservedly undergo from the divine justice eternal torment by fire." 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> When they had said these things the tyrant not only was angry, as at those who are disobedient, but also was enraged, as at those who are ungrateful. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Then at his command the guards brought forward the eldest, and having torn off his tunic, they bound his hands and arms with thongs on each side. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> When they had worn themselves out beating him with scourges, without accomplishing anything, they placed him upon the wheel. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> When the noble youth was stretched out around this, his limbs were dislocated, <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> and though broken in every member he denounced the tyrant, saying, <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> "Most abominable tyrant, enemy of heavenly justice, savage of mind, you are mangling me in this manner, not because I am a murderer, or as one who acts impiously, but because I protect the divine law." <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> And when the guards said, "Agree to eat so that you may be released from the tortures," <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> he replied, "You abominable lackeys, your wheel is not so powerful as to strangle my reason. Cut my limbs, burn my flesh, and twist my joints. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> Through all these tortures I will convince you that sons of the Hebrews alone are invincible where virtue is concerned." <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> While he was saying these things, they spread fire under him, and while fanning the flames they tightened the wheel further. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> The wheel was completely smeared with blood, and the heap of coals was being quenched by the drippings of gore, and pieces of flesh were falling off the axles of the machine. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> Although the ligaments joining his bones were already severed, the courageous youth, worthy of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/abraham.html#1">Abraham</A>, did not groan, <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> but as though transformed by fire into immortality he nobly endured the torments of the rack. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> "Imitate me, brothers," he said. "Do not leave your post in my struggle or renounce our courageous brotherhood. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> Fight the sacred and noble battle for religion. Thereby the just Providence of our ancestors may become merciful to our nation and take vengeance on the accursed tyrant." <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> When he had said this, the saintly youth broke the thread of life. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> While all were marvelling at his courageous spirit, the guards brought in the next eldest, and after fitting themselves with iron gauntlets having sharp hooks, they bound him to the torture machine and catapult. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> Before torturing him, they inquired if he were willing to eat, and they heard his noble decision. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> These leopard-like beasts tore out his sinews with the iron hands, flayed all his flesh up to his chin, and tore away his scalp. But he steadfastly endured this agony and said, <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> "How sweet is any kind of death for the religion of our fathers!" <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> To the tyrant he said, "Do you not think, you most savage tyrant, that you are being tortured more than I, as you see the arrogant design of your tyranny being defeated by our endurance for the sake of religion? <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> I lighten my pain by the joys that come from virtue, <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> but you suffer torture by the threats that come from impiety. You will not escape, most abominable tyrant, the judgments of the divine wrath." 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="10">[10]</A> When he too had endured a glorious death, the third was led in, and many repeatedly urged him to save himself by tasting the meat. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> But he shouted, "Do you not know that the same father begot me and those who died, and the same mother bore me, and that I was brought up on the same teachings? <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> I do not renounce the noble kinship that binds me to my brothers." <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> . . . <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Enraged by the man's boldness, they disjointed his hands and feet with their instruments, dismembering him by prying his limbs from their sockets, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> and breaking his fingers and arms and legs and elbows. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Since they were not able in any way to break his spirit, they abandoned the instruments and scalped him with their fingernails in a <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythian</A> fashion. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> They immediately brought him to the wheel, and while his vertebrae were being dislocated upon it he saw his own flesh torn all around and drops of blood flowing from his entrails. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> When he was about to die, he said, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> "We, most abominable tyrant, are suffering because of our godly training and virtue, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> but you, because of your impiety and bloodthirstiness, will undergo unceasing torments." 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> When he also had died in a manner worthy of his brothers, they dragged in the fourth, saying, <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> "As for you, do not give way to the same insanity as your brothers, but obey the king and save yourself." <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> But he said to them, "You do not have a fire hot enough to make me play the coward. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> No, by the blessed death of my brothers, by the eternal destruction of the tyrant, and by the everlasting life of the pious, I will not renounce our noble brotherhood. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Contrive tortures, tyrant, so that you may learn from them that I am a brother to those who have just been tortured." <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> When he heard this, the bloodthirsty, murderous, and utterly abominable <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A> gave orders to cut out his tongue. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> But he said, "Even if you remove my organ of speech, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A> hears also those who are mute. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> See, here is my tongue; cut it off, for in spite of this you will not make our reason speechless. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> Gladly, for the sake of God, we let our bodily members be mutilated. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> God will visit you swiftly, for you are cutting out a tongue that has been melodious with divine hymns." 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11">[11]</A> When this one died also, after being cruelly tortured, the fifth leaped up, saying, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> "I will not refuse, tyrant, to be tortured for the sake of virtue. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> I have come of my own accord, so that by murdering me you will incur punishment from the heavenly justice for even more crimes. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Hater of virtue, hater of mankind, for what act of ours are you destroying us in this way? <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Is it because we revere the Creator of all things and live according to his virtuous law? <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> But these deeds deserve honours, not tortures." <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> While he was saying these things, the guards bound him and dragged him to the catapult; <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> they tied him to it on his knees, and fitting iron clamps on them, they twisted his back around the wedge on the wheel, so that he was completely curled back like a scorpion, and all his members were disjointed. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> In this condition, gasping for breath and in anguish of body, <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> he said, "Tyrant, they are splendid favours that you grant us against your will, because through these noble sufferings you give us an opportunity to show our endurance for the law." 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> After he too had died, the sixth, a mere boy, was led in. When the tyrant inquired whether he was willing to eat and be released, he said, <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> "I am younger in age than my brothers, but I am their equal in mind. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> Since to this end we were born and bred, we ought likewise to die for the same principles. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> So if you intend to torture me for not eating defiling foods, go on torturing!" <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> When he had said this, they led him to the wheel. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> He was carefully stretched tight upon it, his back was broken, and he was roasted from underneath. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> To his back they applied sharp spits that had been heated in the fire, and pierced his ribs so that his entrails were burned through. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> While being tortured he said, "O contest befitting holiness, in which so many of us brothers have been summoned to an arena of sufferings for religion, and in which we have not been defeated! <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> For religious knowledge, O tyrant, is invincible. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> I also, equipped with nobility, will die with my brothers, <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> and I myself will bring a great avenger upon you, you inventor of tortures and enemy of those who are truly devout. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> We six boys have paralyzed your tyranny! <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> Since you have not been able to persuade us to change our mind or to force us to eat defiling foods, is not this your downfall? <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> Your fire is cold to us, and the catapults painless, and your violence powerless. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> For it is not the guards of the tyrant but those of the divine law that are set over us; therefore, unconquered, we hold fast to reason." 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="12">[12]</A> When he also, thrown into the cauldron, had died a blessed death, the seventh and youngest of all came forward. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Even though the tyrant had been fearfully reproached by the brothers, he felt strong compassion for this child when he saw that he was already in fetters. He summoned him to come nearer and tried to console him, saying, <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> "You see the result of your brothers' stupidity, for they died in torments because of their disobedience. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> You too, if you do not obey, will be miserably tortured and die before your time, <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> but if you yield to persuasion you will be my friend and a leader in the government of the kingdom." <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> When he had so pleaded, he sent for the boy's mother to show compassion on her who had been bereaved of so many sons and to influence her to persuade the surviving son to obey and save himself. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> But when his mother had exhorted him in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrew.html#1">Hebrew</A> language, as we shall tell a little later, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> he said, "Let me loose, let me speak to the king and to all his friends that are with him." <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Extremely pleased by the boy's declaration, they freed him at once. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Running to the nearest of the braziers, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> he said, "You profane tyrant, most impious of all the wicked, since you have received good things and also your kingdom from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A>, were you not ashamed to murder his servants and torture on the wheel those who practice religion? <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Because of this, justice has laid up for you intense and eternal fire and tortures, and these throughout all time will never let you go. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> As a man, were you not ashamed, you most savage beast, to cut out the tongues of men who have feelings like yours and are made of the same elements as you, and to maltreat and torture them in this way? <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Surely they by dying nobly fulfilled their service to God, but you will wail bitterly for having slain without cause the contestants for virtue." <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> Then because he too was about to die, he said, <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> "I do not desert the excellent example of my brothers, <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> and I call on the God of our fathers to be merciful to our nation; <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> but on you he will take vengeance both in this present life and when you are dead." <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> After he had uttered these imprecations, he flung himself into the braziers and so ended his life. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="13">[13]</A> Since, then, the seven brothers despised sufferings even unto death, everyone must concede that devout reason is sovereign over the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> For if they had been slaves to their emotions and had eaten defiling food, we would say that they had been conquered by these emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> But in fact it was not so. Instead, by reason, which is praised before God, they prevailed over their emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> The supremacy of the mind over these cannot be overlooked, for the brothers mastered both emotions and pains. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> How then can one fail to confess the sovereignty of right reason over emotion in those who were not turned back by fiery agonies? <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> For just as towers jutting out over harbours hold back the threatening waves and make it calm for those who sail into the inner basin, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> so the seven-towered right reason of the youths, by fortifying the harbour of religion, conquered the tempest of the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> For they constituted a holy chorus of religion and encouraged one another, saying, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> "Brothers, let us die like brothers for the sake of the law; let us imitate the three youths in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/assyria.html#1">Assyria</A> who despised the same ordeal of the furnace. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Let us not be cowardly in the demonstration of our piety." <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> While one said, "Courage, brother," another said, "Bear up nobly," <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> and another reminded them, "Remember whence you came, and the father by whose hand <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isaac.html#1">Isaac</A> would have submitted to being slain for the sake of religion." <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Each of them and all of them together looking at one another, cheerful and undaunted, said, "Let us with all our hearts consecrate ourselves to God, who gave us our lives, and let us use our bodies as a bulwark for the law. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Let us not fear him who thinks he is killing us, <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> for great is the struggle of the soul and the danger of eternal torment lying before those who transgress the commandment of God. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Therefore let us put on the full armour of self-control, which is divine reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> For if we so die, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/abraham.html#1">Abraham</A> and Isaac and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jacob.html#1">Jacob</A> will welcome us, and all the fathers will praise us." <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> Those who were left behind said to each of the brothers who were being dragged away, "Do not put us to shame, brother, or betray the brothers who have died before us." 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> You are not ignorant of the affection of brotherhood, which the divine and all-wise Providence has bequeathed through the fathers to their descendants and which was implanted in the mother's womb. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> There each of the brothers dwelt the same length of time and was shaped during the same period of time; and growing from the same blood and through the same life, they were brought to the light of day. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> When they were born after an equal time of gestation, they drank milk from the same fountains. For such embraces brotherly-loving souls are nourished; <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> and they grow stronger from this common nurture and daily companionship, and from both general education and our discipline in the law of God. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> Therefore, when sympathy and brotherly affection had been so established, the brothers were the more sympathetic to one another. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> Since they had been educated by the same law and trained in the same virtues and brought up in right living, they loved one another all the more. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> A common zeal for nobility expanded their goodwill and harmony toward one another, <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> because, with the aid of their religion, they rendered their brotherly love more fervent. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> But although nature and companionship and virtuous habits had augmented the affection of brotherhood, those who were left endured for the sake of religion, while watching their brothers being maltreated and tortured to death. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="14">[14]</A>  Furthermore, they encouraged them to face the torture, so that they not only despised their agonies, but also mastered the emotions of brotherly love. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> O reason, more royal than kings and freer than the free! <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> O sacred and harmonious concord of the seven brothers on behalf of religion! <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> None of the seven youths proved coward or shrank from death, <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> but all of them, as though running the course toward immortality, hastened to death by torture. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Just as the hands and feet are moved in harmony with the guidance of the mind, so those holy youths, as though moved by an immortal spirit of devotion, agreed to go to death for its sake. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> O most holy seven, brothers in harmony! For just as the seven days of creation move in choral dance around religion, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> so these youths, forming a chorus, encircled the sevenfold fear of tortures and dissolved it. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Even now, we ourselves shudder as we hear of the tribulations of these young men; they not only saw what was happening, yes, not only heard the direct word of threat, but also bore the sufferings patiently, and in agonies of fire at that. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> What could be more excruciatingly painful than this? For the power of fire is intense and swift, and it consumed their bodies quickly. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Do not consider it amazing that reason had full command over these men in their tortures, since the mind of woman despised even more diverse agonies, <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> for the mother of the seven young men bore up as each one of her children was subjected to the rack. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Observe how complex is a mother's love for her children, which draws everything toward an emotion felt in her inmost parts. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Even unreasoning animals, like mankind, have a sympathy and parental love for their offspring. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> For example, among birds, the ones that are tame protect their young by building on the housetops, <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> and the others, by building in precipitous chasms and in holes and tops of trees, hatch the nestlings and ward off the intruder. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> If they are not able to keep him away, they do what they can to help their young by flying in circles around them in the anguish of love, warning them with their own calls. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> And why is it necessary to demonstrate sympathy for children by the example of unreasoning animals, <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> since even bees at the time for making honeycombs defend themselves against intruders as though with an iron dart sting those who approach their hive and defend it even to the death? <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> But sympathy for her children did not sway the mother of the young men; she was of the same mind as Abraham. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="15">[15]</A> O reason of the children, tyrant over the emotions! O religion, more desirable to the mother than her children! <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Two courses were open to this mother, that of religion, and that of preserving her seven sons for a time, as the tyrant had promised. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> She loved religion more, religion that preserves them for eternal life according to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A>'s promise. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> In what manner might I express the emotions of parents who love their children? We impress upon the character of a small child a wondrous likeness both of mind and of form. Especially is this true of mothers, who because of their birth-pangs have a deeper sympathy toward their offspring than do the fathers. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Considering that mothers are the weaker sex and give birth to many, they are more devoted to their children. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> The mother of the seven boys, more than any other mother, loved her children. In seven pregnancies she had implanted in herself tender love toward them, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> and because of the many pains she suffered with each of them she had sympathy for them; <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> yet because of the fear of God she disdained the temporary safety of her children. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Not only so, but also because of the nobility of her sons and their ready obedience to the law she felt a greater tenderness toward them. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> For they were righteous and self-controlled and brave and magnanimous, and loved their brothers and their mother, so that they obeyed her even to death in keeping the ordinances. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Nevertheless, though so many factors influenced the mother to suffer with them out of love for her children, in the case of none of them were the various tortures strong enough to pervert her reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Instead, the mother urged them on, each child singly and all together, to death for the sake of religion. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> O sacred nature and affection of parental love, yearning of parents toward offspring, nurture and indomitable suffering by mothers! <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> This mother, who saw them tortured and burned one by one, because of religion did not change her attitude. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> She watched the flesh of her children consumed by fire, their toes and fingers scattered on the ground, and the flesh of the head to the chin exposed like masks. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> O mother, tried now by more bitter pains than even the birth-pangs you suffered for them! <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> O woman, who alone gave birth to such complete devotion! <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> When the first-born breathed his last it did not turn you aside, nor when the second in torments looked at you piteously nor when the third expired; <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> nor did you weep when you looked at the eyes of each one in his tortures gazing boldly at the same agonies, and saw in their nostrils the signs of the approach of death. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> When you saw the flesh of children burned upon the flesh of other children, severed hands upon hands, scalped heads upon heads, and corpses fallen on other corpses and when you saw the place filled with many spectators of the tortures, you did not shed tears. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> Neither the melodies of sirens nor the songs of swans attract the attention of their hearers as did the voices of the children in torture calling to their mother. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> How great and how many torments the mother then suffered as her sons were tortured on the wheel and with the hot irons! <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> But devout reason, giving her heart a man's courage in the very midst of her emotions, strengthened her to disregard her temporal love for her children. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> Although she witnessed the destruction of seven children and the ingenious and various torments of the rack, this noble mother disregarded all these because of faith in God. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> For as in the council chamber of her own soul she saw mighty advocates - nature, family, parental love, and the suffering of her children on the rack - <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> this mother held two ballots, one bearing death and the other deliverance for her children. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> She did not approve the deliverance which would preserve the seven sons for a short time, <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> but as the daughter of God-fearing <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/abraham.html#1">Abraham</A> she remembered his fortitude. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> O mother of the nation, vindicator of the law and champion of religion, who carried away the prize of the contest in your heart! <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> O more noble than males in steadfastness, and more manly than men in endurance! <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> Just as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/noah.html#1">Noah</A>'s ark, carrying the world in the universal flood, stoutly endured the waves, <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> so you, O guardian of the law, overwhelmed from every side by the flood of your emotions and the violent winds, the torture of your sons, endured nobly and withstood the wintry storms that assail religion. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="16">[16]</A> If, then, a woman, advanced in years and mother of seven sons, endured seeing her children tortured to death, it must be admitted that devout reason is sovereign over the emotions. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Thus I have demonstrated not only that men have ruled over the emotions, but also that a woman has despised the fiercest tortures. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> The lions surrounding <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/daniel.html#1">Daniel</A> were not so savage, nor was the raging fiery furnace of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mishael.html#1">Mishael</A> so intensely hot, as was her innate parental love, inflamed as she saw her seven sons tortured in such varied ways. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> But the mother quenched so many and such great emotions by devout reason. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Consider this also. If this woman, though a mother, had been fainthearted, she would have mourned over them and perhaps spoken as follows: <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> "O how wretched am I and many times unhappy! After bearing seven children, I am now the mother of none! <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> O seven childbirths all in vain, seven profitless pregnancies - children fruitlessly nurtured and wretchedly nursed! <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> In vain, my sons, I endured many birth-pangs for you, and the more grievous anxieties of your upbringing. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Alas for my children, some unmarried, others married and without offspring. I shall not see your children or have the happiness of being called grandmother. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Alas, I who had so many and beautiful children am a widow and alone, with many sorrows. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Nor when I die, shall I have any of my sons to bury me." <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Yet the sacred and God-fearing mother did not wail with such a lament for any of them, nor did she dissuade any of them from dying, nor did she grieve as they were dying, <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> but, as though having a mind like adamant and giving rebirth for immortality to the whole number of her sons, she implored them and urged them on to death for the sake of religion. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> O mother, soldier of God in the cause of religion, elder and woman! By steadfastness you have conquered even a tyrant, and in word and deed you have proved more powerful than a man. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> For when you and your sons were arrested together, you stood and watched <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eleazar.html#2">Eleazar</A> being tortured, and said to your sons in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrew.html#1">Hebrew</A> language, <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> "My sons, noble is the contest to which you are called to bear witness for the nation. Fight zealously for our ancestral law. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> For it would be shameful if, while an aged man endures such agonies for the sake of religion, you young men were to be terrified by tortures. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> Remember that it is through God that you have had a share in the world and have enjoyed life, <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> and therefore you ought to endure any suffering for the sake of God. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> For his sake also our father Abraham was zealous to sacrifice his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isaac.html#1">Isaac</A>, the ancestor of our nation; and when Isaac saw his father's hand wielding a sword and descending upon him, he did not cower. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> And Daniel the righteous was thrown to the lions, and Hananiah, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/azariah.html#1">Azariah</A>, and Mishael were hurled into the fiery furnace and endured it for the sake of God. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> You too must have the same faith in God and not be grieved. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> It is unreasonable for people who have religious knowledge not to withstand pain." <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> By these words the mother of the seven encouraged and persuaded each of her sons to die rather than violate God's commandment. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> They knew also that those who die for the sake of God live in God, as do Abraham and Isaac and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jacob.html#1">Jacob</A> and all the patriarchs. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="17">[17]</A> Some of the guards said that when she also was about to be seized and put to death she threw herself into the flames so that no one might touch her body. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> O mother, who with your seven sons nullified the violence of the tyrant, frustrated his evil designs, and showed the courage of your faith! <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Nobly set like a roof on the pillars of your sons, you held firm and unswerving against the earthquake of the tortures. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Take courage, therefore, O holy-minded mother, maintaining firm an enduring hope in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/god.html#1">God</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The moon in heaven, with the stars, does not stand so august as you, who, after lighting the way of your star-like seven sons to piety, stand in honour before God and are firmly set in heaven with them. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> For your children were true descendants of father <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/abraham.html#1">Abraham</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> If it were possible for us to paint the history of your piety as an artist might, would not those who first beheld it have shuddered as they saw the mother of the seven children enduring their varied tortures to death for the sake of religion? <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Indeed it would be proper to inscribe upon their tomb these words as a reminder to the people of our nation: <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> "Here lie buried an aged priest and an aged woman and seven sons, because of the violence of the tyrant who wished to destroy the way of life of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrews.html#1">Hebrews</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> They vindicated their nation, looking to God and enduring torture even to death." 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Truly the contest in which they were engaged was divine, <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> for on that day virtue gave the awards and tested them for their endurance. The prize was immortality in endless life. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Eleazar was the first contestant; the mother of the seven sons entered the competition, and the brothers contended. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> The tyrant was the antagonist, and the world and the human race were the spectators. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> Reverence for God was victor and gave the crown to its own athletes. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Who did not admire the athletes of the divine legislation? Who were not amazed? <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> The tyrant himself and all his council marvelled at their endurance, <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> because of which they now stand before the divine throne and live through blessed eternity. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> For <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moses.html#1">Moses</A> says [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Deuteronomy#Chapter_33">Deuteronomy, 33'3</A>], "All who are consecrated are under your hands." <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> These, then, who have been consecrated for the sake of God, are honoured, not only with this honour, but also by the fact that because of them our enemies did not rule over our nation, <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> the tyrant was punished, and the homeland purified - they having become, as it were, a ransom for the sin of our nation. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> And through the blood of those devout ones and their death as an expiation, divine Providence preserved <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/israel.html#1">Israel</A> that previously had been afflicted. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> For the tyrant <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A>, when he saw the courage of their virtue and their endurance under the tortures, proclaimed them to his soldiers as an example for their own endurance, <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> and this made them brave and courageous for infantry battle and siege, and he ravaged and conquered all his enemies. 

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="18">[18]</A> O Israelite children, offspring of the seed of Abraham, obey this law and exercise piety in every way, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> knowing that devout reason is master of all emotions, not only of sufferings from within, but also of those from without. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Therefore those who gave over their bodies in suffering for the sake of religion were not only admired by men, but also were deemed worthy to share in a divine inheritance. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Because of them the nation gained peace, and by reviving observance of the law in the homeland they ravaged the enemy. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The tyrant Antiochus was both punished on earth and is being chastised after his death. Since in no way whatever was he able to compel the Israelites to become pagans and to abandon their ancestral customs, he left Jerusalem and marched against the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persia.html#1">Persians</A>. 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> The mother of seven sons expressed also these principles to her children: <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> "I was a pure virgin and did not go outside my father's house; but I guarded the rib from which woman was made. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> No seducer corrupted me on a desert plain, nor did the destroyer, the deceitful serpent, defile the purity of my virginity. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> In the time of my maturity I remained with my husband, and when these sons had grown up their father died. A happy man was he, who lived out his life with good children, and did not have the grief of bereavement. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> While he was still with you, he taught you the law and the prophets. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> He read to you about <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/abel.html#1">Abel</A> slain by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cain.html#1">Cain</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isaac.html#1">Isaac</A> who was offered as a burnt offering, and of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/joseph.html#1">Joseph</A> in prison. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> He told you of the zeal of Phineas, and he taught you about Hananiah, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/azariah.html#1">Azariah</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mishael.html#1">Mishael</A> in the fire. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> He praised <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/daniel.html#1">Daniel</A> in the den of the lions and blessed him. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> He reminded you of the scripture of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isaiah.html#1">Isaiah</A>, which says [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Isaiah#Chapter_43">43'2</A>], 'Even though you go through the fire, the flame shall not consume you.' <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> He sang to you songs of the psalmist <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/david.html#1">David</A>, who said [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Psalms#Psalm_34">Psalms, 34'19</A>], 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous.' <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> He recounted to you <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/solomon.html#1">Solomon</A>'s proverb [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Proverbs#Chapter_3">Proverbs, 3'18</A>], 'There is a tree of life for those who do his will.' <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> He confirmed the saying of Ezekiel [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Ezekiel#Chapter_37">37'3</A>] 'Shall these dry bones live?' <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> For he did not forget to teach you the song that Moses taught, which says [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Deuteronomy#Chapter_32">Deuteronomy, 32'39</A> &amp; <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28World_English%29/Deuteronomy#Chapter_30">30'20</A>], <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> 'I kill and I make alive: this is your life and the length of your days.'" 

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> O bitter was that day - and yet not bitter - when that bitter tyrant of the Greeks quenched fire with fire in his cruel cauldrons, and in his burning rage brought those seven sons of the daughter of Abraham to the catapult and back again to more tortures, <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> pierced the pupils of their eyes and cut out their tongues, and put them to death with various tortures. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> For these crimes divine justice pursued and will pursue the accursed tyrant. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> But the sons of Abraham with their victorious mother are gathered together into the chorus of the fathers, and have received pure and immortal souls from God, <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

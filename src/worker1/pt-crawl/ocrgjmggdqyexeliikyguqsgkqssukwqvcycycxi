<h1><span>I.&#13;
Summary</span></h1>
<p>In January 2008, women in the custody of US Immigration and&#13;
Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a county jail in Arizona wrote a letter. Addressed&#13;
to an immigration attorney and copied to Human Rights Watch, the letter&#13;
detailed conditions at the jail, including obstacles to medical care, and&#13;
summarized some of the responses the women received when they pressed for&#13;
needed care:</p>
<blockquote>Medical care that is provided to us is very minimal and&#13;
general.... If you do not speak English, you cannot fuss, the only thing you&#13;
can do is go to bed &amp; suffer.... We have no privacy when our health record&#13;
is being discussed.... When we’ve complained to the nurses, we get&#13;
ridiculed with replies like: “You should have made better choices ... ICE&#13;
is not here to make you feel comfortable ... our hands are [tied] ... Well, we&#13;
can’t do much you’re getting deported anyway ... learn English&#13;
before you cross the border ... Mi casa no es su casa.”.... Our living&#13;
situation is degrading and inhuman.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" id="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>These women are not alone. Most immigration detainees in the&#13;
United States are held as a result of administrative, rather than criminal,&#13;
infractions, but the medical treatment they receive can be worse than that of&#13;
convicted criminals in the US prison system. The inspector general’s&#13;
office at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued two reports in&#13;
the past three years criticizing medical treatment at immigration detention&#13;
facilities. Deaths in custody attributed to egregious failures of medical care&#13;
have received prominent media attention and a University of Arizona study in&#13;
January 2009 described failures of medical care for women detained at&#13;
facilities in that state.</p>
<p>Underlying the individual stories of abuse and mistreatment&#13;
is a system badly in need of repair, recent reforms notwithstanding. This&#13;
report, based on interviews with women detainees, immigration officials, and&#13;
visits to nine different facilities in three states, addresses one important&#13;
component of the needed change: the medical care available to women detainees.&#13;
As detailed below, we found that ICE policies unduly deprive women of basic&#13;
health services. And even services that are provided are often unconscionably&#13;
delayed or otherwise seriously substandard.</p>
<p>Abuses documented in this report range from delays in&#13;
medical treatment and testing in cases where symptoms indicate that women’s&#13;
lives and well-being could be at risk, to the shackling of pregnant women&#13;
during transport, to systematic failures in provision of routine care. As the&#13;
letter from the women immigration detainees in Arizona concluded, ICE&#13;
healthcare standards are “not in line with international standards to&#13;
ensure that detainee rights are protected.” We join in the women’s&#13;
appeal for change.</p>
<p>*              *              *</p>
<p>The number of individuals held in administrative detention&#13;
while their immigration cases are determined has skyrocketed in recent years.&#13;
The detained population on any given day is now over 29,000 nationwide, up&#13;
almost 50 percent from 2005. ICE holds the majority of them in state and county&#13;
jails contracted to provide bed space and other basic custodial services,&#13;
including medical care. As civil—not criminal—detainees, these&#13;
individuals have no right to be provided an attorney by the government while it&#13;
holds them for an uncertain period pending the outcome of their immigration&#13;
case.</p>
<p>Every one of these individuals has health care rights and&#13;
needs. Unfortunately, the system for providing health care to detained&#13;
immigrants is perilously flawed, putting the lives and well-being of more and&#13;
more people at risk each year. While the immigration detention system’s&#13;
flawed medical care affects both men and women, this report focuses on the&#13;
situation of women detainees, roughly 10 percent of the overall immigration&#13;
detainee population at any given time. These women include refugees fleeing&#13;
persecution, survivors of sexual assault, pregnant women, nursing mothers&#13;
separated from their children, patients detained amidst treatment for cancer,&#13;
and many more women who have needs for basic medical care.</p>
<p>Many women in the United States continue to struggle with&#13;
finding ways to access basic medical care. But for the thousands of women in&#13;
immigration detention, there is only one way to get a Pap smear to detect&#13;
cervical cancer, undergo a mammogram, receive pregnancy care, access care and&#13;
counseling after sexual violence, or simply obtain a sufficient supply of&#13;
sanitary pads: through ICE. In custody without other options, women receive&#13;
care through ICE or are forced to go without.</p>
<p>In interviews with detained and recently detained immigrant&#13;
women, Human Rights Watch documented dozens of instances where women’s&#13;
health concerns went unaddressed by facility medical staff, or were addressed&#13;
only after considerable delays.</p>
<ul><li>We met women who were denied gynecological care or&#13;
     obtained it only after many requests, including a woman who entered&#13;
     detention shortly after receiving news of an abnormal Pap smear. She told&#13;
     detention authorities that her doctor instructed her to get Pap smears&#13;
     every six months, but after 16 months in detention and many requests, she&#13;
     had still not gotten a Pap smear.</li>
<li>We met women who were refused hormonal contraceptives&#13;
     during detention, including one who had inflamed ovaries and endured&#13;
     excruciating, heavy periods when the detention facility refused to provide&#13;
     her the birth control pills prescribed to manage her condition.</li>
<li>We met women who, according to standards of medical&#13;
     practice in the United States, should have received mammograms, including&#13;
     one woman who had breast cancer surgery before detention and was&#13;
     instructed to get mammograms every six months. Due for her six-month&#13;
     check-up when she was detained, she waited four months for her first&#13;
     mammogram during detention, and did not receive another in her remaining&#13;
     12 months there.</li>
<li>We met women who complained of inadequate care during&#13;
     pregnancy, including one diagnosed with an ovarian cyst threatening her&#13;
     five-month pregnancy shortly before she was detained. Her doctor said the&#13;
     cyst should be monitored every two to three weeks, but during her stay in&#13;
     detention of more than four weeks, she was never able to see a doctor. The&#13;
     medical staff’s response to her last sick call request read,&#13;
     “be patient.”</li>
<li>We met mothers who were nursing their babies prior to&#13;
     detention and were then denied breast pumps in the facilities, resulting&#13;
     in fever, pain, mastitis, and the inability to continue breastfeeding upon&#13;
     release.</li>
<li>We met women who had to beg, plead, and in some cases work&#13;
     within the facility just to get enough sanitary pads not to bleed through&#13;
     their clothes, and one woman who sat on a toilet for hours when the&#13;
     facility would not give her the pads she needed.</li>
</ul><p>Certain themes arose again and again in our interviews and&#13;
demand attention. Detained women did not have accurate information about&#13;
available health services. Care and treatment were often delayed and sometimes&#13;
denied. Confidentiality of medical information was often breached. Women had&#13;
trouble directly accessing facility health clinics and persuading security&#13;
guards that they needed medical attention. Interpreters were not always&#13;
available during exams. Security guards were sometimes inside exam rooms,&#13;
invading privacy and encroaching on the patient-provider relationship. Some&#13;
women feared retaliation or negative consequences to their immigration cases if&#13;
they sought care. A few were not given the option to refuse medication or&#13;
received other inappropriate treatment. Full medical records were not available&#13;
when the detained women were transferred or released. Written complaints about&#13;
medical care through facility grievance procedures went ignored. The list goes&#13;
on.</p>
<p>Official ICE policy, which focuses on emergency care and&#13;
keeping the individuals in its custody in deportable condition, effectively&#13;
discourages the routine provision of some basic women’s health services.&#13;
ICE’s Division of Immigration Health Services (DIHS) has chief&#13;
responsibility for the medical care provided to detained immigrants, whether it&#13;
provides those services directly or through a contractor at a local facility.&#13;
The DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package, which governs access&#13;
to off-site specialists, says that requests for non-emergency care will be considered&#13;
if going without treatment in custody would “cause deterioration of the&#13;
detainee’s health or uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation&#13;
status.” Although, on occasion, officials have offered generous&#13;
interpretations of this policy in its defense, the message about the scope of&#13;
care provided remains clear. “We are in the deportation business....&#13;
Obviously, our goal is to remove individuals ordered removed from our&#13;
country,” ICE spokesperson Kelly Nantel told a reporter in June 2008.&#13;
“We address their health care issues to make sure they are medically able&#13;
to travel and medically able to return to their country.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[2]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The Covered Services Package operates in tandem with&#13;
ICE’s national standards for its detention facilities, which include a&#13;
medical care standard that was revised in September 2008 (the new medical care&#13;
standard will not take full effect until 2010). While the new medical care&#13;
standard provides that “detainees will have access to a continuum of&#13;
health care services,” there is no detention standard specific to women&#13;
or their health needs. The new standard mentions women’s health care only&#13;
briefly, specifying merely that women will have access to prenatal and&#13;
postnatal care and that detained individuals will have access to “gender-appropriate&#13;
examinations.”</p>
<p>When the US government chooses to take thousands of&#13;
immigrants into its custody—which is itself a highly contentious and&#13;
costly course of action—it necessarily assumes responsibility for&#13;
providing adequate health care to those individuals. This may pose challenges,&#13;
but they are not insurmountable. Guidance on health care in custodial&#13;
situations, including care for women, is readily available from a range of US&#13;
and international sources, including the American Public Health&#13;
Association’s <i>Standards for Health Services in Correctional&#13;
Institutions</i> and the National Commission on Correctional Health&#13;
Care’s <i>Standards for Health Services in Jails</i>. As this report&#13;
details, ICE practice falls short of many of these standards.</p>
<p>The revised ICE medical standard contains important&#13;
improvements, but much more remains to be done to develop adequate policies,&#13;
ensure their proper implementation, and open up the detention system to&#13;
effective oversight.</p>
<p>As a start, the government should take immediate steps to&#13;
address the fundamental policy flaws that limit access to medical care for all&#13;
immigration detainees. We recommend:</p>
<ul><li>To DIHS: Amend the Covered Services Package to remove&#13;
     inappropriate consideration of an individual’s deportation prospects&#13;
     in determining eligibility for medical procedures and harmonize the&#13;
     package with the revised ICE medical standard so that detained individuals&#13;
     can access a full continuum of health services, whether available inside&#13;
     or outside the detention facility.</li>
<li>To ICE: Require all facilities holding individuals on&#13;
     behalf of ICE to maintain accreditation with the National Commission on&#13;
     Correctional Health Care.</li>
<li>To DHS: Convert the ICE detention standards, including the&#13;
     ICE medical standard, into federal administrative regulations so that they&#13;
     have the force of law and detained individuals and their advocates have&#13;
     recourse to courts to redress shortfalls in health care.</li>
</ul><p>Further, to address the glaring gaps in ICE policy regarding&#13;
women’s health concerns, we recommend:</p>
<ul><li>To ICE: Implement the recommendations of the UN special&#13;
     rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, including in particular the&#13;
     recommendations that ICE develop gender-specific detention standards with&#13;
     attention to the medical and mental health needs of women survivors of&#13;
     violence and refrain from detaining women who are suffering the effects of&#13;
     persecution or abuse, or who are pregnant or nursing infants.</li></ul><ul><li>To ICE: Incorporate into the ICE medical standard the&#13;
     American Public Health Association’s standards on women’s&#13;
     health care in correctional institutions and the recommendations of the&#13;
     National Commission on Correctional Health Care’s policy statement&#13;
     on women’s health care.</li>
<li>To ICE and DIHS: Establish a formal process for ICE&#13;
     officers charged with case management to coordinate with health services&#13;
     personnel to ensure that nursing mothers, pregnant women, and other women&#13;
     with significant health concerns are immediately identified and considered&#13;
     for parole.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, to meet its obligations and make real improvements&#13;
in medical care for women in immigration detention, the government should aggressively&#13;
pursue better implementation and oversight of its policies, beginning with the&#13;
following steps:</p>
<ul><li>To ICE and DIHS: Conduct intensive outreach to facilities&#13;
     to ensure that both health professionals and security personnel are aware&#13;
     that the men and women in their custody are entitled to the same level of&#13;
     medical care as individuals who are not detained and assure health&#13;
     professionals that ICE and DIHS policies are intended to support and not&#13;
     inhibit their delivery of care consistent with standards of medical&#13;
     practice in the United States.</li>
<li>To ICE: Improve the current system for receiving and&#13;
     tracking complaints made by individuals in ICE custody. Ensure that all&#13;
     individuals receive notice of complaint procedures in their native&#13;
     languages and that they are informed of the availability of these&#13;
     mechanisms for addressing medical care complaints.</li>
<li>To DHS: Require detention facilities to provide regular&#13;
     reports to the DHS Office of the Inspector General detailing the number of&#13;
     grievances received regarding medical care and their disposition at the&#13;
     facility level.</li>
</ul><p><span> </span></p>
<h1><span>II. Methodology</span></h1>
<p>This report is based primarily on interviews conducted by&#13;
Human Rights Watch in the United States in 2008 with individuals possessing&#13;
direct knowledge of the medical care provided to women in immigration&#13;
detention. Our research included consultations with legal and health service&#13;
providers and immigration policy experts, and a review of relevant published&#13;
materials. The research also included interviews with 48 women detained by&#13;
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) (34 of whom were in detention when we&#13;
interviewed them and 14 who had been detained for some period of time since the&#13;
formation of ICE in 2003); 17 detention officials and health services&#13;
administrators; and two off-site specialists contracted to provide prenatal and&#13;
gynecological services to women in ICE custody.</p>
<p>In these interviews and visits to nine detention facilities,&#13;
Human Rights Watch investigated care for a range of women’s health&#13;
concerns and collected information regarding each type of facility where ICE&#13;
policies govern health care: service processing centers operated directly by&#13;
ICE, contract detention facilities managed by private companies, and state and county&#13;
jails contracted through intergovernmental service agreements. On October 30,&#13;
2008, we met with officials at ICE headquarters to share our preliminary&#13;
findings, clarify a number of medical care policies, and discuss ICE’s&#13;
plans for health services going forward.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch informed ICE of our intent to carry out&#13;
this and two other research projects in February 2008 and entered into&#13;
discussions with ICE officials regarding the parameters of our access to detention&#13;
facilities.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
ICE asked Human Rights Watch to propose a schedule of facility visits that were&#13;
to include a tour and private interviews with detained individuals identified&#13;
by Human Rights Watch in advance of the visit. In selecting the facilities for&#13;
this research project, Human Rights Watch sought to identify states with a high&#13;
concentration of women in detention, examples of each of the types of facility referenced&#13;
above, and local legal service providers and other partners able to identify women&#13;
willing to talk about their detention experience. On the basis of these&#13;
criteria, we identified ten facilities in Florida, Texas, and Arizona.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
With the exception of one facility visit, ICE accommodated the requests for&#13;
visits to these facilities and arranged for them on the dates we specified.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[5]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
It should be noted that Human Rights Watch adopted this methodology to enhance&#13;
the breadth and depth of the research but we did not conduct a scientific&#13;
sampling and we do not contend that generalized conclusions about conditions at&#13;
ICE facilities nationwide can be drawn on the basis of our findings.</p>
<p>While the bulk of the interviews for this report were&#13;
conducted at detention centers between April 7 and May 2, 2008, in accordance&#13;
with the schedule of announced facility visits negotiated with ICE, Human&#13;
Rights Watch arranged further interviews with women released from detention,&#13;
community service providers, and local activists during the same period. In&#13;
addition, in June, July, and August 2008, we interviewed six formerly detained&#13;
women in the Washington, DC and New York metropolitan areas. Follow-up research&#13;
continued through February 2009 and included meeting with ICE and DIHS and&#13;
examining materials obtained through a request submitted to ICE under the Freedom&#13;
of Information Act.</p>
<p>Our main method for reaching women willing to speak with us,&#13;
whether currently or formerly detained, was through legal service providers, who&#13;
discussed our project with women they identified as possibly having information&#13;
relevant to our research. However, with more than 80 percent of individuals in&#13;
detention unrepresented, many women were simply beyond our reach. Also, fear&#13;
among women that speaking with us about detention conditions could adversely affect&#13;
their immigration status led some to decline an interview.</p>
<p>ICE had no input in identifying which women would be&#13;
interviewed for this research. However, an ambiguous limitation imposed by ICE regarding&#13;
the number of interviews and shifting requirements for documentation of the individuals’&#13;
consent to be interviewed proved obstructive. Shortly before the start of the&#13;
first trip, ICE introduced a limit of 12 on the number of individuals in&#13;
custody who could be interviewed, without indicating whether this limit applied&#13;
per facility, per day, per state, or per Human Rights Watch project. Despite&#13;
efforts to clarify this issue, the limit became a major impediment, as each ICE&#13;
field office varied in its application of the limit set by headquarters, and&#13;
none permitted us to interview more than 12 detained individuals per facility&#13;
for all three projects. Further, the field offices imposed different&#13;
requirements regarding the form in which the individuals, and sometimes their&#13;
lawyers, were to demonstrate their consent to the interviews. They also&#13;
required up to five business days notice for the list of interviewees, a&#13;
particularly impractical demand given the transience of the immigration&#13;
detention population.</p>
<p>As noted above, of the 48 women who spoke with Human Rights&#13;
Watch about their experience with medical care in immigration detention, 34&#13;
were in ICE custody at the time of their interview; the other 14, all of whom&#13;
had been detained for some period of time since the formation of ICE in 2003,&#13;
had been released from custody and were living in the US. The length of time&#13;
the women had spent in ICE custody varied considerably, from less than 24 hours&#13;
to over two-and-a-half years. The backgrounds of the women interviewed also&#13;
varied in terms of the length of time they had spent in the US, the manner in&#13;
which they had come to be in ICE custody, and their countries of origin,&#13;
although 29 of the 48 came from Latin America and the Caribbean. No one below&#13;
the age of 18 was interviewed for this report, and the majority of the women&#13;
were in their 20s or 30s.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch conducted an individual interview with&#13;
each woman. With the exception of two, the interviews at detention centers took&#13;
place in a room in which only the woman, the Human Rights Watch interviewers,&#13;
and any interpreters were present. In two cases, the interviews were conducted&#13;
in a corner of a large room in which other detained women were present but out&#13;
of earshot. In a single instance, one woman we interviewed interpreted for&#13;
another woman in a subsequent interview with the second woman’s express&#13;
consent. Human Rights Watch met with women who had been released from detention&#13;
in a variety of locations selected for their comfort and privacy. In four&#13;
cases, family members of the women were present at the request of the interviewee&#13;
for all or a portion of the interview and in one case a woman’s lawyer&#13;
participated in the interview. The primary interviewers for this project were&#13;
women; however, due to logistical constraints, a male colleague pursuing a&#13;
separate line of research was present for several of the interviews.</p>
<p>The interviews ranged in length from 15 minutes to almost&#13;
four hours; most lasted approximately one hour. Interviews were conducted in&#13;
English or in Spanish, and, in one case, in French. They began with a&#13;
discussion of the purpose of the interview and an explanation that&#13;
participation was entirely voluntary and could be stopped at any time. Where&#13;
appropriate, Human Rights Watch attempted to provide contact information for&#13;
other organizations offering legal, counseling, or social services. No one&#13;
received or was promised any material compensation for their participation. To&#13;
protect their privacy and alleviate concerns regarding retaliation, Human&#13;
Rights Watch assured women that their real names and the potentially identifying&#13;
details of their interview would not appear in this report. For this reason,&#13;
the names of all women interviewed for this report have been replaced with&#13;
pseudonyms (in the form of names and initials which do not reflect real names)&#13;
and the exact date and precise location of the interviews have been withheld.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h1><span>III. Background</span></h1>
<p>The women whose accounts appear in this report are among a&#13;
growing number whose physical and mental health are at risk as a result of the&#13;
US government’s increasing reliance on detention as a means of&#13;
immigration law enforcement. Between December 2005 and May 2008, the number of&#13;
individuals in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on any given&#13;
day shot up almost 50 percent, from 19,562 to 29,340,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[6]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
giving ICE the distinction of overseeing the fastest growing form of&#13;
incarceration in the US.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[7]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
For the fiscal year that ended on September 31, 2007, ICE reported that it had held&#13;
more than 320,000 people in its custody for various lengths of time over the&#13;
course of that single year.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[8]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>As the number of people detained has increased, the number&#13;
of women detained has risen as well. In fact, the proportion of the detention&#13;
population made up by women increased from approximately 7 percent in 2001 to&#13;
10 percent in 2008.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[9]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Detained for alleged violations of US immigration law, these women include&#13;
asylum seekers,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[10]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
undocumented immigrants,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[11]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
legal permanent residents convicted of certain crimes,<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[12]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
refugees resettled by the US who did not apply for permanent residency,<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" id="_ftnref13"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[13]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
and even US citizens whose citizenship the government disputes.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" id="_ftnref14"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[14]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The dramatic increase in the detention of immigrants can be&#13;
traced back to several policy developments of the past 13 years. These include&#13;
the passage in 1996 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility&#13;
Act, which expanded mandatory detention during removal<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" id="_ftnref15"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[15]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
proceedings for individuals convicted of certain crimes;<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" id="_ftnref16"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[16]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
the events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent emphasis on border&#13;
security and immigration law enforcement; the broader detention powers ushered&#13;
in by the USA PATRIOT Act;<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" id="_ftnref17"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[17]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
and an expansion in the use of expedited removal for undocumented individuals&#13;
apprehended at a port of entry or within a certain distance of the border.</p>
<h2><span>The Immigration Detention&#13;
System</span></h2>
<p>ICE detains individuals at over 500 facilities nationwide.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" id="_ftnref18"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[18]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The facilities fall into four categories: service processing centers operated&#13;
directly by ICE; contract detention facilities managed by private companies&#13;
such as the GEO Group and Corrections Corporation of America; state and county&#13;
jails that ICE has contracted with through intergovernmental service&#13;
agreements; and facilities run by the federal Bureau of Prisons. Eight of the&#13;
facilities used by ICE are service processing centers, 7 are contract detention&#13;
facilities, and more than 500 are state and county jails.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" id="_ftnref19"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[19]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This report does not address conditions at the few Bureau of Prisons facilities&#13;
used because they are separately regulated.</p>
<p>To be eligible to hold women, ICE facilities need only&#13;
establish that they can maintain physical and visual separation of the sexes.&#13;
Even though they constitute only 10 percent of the immigration detention&#13;
population, women are spread out over 300 plus facilities. However, 50 percent&#13;
of the women detained by ICE are held in ten facilities, half of which are&#13;
located in Texas.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[20]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
ICE holds 68 percent of the women in its custody in state and county jails, 25&#13;
percent in contract detention facilities, and just 7 percent in the service&#13;
processing centers run by ICE.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" id="_ftnref21"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[21]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
State and county jails have greater latitude to stray from compliance with&#13;
certain provisions of the ICE detention standards.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" id="_ftnref22"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[22]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In addition, the remoteness of some of these facilities may be detrimental to&#13;
individuals’ access to counsel and family members.</p>
<p>While “enforcement” stands out as the preeminent&#13;
watchword of the current political discourse on immigration, detention is often&#13;
not a proportional, necessary, or cost-effective response to immigration violations,&#13;
most of which are administrative, not criminal, infractions.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" id="_ftnref23"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[23]</span></span></span></span></a>Under US and international law, the&#13;
government’s infringement of fundamental rights, such as the right to&#13;
liberty,for punitive purposes must be&#13;
proportional to the acts punished.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[24]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Although the US considers immigration detention to be administrative rather&#13;
than punitive, its effects—confinement, separation from family, loss of&#13;
livelihood, among others—may serve in fact to punish harshly those&#13;
detained, particularly those held for extended periods of time.Further, alternative methods for ensuring that&#13;
individuals appear for their immigration hearings and comply with the final&#13;
rulings in their cases have proven successful, with supervised release programs&#13;
reporting upwards of 90 percent of participants appearing for their hearings.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" id="_ftnref25"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[25]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Supervised release programs also offer an alternative to the&#13;
ballooning costs of detention. In 2008 ICE spent an average $119.28 per day for&#13;
each person it holds in a service processing center and can pay upwards of $100&#13;
per day to the state and county jails to which it entrusts the care of individuals&#13;
in its custody.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" id="_ftnref26"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[26]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In contrast, a study funded by the government from 1997 to 2000 showed that a&#13;
supervised release program can be both effective and cost efficient, costing an&#13;
estimated $12 per person per day as compared with $61, then the average daily&#13;
cost of detention per person.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" id="_ftnref27"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[27]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Medical Care in Detention</span></h2>
<p>Chief responsibility for the medical care provided to&#13;
individuals in ICE custody resides with the Division of Immigration Health&#13;
Services (DIHS). Formerly a component of the Public Health Service within the&#13;
Department of Health and Human Services, DIHS was detailed indefinitely to ICE&#13;
in October 2007.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" id="_ftnref28"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[28]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
DIHS retains a commissioned corps of health professionals, including&#13;
physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, psychiatrists, and clinical social&#13;
workers. The division is headquartered in Washington, DC, where the national&#13;
office sets policy for the detention medical care system. However, of the more&#13;
than 500 facilities, DIHS personnel provide the on-site medical services at&#13;
only 21, eight of which are service processing centers run by ICE.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" id="_ftnref29"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[29]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Investigations conducted in 2007 revealed that staffing at even these 15&#13;
facilities poses a challenge, with a 36 percent vacancy rate for medical staff&#13;
at DIHS facilities nationwide.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" id="_ftnref30"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[30]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
At other facilities, medical care is contracted out along with other detention&#13;
functions, and may actually be further subcontracted if the facility operator&#13;
has enlisted the services of a private healthcare company.</p>
<p>DIHS nonetheless regulates the medical care available at all&#13;
facilities through an ICE detention standard on medical care (ICE medical&#13;
standard) and the DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package&#13;
(Covered Services Package). Under this regime, individuals detained by ICE&#13;
should have access to the same level of care regardless of where they are held.&#13;
In state and county jails, for example, the individuals held on behalf of ICE&#13;
should have access to services necessary for meeting the ICE medical standard,&#13;
regardless of the services available to the criminal population at the jail.&#13;
Since the services available within individual facilities may vary, ensuring&#13;
uniform access to services requires providing coverage for services in the&#13;
community (i.e., outside the jail or other detention facility) where necessary.&#13;
The Covered Services Package, like an insurance company’s statement of&#13;
covered benefits, governs which services may be provided to individuals in&#13;
custody at the expense of ICE that are beyond “the contracted minimum&#13;
scope of services provided by a detention facility.”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" id="_ftnref31"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[31]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Pursuant to this arrangement, DIHS must pre-approve any medical care provided&#13;
outside of the facility, except for emergency services. Where the on-site&#13;
clinic is small, this may encompass almost all medical services. In order to&#13;
obtain this pre-approval, the facility’s medical providers must submit a&#13;
Treatment Authorization Request (TAR) to DIHS headquarters.</p>
<p>The TAR process is currently a major weakness in the system&#13;
that can result in major delays or denials of necessary health care. Both governmental&#13;
and nongovernmental bodies have criticized DIHS for tracking cost savings from&#13;
TAR denials and employing only three or four nurses to evaluate TAR submissions&#13;
from around the country.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" id="_ftnref32"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[32]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In a 2007 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) documented several&#13;
cases in which facilities encountered difficulties obtaining approval for&#13;
off-site treatment through this process.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" id="_ftnref33"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[33]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
A recent Congressional Research Service report found that “between FY2005&#13;
and FY2007, expenditures on medical claims [services rendered by an off-site&#13;
healthcare provider] remained almost constant. During the same time, the funded&#13;
amount of bed space increased by 49%.”<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" id="_ftnref34"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[34]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Healthcare Standards</span></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, health care provided to individuals in&#13;
ICE custody must meet a national standard for medical care set by ICE. The ICE&#13;
medical standard is one of a <span>numberof</span><span class="MsoCommentReference"><span><a href="#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1" id="_msoanchor_1">[laura1]</a> </span></span> standards developed by ICE&#13;
to govern the operation of the detention system (ICE detention standards).<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" id="_ftnref35"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[35]</span></span></span></span></a> In&#13;
2008 ICE revised the ICE medical standard as part of a process to update the&#13;
ICE detention standards and convert them into a “performance-based”&#13;
format. The new ICE medical standard was issued on September 12, 2008, with&#13;
limited revisions made on December 2, 2008, but will not be binding on facilities&#13;
until January 2010. Until then, the old ICE medical standard remains binding.&#13;
This report refers to the revised standard as “the new ICE medical&#13;
standard” and the old standard as “the currently binding ICE&#13;
medical standard.”<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" id="_ftnref36"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[36]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Facility health clinics receive differing messages about the&#13;
scope of care they should provide or arrange for individuals in ICE custody.&#13;
The new ICE medical standard provides that “detainees will have access to&#13;
a continuum of health care services, including prevention, health education,&#13;
diagnosis and treatment.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" id="_ftnref37"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[37]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This builds on the currently binding ICE medical standard, which states that&#13;
individuals in custody will have access to medical services that promote health&#13;
and general well-being.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" id="_ftnref38"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[38]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In marked contrast, however, the Covered Services Package, which regulates the&#13;
care that ICE will pay for outside the facility, emphasizes only emergency care&#13;
and treatment to prevent the deterioration of a health condition during the&#13;
period of custody.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" id="_ftnref39"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[39]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Given the restricted scope of services available on-site at some facilities,&#13;
the limitation on off-site care has meant that some individuals have not had&#13;
access to the continuum of services referenced in the new ICE medical standard.</p>
<p>The focus on emergency care is premised on the assumption&#13;
that an individual’s stay in detention will be brief, despite the fact&#13;
that individuals may and do spend months or even years in detention. A recent Congressional&#13;
Research Service report noted that, according to ICE statistics for fiscal year&#13;
2006, ICE held 7,000 people for over 6 months during that year.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" id="_ftnref40"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[40]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Asylum seekers, in particular, may spend an extended period of time in custody,<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" id="_ftnref41"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[41]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
and may also be a group with particular medical needs exacerbated by detention.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" id="_ftnref42"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[42]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Access to comprehensive health services is essential for all individuals in&#13;
custody, and particularly relevant for those detained over a long period.</p>
<p>ICE has no detention standard specific to women or their&#13;
health needs, and women’s health barely receives a mention in the currently&#13;
binding ICE medical standard, a mere instruction that officers in charge be&#13;
notified if any woman in custody is pregnant. The new ICE medical standard&#13;
shows improvements in its requirement of care for prenatal and postnatal women,&#13;
and its indication that “[d]etainees shall have access to age and&#13;
gender-appropriate examinations,”<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" id="_ftnref43"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[43]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
but without further detail these provisions provide limited assurance that&#13;
women can expect the care they need. As detailed below, the Covered Services&#13;
Package likewise reflects a narrow view of women’s health care,&#13;
restricting access to essential cancer screenings and basic components of care&#13;
such as hormonal contraception.</p>
<h2><span>Monitoring and Enforcement of&#13;
the Standards</span></h2>
<p>ICE has internal enforcement mechanisms for its detention&#13;
standards, but since the standards do not constitute formal federal&#13;
administrative regulations, they are not legally enforceable. Although the&#13;
standards require ICE officials to visit the facilities on a regular basis, ICE&#13;
evaluates most detention facilities’ compliance with the detention standards&#13;
with only a single official inspection each year. If the inspection shows the&#13;
facility is deficient in implementation of one of the standards, the facility&#13;
must devise a plan of action to remedy the deficiency. Should the facility fail&#13;
or refuse to fix the problem, ICE may impose penalties as outlined in its&#13;
contract with the facility or discontinue using the facility.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" id="_ftnref44"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[44]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>ICE has undertaken new measures to improve accountability&#13;
through the use of private inspectors, hiring the Nakamoto Group in 2007 to&#13;
provide on-site quality control inspectors at the 40 facilities holding the&#13;
highest number of individuals in ICE custody. Also in 2007, ICE hired the&#13;
Creative Corrections Corporation to conduct the annual facility inspections.&#13;
These private companies report their findings directly to ICE, the agency&#13;
financing their work. ICE also created a new subsection within its Office of&#13;
Professional Responsibility, called the Detention Facilities Inspection Group,&#13;
to oversee the annual inspections process.</p>
<p>The quality of ICE inspections is disputed. In 2008, ICE&#13;
released its first semiannual report on detention standards compliance, which&#13;
indicates that 98 percent of the 176 facilities evaluated received a rating of&#13;
acceptable or above for compliance with the medical care standard.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" id="_ftnref45"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[45]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, an audit conducted by the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG)&#13;
noted discrepancies between reviews of the same facility conducted by ICE and&#13;
by the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) of the Department of&#13;
Justice. Where ICE had rated the facility “acceptable,” an OFDT&#13;
review within six weeks deemed the facility “at risk,” which is the&#13;
lowest possible rating, two levels below “acceptable.”<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" id="_ftnref46"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[46]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Further, the OIG audit found “staff conducting routine oversight of&#13;
facilities has not been effective in identifying certain serious problems at&#13;
facilities.”<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" id="_ftnref47"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[47]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Since March 2003 at least 85 individuals have died in or&#13;
shortly after leaving ICE custody.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" id="_ftnref48"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[48]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
ICE contentions that the death rate for individuals in its custody has declined&#13;
and compares favorably to that of the US prison population have been assailed&#13;
by critics for failing to adjust for the comparatively short, and shrinking,&#13;
period of time that the average person spends in immigration detention.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" id="_ftnref49"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[49]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is responsible for&#13;
investigating deaths of individuals in ICE custody. The DHS Office of the&#13;
Inspector General (OIG) has recommended to ICE that it send the OIG reports of&#13;
all deaths in order to determine the appropriate review process.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" id="_ftnref50"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[50]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This recommendation resulted from the audit mentioned above.</p>
<p>ICE has severely limited its commitments with respect to&#13;
meeting standards set by professional accreditation bodies. Under the new and&#13;
currently binding ICE medical standards, state and county jails contracted by&#13;
ICE are not required to maintain any professional medical accreditation.&#13;
Service processing centers and contract detention facilities must currently be&#13;
accredited with the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC); however&#13;
the new ICE medical standard does not include that requirement.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" id="_ftnref51"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[51]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The NCCHC is a body with representatives from the Academy of Correctional&#13;
Health Professionals, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Bar&#13;
Association, and other professional organizations from the fields of&#13;
corrections, health care, and law. Maintaining NCCHC accreditation requires an&#13;
on-site survey of the facility by NCCHC staff health professionals every three&#13;
years, including a review of medical policies and procedures, as well as&#13;
interviews with health staff, security personnel, and individuals detained at&#13;
the facility. The currently binding ICE medical care standard also states that&#13;
facilities will “strive” for accreditation with the Joint&#13;
Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO); however,&#13;
the new ICE medical standard lacks this provision.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" id="_ftnref52"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[52]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>A Mounting Critique of Immigration&#13;
Detention Health Care</span></h2>
<p>Stories of women suffering because of delayed or denied&#13;
health care have emerged amidst a mounting critique of the ICE detention&#13;
medical system as a whole. Congressional hearings, international inquiries,&#13;
lawsuits, nongovernmental organization reports, and media coverage have&#13;
unearthed instances of facilities ignoring sick call requests, not delivering&#13;
medication, losing medical records, failing to provide translation services,&#13;
impeding access to specialist care, and outright denying needed treatment.</p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on&#13;
Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law held&#13;
multiple oversight hearings on ICE’s detention and removal operations in&#13;
2007 and 2008, including two addressing problems in the medical care system. At&#13;
those hearings, members of Congress heard testimony about instances of delayed&#13;
and denied care and their consequences from individuals formerly in ICE&#13;
custody, immigration attorneys, and medical experts. Several bills were&#13;
introduced in the 110th Congress that, if adopted, would&#13;
specifically address certain aspects of medical care for individuals detained&#13;
by ICE.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" id="_ftnref53"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[53]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Within the Department of Homeland Security itself, the&#13;
Office of Inspector General has conducted two audits in the last two years that&#13;
highlighted deficiencies in medical care. The first, published in December&#13;
2006, found instances of non-compliance with health care standards at four out&#13;
of five facilities surveyed. The one facility in full compliance, Krome Service&#13;
Processing Center in Miami, does not hold women.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" id="_ftnref54"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[54]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
More recently, in June 2008, the OIG investigated the handling of deaths in ICE&#13;
custody and again found various instances of non-compliance with the medical&#13;
standard, while noting compliance with “important portions” of the&#13;
standard on deaths in the two individual cases reviewed.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" id="_ftnref55"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[55]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In addition, a 2007 study by the US Government Accountability Office noted&#13;
weaknesses in ICE’s internal monitoring processes.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" id="_ftnref56"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[56]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>US immigration detention practices have drawn the attention&#13;
of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and United Nations (UN) human&#13;
rights experts. In October 2007, the Inter-American Commission held a hearing&#13;
on detention conditions and, in October 2008, began a fact-finding mission to&#13;
investigate the treatment of immigrants in detention centers.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" id="_ftnref57"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[57]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The UN Human Rights Committee encouraged the US “to adopt all measures&#13;
necessary for [the detention standards’] effective enforcement” in&#13;
its 2006 concluding observations to the US report on its compliance with the&#13;
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" id="_ftnref58"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[58]</span></span></span></span></a> Further,&#13;
the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants recommended that the&#13;
US develop gender-specific detention standards with attention to the medical&#13;
and mental health needs of women survivors of violence and refrain from&#13;
detaining women who are suffering the effects of persecution or abuse, or who&#13;
are pregnant or nursing infants. In addition, the rapporteur recommended that&#13;
mandatory detention be eliminated and that the government issue legally binding&#13;
standards governing the treatment of individuals in all types of immigration&#13;
detention facilities, finding the current non-binding standards insufficient.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" id="_ftnref59"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[59]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>In a series of legal challenges, immigrants’ rights&#13;
advocates have called for accountability for the shortcomings of the detention&#13;
medical care system. In June 2007, the ACLU filed suit challenging the&#13;
constitutionality of delays and other serious shortcomings in critical health&#13;
services provided at a San Diego contract detention facility.<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" id="_ftnref60"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[60]</span></span></span></span></a> The&#13;
suit’s plaintiffs included three women, two of whom experienced problems&#13;
in requesting care for gynecological or breast health issues. Addressing the&#13;
lack of enforceable standards, Families for Freedom sued in federal court in&#13;
April 2008 to press its petition for rule-making which requested that the&#13;
Department of Homeland Security issue formal administrative regulations&#13;
governing the conditions for individuals in ICE custody.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" id="_ftnref61"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[61]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Both lawsuits are currently pending. April 2008 also saw the US government&#13;
admit liability for medical negligence in the death of Francisco Castaneda, who&#13;
died of cancer following months of being denied a biopsy in ICE custody.<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" id="_ftnref62"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[62]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Reporting by nongovernmental organizations and the media has&#13;
brought forward more facts, adding to the picture of a medical system in&#13;
trouble. Human Rights Watch issued a report in December 2007 documenting the&#13;
failure of immigration authorities to care for the health needs of detained&#13;
individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Human Rights Watch found that ICE fails to&#13;
consistently deliver medication, conduct lab tests on time, prevent infections,&#13;
provide access to specialty care, and ensure the confidentiality of medical&#13;
care.<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" id="_ftnref63"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[63]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In addition, public outrage followed a May 2008 investigative report on&#13;
immigration detention medical care by the <i>Washington Post</i>, which described&#13;
a dysfunctional system plagued by staffing shortages, bureaucratic hurdles to&#13;
providing care, and dangerous cost-cutting measures.<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" id="_ftnref64"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[64]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>By the beginning of 2008, reports from advocates working in&#13;
immigration detention were pointing to serious problems in the care provided to&#13;
women. Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy&#13;
Center, testified before Congress in October 2007 that women often do not&#13;
receive regular obstetrical and gynecological care and cited incidents&#13;
including an ignored ectopic pregnancy, a uterine surgery inexplicably canceled&#13;
at the last minute, a miscarriage following pleas for help, and an effort by&#13;
detention personnel to prevent an asylum seeker who had survived rape from&#13;
obtaining an abortion.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" id="_ftnref65"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[65]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In a briefing paper compiled for the visit of the UN special rapporteur on the&#13;
human rights of migrants, the National Immigrant Justice Center drew on&#13;
advocates’ knowledge of such incidents and outlined several areas of&#13;
major concern for women in ICE custody: medical and mental health conditions&#13;
for victims of violence; medical conditions for pregnant and postnatal women;&#13;
sexual assault; family separation; and access to counsel.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" id="_ftnref66"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[66]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>As research for this report was underway, the treatment of&#13;
pregnant women in ICE custody came under particular scrutiny. In early July&#13;
2008, The <i>Tahoma Organizer</i> published a letter alleging mistreatment of&#13;
pregnant women at the Northwest Detention Center including malnutrition,&#13;
inadequate bedding, insufficient medical care, shackling during transportation&#13;
for medical care, and lack of privacy during off-site medical examinations.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" id="_ftnref67"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[67]</span></span></span></span></a> A&#13;
recent study by the University of Arizona’s Southwest Institute for&#13;
Research on Women noted medical care for pregnant women among numerous problem&#13;
areas documented at facilities in Arizona.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" id="_ftnref68"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[68]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>With a growing body of documentation pointing to dangerous&#13;
flaws in the immigration detention medical care system, calls for reform of the&#13;
system have multiplied in number and strength. Immigration detention medical&#13;
care is now a live policy debate. As efforts around reform gather momentum,&#13;
women’s medical needs must be addressed. This report identifies existing&#13;
gaps in policy and practice and outlines an agenda for the way forward.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h1><span>IV. Findings: Overarching&#13;
Problems in the Medical System Affecting Women’s Care</span></h1>
<p>In our interviews with currently or recently detained women,&#13;
Human Rights Watch found that some issues arose repeatedly as impediments to&#13;
proper care: delays in getting requested medical attention, compromised&#13;
doctor-patient relationships, unnecessary use of restraints and strip searches,&#13;
interruptions in care, unwarranted denials of testing and treatment, and&#13;
ineffective complaint mechanisms. The following section outlines the&#13;
difficulties women faced at each stage of their attempts to obtain appropriate&#13;
care.</p>
<h2><span>Delays &amp; Denials of&#13;
Testing and Treatment</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<i>I was starting to go blind. I had complained for 15 days&#13;
about the blindness. I sent many sick calls. In June 2007 the officers called&#13;
medical. I could only see shades of people. I couldn’t see numbers or&#13;
letters. An officer asked me, “How come you are always sleeping?&#13;
You’re not like that.” They called to inform the doctors (the&#13;
doctors tell them whether to send us). The officer called and said I was&#13;
diabetic and needed to be seen. Then the nurse saw me. I told her, “I&#13;
can’t see. I’m blind. It has been 15 days.” They checked my&#13;
sugars. They were 549. The nurse asked, “Why didn’t you tell&#13;
us?” I was about to go into a diabetic coma or have a heart attack because&#13;
my blood sugar was so high</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>—Mary T., Texas, April 2008</blockquote>
<p>Half of the women Human Rights Watch interviewed said they&#13;
had experienced delays in receiving requested medical care and nearly as many&#13;
were forced to make repeated appeals to obtain an appropriate response to their&#13;
medical concerns. Official statements regarding the average response time for&#13;
sick call requests at individual facilities bore little resemblance to the&#13;
extended wait times women who spoke with us reported.<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" id="_ftnref69"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[69]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The length of the delays ranged from a few days to dispense ibuprofen for a&#13;
headache to five-and-a-half months to follow up on an abnormal Pap smear. Some&#13;
requests remained unfilled at the time of the woman’s release, including&#13;
requests for prenatal care that never arrived in a woman’s month-and-a-half&#13;
stay in detention. Giselle M., who could not remember the number of times she&#13;
requested a sonogram to monitor a cyst that threatened her pregnancy, said the&#13;
delay could not be justified: “I know everything is a process but to me&#13;
there are some things they should be on top of.”<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" id="_ftnref70"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[70]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Delays occurred at various points from the initial request&#13;
to the scheduling of specialist visits to the arrival of medication, and affected&#13;
treatment for problems of varying severity and complexity. Likewise, the delays&#13;
resulted in a range of consequences, some of which were not manifest until&#13;
after the period of detention. In several cases, the delays deterred use of the&#13;
medical system by people who needed it. After waiting 10 days for an&#13;
appointment to address burning urination and 15 days to see someone about a&#13;
growing rash on her face, Meron A. gave up on the sick call procedure: “If&#13;
I have a problem today, I need help today.... That makes me mad, I don’t&#13;
like to write, I’m not going to say anything.”<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" id="_ftnref71"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[71]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Similarly, Raquel B. stopped trying to get the facility to dispense the&#13;
anti-anxiety medication she took outside of detention, even though taking the&#13;
substitute the facility provided caused her to tremble and prevented her from&#13;
sleeping. “I’m already tired of asking [to change the medication].&#13;
Many times I’ve requested sick call.”<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" id="_ftnref72"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[72]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>While less common than delays, outright denials of requested&#13;
care arose in circumstances of varying gravity, including in the case of a&#13;
woman with an incapacitating spinal injury that ICE diagnosed as requiring&#13;
surgery that it refused to provide.<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" id="_ftnref73"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[73]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
None of the health service providers we spoke with reported difficulty working&#13;
within the DIHS managed care system, which requires prior authorization for off-site,&#13;
non-emergency treatment. However, at least two women were told explicitly by&#13;
on-site providers that they believed they should receive a certain course of&#13;
treatment but were prevented from providing it by authorization denials from&#13;
the managed care unit at headquarters. “[The physician’s assistant]&#13;
said, ‘We can’t do anything for you. Requests for care are denied&#13;
by Washington.’ If it was up to him, ‘we would have approved it&#13;
right away.’ They especially don’t want to provide care if you are&#13;
awaiting deportation. They probably put my file aside. I can read between the&#13;
lines.”<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" id="_ftnref74"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[74]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Many more women complained about receiving inappropriate or&#13;
inadequate care for their health concerns. These cases included a woman with&#13;
gallstones whose symptoms nurses diagnosed and treated as related to depression&#13;
until she collapsed,<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" id="_ftnref75"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[75]</span></span></span></span></a>as well as numerous women who were instructed&#13;
to drink water for an assortment of maladies, such as intense menstrual cramps.&#13;
“We call it the magic water,” said Elisa G.<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" id="_ftnref76"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[76]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Obstacles to Obtaining&#13;
Medical Care</span></h2>
<p>In order to bring their health concerns to the attention of&#13;
an appropriate medical provider, women described having to overcome numerous&#13;
obstacles, including lack of awareness of available services and the sometimes&#13;
obstructive role of security personnel and frontline medical staff.</p>
<h3><span>Information</span></h3>
<p>The ability to access information on health services is an&#13;
obvious prerequisite to obtaining the services themselves, but proves to be far&#13;
from a simple matter in the detention context. National Commission on&#13;
Correctional Health Care standards stipulate that information on the&#13;
availability of health services should be provided orally and in writing to&#13;
detained individuals on their arrival at a facility, with care taken to ensure&#13;
it is communicated in a form and language they understand.<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" id="_ftnref77"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[77]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The new ICE medical standard and the standard on the admission and release of&#13;
individuals from detention describe an orientation process where the facility&#13;
should inform individuals about the available services, including medical care.<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" id="_ftnref78"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[78]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
As part of the orientation, a “detainee handbook” outlining&#13;
facility procedures should be provided to each individual who enters custody<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" id="_ftnref79"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[79]</span></span></span></span></a>.&#13;
In addition, the Division of Immigration Health Services (DIHS) standard intake&#13;
form contains a check box for the intake examiner to indicate that the patient&#13;
has been informed how to request medical care. The women who spoke with Human&#13;
Rights Watch were by and large familiar with the general procedures for&#13;
requesting care, although a few had received the information from other&#13;
detained women and did not recall any official guidelines on how to seek care.</p>
<p>More commonly the information gap pertained to the nature&#13;
and scope of the services available. Giselle M. spent several weeks in&#13;
discomfort when she was detained during her pregnancy before one of the other&#13;
women in her unit told her that she should have received an extra mattress pad&#13;
for her bed, according to the facility’s standard practice. “You&#13;
don’t know your rights,” she told Human Rights Watch.<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" id="_ftnref80"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[80]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This problem arose even more frequently in relation to services that were not&#13;
routinely provided. In discussing various health concerns, including abortion,&#13;
lactation, hormonal contraception, and services for survivors of recent sexual&#13;
assault, health providers frequently stated that an issue had not come up at&#13;
their facility, or that a procedure was not standard but could be made&#13;
available if requested. Women we spoke with who had been released from&#13;
detention, on the other hand, frequently said that they would have wanted the&#13;
services had they known they could be obtained in detention.</p>
<p>At Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, for example, Health&#13;
Services Administrator Lieutenant Commander Melissa George indicated that&#13;
Tylenol and massage would normally be recommended to nursing mothers but that a&#13;
breast pump also could be made available.<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" id="_ftnref81"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[81]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, Ashley J., who was detained at Eloy while nursing, told Human Rights&#13;
Watch that she was not told she could have access to a breast pump and so&#13;
assumed it was not available. Unable to express her breast milk manually,&#13;
Ashley experienced great pain when the ducts in her breast clogged. Speaking&#13;
about the pump and other services, Ashley J. explained, “Sometimes we&#13;
don’t ask. We don’t even know these things exist. You believe in&#13;
part—you almost feel like you are a criminal and the crime is to be&#13;
illegal.”<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" id="_ftnref82"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[82]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>This combination of ignorance of available services and&#13;
inhibition inspired by detention dynamics points to why the legal onus is on&#13;
the detention authorities to raise awareness and offer services to the&#13;
individuals in their custody. Certainly, some individuals will come into&#13;
detention with a ready knowledge of the services they are entitled to and will&#13;
not shy away from asking for them, but others—especially those who have&#13;
never experienced detention before and who may be traumatized or face linguistic&#13;
or cultural barriers—may not be equipped to do so. Further, relying on&#13;
the detention grapevine to inform women does not represent a satisfactory&#13;
substitute for proactive education by facility staff and, in fact, may undermine&#13;
efforts to provide care.</p>
<p>A key component to making individuals aware of services they&#13;
need is identifying their medical concerns. DIHS officials told Human Rights&#13;
Watch that their ability to respond to health concerns depends in large part on&#13;
what information is conveyed during an individual’s initial medical&#13;
screening and follow up appraisal. However, the new and currently binding ICE&#13;
medical standards state that non-medical detention staff can conduct the&#13;
initial medical and mental health screening.<a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" id="_ftnref83"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[83]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Even though staff members receive training to perform this function, they will&#13;
not be as well-equipped as certified medical professionals to identify and&#13;
respond to pressing health concerns.</p>
<h3><span>Gatekeepers</span></h3>
<p>Limitations on their movement and a series of intermediaries&#13;
between themselves and the appropriate health professionals may also impair&#13;
women’s access to care. In most facilities women do not have the freedom&#13;
of movement to present themselves at the facility medical unit when they feel&#13;
the need. Rather, health services are accessed in two ways, through submission&#13;
of a “sick call” slip or “kite” or by bringing the&#13;
situation to the attention of the security personnel in the housing unit.<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" id="_ftnref84"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[84]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The health services personnel triage the sick call requests and nurses conduct&#13;
initial patient evaluations, provide appropriate treatment within their range&#13;
of expertise, and refer patients to a physician’s assistant or doctor&#13;
when they deem it necessary. Although one health services administrator&#13;
indicated that referral to a doctor becomes automatic after a patient has been&#13;
seen a certain number of times,<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" id="_ftnref85"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[85]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
some women told Human Rights Watch that they had difficulty reaching a doctor.<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" id="_ftnref86"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[86]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>In between sick calls, security personnel assume the&#13;
frontline in receiving the health concerns of the women in their custody. This&#13;
can prove problematic for two reasons. First, staff without advanced medical&#13;
training are put in the position of evaluating a patient’s need for care,&#13;
including in the event of an emergency. American Public Health Association&#13;
standards require that “prisoners who complain of or display acute or&#13;
emergency health problems must be referred to medical staff immediately.”<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" id="_ftnref87"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[87]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
One health services administrator insisted that officers have an obligation to&#13;
call if they are notified of an emergency because they are not qualified to&#13;
make medical decisions.<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" id="_ftnref88"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[88]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This approach is reflected in the new and currently binding medical&#13;
standards’ instruction that employees who are unsure whether emergency&#13;
care is required should immediately notify medical personnel who can make the&#13;
determination.<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" id="_ftnref89"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[89]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, Rhonda U. told Human Rights Watch of her difficulties in appealing to&#13;
security personnel for access to care in urgent circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>Only one officer will advocate for women for medical;&#13;
others will tell you to put in a request. When I say, “I’m sick,&#13;
please let someone with medical knowledge check on me,” the officer, Mrs.&#13;
[Name], says “Out there you wouldn’t get any better.” But I&#13;
say, “You have alternatives. Our back is against the wall. [In here] you&#13;
can’t do for yourself. Don’t make me feel this small. Like I just&#13;
want to get into a medical facility. Please help me because I can’t help&#13;
myself. That’s all I ask.”<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" id="_ftnref90"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[90]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, determining the existence of an emergency may entail&#13;
a medical judgment in itself and according to one woman at an Arizona facility,&#13;
“there is no such thing as an emergency for them unless you are&#13;
bleeding.”<a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" id="_ftnref91"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[91]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Secondly, testimony provided to Human Rights Watch suggests&#13;
that the relationship of security personnel to the individuals in their custody&#13;
may seriously undermine access to health care. In the most benign instances,&#13;
some women said that they did not feel comfortable sharing private health&#13;
information with the individuals with whom they interacted day in and day out.&#13;
In other cases women alleged mistreatment by security staff in the course of requesting&#13;
medical care or being transported for treatment. This included guards placing a&#13;
woman on lockdown in response to repeated sick call requests during a&#13;
protracted struggle between her lawyers and ICE over her medical care, and, in&#13;
another case described below, guards saying that they could do whatever they&#13;
wanted to a woman who they knew to have been on suicide watch because no one&#13;
would believe her.<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92" id="_ftnref92"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[92]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Itzya N. described the way the guards’ knowledge of&#13;
her mental health issues allowed them to frighten her to the point that she&#13;
wanted to leave the facility to which she had been transported for better&#13;
medical care:</p>
<blockquote>The guards know about medical problems.... Nothing is a&#13;
secret around here. In the past, I used to get very depressed and I thought&#13;
about it and here you are laughing at me and I’m just trying to go&#13;
forward. They [the guards] talk poorly about the women who are here. Instead of&#13;
taking care of you they pretty much screw you over verbally. I don’t want&#13;
to generalize but it happens with more than one. I do remember [one time] and&#13;
it was at [the service processing center]. It was a woman and four men. They&#13;
referred to me as the one who tried to kill herself. They said they could do&#13;
anything they wanted to me because no one was going to believe me because I had&#13;
done something stupid. I don’t want to remember the exact words they&#13;
said. All I know is that night I told the doctor I didn’t want to be&#13;
there for one more minute. All I remember is that that night I couldn’t&#13;
sleep fearing what would happen to me. If I close my eyes I can see their&#13;
faces. The first time it happened I lowered my head. But now every time I see&#13;
them I raise my head because I see them and I know what they did.<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" id="_ftnref93"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[93]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<h2><span>Distortions in the Doctor-Patient&#13;
Relationship</span></h2>
<p>The immigration detention healthcare system’s focus on&#13;
crisis management compromised the doctor-patient relationship in multiple ways&#13;
for women who spoke with Human Rights Watch. While some women spoke favorably&#13;
of the medical staff, a number felt that the staff did not take their&#13;
complaints seriously or lacked a genuine interest in helping them. Further, language&#13;
interpretation deficiencies prevented some women from participating fully in&#13;
their care, and we received four reports of health service providers insisting&#13;
on medication against the express wishes of the patient.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h3><span>Providers’ Narrow&#13;
Approach to Care</span></h3>
<p>While variation in the aptitude and zeal of individual&#13;
providers may be hard to avoid, the government bears responsibility for the&#13;
extent to which the detention system’s emphasis on stop-gap,&#13;
deportation-oriented care at the policy level has influenced the outlook of its&#13;
caregivers. The first rule of the Principles of Medical Ethics Relevant to the&#13;
Protection of Prisoners Against Torture, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982,&#13;
holds that “<span>Health personnel, particularly physicians,&#13;
charged with the medical care of prisoners and detainees have a duty to provide&#13;
them with protection of their physical and mental health and treatment of&#13;
disease of the same quality and standard as is afforded to those who are not&#13;
imprisoned or detained.”</span><a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" id="_ftnref94"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[94]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>However, some </span>statements by health&#13;
services personnel to Human Rights Watch reflected the Covered Service&#13;
Package’s more narrow view of care. One service provider articulated the&#13;
medical unit’s mission as “to maintain health and keep [the&#13;
detained individuals] in a deportable state.”<a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95" id="_ftnref95"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[95]</span></span></span></span></a> This&#13;
view is consistent not only with the declared intent of the Covered Services&#13;
Package, but the package’s requirement that certain basic services, such&#13;
as Pap smears and annual dental examinations, only be provided to individuals&#13;
“with no indication of imminent removal.”<a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" id="_ftnref96"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[96]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Another health service provider noted that “most people are here&#13;
voluntarily because they are fighting their deportation case” when explaining&#13;
the limitations in available services.<a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" id="_ftnref97"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[97]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This assertion is only true in the barest technical sense since individuals&#13;
face a choice of enduring detention or giving up their claims for legal status&#13;
in the US, which would likely come at great personal cost and possibly great&#13;
personal peril for individuals fleeing persecution.</p>
<p>Women had high praise for certain medical providers and&#13;
strong criticism for others. Mercedes O. told Human Rights Watch how moved she&#13;
had been when a provider took a personal interest in her situation: “That&#13;
doctor was a good person and helped: I’m a Christian and she prayed with&#13;
me and said she was going to do everything to help me get out of [the detention&#13;
center].”<a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98" id="_ftnref98"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[98]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
But others felt that the providers were indifferent to their concerns, did not&#13;
take them seriously, or viewed their requests as bothersome.<a href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99" id="_ftnref99"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[99]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
One health services administrator who spoke with Human Rights Watch gave little&#13;
cause to doubt these reports. Speaking about the prevalence of anxiety among&#13;
the women in custody, she said, “You know us girls, we just want to go&#13;
home, we want to look pretty,” and later commented, “I don’t&#13;
spend a whole lot of time down there with [the women in custody] because they&#13;
are difficult.”<a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" id="_ftnref100"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[100]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Some women recounted confronting a lack of compassion at a&#13;
moment of intense vulnerability. Alicia Y. had to be hospitalized for kidney&#13;
stones and an acute pancreatic infection that caused her to faint. At the&#13;
hospital, she remembered a nurse bruising her with a needle, leaving her to&#13;
bleed and letting the blood remain soaking through her sheets overnight. She&#13;
overheard a nurse who thought she did not understand English comment to a&#13;
colleague that, “She doesn’t have any options. She’s just a&#13;
detainee.”<a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101" id="_ftnref101"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[101]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Beatriz R., whose physical and mental health had markedly deteriorated over the&#13;
period of her detention, recalled, “I was talking to the nurse about how&#13;
I feel and she interrupted, ‘You can’t be talking about your&#13;
problems, you’re just here for a check-up.’”<a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" id="_ftnref102"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[102]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Looking up from her hands in her lap as she recounted this incident, Beatriz R.&#13;
appeared both hurt and puzzled. “They treat us like we don’t have a&#13;
life out there, like we don’t have a family, like we didn’t exist&#13;
in the world.”<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" id="_ftnref103"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[103]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3><span>Confidentiality &amp; Privacy</span></h3>
<p>Breaches of confidentiality in the handling of medical&#13;
information and intrusions into the privacy of the exam room concerned several&#13;
women who spoke with Human Rights Watch and led at least one woman to decline&#13;
to seek care. According to the currently binding ICE medical standard,&#13;
healthcare providers are expected to protect the confidentiality of medical&#13;
information to the degree possible “while permitting the exchange of&#13;
health information required to fulfill program responsibilities and to provide&#13;
for the well being of detainees.”<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" id="_ftnref104"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[104]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The new ICE medical standard states that privacy of medical information will be&#13;
protected in accordance with “established guidelines and applicable&#13;
laws.”<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" id="_ftnref105"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[105]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Three women reported that guards, some male and some female, commonly have&#13;
knowledge of the women’s health concerns, while two health services&#13;
administrators explained that although they did try to limit security&#13;
personnel’s exposure to individual medical information, the guards would&#13;
also be bound by medical privacy laws. Nonetheless, Maya Z. insisted, “They&#13;
talk about other patients. Everyone always knows why you went to the&#13;
doctor.”<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106" id="_ftnref106"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[106]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Women may find their confidential medical information exposed to other detained&#13;
women as well, including in the communication of pregnancy test results which&#13;
is not always done individually.</p>
<p>                                                                   </p>
<p>According to the new ICE medical standard, detention&#13;
facility medical units should have sufficient space to allow patients to be&#13;
seen in private while ensuring safety.<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107" id="_ftnref107"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[107]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, on visits to off-site providers, security measures vary between&#13;
facilities and by the security classification of the woman detained. In some&#13;
cases these measures can include having a guard stationed inside the exam room.&#13;
This practice, as implemented in cases described to Human Rights Watch, is&#13;
inconsistent with standards issued by the National Commission on Correctional&#13;
Health Care which maintain that all clinical visits should be conducted in&#13;
private “without being observed or overheard.”<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108" id="_ftnref108"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[108]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The NCCHC recognizes exceptions for the presence of security personnel only&#13;
where a patient poses a probable safety risk to a health care provider or&#13;
others. In the instances described to Human Rights Watch, the women whose care&#13;
was observed had no history of violent behavior.</p>
<p>One woman confessed that she had multiple issues she had not&#13;
raised after hearing that another woman received a Pap smear in the presence of&#13;
a guard. “The doctors outside treated me okay but it was uncomfortable&#13;
for me because the guard has to be in the room. If I have to show where I have&#13;
pain, the guard has to see it too. The CO [corrections officer] was there when&#13;
they did the Pap smear on [other woman in custody]. I haven’t told them&#13;
[that I am due for a Pap smear] because I don’t want to go through what&#13;
she went through... I have breast implants, I didn’t tell them. By the&#13;
end of last year I was supposed to get them checked. I haven’t told them&#13;
about the breast implants because I don’t want the officers to see me&#13;
naked.”<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" id="_ftnref109"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[109]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h3><span>Language &amp; Consent</span></h3>
<p>Under the American Public Health Association’s&#13;
standards, “It is the institution’s responsibility to maintain&#13;
communication with the prisoners; therefore, personnel must be available to&#13;
communicate with prisoners with language barriers.”<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110" id="_ftnref110"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[110]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Each facility Human Rights Watch visited insisted that language differences did&#13;
not impede access to care, generally because the staff spoke multiple languages&#13;
and interpretation for less commonly encountered languages could be obtained by&#13;
phone. However, inconsistencies in the use of interpretation services compromised&#13;
care for several women Human Rights Watch interviewed. Meron A. said that she&#13;
informed the facility health providers that her English “was not&#13;
good” only to have them dismiss her concern, saying they understood her,&#13;
neglecting to consider that she in fact did not understand them.<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111" id="_ftnref111"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[111]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Medical records for Nana B., whose interview with Human Rights Watch required&#13;
French interpretation, indicate that facility personnel repeatedly conducted&#13;
her medical visits in English, perhaps contributing to the fact that the date&#13;
of birth in her records was off by 18 years.<a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" id="_ftnref112"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[112]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Suana Michel Q., hospitalized during her time in ICE custody, reported being&#13;
asked to sign consent forms for treatment without the opportunity to consult&#13;
with a translator.<a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113" id="_ftnref113"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[113]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Informed consent arose as an issue on several different&#13;
occasions.<a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" id="_ftnref114"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[114]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The new and currently binding ICE medical standards state that “as a&#13;
rule, medical treatment shall not be administered against a detainee’s&#13;
will.”<a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115" id="_ftnref115"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[115]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, some women reported that they did not have the option to refuse&#13;
medication when the staff came through to distribute it at “pill&#13;
call.” Itzya N. recalled, “I started to stick the pills under my&#13;
tongue ... because I didn’t want to take the pills. But some nurses look&#13;
under your tongue.”<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" id="_ftnref116"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[116]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Serafina D. reported that the facility would not permit her to stop taking&#13;
anti-seizure medication, even after tests confirmed her ailments were not&#13;
seizure-related: “They just kept giving it to me.... They said since I&#13;
was under their rules, if didn’t want to take it, I still have to take it....&#13;
Medicine would make me tired and drowsy. My body was feeling heavy, my eyes&#13;
were heavy. I felt drugged up.”<a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" id="_ftnref117"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[117]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Detrimental and Unnecessary&#13;
Use of Restraints and Strip Searches</span></h2>
<p>ICE detention standards impose few definitive limits on the measures&#13;
available to security personnel to control the individuals in their custody,&#13;
with the result that women find their safety and their dignity subject to the&#13;
inclinations of those charged with their supervision. Women interviewed by&#13;
Human Rights Watch said this undermined their physical and psychological&#13;
health.</p>
<p>The failure to categorically prohibit the shackling of&#13;
pregnant women in ICE custody has drawn considerable criticism, as it is a&#13;
practice condemned by health professionals and international bodies.<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" id="_ftnref118"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[118]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Under ICE policy, security staff may use restraints on pregnant women with the&#13;
consultation of a medical provider.<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" id="_ftnref119"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[119]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Officials from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have&#13;
declared their disagreement with the practice of shackling pregnant women,&#13;
stating that “physical restraints have interfered with the ability of&#13;
physicians to safely practice medicine by reducing their ability to assess and&#13;
evaluate the physical condition of the mother and the fetus ... thus, overall&#13;
putting the lives of women and unborn children at risk.”<a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120" id="_ftnref120"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[120]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In July 2008 a coalition of over one hundred women’s rights and&#13;
immigrants’ rights groups wrote to ICE to request that the agency’s&#13;
policy be changed to prohibit the routine restraint of pregnant women during&#13;
medical appointments, transport to appointments, labor, delivery, and&#13;
post-delivery.<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" id="_ftnref121"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[121]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
ICE declined to make any revisions to the existing policy, stating in a&#13;
response that it “properly balances the safety of the public, detainees&#13;
and ICE personnel.”<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122" id="_ftnref122"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[122]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Women who were pregnant while in ICE custody told Human&#13;
Rights Watch that they were not shackled during medical examinations, but that&#13;
the use of restraints was typical during transportation between detention&#13;
facilities and to and from off-site medical providers.<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" id="_ftnref123"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[123]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Both the new and currently binding ICE detention standards on land&#13;
transportation indicate that as a rule women should not be restrained, but in&#13;
addressing the shackling of pregnant women ICE has stated that “[its]&#13;
policy is clear that any individual who has demonstrated violent behavior,&#13;
criminal activity, or a strong likelihood of escape shall be restrained during&#13;
transit.”<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" id="_ftnref124"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[124]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Giselle M., who was shackled while en route from one detention center to&#13;
another, questioned the necessity of putting her pregnancy at risk: “What&#13;
if I had fallen? How fast is a pregnant girl going to run?”<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" id="_ftnref125"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[125]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Recalling her experience with shackling, Katherine I. said, “When we went&#13;
to the clinic in [city name], we were in a van without a way to hold on. There&#13;
was a bench around and no way I could get myself so I couldn’t fall; I&#13;
was pregnant and she was driving too fast. And I told the security who took us&#13;
and they said they couldn’t do nothing about it.”<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" id="_ftnref126"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[126]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Women who were shackled in the course of requesting medical&#13;
care, whether pregnant or seeking care for other concerns, reported that the&#13;
restraints took a psychological toll and presented a disincentive to seek care.&#13;
Itzya N. said, “They only use shackles in transportation, but that is a&#13;
trauma that lasts for three days. It’s just that on top of being chained&#13;
you are being treated like an animal. It is more about the way they treat you,&#13;
how they yell at you, how it’s like being caged.”<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127" id="_ftnref127"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[127]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Human Rights Watch spoke with women detained at facilities&#13;
that also held criminal populations who were subjected to the facilities’&#13;
standard strip search procedures. The searches, which were imposed without&#13;
apparent cause, constituted debilitating affronts to their dignity. Nora S.&#13;
shook her head and closed her eyes as she recalled, “When the women from&#13;
California first arrived, we were asked to strip down naked and walk around in&#13;
circles in front of the women guards... I didn’t file a request for two&#13;
whole weeks. All I could do was cry. I was in shock.”<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" id="_ftnref128"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[128]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Jameela E. was required to strip at each of the four county jails she was&#13;
transferred between in Virginia. She described herself as devastated at the&#13;
immodesty of being unable to wear her hijab, to say nothing of the requirement&#13;
that she disrobe for inspection on multiple occasions.<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129" id="_ftnref129"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[129]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Discontinuity of Care</span></h2>
<p>Women and healthcare providers alike identified lack of continuity&#13;
of care as one of the greatest obstacles in the detention medical system.<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" id="_ftnref130"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[130]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Given the number of transfers between facilities and the short time that some individuals&#13;
spend in the detention system, disruptions in care are an expected part of the&#13;
detention system, as currently operated. Human Rights Watch interviews indicate&#13;
that DIHS is failing to take sufficient steps to address this reality.</p>
<h3><span>Records</span></h3>
<p>Having a complete medical history available and transferring&#13;
it with the patient can help considerably in bridging the gaps in care between&#13;
a facility in the community and one in the detention system, as well between&#13;
different facilities within the detention system. Yet exchanging comprehensive&#13;
records does not register as a priority in ICE policy. Although not required by&#13;
the ICE detention standards, some health service providers who spoke with Human&#13;
Rights Watch said that they would try to get a patient’s prior medical&#13;
records from a community provider where necessary and feasible.<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" id="_ftnref131"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[131]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
But several women reported that they had to resort to getting those records on&#13;
their own in order to substantiate their healthcare needs.<a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" id="_ftnref132"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[132]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Receiving no help from the facility to obtain her records, Lily F. tried&#13;
repeatedly to reach the doctor in California who had originally put in her&#13;
breast implants, which ruptured while she was in prison and remained deflated&#13;
in her chest when she reached ICE custody. But Lily F. found the doctor had&#13;
moved offices. She tried to follow up but had no money for phone calls and, not&#13;
being literate, could not write letters. To get more money for the calls she&#13;
worked in the detention center for the nominal wage (one or two dollars) the&#13;
facility provided: “I worked for five-and-a-half months but I had to quit&#13;
because I was not feeling good.”<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" id="_ftnref133"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[133]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Individuals transferred from one ICE detention facility to&#13;
another can encounter the same difficulties and experience disruptions in care,&#13;
even though they remain in the custody and care of the same authority. American&#13;
Public Health Association standards stipulate that a full medical record should&#13;
accompany an individual transferred within the same correctional system, and a&#13;
summary should only be used for transfers into another system.<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" id="_ftnref134"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[134]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Under ICE policy, a summary is used whenever ICE transfers someone to a&#13;
facility where DIHS does not directly provide care.<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" id="_ftnref135"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[135]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The new non-DIHS facility does not receive the full medical record as a matter&#13;
of course. This is problematic because, unlike transfers between correctional&#13;
systems, transfers between DIHS and non-DIHS facilities happen frequently&#13;
within the ICE system. ICE moved Antoinette L., who had a complicated medical&#13;
history, from one facility to another located just across the street and still&#13;
provided only an incomplete transfer sheet that did not include her list of&#13;
medications, an omission that could further compound difficulties that can&#13;
arise due to DIHS and non-DIHS facilities maintaining different formularies.<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" id="_ftnref136"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[136]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>For Jameela E., whom ICE shuttled between four county jails&#13;
in Virginia, the impact of the policy on transferring records was palpable.&#13;
“I had pain over half my body,” she said in describing what it was&#13;
like to contend with an ovarian cyst without her pre-detention painkillers.<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" id="_ftnref137"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[137]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
At the first detention center, the health authorities referred her to a&#13;
specialist at a local hospital where it was determined that the cyst required&#13;
surgery. Before the scheduled surgical appointment two weeks later, ICE&#13;
transferred her to another jail. Not having received any records from the first&#13;
facility, the health provider demanded, “Do you have any proof you have a&#13;
cyst?” Jameela E. had records from prior to detention with her&#13;
belongings: “I said I have it in my property but they won’t let me&#13;
have it.... Finally I got it.”<a href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138" id="_ftnref138"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[138]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
But the jail kept saying it had to wait for records from the first facility,&#13;
and before long ICE transferred Jameela E. again. She did not receive surgery&#13;
for her cyst during her time in ICE custody.</p>
<p>The new and currently binding ICE medical standards do not&#13;
provide for individuals to automatically receive their full medical record on&#13;
release, but they are entitled to request it from the detention center.<a href="#_ftn139" name="_ftnref139" id="_ftnref139"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[139]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Nonetheless, detained women and their lawyers report problems accessing medical&#13;
records, with requests going unanswered or yielding only partial files. Serafina&#13;
D. reported that the off-site specialists she saw refused to give her paper&#13;
records because they said the tests had been ordered by ICE.<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140" id="_ftnref140"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[140]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Despite provisions in federal law and the detention standards intended to&#13;
ensure individuals’ access to their records, lawyers report that&#13;
facilities often impose obstructive requirements.<a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141" id="_ftnref141"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[141]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Kelleen Corrigan of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center told Human Rights&#13;
Watch that one facility she deals with regularly accepts record requests only&#13;
from lawyers, effectively prohibiting unrepresented individuals from accessing&#13;
their own medical information.<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" id="_ftnref142"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[142]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3><span>Referrals and Discharge&#13;
Planning</span></h3>
<p>The Division of Immigration Health Service prides itself on&#13;
its tuberculosis program, which includes not only screening and treatment at&#13;
the detention facilities, but referral for continued treatment after detention,&#13;
even in those cases in which the individual is being deported. Health services&#13;
administrators told Human Rights Watch that they will provide individuals with&#13;
a supply of medication and a referral to their nearest available clinic to&#13;
receive follow up care. Although this level of continuity of care may be&#13;
impracticable for all health concerns, the success with tuberculosis has shown&#13;
that it is possible to provide useful medical advice and assistance to&#13;
individuals leaving detention. Indeed, in standards issued by the American&#13;
Public Health Association, it is expected that “correctional health care&#13;
providers should work with government and non-government health care agencies&#13;
to develop referral criteria and programs to ensure continuity of care for&#13;
discharged prisoners with significant health care needs including medications&#13;
and supportive care.”<a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" id="_ftnref143"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[143]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The issue of continuity of care arose most frequently in our&#13;
research in relation to pregnancy, in part because women are likely to be released&#13;
from detention through parole or another mechanism the further they progress&#13;
into the pregnancy. Two officials Human Rights Watch spoke with described their&#13;
commitment to identifying quality programs in the community to provide&#13;
alternatives to detention for pregnant women: “Just because she’s&#13;
out of detention doesn’t mean she is out of our responsibility.”<a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" id="_ftnref144"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[144]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
At another facility, however, Human Rights Watch asked whether the detention&#13;
center would assist pregnant women who were about to be released with&#13;
identifying appropriate health care providers in the community, and was told&#13;
that those arrangements would be up to the women themselves.<a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" id="_ftnref145"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[145]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h2><span>Lack of Effective Remedies</span></h2>
<blockquote><i>I filled out a grievance a long time ago and&#13;
didn’t get a response so I didn’t bother to grieve any more. The&#13;
officers told me to put in a grievance because I was feeling bad. This was&#13;
around September of 2007. I didn’t get a response until this January&#13;
[2008]. They said it had gotten mixed in with a bunch of papers and they just&#13;
found it. I don’t think so. I put a grievance against the medical&#13;
treatment and they said, “Are you better now?” I told them,&#13;
“You took so long to answer I could have been dead by now.”</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>—Mary T., Texas, April 2008</blockquote>
<p>In the past year ICE has instituted a number of new&#13;
oversight measures to assess facility compliance with detention standards;&#13;
however, few include effective mechanisms for seeking feedback from or&#13;
providing redress to detained individuals. The main mechanism for individuals&#13;
in custody to register complaints about their care remains the local facility&#13;
grievance systems, which to date have had limited input into ICE oversight&#13;
programs.</p>
<p>Standard setting bodies such as the National Commission on&#13;
Correctional Health Care state that a grievance process must be available to&#13;
address complaints about health services.<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146" id="_ftnref146"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[146]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Currently binding ICE detention standards require detention facilities to&#13;
institute a grievance system whereby the individuals detained can file&#13;
complaints that are reviewed and may be appealed up the chain of command to the&#13;
officer-in-charge of the facility.<a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" id="_ftnref147"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[147]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In addition, facilities must post the telephone number for the Office of the&#13;
Inspector General’s (OIG) toll-free hotline where individuals can bypass&#13;
the facility grievance process and report violations of their civil rights&#13;
directly to the national-level authorities.<a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" id="_ftnref148"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[148]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The new ICE standard on grievances, which will become binding on facilities in&#13;
2010, includes a separate process for addressing medical grievances in which&#13;
ICE must be notified of appeals of medical grievances.<a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" id="_ftnref149"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[149]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Also, ICE informed Human Rights Watch that it has begun screening&#13;
correspondence to its field offices to identify communications raising pressing&#13;
medical issues.<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" id="_ftnref150"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[150]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>These policy changes are positive signs, but their&#13;
implementation will be essential to realizing actual progress. In interviews&#13;
about the operation of the current grievance system, women indicated to Human&#13;
Rights Watch that it was at the facility level of implementation that the&#13;
process often failed them. Women interviewed for this report rarely found the&#13;
available complaint mechanisms to be effective tools for obtaining redress. Even&#13;
though information on the grievance system should be provided in an&#13;
individual’s orientation upon arrival at the detention facility, some&#13;
women never heard about the grievance system or seemed unclear on the&#13;
availability of the grievance system for medical issues.<a href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" id="_ftnref151"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[151]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
“When the doctor says no, it’s no. I don’t know about&#13;
grievance,”<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" id="_ftnref152"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[152]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
said Teresa W. Others said using the grievance system carried a risk of&#13;
retaliation. “When you become such an advocate, you become a target. To&#13;
them I’m threatening their job,”<a href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" id="_ftnref153"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[153]</span></span></span></span></a>said Nadine&#13;
I. Serafina D., who said she did not shy away from advocating for herself or&#13;
others, admitted, “One time I was going to file a complaint [about a&#13;
non-medical issue] but then I was told if I file a complaint that they would do&#13;
something to me and I never filed it.”<a href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" id="_ftnref154"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[154]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Facility procedures for the submission of complaints in some facilities&#13;
amplified those fears. In one county jail, to file a grievance women needed to&#13;
ask the guards for the form and return it directly to them after completing it.<a href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155" id="_ftnref155"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[155]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Even the option of calling the OIG hotline was not perceived by women as being&#13;
without risk, as women feared their calls would be monitored and their&#13;
anonymity would be compromised.</p>
<p>For many of the women who spoke with Human Rights Watch,&#13;
behind the decision to opt out of the grievance system or drop a complaint lay&#13;
not fear but exhaustion and resignation. Having attempted to engage the system&#13;
without success in other forms—filing sick call requests, asking guards&#13;
for help, mentioning their concerns to deportation officers—women looked&#13;
dimly upon the prospect of satisfaction through yet another bureaucratic&#13;
process.</p>
<p>The women who did pursue the grievance process or another&#13;
complaint mechanism reported mixed results. One woman reported that she&#13;
convinced the facility to purchase new shower curtains for the women’s&#13;
unit,<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" id="_ftnref156"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[156]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
while another noticed a change for the better in the demeanor of a nurse after&#13;
filing a complaint about her behavior toward patients.<a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157" id="_ftnref157"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[157]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Fewer appreciable results followed complaints about courses of treatment or the&#13;
availability of particular medical services. One woman tried to call the Texas&#13;
Health Department because a notice posted at the facility said that the&#13;
Department accepted complaints, but could not get her call to connect.<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158" id="_ftnref158"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[158]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Women who had the support of lawyers and family members who filed supporting&#13;
letters and made follow up phone calls had more success, but it was inconsistent&#13;
and delayed. Even with the backing of a team of zealous lawyers and attentive&#13;
family members, Rose V. faced intimidation in pursuing her complaints regarding&#13;
medical care. After advocacy efforts on her behalf graduated into a&#13;
full-fledged campaign, Rose V. said that a senior official from the medical&#13;
staff visited her and warned her, “I’m going to tell you right now,&#13;
if your lawyers don’t stop it’s going to hurt your case. It’s&#13;
going to make your judge mad; it’s going to make ICE mad... Call your&#13;
lawyer.”<a href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159" id="_ftnref159"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[159]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h1><span>V. Findings: Specific Women’s Health Concerns</span></h1>
<p>Human Rights Watch interviewed women about their ability to&#13;
access medical care for the full range of their health concerns while in&#13;
detention. To gauge the system’s preparedness in policy and in practice&#13;
to address the particular needs of women, the interviews included in-depth&#13;
discussions of women-specific health concerns. This chapter presents our&#13;
findings on those issues, as well as findings on care for survivors of violence&#13;
and on mental health care, both of which emerged in our research as priority&#13;
issues for women in detention.</p>
<h2><span>Routine Gynecological Care</span></h2>
<p>As a group for whom routine, but consequential and&#13;
potentially painful reproductive healthcare issues arise frequently, women&#13;
stand to suffer considerably within a medical system that emphasizes emergency&#13;
care and treating conditions that “would cause deterioration of the&#13;
detainee’s health or uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation&#13;
status.”<a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" id="_ftnref160"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[160]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Although individual providers may conceive of their role more broadly, policies&#13;
set at the national level establish a framework that is startlingly inadequate&#13;
in addressing common gynecological concerns. The Covered Services Package warns&#13;
providers that non-emergency gynecological services are usually not a covered&#13;
benefit, though requests may be approved on a case by case basis, effectively&#13;
limiting care to whatever minor interventions may be available at the facility&#13;
clinic or, if the woman is lucky, through Division of Immigration Health&#13;
Services (DIHS) approval of outside care.<a href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" id="_ftnref161"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[161]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This overall approach, as well as specific restrictions on Pap smears, hormonal&#13;
contraception, and access to specialist care, undermined the health of a number&#13;
of women who spoke with Human Rights Watch.</p>
<h3><span>Pap Smears</span></h3>
<p>Cervical cancer represents the second leading cause of&#13;
cancer deaths among women worldwide.<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" id="_ftnref162"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[162]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, the Pap smear, a simple and inexpensive screening test, is capable of&#13;
detecting 90 percent of early cellular changes in the cervix that signal an&#13;
increased risk of cancer, allowing for life-saving interventions.<a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" id="_ftnref163"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[163]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Accordingly, Pap smears have become a mainstay of routine preventive health&#13;
care for women in the US. The American College of Obstetricians and&#13;
Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society recommend that beginning within&#13;
three years of sexual activity or after the age of 21, women receive a Pap&#13;
smear annually until they reach the age of 30. After age 30, women who have had&#13;
three negative Pap smears can be screened every two to three years. Women who&#13;
have reached the age of 65 with no abnormal results in the last 10 years may be&#13;
safe to discontinue screenings.<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" id="_ftnref164"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[164]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
As Dr. Homer Venters testified before Congress during a hearing on problems&#13;
with medical care in immigration detention, Pap smears represent one of “the&#13;
most beneficial and cost-effective measures of modern medicine.”<a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" id="_ftnref165"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[165]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Women in ICE custody cannot count on accessing this&#13;
essential screening with the frequency recommended above. According to ICE&#13;
Policy, women must generally spend a year in ICE custody before becoming&#13;
eligible for a Pap smear screening.<a href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166" id="_ftnref166"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[166]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Pap smears may be considered before that time if “medically indicated”<a href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167" id="_ftnref167"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[167]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
or if a specific problem is brought to the attention of the medical providers.<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168" id="_ftnref168"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[168]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
On its face, this policy does not correspond to the community standard because&#13;
it does not account for when a woman may have last had a screening before&#13;
entering detention. Several women told Human Rights Watch that they had plans&#13;
for an annual exam right around the time they were detained, while others had&#13;
not had the opportunity for a screening in years. Standard setting bodies for&#13;
correctional institutions such as the National Commission on Correctional Health&#13;
Care and the American Public Health Association avoid this problem by&#13;
recommending that Pap smears form part of jails’ initial health screening&#13;
for women, to then be followed up with periodic screening according to community&#13;
standards.<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" id="_ftnref169"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[169]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch confirm that&#13;
women are indeed being denied this critical screening. Of eight women&#13;
interviewed who had been detained for more than a year, six women had not&#13;
received a Pap smear,<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" id="_ftnref170"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[170]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
one had been screened once in two years of detention,<a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171" id="_ftnref171"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[171]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
and another had received the test when she was receiving attention for other&#13;
medical concerns.<a href="#_ftn172" name="_ftnref172" id="_ftnref172"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[172]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In some cases the women actively pursued the screening; in others they were&#13;
unaware of their potential eligibility because medical personnel had not&#13;
mentioned it.</p>
<p>Cecile A., detained for 18 months at the time she spoke with&#13;
Human Rights Watch, said she had stopped trying to get the test after multiple&#13;
attempts: “In Texas I asked. I submitted a request and they said yes but&#13;
they never called. In Texas I asked many times but here [at a Florida detention&#13;
center] I don’t think they do it.”<a href="#_ftn173" name="_ftnref173" id="_ftnref173"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[173]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Cecile A. and the other five women we spoke with whom ICE detained for over a&#13;
year without a Pap smear were in detention at the time we interviewed them,&#13;
making it impossible to assess the impact of the missed screenings on their&#13;
physical health. However, the understandable impact of this uncertainty on&#13;
their mental health was readily apparent. Expressing distress over the number&#13;
of Pap smears and other cancer screenings she had not received over the course&#13;
of two years in detention, Nana B. said, “I think because I have been&#13;
here a long time they need to do all the tests ... I don’t know if&#13;
I’m sick or not. I’m scared.”<a href="#_ftn174" name="_ftnref174" id="_ftnref174"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[174]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Improvements in the eligibility criteria for Pap smears at&#13;
the national policy level likely constitute only the first step toward ensuring&#13;
access to screenings at the facility level. If the experience of Lucia C., who&#13;
met all of the current requirements for Pap smears, provides any indication,&#13;
implementation poses its own challenges. Prior to her detention by ICE, Lucia&#13;
C. had obtained a Pap smear and learned that the result was abnormal. Her&#13;
doctor instructed her that she should follow up with Pap smears every six&#13;
months to check for signs that cervical cancer was developing. When ICE&#13;
detained her at a county jail in New Jersey, Lucia brought her situation to the&#13;
attention of medical authorities. Initially rebuffed, she persisted: “I&#13;
was supposed to be checked every six months. I asked my daughter to send the&#13;
records. I got it and I brought it to medical so they could see I’m not&#13;
lying. I have asked a lot of times.”<a href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175" id="_ftnref175"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[175]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Speaking with Human Rights Watch after almost 16 months in detention, Lucia C.&#13;
reported that the medical staff still had not provided her a Pap smear.&#13;
“It’s terrible,” she said, “because you feel like you&#13;
have something you can die for... and you don’t have no&#13;
assistance.”<a href="#_ftn176" name="_ftnref176" id="_ftnref176"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[176]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3><span>Hormonal Contraception and&#13;
Gynecology Appointments</span></h3>
<p>DIHS policy denies women in ICE custody access to basic&#13;
family planning services including contraceptive drugs, interfering with their&#13;
reproductive autonomy, and exposing them to the risk of unintended pregnancy&#13;
and unnecessary hardship. Furthermore, several women reported struggling to&#13;
obtain appropriate attention for menstrual irregularities and other&#13;
gynecological concerns through the detention medical care system.</p>
<p>Out of step with American Public Health Association&#13;
correctional standards mandating access to contraception, the Covered Services&#13;
Package specifically disclaims coverage for family planning services of any&#13;
kind and the DIHS formulary omits hormonal contraceptives.<a href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" id="_ftnref177"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[177]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
DIHS officials told Human Rights Watch that hormonal contraceptives for birth&#13;
control were not available because they constitute an elective therapy that is&#13;
not without risks.<a href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" id="_ftnref178"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[178]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In addition to blocking access to birth control, Human Rights Watch found that&#13;
this policy can also impede women from obtaining access to hormonal&#13;
contraceptives as treatment for other health conditions, including painful or&#13;
irregular menstruation.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations that a sex-segregated detention&#13;
setting might seem to imply, the lack of access to contraceptives can put women&#13;
at risk for unintended pregnancy. Instances of sexual contact between men and&#13;
women in detention centers, while rightly forbidden given the impossibility of&#13;
meaningful consent in such an environment, have occurred and women should not&#13;
be required to report sexual abuse in order to obtain needed services.<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" id="_ftnref179"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[179]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Further, women’s time in detention must be viewed in the context of their&#13;
larger reproductive lives. On release from detention, women who had been forced&#13;
to discontinue their use of hormonal contraceptives would not immediately be&#13;
able to rely on that method due to the time it takes for hormonal&#13;
contraceptives to become effective.<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" id="_ftnref180"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[180]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
It is notable that the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which cares for women who&#13;
will generally be out of the community for longer periods, provides women with&#13;
advice and consultation about methods of birth control and will prescribe it&#13;
when deemed medically appropriate.<a href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181" id="_ftnref181"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[181]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>In addition, hormonal contraceptives serve a number of&#13;
important purposes beyond birth control. Among their many uses, hormonal&#13;
contraceptives may be prescribed to reduce a woman’s risk of developing&#13;
ovarian and breast cancer, to regulate a woman’s menstrual cycle, or to&#13;
alleviate painful menstrual cramps.<a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182" id="_ftnref182"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[182]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Three of the health services administrators who spoke with Human Rights Watch&#13;
indicated that the exclusion of family planning services from the Covered&#13;
Services Package and DIHS formulary would not prevent hormonal contraception&#13;
from being prescribed for a medical issue aside from birth control.<a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183" id="_ftnref183"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[183]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, for Serafina D., that was exactly the effect it had:</p>
<blockquote>I was having ovarian problems where I was bleeding very&#13;
heavily and [my medical providers before I was detained] told me that I had&#13;
inflammation of ovaries and because the bleeding was so heavy they prescribed&#13;
birth control ... Birth control would make it soft and light. When it was heavy&#13;
it was very uncomfortable. Cramping, heavy, like I was hemorrhaging ... [In&#13;
detention] they couldn’t give me the medications because they don’t&#13;
provide birth control. “We don’t [provide that] kind of medication....&#13;
The only thing we can give you is ibuprofen as an anti-inflammatory.” I&#13;
was glad when I didn’t have my period for two months but then when it&#13;
came, ahhhh. I wouldn’t want to get up.<a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" id="_ftnref184"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[184]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Women unable to obtain gynecological appointments reported&#13;
that, in some cases, the difficulty was directly attributed to the requirement&#13;
that national headquarters authorize outside appointments for specialist care.&#13;
Before ICE detained her, Nadine I. had made arrangements to see a gynecologist&#13;
for painful menstruation-related concerns.<a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185" id="_ftnref185"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[185]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
She said, “A week before I got my period I would be in agony. I would&#13;
pass heavy, huge clots.”<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186" id="_ftnref186"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[186]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
At one Florida detention center, she put in four or five requests to see a&#13;
gynecologist and understood that the medical facility had sent in the required&#13;
papers for DIHS authorization to make the appointment. After six months passed&#13;
without a response, she was transferred to a second facility in another part of&#13;
the state. There she again filed a request. It was not until more than four&#13;
months later, over 10 months from her original request, that she saw a&#13;
gynecologist. During her months of waiting, she said, “They&#13;
wouldn’t give you anything.”<a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" id="_ftnref187"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[187]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Several other women repeated similar stories of difficulty&#13;
obtaining attention for gynecological concerns but never received an explanation&#13;
for the delay. In two instances, the requests simply went unanswered. After she&#13;
was detained, Jameela E. started getting her period every two weeks. She put in&#13;
multiple requests to consult a doctor without success.<a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" id="_ftnref188"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[188]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Lily F., who arrived at a detention center in Arizona and immediately sought&#13;
follow up for an abnormal Pap smear, waited months to be sent for treatment.&#13;
Transferred from a prison in California, she had the good fortune of having her&#13;
medical records follow her to ICE detention, including the abnormal Pap&#13;
results, but it still took six months for the facility to arrange for her to go&#13;
off-site for a biopsy.<a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" id="_ftnref189"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[189]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3>
<span>Sanitary P</span>ads</h3>
<blockquote>
<i>They only give two pads. In the morning they come and&#13;
give you two. If you need more than that you have to go to the nurse.&#13;
“Why do you need more pads?” You have to tell her, “Because I&#13;
bleed so much.” But it has to be an extraordinary reason. If it’s&#13;
normal for you to have a heavy period—nothing. I bleed through three&#13;
pairs of pants. Well yes, if the officers see this, then it’s a reason</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>—Nana B., Arizona, May 2008</blockquote>
<p>Women at several facilities described arbitrary and&#13;
humiliating limitations on access to sanitary pads. ICE standards state that&#13;
facilities will issue feminine-hygiene items on an as-needed basis.<a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" id="_ftnref190"><span><span>[190]</span></span></a>&#13;
However, as implemented in several detention centers, this policy has failed to&#13;
meet the UN Standard Minimum Rules on the Treatment of Prisoners requirement&#13;
that authorities provide individuals in custody with “water and with such&#13;
toilet articles as are necessary for health and cleanliness.”<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" id="_ftnref191"><span><span>[191]</span></span></a>&#13;
A number of women told Human Rights Watch that officers would distribute a&#13;
certain quantity of pads (two to six), and obtaining more “as&#13;
needed” posed a challenge. Nadine I. recalled that after you used your&#13;
allowance of four pads, the officers would hand them out one at a time.&#13;
“I needed three pads. It would just gush. It would end up soaking my&#13;
clothes. If my clothing got soaked, I could go through a shift change without a&#13;
change of clothing ... We were shaken down every night. If you had hoarded they&#13;
would take [away] the extra pads.”<a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" id="_ftnref192"><span><span>[192]</span></span></a></p>
<p>Such restrictions put women in the place of having to&#13;
justify to staff—and often not the medical professionals—the needs&#13;
occasioned by a private bodily function. Elisa G. had her period when the detention&#13;
center decided to lock down her entire housing unit for three days. The&#13;
circumstances forced her to appeal to the ICE officer visiting the unit: “I&#13;
had to ask [for pads] again. ‘I have my period. I have a lot of pain. I&#13;
need to shower. It’s not for [my benefit], it’s for my&#13;
roommate.’ [ICE officer:] ‘Give this lady two pads.’ I said,&#13;
‘Sir, you’re not understanding what I am saying. I need more than&#13;
two pads,’ ... I had to just sit on the toilet for hours because I had&#13;
nothing else [I could] do.”<a href="#_ftn193" name="_ftnref193" id="_ftnref193"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[193]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Several women at one facility expressed anger over a&#13;
recently instituted rule at that particular facility that required women to&#13;
work to receive any sanitary pads beyond their initial allotment.<a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" id="_ftnref194"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[194]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
“I don’t have any problem with working, but I don’t feel that&#13;
it is right that you have to do that to get what you need,” said one&#13;
woman.<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195" id="_ftnref195"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[195]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Upon learning of this rule, the ICE field office said this rule was against&#13;
policy and would be taken up with the facility immediately.</p>
<h2><span>Mammography and Breast Health</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<i>I worry about my breast a lot. I told my family,&#13;
“Don’t ask me to [appeal my immigration case].” I’m not&#13;
well and I would have to stay without medical care. I don’t know from&#13;
month to month ... things can get worse in my breast. It’s hurting me.&#13;
What was I supposed to do, die of cancer here? With adequate care, yes, I would&#13;
stay until the end. Because 22 years of my life [have been in the US]. My kids&#13;
are 12 and the United States is all they know. Depression, inadequate food,&#13;
detention? Yes, still I would have fought it indefinitely</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>—Antoinette L., Arizona, May 2008<a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196" id="_ftnref196"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[196]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Topping even cervical cancer, breast cancer ranks as the&#13;
leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Calling mammograms “the gold&#13;
standard” for early detection of the disease, the American Cancer Society&#13;
recommends that women age 40 and over receive the screening yearly along with a&#13;
clinical breast exam from their health care provider, and that younger women&#13;
undergo the clinical exam every two to three years. The American Cancer Society&#13;
also counsels providers to tell women in their 20s and older about the benefits&#13;
and limitations of breast self-examinations.<a href="#_ftn197" name="_ftnref197" id="_ftnref197"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[197]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The DIHS approach to breast health is deficient in how it&#13;
addresses all three modes of breast cancer screening. National policy limits&#13;
access to mammograms and is completely silent on manual breast exams and&#13;
self-exams. The DIHS benefit package provides that mammography requests will be&#13;
considered for asymptomatic cases only after an individual has been in custody&#13;
for one year and only if that the individual is not facing imminent deportation.<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198" id="_ftnref198"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[198]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
As discussed in regard to Pap smears, the one-year requirement contradicts&#13;
advice that these tests be administered annually, since it does not take into&#13;
account when the woman last obtained a screening prior to detention.</p>
<p>Four women who spoke with Human Rights Watch who had been in&#13;
custody over one year had not received either a mammogram or a manual breast&#13;
exam.<a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199" id="_ftnref199"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[199]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Another woman had recently had surgery on her breast before being detained and&#13;
was instructed to get a mammogram every six months. Due for her six-month&#13;
mammogram at the time she was detained, she had to wait four months before the&#13;
detention authorities arranged for a mammogram, and did not receive another one&#13;
during her remaining 12 months in detention.<a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200" id="_ftnref200"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[200]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Those women who have breast health concerns that require&#13;
examination and follow up care find the uncertainty around their health&#13;
compounded by uncertainty around the procedure for obtaining appropriate&#13;
medical attention. The Covered Services Package does not set out separate rules&#13;
on eligibility for diagnostic mammograms. However, presumably they would fall&#13;
under the rubric of procedures that might be authorized if supported by&#13;
clinical findings.<a href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201" id="_ftnref201"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[201]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Two women felt their lives were in jeopardy due to ICE’s failure to&#13;
follow up on concerns related to breast cancer. Antoinette L., quoted above,&#13;
waited months for a mammogram. When one was finally performed, and it was&#13;
determined that at least one of two lumps required further investigation, no&#13;
plan of action was formed; rather, she was told that this was something she&#13;
should pursue after leaving detention, whenever that might be.<a href="#_ftn202" name="_ftnref202" id="_ftnref202"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[202]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
During Lily F.’s months-long wait for a mammogram she felt increasing&#13;
discomfort—“It’s like something bite[s] me”—and&#13;
worried with thoughts of her mother’s death from breast cancer: “I&#13;
have kids,” she said, “I don’t want to die here away from my&#13;
family.”<a href="#_ftn203" name="_ftnref203" id="_ftnref203"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[203]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Pregnancy</span></h2>
<h3><span>Prenatal and Postnatal Care</span></h3>
<p>Pregnancy is one of the few women’s health concerns&#13;
ICE leadership has begun to address with appropriate gravity in policy, but&#13;
this improvement is limited by uneven implementation. It is ICE policy that&#13;
medical personnel immediately inform ICE when they discover a woman in custody&#13;
is pregnant in order that those responsible for case management can monitor her&#13;
progress and assess whether alternatives to detention might be available. For&#13;
the duration that prenatal and postnatal women are in custody, the ICE benefit&#13;
package states that prenatal exams are covered services and the new ICE medical&#13;
standard will provide that “[f]emale detainees shall have access to&#13;
pregnancy testing and pregnancy management services that include routine&#13;
prenatal care, addiction management, comprehensive counseling and assistance,&#13;
nutrition, and postpartum follow up.”<a href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204" id="_ftnref204"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[204]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
As it stands, however, access to these services appears to vary considerably.</p>
<p>ICE contends that all pregnant women in detention receive&#13;
care from off-site obstetrical specialists, two of whom we spoke with and&#13;
confirmed that they provide the detained women with care commensurate with&#13;
community standards. Martha Burke, midwife at Su Clinica Familiar in Harlingen,&#13;
Texas, sees pregnant women detained at Willacy County Detention Center and told&#13;
Human Rights Watch that “What’s available to them is what’s&#13;
available to everyone.”<a href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205" id="_ftnref205"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[205]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Restrictions in the DIHS health coverage or in the logistics of transporting&#13;
women for services do not pose a problem according to Dr. F. Javier del&#13;
Castillo, who provides care at his practice in Brownsville, Texas, for women&#13;
detained at Port Isabel Service Processing Center: “If I say the lady&#13;
needs an ultrasound on Sunday, she’ll get it on Sunday.”<a href="#_ftn206" name="_ftnref206" id="_ftnref206"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[206]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Three women who visited off-site providers expressed satisfaction with the&#13;
services.<a href="#_ftn207" name="_ftnref207" id="_ftnref207"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[207]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Speaking of the Brownsville practice, Katherine I. said, “They [ICE] sent&#13;
me to the doctor three or four times, a women’s clinic in Brownsville....&#13;
They did a sonogram twice, checking everything. They treated me well.&#13;
There’s nothing that needs to be changed about Brownsville.”<a href="#_ftn208" name="_ftnref208" id="_ftnref208"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[208]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>However, we spoke with three women in Arizona who never&#13;
reached an outside provider and for whom these services never materialized. In&#13;
two of those cases, the women told the medical staff of their pregnancy but&#13;
tested negative on the urine test the DIHS facilities use to detect pregnancy&#13;
in all detained women who are of child-bearing age. While accurate most of the&#13;
time, urine tests cannot predict pregnancy as early as blood tests.<a href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209" id="_ftnref209"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[209]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Failure to schedule necessary tests in a timely manner can&#13;
also delay or effectively deny access to prenatal care. Giselle M., pregnant&#13;
for the first time, entered ICE custody after her doctor identified an ovarian&#13;
cyst that threatened her five-month pregnancy and her health but, despite&#13;
bringing her need for frequent sonograms to the attention of ICE, never&#13;
obtained a prenatal exam of any kind during a month and a half in detention:</p>
<blockquote>When I went to get a sonogram [before being detained] the&#13;
doctor found a cyst and wanted to monitor every two to three weeks because it&#13;
kept growing, growing to the size of a golf ball. It could erupt and hurt me or&#13;
the baby. I was a first time mom, I didn’t know what to expect. I told&#13;
them [at the detention center] this is what is going on and I need to see a&#13;
doctor. I would go every time with my little paper. They would say, “Go&#13;
ahead, put [in] a request.” But they never took me once. They never got&#13;
back to me.<a href="#_ftn210" name="_ftnref210" id="_ftnref210"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[210]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Giselle M.’s medical record indicates that the health&#13;
unit planned to include her the next time they arranged a visit with the&#13;
prenatal care provider, but did not make any accommodation for her to see a&#13;
specialist more quickly given her circumstances. After almost a month had&#13;
passed from when she was supposed to have had a sonogram according to the&#13;
schedule set by her doctor, Giselle filed another sick call request asking&#13;
about when she would have an appointment. The response from the medical staff&#13;
read, “You are scheduled to see PA soon, within 2 wks. Be patient.”<a href="#_ftn211" name="_ftnref211" id="_ftnref211"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[211]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3><span>Abortion</span></h3>
<p>The Division of Immigration Health Services lists&#13;
“elective abortions” as an example of “commonly requested&#13;
procedures” that are generally not authorized under the Covered Services&#13;
Package. Several of the health service providers we questioned about the&#13;
accessibility of abortions indicated that ICE would not provide or fund an&#13;
abortion for a woman in custody, but could arrange transportation to an&#13;
appointment paid for by the woman herself or a third party. For many women who&#13;
arrive in detention without significant personal funds or connections to&#13;
resources in the immediate area, arranging to pay for the procedure, which can&#13;
cost hundreds of dollars, may be impossible. Detention health care providers&#13;
emphasized that abortion rarely comes up and some could not remember it ever&#13;
arising at all. In contrast, legal and social service providers noted the frequency&#13;
of sexual assault along the border and recalled clients seeking access to&#13;
abortion following incidents of rape. By comparison, unlike women in ICE&#13;
custody, women in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons may receive an elective&#13;
abortion at Bureau expense if the pregnancy is the result of rape.<a href="#_ftn212" name="_ftnref212" id="_ftnref212"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[212]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The reference to abortion not “coming up”&#13;
underscored the apparent omission of options counseling for women who test&#13;
positive on the pregnancy tests all women receive at intake.<a href="#_ftn213" name="_ftnref213" id="_ftnref213"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[213]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The DIHS Policies and Procedures Manual, which provides instructions to staff&#13;
at DIHS-operated facilities, requires providers to screen all women between the&#13;
ages of 10 and 55 for pregnancy, and to follow up on positive results with&#13;
notification to ICE and initiation of prenatal care. But there is no&#13;
recognition of the possibility that a woman might not wish to continue the&#13;
pregnancy.<a href="#_ftn214" name="_ftnref214" id="_ftnref214"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[214]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Indeed, one provider confirmed that unless the woman articulates a desire to&#13;
terminate the pregnancy, it is “care as usual.”<a href="#_ftn215" name="_ftnref215" id="_ftnref215"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[215]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Three women confirmed that they received no such counseling and one indicated&#13;
that she had planned to seek an abortion before being detained and would have&#13;
requested one in detention if that option had been explained to her:</p>
<blockquote>You know when you find out you’re pregnant you feel&#13;
excited. That’s normal. But I didn’t feel that way. I was&#13;
indifferent. I had been thinking about abortion ... But the doctors [at the&#13;
detention center] were going to want me to tell them why I am thinking about&#13;
that. In that moment, if I had the option I would have done it [abortion] ... I&#13;
didn’t know that there were those kind of services available.<a href="#_ftn216" name="_ftnref216" id="_ftnref216"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[216]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>According to standards issued by the National Commission on&#13;
Correctional Health Care, “pregnant inmates [should be] given&#13;
comprehensive counseling and assistance in accordance with their expressed&#13;
desires regarding their pregnancy, whether they elect to keep the child, use&#13;
adoption services, or have an abortion.”<a href="#_ftn217" name="_ftnref217" id="_ftnref217"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[217]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The Federal Bureau of Prisons requires wardens to “offer to provide each&#13;
pregnant inmate with medical, religious, and social counseling to aid her in&#13;
making the decision whether to carry the pregnancy to full term or to have an&#13;
elective abortion.”<a href="#_ftn218" name="_ftnref218" id="_ftnref218"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[218]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The new ICE medical standard states that pregnant women will have access to&#13;
“comprehensive counseling and assistance” as part of&#13;
“pregnancy management services” but does not elaborate on what this&#13;
entails, whether it covers information on abortion, how it will be made&#13;
available or who will be responsible for providing it.<a href="#_ftn219" name="_ftnref219" id="_ftnref219"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[219]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The duty to provide options counseling as a component of&#13;
pregnancy testing is especially important in the immigration detention context,&#13;
where desires to terminate a pregnancy may not be expressed because women are&#13;
unaware of the options that are legally available in this country. It is&#13;
incumbent on facilities to provide each pregnant woman with, at the very least,&#13;
a statement of the law and referrals to trained counselors for more information&#13;
as desired.</p>
<h3><span>Nursing Mothers</span></h3>
<p>Recent policy changes limiting the detention of nursing&#13;
mothers should prevent many women from having to contend with the detention&#13;
health services’ deficient approach to lactation. However, gaps in&#13;
implementation of the new policy raise concerns that women and children will&#13;
continue to suffer the short- and long-term effects of the scant medical&#13;
attention offered to nursing mothers in custody.</p>
<p>In a November 2007 directive, then Assistant Secretary Julie&#13;
Myers instructed ICE Field Offices to consider paroling all nursing mothers who&#13;
did not meet the criteria for mandatory detention<a href="#_ftn220" name="_ftnref220" id="_ftnref220"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[220]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
and who did not present a national security risk.<a href="#_ftn221" name="_ftnref221" id="_ftnref221"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[221]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Nonetheless, two of the five nursing mothers who spoke with Human Rights Watch had&#13;
entered detention since the directive despite being eligible for parole under&#13;
its guidelines. In both cases, it appeared that there had been a breakdown in&#13;
communication between health services personnel and the case management&#13;
authorities in charge of parole decisions. The directive instructs field&#13;
offices to update ICE headquarters regarding decisions to detain nursing mothers;&#13;
however, there does not seem to be a functioning system for health services staff&#13;
to alert immediately field offices of the presence of nursing mothers, as they&#13;
must with pregnant women. In fact, when Human Rights Watch queried health&#13;
services administrators about their approach to lactation, none made reference&#13;
to the directive.</p>
<p>Women entering detention as nursing mothers, whether because&#13;
they meet the criteria for mandatory detention or because they have been&#13;
overlooked for parole, face considerable hardship, much of which could be&#13;
avoided with the most basic and inexpensive of interventions: a breast pump. Officials&#13;
at DIHS headquarters informed Human Rights Watch that breast pumps should be&#13;
made available to nursing mothers.<a href="#_ftn222" name="_ftnref222" id="_ftnref222"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[222]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, of the five women who spoke with us about their experience of being&#13;
detained while lactating, none were offered the option of using a breast pump&#13;
when they presented for medical intake.<a href="#_ftn223" name="_ftnref223" id="_ftnref223"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[223]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The absence of this option caused intense physical discomfort including fever, chills,&#13;
and pain. Jennifer L., detained at two facilities in Texas, recounted, “I&#13;
told them at [the first detention center], and they called me after two-three&#13;
days. They gave me a little bit of pills for fever but the breasts were full.&#13;
And the fever was permanently in my body. No pump, no compress, no ice.”<a href="#_ftn224" name="_ftnref224" id="_ftnref224"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[224]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Similarly, Ashley J., detained in Arizona, said, “The ducts clogged. I&#13;
felt very bad. [My breasts] were so full my arms hurt. I couldn’t move my&#13;
arms.”<a href="#_ftn225" name="_ftnref225" id="_ftnref225"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[225]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In at least one case, mastitis resulted when these concerns went unaddressed.<a href="#_ftn226" name="_ftnref226" id="_ftnref226"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[226]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>In addition to causing severe discomfort, the abrupt halt to&#13;
lactation has significant long-term implications for the woman and her child.&#13;
The women who spoke with Human Rights Watch had intended to continue&#13;
breastfeeding their children, in some cases, for years beyond the point of&#13;
their detention, as is typical in some cultures. Women who breastfeed benefit&#13;
from a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancer, and their children are less&#13;
likely to suffer from pneumonia, viral infections, and, research suggests,&#13;
possibly obesity and diabetes.<a href="#_ftn227" name="_ftnref227" id="_ftnref227"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[227]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Despite one health services administrator’s contention that they had the&#13;
option of manually expressing milk, none of the women who went without a pump&#13;
were able to breastfeed after their release. Apart from depriving mother and&#13;
child of the physical benefits of continued breastfeeding, this carried with it&#13;
mental anguish for several women. “My focus was that I couldn’t&#13;
nurse my child. I could not go back to nursing,”<a href="#_ftn228" name="_ftnref228" id="_ftnref228"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[228]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
said Ashley J. Mercedes O. remembered, “When I was thinking that my&#13;
daughter would look for me to nurse and I couldn’t, I felt useless.”<a href="#_ftn229" name="_ftnref229" id="_ftnref229"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[229]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Services for Survivors of Sexual&#13;
and Gender-Based Violence</span></h2>
<p>While it is impossible to say what percentage of the women&#13;
detained by immigration authorities have survived sexual or gender-based&#13;
violence, observers’ estimates and the risks associated with migration&#13;
suggest it is high, and possibly climbing.<a href="#_ftn230" name="_ftnref230" id="_ftnref230"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[230]</span></span></span></span></a>Even though this violence does not affect&#13;
women exclusively, Human Rights Watch considers it an important topic to&#13;
address in assessing the detention medical care system’s response to&#13;
women’s health needs. One health services administrator told Human Rights&#13;
Watch that she thought almost all the women in her care were touched by&#13;
domestic violence;<a href="#_ftn231" name="_ftnref231" id="_ftnref231"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[231]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
at another facility a health official said that women reporting rape during&#13;
border crossing “is not surprising for us. Routinely we see it.”<a href="#_ftn232" name="_ftnref232" id="_ftnref232"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[232]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Among the women who spoke with Human Rights Watch, many&#13;
reported some form of sexual or gender-based violence in one or more stages of&#13;
the migratory process. For some, violence created the impetus for leaving their&#13;
country of origin: “I was afraid of my husband because he was abusing me&#13;
and if I go back he may do something to me,” said Yesenia P.<a href="#_ftn233" name="_ftnref233" id="_ftnref233"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[233]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
For others, it transpired over the journey: “There was no lock on the&#13;
door to the bathroom [at the house where the coyotes kept us]. I had my back&#13;
turned in the shower when they came in ... afterwards I saw the condoms on the&#13;
floor,” said Suana Michel Q.<a href="#_ftn234" name="_ftnref234" id="_ftnref234"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[234]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
For still others, it formed part of their experience in the US: “Little&#13;
by little I came to be in a relationship where [my husband] had the biggest&#13;
control over me because of my being illegal. He had total control over me,”&#13;
said Ashley J.<a href="#_ftn235" name="_ftnref235" id="_ftnref235"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[235]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
For almost all, the violence had repercussions that persisted at the time of&#13;
their detention, such as severe mental distress.</p>
<p>In addressing the needs of survivors of sexual and&#13;
gender-based violence, inconsistency among detention centers’ approaches&#13;
means that some women benefit from a comprehensive approach to their mental and&#13;
physical health, but many go without any recognition of their needs. Both the&#13;
American Public Health Association and the National Commission on Correctional&#13;
Health Care recommend that women in custody receive services to address those&#13;
needs.<a href="#_ftn236" name="_ftnref236" id="_ftnref236"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[236]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The APHA standard states that, “Health care for incarcerated women should&#13;
include services that address the consequences of abusive relationships. The&#13;
safety of women should be ensured and care should be provided for the physical&#13;
and emotional sequela of abuse.”<a href="#_ftn237" name="_ftnref237" id="_ftnref237"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[237]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>ICE policy fails to comprehensively address the needs of&#13;
survivors of violence. During the recent revision of the detention standards,&#13;
ICE added a standard on preventing and responding to sexual assault. While this&#13;
is an important improvement, the standard focuses on sexual assault that takes&#13;
place in ICE custody, and does not specifically address the needs of survivors&#13;
whose assault predates their detention. Discussions with facility health&#13;
services administrators and women currently or formerly detained by ICE&#13;
highlighted some existing positive practices but also weaknesses in several&#13;
areas: the identification of survivors, the range of services available to&#13;
address the short- and long-term consequences of violence, and the cultivation&#13;
of partnerships with community service providers.</p>
<p>Providing clear opportunities and safe spaces for women to&#13;
disclose their experience with violence is essential for ensuring the&#13;
well-being of women in custody, both because they may have urgent medical needs&#13;
and because the experience of detention may retraumatize them. The new ICE&#13;
medical standard directs facilities to question all detained persons at their&#13;
initial medical screening about past or recent sexual victimization, but only advises&#13;
questioning about other forms of physical abuse for individuals referred for&#13;
mental health evaluations.<a href="#_ftn238" name="_ftnref238" id="_ftnref238"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[238]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Despite assertions by facility providers that they ask about violence during medical&#13;
intake, a number of the women who spoke with Human Rights Watch did not recall&#13;
ever being asked. In cases where abuse or assault formed the basis for the&#13;
woman’s claim for immigration relief and would likely have been known to&#13;
her deportation officer, these issues still went unaddressed on the medical&#13;
side. Nora S. said that this subject did not come up with the detention staff:&#13;
“I only spoke about this in court.”<a href="#_ftn239" name="_ftnref239" id="_ftnref239"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[239]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Failure to identify survivors of violence during initial&#13;
screenings may be linked to the phrasing of the question and the person by whom&#13;
it is asked. On one intake form, the question is asked, “Have you ever&#13;
been the victim of a sex crime?”<a href="#_ftn240" name="_ftnref240" id="_ftnref240"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[240]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In addition to leaving out the most common form of gender-based&#13;
violence—domestic violence—the question may fail to elicit&#13;
information because of confusion over what constitutes a crime. National and international&#13;
standards on such screening typically advise a series of questions about&#13;
specific behaviors or incidents given the varying ways in which individuals,&#13;
especially those from diverse cultural backgrounds, may define violence or&#13;
crimes.<a href="#_ftn241" name="_ftnref241" id="_ftnref241"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[241]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In addition, in many cases, women may only be willing or comfortable disclosing&#13;
violence to a healthcare provider of the same gender. As noted above, the&#13;
initial medical screening at ICE facilities may be conducted by personnel who&#13;
are not medical professionals. Further, detainees are not necessarily screened&#13;
by someone of the same gender.</p>
<p>An early opportunity for an effective discussion of these&#13;
issues is particularly important for women who have suffered sexual violence&#13;
immediately preceding their detention. Otherwise, they may miss the window for&#13;
time-sensitive interventions such as emergency contraception (EC) and&#13;
prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as the&#13;
collection of physical evidence of the attack. Health services administrators&#13;
told Human Rights Watch that while most women would have passed the time period&#13;
for EC to be effective at the point they reached the detention center, the&#13;
medication could be made available when appropriate, as could treatment for&#13;
STIs, crisis counseling, and referral to a local hospital for forensic evidence&#13;
collection. Despite the administrators’ statements regarding the&#13;
availability of EC, the medicine is not on the detention center formulary and,&#13;
unlike STI prophylaxis, it is omitted from the list of interventions to be made&#13;
available to rape survivors in the new standard on sexual abuse and assault&#13;
prevention and intervention.<a href="#_ftn242" name="_ftnref242" id="_ftnref242"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[242]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Officials from DIHS headquarters insisted that as an “emergency”&#13;
intervention, EC would be obtained in one manner or another to ensure a woman&#13;
would have timely access to it.<a href="#_ftn243" name="_ftnref243" id="_ftnref243"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[243]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Women in abusive relationships may also have immediate needs&#13;
and concerns for their safety. Ashley J. recounted the continuing torment her&#13;
abusive husband inflicted on her while she was in detention: “He would&#13;
tell me that he knew deportation officers and that he could see the videos of&#13;
how I was behaving. I believed that he could reach me inside, in detention.”<a href="#_ftn244" name="_ftnref244" id="_ftnref244"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[244]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Ashley J. informed her deportation officer of the situation so that he would&#13;
not provide her husband with information on her case, but she was not referred&#13;
by the officer for services nor was the subject broached by health care&#13;
providers.</p>
<p>For women whose experience with violence dates back further,&#13;
the needs for medical attention may still be acute. Human Rights Watch spoke&#13;
with two women, Nana B. and Jameela E., who suffered gynecological problems&#13;
while in detention that they attributed to female genital mutilation performed&#13;
in their country of origin. Regarding mental health care, Nora S., a survivor&#13;
of domestic violence, stated affirmatively, “I would definitely have&#13;
wanted help with this, the opportunity to talk about this. I was a victim of&#13;
domestic violence for 13 years.”<a href="#_ftn245" name="_ftnref245" id="_ftnref245"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[245]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Finally, a hallmark feature of one facility’s&#13;
successful response to one survivor’s assault was the detention&#13;
facility’s partnership with a local service provider. According to Suana&#13;
Michel Q., the health providers at Port Isabel Service Processing Center&#13;
referred her to the Family Crisis Center in Harlingen, Texas, who provided her&#13;
with counseling during her stay in detention and afterwards when she was&#13;
released into an alternative to detention program.<a href="#_ftn246" name="_ftnref246" id="_ftnref246"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[246]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Moreover, when she moved out of state, the facility provided her with a&#13;
referral to a similar organization at her destination. Unfortunately, not all&#13;
detention centers coordinate so closely with local resources. An advocate for&#13;
sexual assault survivors in Arizona told Human Rights Watch that she had repeatedly&#13;
sought to engage her local ICE field office in a dialogue on ways they could&#13;
cooperate to serve the needs of survivors but found them uninterested.<a href="#_ftn247" name="_ftnref247" id="_ftnref247"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[247]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Mental Health Care</span></h2>
<p>Human Rights Watch decided to probe further on care for&#13;
mental health issues because it emerged in interviews as a priority issue for&#13;
many women in detention. When asked about the health concerns women frequently&#13;
presented, several health services administrators noted that women would&#13;
commonly seek care for depression or anxiety.<a href="#_ftn248" name="_ftnref248" id="_ftnref248"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[248]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This held true in Human Rights Watch’s interviews with women who were or&#13;
had been in detention.</p>
<p>According to the women we spoke with, the facilities’&#13;
response to mental health concerns ranked as one of the greatest deficiencies&#13;
in the detention health care system. In part, this failing represents one more&#13;
manifestation of the detention standard and benefit package’s emphasis on&#13;
acute care. The currently binding ICE medical standard provides for a mental&#13;
health screening, but does not elaborate on what treatment is available.<a href="#_ftn249" name="_ftnref249" id="_ftnref249"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[249]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The new ICE medical standard shows improvement in that it stipulates that every&#13;
facility shall provide mental health care to the individuals in its custody and&#13;
that a treatment plan will be devised for individuals with mental health needs.<a href="#_ftn250" name="_ftnref250" id="_ftnref250"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[250]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, the extent to which an effective treatment plan can be implemented may&#13;
be limited by the off-site services authorized under the DIHS Covered Services&#13;
Package, which states that non-emergency services are generally not covered and&#13;
that counseling and psychotherapy are not covered unless approved by the&#13;
medical director.<a href="#_ftn251" name="_ftnref251" id="_ftnref251"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[251]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
DIHS officials assured Human Rights Watch that counseling is available and that&#13;
medication would not be prescribed alone but as part of a comprehensive&#13;
treatment plan, as is contemplated in relevant health standards.<a href="#_ftn252" name="_ftnref252" id="_ftnref252"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[252]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>However, a number of women cited difficulty obtaining&#13;
counseling or accessing other options for treating mental health concerns&#13;
beyond medication alone: “I’ve never been offered therapy but I&#13;
have asked for information to try to get something done but I’ve never&#13;
received any replies . . . [The clinic manager] keeps telling me that there is&#13;
nothing that the institution can do with us because we are not going to be here&#13;
for a very long time,” said Itzya N., who at the time had already been&#13;
detained for more than four months.<a href="#_ftn253" name="_ftnref253" id="_ftnref253"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[253]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Her severe depression led the facility to twice place her on suicide watch and&#13;
to prescribe her increasingly strong doses of medication, but without a&#13;
complementary course of therapy, as she requested. Beatriz R., on the other&#13;
hand, said she had been told that counseling was available but was never able&#13;
to avail herself of it: “They say, ‘Oh, you can speak to a&#13;
counselor anytime you want.’ But they’re not there or they’re&#13;
busy. Before they said they would call me. I don’t know who the counselor&#13;
is. They never called me to talk with the counselor.”<a href="#_ftn254" name="_ftnref254" id="_ftnref254"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[254]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Several women who had suffered from depression or anxiety&#13;
told Human Rights Watch that they were dissuaded from even seeking help by the&#13;
knowledge that, at best, they would get medication but no counseling or&#13;
therapy.<a href="#_ftn255" name="_ftnref255" id="_ftnref255"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[255]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Others delayed or decided against reporting their mental health concerns out of&#13;
fear that they would face negative consequences.<a href="#_ftn256" name="_ftnref256" id="_ftnref256"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[256]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Maya Z. said that facility staff as well as other women detained at the&#13;
facility advised her to cope with her anxiety problems by herself because&#13;
bringing it to the attention of medical staff might result in a transfer to a&#13;
less desirable facility.<a href="#_ftn257" name="_ftnref257" id="_ftnref257"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[257]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Another woman found that the medical staff immediately interpreted a request to&#13;
speak with a psychologist as an indication of suicidal ideation. After her&#13;
request, the staff asked her if she wanted to kill herself, to which she&#13;
responded that she would rather be dead than have been taken into detention,&#13;
but that she had no intention of harming herself. She was immediately put on&#13;
lockdown for several days, which only compounded her distress and dissuaded her&#13;
from raising the issue again.<a href="#_ftn258" name="_ftnref258" id="_ftnref258"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[258]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The medical system’s focus on crisis intervention also&#13;
serves to exclude preventive care for individuals who develop depression and&#13;
anxiety in response to the experience of being detained. Women, both those who&#13;
have pre-existing mental health concerns and those who do not, face a host of&#13;
stressors brought on by detention. These may include separation from children&#13;
and family members who depend on them, uncertainty about whether they will be&#13;
allowed to remain in the country, trauma from their arrest, and the deprivation&#13;
of their liberty inside the facility. One DIHS healthcare provider acknowledged&#13;
to Human Rights Watch that detention does take a toll on mental well-being but&#13;
added that the medical staff has limited options for alleviating these&#13;
stressors before the situation degrades to the point where intervention by&#13;
mental health professionals is necessary.<a href="#_ftn259" name="_ftnref259" id="_ftnref259"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[259]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>These needs might be met through the assistance of a social&#13;
worker who could, for example, make inquiries into the well-being of separated&#13;
family members or contact deportation officers to discuss the case management&#13;
of individuals having a particularly negative response to detention. But the&#13;
women we spoke with pointed to even smaller interventions that, where&#13;
available, helped a great deal. Comparing two facilities, Nora S. said that at&#13;
the first one, a service processing center, they “had the heart to&#13;
help.” This, she explained, meant that “they would give us paper,&#13;
pens to write our families every day,” and offered her opportunities to&#13;
call her family, as opposed to the second facility, a contract detention&#13;
center, where she was unable to call her family for four weeks. “I mean&#13;
the fact that they were allowing people to communicate with families is&#13;
emotional support because it is very hard to be locked up,” Nora S. said.&#13;
The facility’s enabling them to reach family members meant that they “were&#13;
not abandoned.”<a href="#_ftn260" name="_ftnref260" id="_ftnref260"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[260]</span></span></span></span></a></p>

<h1><span>VI. Legal Standards</span></h1>
<h2><span>International Legal Standards</span></h2>
<p>Failures in the detention medical care system’s&#13;
response to women’s health concerns implicate fundamental human rights,&#13;
including international legal protections for the right to health, the right to&#13;
non-discrimination, and the rights of detained persons. A number of these&#13;
protections are enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political&#13;
Rights, the Convention against Torture, and the Convention on the Elimination&#13;
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, treaties which the US has ratified. The&#13;
right to health itself is articulated in the International Covenant on&#13;
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which the US has signed but not&#13;
yet ratified.</p>
<h3><span>The Right to Health</span></h3>
<p>By restricting coverage of basic women’s health&#13;
services, failing to ensure that appropriate care is delivered in a timely way,&#13;
and paying insufficient attention to the manner in which services are&#13;
delivered, ICE undermines the right to health of the women in its custody. The&#13;
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)&#13;
recognizes “the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest&#13;
attainable standard of physical and mental health.”<a href="#_ftn261" name="_ftnref261" id="_ftnref261"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[261]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The US, as a signatory, has an obligation not to undermine the object and purpose&#13;
of the treaty.<a href="#_ftn262" name="_ftnref262" id="_ftnref262"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[262]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The US is additionally committed to protecting the right to health as a member&#13;
of the United Nations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The&#13;
right to health is inseparable from provisions on the right to life and the right&#13;
to freedom from degrading treatment that are included in the International&#13;
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture, both&#13;
of which the US has ratified.<a href="#_ftn263" name="_ftnref263" id="_ftnref263"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[263]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the&#13;
body charged with interpreting and monitoring the implementation of the ICESCR,&#13;
has identified four essential components to the right to health: availability,&#13;
accessibility, acceptability and quality.<a href="#_ftn264" name="_ftnref264" id="_ftnref264"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[264]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The health care provided in US immigration detention is deficient in each of&#13;
these areas. Availability refers to the existence of health services, personnel,&#13;
and materials of a “sufficient quantity.”<a href="#_ftn265" name="_ftnref265" id="_ftnref265"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[265]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
ICE fails in this respect when women in custody seek professional services,&#13;
such as therapy for mental health issues or other specialist care, and&#13;
experience delays or denials due to medical staff shortages. In addition, the&#13;
Committee’s assessment of availability looks at essential drugs as&#13;
defined by the World Health Organization Action Programme on Essential Drugs.&#13;
This list includes hormonal contraception, which is not part of the DIHS&#13;
formulary. Moreover, the limitation on access to contraception infringes on&#13;
what the Committee has identified as a freedom encompassed in the right to&#13;
health: “the right to control one's health and body, including sexual and&#13;
reproductive freedom.”<a href="#_ftn266" name="_ftnref266" id="_ftnref266"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[266]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Accessibility as an element of the right to health breaks&#13;
down into four sub-parts: non-discrimination in access, physical accessibility,&#13;
economic accessibility, and information accessibility. The Committee on&#13;
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted that the governmental obligation&#13;
to respect the right to health includes "refraining from denying or&#13;
limiting equal access for all persons, including prisoners or detainees,&#13;
minorities, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, to preventive, curative and&#13;
palliative health services."<a href="#_ftn267" name="_ftnref267" id="_ftnref267"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[267]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The restricted scope of care available under the Covered Services package&#13;
limits access to a range of such services for individuals in ICE custody. With&#13;
respect to information accessibility, which includes the right to “seek,&#13;
receive and impart information and ideas concerning health issues,”<a href="#_ftn268" name="_ftnref268" id="_ftnref268"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[268]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
ICE falls short when it impedes women’s access to their health records&#13;
either by failing to transfer medical information between facilities or&#13;
stonewalling records requests. Also, by omitting options counseling in its&#13;
handling of pregnancy, ICE denies women access to information about the range&#13;
of health services that are legally available to them.</p>
<p>Regarding the acceptability of health services, ICE has an&#13;
obligation to ensure that the services it provides are “respectful of&#13;
medical ethics and culturally appropriate, i.e. respectful of the culture of&#13;
individuals, minorities, peoples and communities, sensitive to gender and life-cycle&#13;
requirements, as well as being designed to respect confidentiality and improve&#13;
the health status of those concerned.”<a href="#_ftn269" name="_ftnref269" id="_ftnref269"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[269]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In the interviews Human Rights Watch conducted, the issue of acceptability&#13;
emerged with inconsistencies in the use of translators for non-English&#13;
speakers, in the sophistication of the assessment of women’s experience&#13;
with violence, and in providers’ sensitivity to the impact of the&#13;
detention environment on individuals. Further, breaches of confidentiality in&#13;
the course of medication distribution and the use of security precautions that&#13;
intruded on the privacy of exams and treatment raised questions around the&#13;
observance of medical ethics.</p>
<p>ICE health care is also unsatisfactory in terms of quality.&#13;
Under the Committee’s analysis, quality refers to the appropriateness of&#13;
care by medical and scientific standards.<a href="#_ftn270" name="_ftnref270" id="_ftnref270"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[270]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
ICE policy diverges from standards of medical practice in the United States in&#13;
its approach to certain basic women’s health services, including Pap&#13;
smears and mammograms. In other areas, including services for nursing mothers,&#13;
failures at the level of policy implementation prevent women from accessing&#13;
care consistent with prevailing medical standards. In addition, by imposing few&#13;
requirements for professional accreditation on its facilities, ICE removes&#13;
itself from rigorous external evaluation of its operations that would help to&#13;
monitor the appropriateness of the care available.</p>
<p>In addition to falling short on benchmarks of availability,&#13;
accessibility, acceptability and quality, ICE’s performance on&#13;
safeguarding women’s health is also problematic under other international&#13;
legal standards. For example, the inconsistent care provided to pregnant women&#13;
in ICE custody raises issues under article 12 of the Convention on the Elimination&#13;
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, a treaty the US has signed but&#13;
not ratified. Article 12 obligates governments to “ensure to women&#13;
appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, confinement and the&#13;
post-natal period, granting free services where necessary, as well as adequate&#13;
nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.”<a href="#_ftn271" name="_ftnref271" id="_ftnref271"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[271]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Similar provisions regarding prenatal and postnatal care and support for&#13;
breastfeeding appear in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the US&#13;
has also signed but not ratified.<a href="#_ftn272" name="_ftnref272" id="_ftnref272"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[272]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Further, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination&#13;
against Women recommends, as one step toward assuring women equal access to&#13;
health care, that governments “establish or support services for victims&#13;
of family violence, rape, sex assault and other forms of gender-based violence,&#13;
including refuges, specially trained health workers, rehabilitation and counselling.”<a href="#_ftn273" name="_ftnref273" id="_ftnref273"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[273]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3><span>The Right to&#13;
Non-Discrimination</span></h3>
<p>Non-discrimination represents a central principle of&#13;
international human rights law.<a href="#_ftn274" name="_ftnref274" id="_ftnref274"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[274]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),&#13;
the US is obligated to guarantee effective protection against discrimination.<a href="#_ftn275" name="_ftnref275" id="_ftnref275"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[275]</span></span></span></span></a>The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms&#13;
of Discrimination against Women specifically mandates that states take action&#13;
to “eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in&#13;
order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, access to healthcare&#13;
services, including those related to family planning.”<a href="#_ftn276" name="_ftnref276" id="_ftnref276"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[276]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
While both men and women may experience deficiencies in the medical care&#13;
provided by ICE, certain deficiencies are discriminatory due to the&#13;
disproportionate impact they have on women. The lack of coverage for family&#13;
planning methods affects both sexes, but women are particularly affected&#13;
because the lack of services places them at risk of unintended pregnancy, along&#13;
with its accompanying health risks and many other profound consequences.&#13;
Further, women may be disproportionately affected by the limitations on&#13;
preventive and routine reproductive health care, for which women generally have&#13;
greater needs.<a href="#_ftn277" name="_ftnref277" id="_ftnref277"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[277]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3><span>The Rights of Individuals Deprived&#13;
of their Liberty</span></h3>
<p>Women taken into the custody of immigration authorities do&#13;
not lose their fundamental rights. The International Covenant on Civil and&#13;
Political Rights obligates states to ensure that “all persons deprived of&#13;
their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent&#13;
dignity of the human person.”<a href="#_ftn278" name="_ftnref278" id="_ftnref278"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[278]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
This, the UN Human Rights Committee has explained, entails a positive&#13;
obligation to see that those individuals suffer no “hardship or&#13;
constraint other than that resulting from the deprivation of liberty; respect&#13;
for the dignity of such persons must be guaranteed under the same conditions as&#13;
for that of free persons. Persons deprived of their liberty enjoy all the&#13;
rights set forth in the Covenant, subject to the restrictions that are&#13;
unavoidable in a closed environment.”<a href="#_ftn279" name="_ftnref279" id="_ftnref279"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[279]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>There is no doubt that both the humiliating treatment of&#13;
women in ICE custody, and the lack of access to routine health services are far&#13;
from unavoidable, and can be traced to policy choices well within the power of&#13;
the government to change. Human Rights Watch’s investigation revealed&#13;
that the treatment of women in ICE custody is often humiliating and at times&#13;
crosses the line into cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Unnecessary use&#13;
of restraints and strip searches, arbitrary restrictions on sanitary supplies,&#13;
and insufficient privacy during medical examinations undermine the dignity of&#13;
women in detention. The right to a basic level of healthcare in detention is&#13;
fundamental to maintaining human dignity and too often is not afforded to women&#13;
in ICE custody.</p>
<p>Addressing a concern specific to women in detention, the&#13;
Human Rights Committee has advised states that “Pregnant women who are&#13;
deprived of their liberty should receive humane treatment and respect for their&#13;
inherent dignity at all times, and in particular during the birth and while&#13;
caring for their newborn children; States parties should report on facilities&#13;
to ensure this and on medical and health care for such mothers and their&#13;
babies.”<a href="#_ftn280" name="_ftnref280" id="_ftnref280"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[280]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In this respect, ICE’s policy permitting shackling of pregnant women is&#13;
at odds with a growing international consensus against the use physical&#13;
restraints on women during pregnancy, delivery, and the immediate postnatal&#13;
period. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or&#13;
Degrading Treatment or Punishment has described pregnant women being shackled&#13;
or otherwise restrained as “completely unacceptable, and could certainly&#13;
be qualified as inhuman and degrading treatment.”<a href="#_ftn281" name="_ftnref281" id="_ftnref281"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[281]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The Human Rights Committee commented on the continuation of this practice in&#13;
the United States in its concluding observations to the country’s second&#13;
and third periodic reports in June of 2006 and recommended that the government “prohibit&#13;
the shackling of detained women during childbirth.”<a href="#_ftn282" name="_ftnref282" id="_ftnref282"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[282]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Finally, ineffective grievance procedures and the Department&#13;
of Homeland Security’s failure to convert the ICE detention standards into&#13;
enforceable regulations impede detainees in enforcing their rights. The ICCPR,&#13;
article 2.1, requires that states parties undertake to “ensure” the&#13;
Covenant’s rights to all persons within their territory. Without an&#13;
effective remedy for the violation of the right to dignity, the enjoyment of&#13;
the right cannot be guaranteed. The Human Rights Committee, which interprets&#13;
the ICCPR and evaluates state compliance, has urged states to specify in their&#13;
reports whether individuals in detention “have access to such information&#13;
and have effective legal means enabling them to ensure that those rules are&#13;
respected, to complain if the rules are ignored and to obtain adequate&#13;
compensation in the event of a violation.”<a href="#_ftn283" name="_ftnref283" id="_ftnref283"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[283]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h3><span>Defining a standard of care</span></h3>
<p>The basic international healthcare standard for individuals&#13;
in state custody is that such persons are entitled to at least comparable&#13;
services and care as those who are at liberty. The principle of equivalence,&#13;
articulated in the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted by&#13;
the UN General Assembly in 1990, holds that:</p>
<blockquote>Except for those limitations that are demonstrably&#13;
necessitated by the fact of incarceration, all prisoners shall retain the human&#13;
rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the Universal Declaration of Human&#13;
Rights, and where the State concerned is a party, the International Covenant on&#13;
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil&#13;
and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol thereto, as well as such other&#13;
rights as are set out in other United Nations covenants... Prisoners shall have&#13;
access to the health services available in the country without discrimination&#13;
on the grounds of their legal situation.<a href="#_ftn284" name="_ftnref284" id="_ftnref284"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[284]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the UN principles on the ethical&#13;
responsibilities of healthcare providers, health professionals should provide&#13;
individuals imprisoned or detained with the same quality and standard of care&#13;
as those who are not imprisoned or detained.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><a href="#_ftn285" name="_ftnref285" id="_ftnref285"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[285]</span></span></a></span></span>&#13;
This suggests that the appropriate standard for DIHS should be a level of&#13;
physical and mental health care equivalent to that available in the community,&#13;
a bar much higher than the standard embodied in the Covered Services Package or&#13;
even the new ICE medical standard.<a href="#_ftn286" name="_ftnref286" id="_ftnref286"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[286]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<h2><span>Domestic Legal Standards</span></h2>
<p>The US Constitution establishes a right to medical care for&#13;
individuals in government custody. The eighth amendment prohibition on cruel&#13;
and unusual punishments entitles individuals convicted of crimes to medical&#13;
care. However, since immigration detention is not punitive, the right to medical&#13;
care for individuals held by ICE derives from the fifth amendment, which states&#13;
that no person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without&#13;
due process of law.”<a href="#_ftn287" name="_ftnref287" id="_ftnref287"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[287]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Despite the difference in constitutional origin, the rationale behind both protections&#13;
lies in the custodial responsibility assumed by the state when it deprives the&#13;
individual of liberty:</p>
<blockquote>[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody and holds&#13;
him there against his will, the Constitution&#13;
imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his&#13;
safety and general well-being. The rationale for this principle is simple&#13;
enough: when the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an&#13;
individual's liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the&#13;
same time fails to provide for his basic human needs—<i>e.g.,</i> food,&#13;
clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—it transgresses&#13;
the substantive limits on state action set by the Eighth Amendment and the Due&#13;
Process Clause.<a href="#_ftn288" name="_ftnref288" id="_ftnref288"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[288]</span></span></span></span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>The government does not escape this duty when it engages a&#13;
contractor to provide detention services. The US Supreme Court has held that “Contracting&#13;
out prison medical care does not relieve the State of its constitutional duty&#13;
to provide adequate medical treatment to those in its custody, and it does not&#13;
deprive the State's prisoners of the means to vindicate their Eighth Amendment&#13;
rights.”<a href="#_ftn289" name="_ftnref289" id="_ftnref289"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[289]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>In addition, the scope of the protection for individuals&#13;
held by ICE in civil custody may exceed that afforded to convicted individuals.&#13;
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an individual confined&#13;
awaiting adjudication under civil process cannot be punished and that&#13;
punishment occurs where “the individual is detained under conditions&#13;
identical to, similar to, or more restrictive than those under which pretrial&#13;
criminal detainees are held.”<a href="#_ftn290" name="_ftnref290" id="_ftnref290"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[290]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Thus, as another court held, “persons in non-punitive detention have a&#13;
right to ‘reasonable medical care,’ a standard demonstrably higher&#13;
than the Eighth Amendment standard.”<a href="#_ftn291" name="_ftnref291" id="_ftnref291"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[291]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
However, in the absence of case law specific to immigration, applications of&#13;
the eighth amendment protection provide guidance on at least the very minimum&#13;
that the constitution requires ICE to provide.</p>
<p>In <i>Estelle v. Gamble</i>, the landmark case defining&#13;
custodial responsibility for medical care, the US Supreme Court held that the&#13;
eighth amendment prohibits “deliberate indifference” on the part of&#13;
detention authorities to a “serious medical need” of a prisoner in&#13;
their custody.<a href="#_ftn292" name="_ftnref292" id="_ftnref292"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[292]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
Federal courts have had several occasions to apply the <i>Estelle</i> standard&#13;
to specific women’s rights concerns and, in some cases,&#13;
reached differing results. The entire US Court of Appeals for the Eighth&#13;
Circuit has granted a rehearing to determine the constitutionality of shackling&#13;
a woman during labor, after a three-judge panel of that court held that the&#13;
practice did not constitute deliberate indifference to her serious medical&#13;
need.<a href="#_ftn293" name="_ftnref293" id="_ftnref293"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[293]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The US District Court for the District of Columbia has already banned the&#13;
practice, holding that shackling during labor and shortly thereafter is&#13;
“inhumane” and constitutionally impermissible.<a href="#_ftn294" name="_ftnref294" id="_ftnref294"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[294]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
In the area of abortion rights, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has&#13;
recognized access to elective, non-therapeutic abortions as a serious medical&#13;
need.<a href="#_ftn295" name="_ftnref295" id="_ftnref295"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[295]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
While disagreeing with the finding of a serious medical need, the Eighth&#13;
Circuit nonetheless invalidated a ban on transporting incarcerated women for&#13;
abortion on the basis of its unreasonable restriction on a woman’s right&#13;
to abortion under the fourteenth amendment.<a href="#_ftn296" name="_ftnref296" id="_ftnref296"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[296]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The obligation to ensure that incarceration does not force a woman to forfeit&#13;
her constitutional right to abortion has also been interpreted to include&#13;
ensuring access to funding for the procedure.<a href="#_ftn297" name="_ftnref297" id="_ftnref297"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[297]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>In a notable 1994 case, the US District Court in the&#13;
District of Columbia found that inadequate obstetrical and gynecological care&#13;
at a correctional treatment facility violated the division of the DC Code&#13;
governing the treatment of prisoners, which the court described as a&#13;
codification of the common law rule that prison officials have a duty of&#13;
reasonable care in the protection and safekeeping of individuals who are&#13;
imprisoned. Stating that “in the area of medical care, physicians owe the&#13;
same standard of care to prisoners as physicians owe to private patients&#13;
generally,” the court found that inadequate gynecological examination and&#13;
testing, STD testing, follow up care, health education, and prenatal care&#13;
violated the law.<a href="#_ftn298" name="_ftnref298" id="_ftnref298"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[298]</span></span></span></span></a></p>

<h1><span>VII. Recommendations</span></h1>
<h2>To the Division of Immigration Health Services</h2>
<h3>General Policy Recommendations</h3>
<ul><li>Amend the Covered Services Package to remove inappropriate&#13;
     consideration of an individual’s deportation prospects in&#13;
     determining eligibility for medical procedures and harmonize the package&#13;
     with the revised ICE medical standard so that detained individuals can&#13;
     access a full continuum of health services, whether available inside or&#13;
     outside the detention facility.</li>
<li>Create mechanisms to improve the timeliness of response to&#13;
     the health care needs of individuals in ICE custody and to their submission&#13;
     of complaints.</li>
<li>Recruit qualified health professionals to maintain a&#13;
     sufficient number of medical staff at facilities to address the nationwide&#13;
     shortages.</li>
<li>Ensure that individuals in custody can request translation&#13;
     during their medical visits and are advised of their right to do so.</li>
<li>Increase the number of qualified staff reviewing Treatment&#13;
     Authorization Requests to remove bottlenecks that cause delays in&#13;
     treatment.</li>
<li>Ensure that the pursuit of cost savings does not override&#13;
     the medical needs of the patients in the consideration of Treatment&#13;
     Authorization Requests.</li>
<li>Improve the screening for sexual and gender-based violence&#13;
     according to Family Violence Prevention Fund and WHO guidance.<a href="#_ftn299" name="_ftnref299" id="_ftnref299"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[299]</span></span></span></span></a>
</li>
<li>Encourage facilities to establish partnerships with&#13;
     community organizations that provide services to survivors of sexual and&#13;
     gender-based violence to increase women’s access to services during&#13;
     and following their period of detention.</li>
<li>Encourage facilities to establish partnerships with&#13;
     community organizations to ensure that detainees receive referrals for&#13;
     medical care after detention.</li>
</ul><h3>Women’s Health Policy Recommendations</h3>
<ul><li>Amend the Covered Services Package to ensure coverage for&#13;
     Pap smears and mammograms for screening purposes according to community&#13;
     standards.</li>
<li>Amend the Covered Services Package to provide coverage for&#13;
     family planning services and ensure that detention center formularies&#13;
     stock contraceptives, including emergency contraceptive pills.</li>
<li>Expand mental healthcare options for individuals detained&#13;
     to include scheduled, non-emergency counseling visits with a mental health&#13;
     professional.</li>
</ul><h3>Implementation and Training Recommendations</h3>
<ul><li>Conduct intensive outreach to facilities to ensure that&#13;
     both health professionals and security personnel are aware that the men&#13;
     and women in their custody are entitled to the same level of medical care&#13;
     as individuals who are not detained and assure health professionals that&#13;
     ICE and DIHS policies are intended to support and not inhibit their&#13;
     delivery of care consistent with standards of medical practice in the&#13;
     United States.</li>
<li>Ensure that all facility medical staff conducting intake&#13;
     examinations are aware of the jurisdiction’s legal standards and&#13;
     ICE’s policy on access to abortion. Require staff to apprise women&#13;
     testing positive for pregnancy that they have legal rights regarding the&#13;
     continuation or termination of their pregnancy, and refer women who have&#13;
     questions about access to abortion for a consultation with a licensed&#13;
     abortion provider.</li>
<li>Ensure that facilities have ready access to breast pumps&#13;
     and are aware of their duty to offer them to nursing mothers who come into&#13;
     custody.</li>
<li>Provide training to medical staff conducting intake&#13;
     examinations on the manifestations of trauma in women and appropriate&#13;
     techniques for talking about sexual and gender-based violence.</li>
</ul><h2>To Immigration and Customs Enforcement</h2>
<h3>General policy improvements</h3>
<ul><li>Require all facilities holding individuals on behalf of&#13;
     ICE to maintain accreditation with the National Commission on Correctional&#13;
     Health Care. </li>
<li>Improve precautions to protect the privacy of&#13;
     individuals’ medical examinations, including by requiring security&#13;
     personnel to remain outside the exam room in the absence of extraordinary&#13;
     security concerns.</li>
<li>Amend the detention standards to require that certified&#13;
     health professionals conduct medical intake screening.</li>
<li>Amend the detention standards to require that individuals&#13;
     receive their complete medical records on release or deportation and to&#13;
     mandate that the full medical record accompany individuals who are&#13;
     transferred between facilities, regardless of whether DIHS operates the&#13;
     facilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Improvements in the treatment of women</h3>
<ul><li>Implement the recommendations of the UN special rapporteur&#13;
     on the human rights of migrants, including in particular the&#13;
     recommendations that ICE develop gender-specific detention standards with&#13;
     attention to the medical and mental health needs of women survivors of&#13;
     violence and refrain from detaining women who are suffering the effects of&#13;
     persecution or abuse, or who are pregnant or nursing infants.<a href="#_ftn300" name="_ftnref300" id="_ftnref300"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[300]</span></span></span></span></a>
</li>
<li>Incorporate into the ICE medical standard the American&#13;
     Public Health Association’s standards on women’s health care&#13;
     in correctional institutions and the recommendations of the National&#13;
     Commission on Correctional Health Care’s policy statement on women’s&#13;
     health care.<a href="#_ftn301" name="_ftnref301" id="_ftnref301"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[301]</span></span></span></span></a>
</li>
<li>Establish a formal process for ICE officers charged with&#13;
     case management to coordinate with health services personnel to ensure&#13;
     that nursing mothers, pregnant women, and other women with significant&#13;
     health concerns are immediately identified and considered for parole.</li>
<li>Amend the ICE detention standard on the use of force to&#13;
     specifically prohibit the shackling of women during pregnancy, delivery,&#13;
     and in the immediate postnatal period.</li>
<li>Consider the availability of specialist services for&#13;
     obstetrics and gynecology in the surrounding community when determining&#13;
     the suitability of facilities for the detention of women.</li>
<li>Require that facilities make sanitary pads and other&#13;
     materials and facilities necessary for cleanliness and dignity available&#13;
     without restriction.</li>
</ul><h3>Implementation of existing and improved polices</h3>
<ul><li>Improve the current system for receiving and tracking&#13;
     complaints made by individuals in ICE custody. Ensure that all individuals&#13;
     receive notice of complaint procedures in their native languages and that&#13;
     they are informed of the availability of these mechanisms for addressing&#13;
     medical care complaints.</li>
<li>Provide public notice of penalties imposed on facilities&#13;
     for violations of the detention standard.</li>
<li>Insist that private contractors engaged to monitor&#13;
     facility compliance with detention standards include professionals with&#13;
     medical expertise in the review of compliance with the medical standard.&#13;
     Provide copies of the private contractors’ findings to oversight&#13;
     committees in Congress.</li>
</ul><h2>To the US Department of Homeland Security</h2>
<ul><li>Convert the ICE detention standards, including the ICE&#13;
     medical standard, into federal administrative regulations so that they&#13;
     have the strength of law and detained individuals and their advocates will&#13;
     be able to have recourse to courts to redress shortfalls in health care.</li>
<li>Require detention facilities to provide regular reports to&#13;
     the DHS Office of Inspector General detailing the number of grievances&#13;
     received regarding medical care and their disposition at the facility&#13;
     level.</li>
<li>Designate a focal point for the protection of the rights&#13;
     of women in immigration detention within the DHS’s Office for Civil&#13;
     Rights and Civil Liberties.</li>
</ul><h2>To the US Congress</h2>
<ul><li>Pass legislation to require that all individuals in&#13;
     immigration detention have access to medical care that meets standards of&#13;
     medical practice in the United States.</li>
<li>Establish a commission of independent experts to examine&#13;
     the status of the ICE medical system and identify means of ensuring that immigrants&#13;
     in ICE custody have access to medical care that meets standards of medical&#13;
     practice in the United States.</li>
<li>Require ICE to provide relevant congressional oversight&#13;
     committees with the reviews of facility compliance with ICE detention&#13;
     standards completed by private contractors. Require DIHS to provide&#13;
     oversight committees with any future analyses of the cost savings&#13;
     generated by denying treatment authorization requests.</li>

In addition to this project, Human Rights Watch undertook research on two other&#13;
topics related to immigration detention in the US: transfers within immigration&#13;
detention and parole of asylum seekers under a policy directive introduced in&#13;
November 2007. Research into the other subjects was conducted by other&#13;
researchers, and included visits to certain facilities identified for this&#13;
project as well as other facilities.</p></div>
<div id="ftn4"><p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" id="_ftn4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span></a>&#13;
The ten facilities were Broward Transitional Center, Pompano Beach, Florida;&#13;
West Palm Beach County Jail, West Palm Beach, Florida; Glades County Jail,&#13;
Moore Haven, Florida; Monroe County Detention Center, Key West, Florida; South&#13;
Texas Detention Complex, Pearsall, Texas; Willacy Detention Center,&#13;
Raymondville, Texas; Port Isabel Service Processing Center, Los Fresnos, Texas;&#13;
Eloy Detention Center, Eloy, Arizona; Pinal County Jail, Florence, Arizona; and&#13;
Central Arizona Detention Center, Florence, Arizona. We also visited and talked&#13;
with health care providers at Krome Service Processing Center in Miami,&#13;
Florida. Krome, which does not hold women, provided a point of comparison for&#13;
our visits to the other facilities. In later research conducted separately from&#13;
the agreement with ICE, we visited an additional county jail in New Jersey that&#13;
holds women in ICE custody.</p></div>

ICE informed Human Rights Watch that West Palm Beach County Jail in Florida&#13;
declined the visit. No explanation for the refusal was given. Because the jail&#13;
is designated by ICE to hold individuals for less than 72 hours, it is not&#13;
subject to the detention standards. However, Human Rights Watch had requested&#13;
the visit upon hearing that individuals in ICE custody did in fact spend more&#13;
than 72 hours at the jail and that conditions there were especially poor.</p></div>

For example, from 1997 to 2000 the Vera Institute of Justice cooperated with&#13;
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a predecessor to ICE, to pilot an&#13;
alternative to detention model called the Appearance Assistance Program.&#13;
Through the AAP, individuals in immigration proceedings participated in a&#13;
supervised release system wherein they regularly reported to a case manager and&#13;
were provided with information on their legal rights and referrals to community&#13;
resources. The Vera Institute reported that 91 percent of participants in the&#13;
intensive supervision program appeared for all of their required hearings.&#13;

June 16, 2004, pp. 6-7. The new ICE medical standard requires that the medical&#13;
provider ensure that all relevant medical records accompany an individual who&#13;
is transferred or released. ICE/DRO Detention Standard: Medical Care, December&#13;
2, 2008, p. 19. However, the new ICE transfer standard differentiates transfers&#13;
to facilities not operated by DIHS (state and county jails and some contract&#13;
detention facilities) from those to facilities within the DIHS system, stating&#13;
that a transfer summary will accompany an individual transferred to facilities&#13;
not operated by DIHS , while a transfer summary and “the official health&#13;
records” will accompany an individual transferred within the DIHS system.&#13;

“The DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package primarily&#13;
provides health care services for emergency care … Other medical&#13;
conditions which the physician believes, if left untreated during the period of&#13;
ICE/BP custody, would cause deterioration of the detainee’s health or&#13;
uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation status will be assessed&#13;
and evaluated for care.” DIHS Covered Services Package, 2005, p.1. As&#13;
noted in the summary, some officials have argued this language is broadly&#13;
interpreted, but other official statements and accounts of the policy in&#13;
practice indicate that this policy does significantly limit the scope of care.</p></div>

receiving a Pap smear screening is reflected in the Covered Services Package as&#13;

on the detainee's past history, family history, current medical conditions, or&#13;
reported lifestyle. Local operating procedures provide specific indications for&#13;
performing pelvic examination.” DIHS Policies and Procedures Manual, sec.&#13;

Some have argued that states may in fact have an elevated responsibility to&#13;
ensure medical care for individuals in detention based upon the custodial&#13;
relationship the state assumes when it deprives them of their liberty and their&#13;
options to provide for their own health care.The duty to ensure a&#13;
higher level of care for detained persons than that available in the community&#13;
may apply with particular force to conditions created or exacerbated by&#13;
detention conditions, such as mental health concerns. See Rick Lines,&#13;
“From equivalence of standards to equivalence of objectives: the&#13;
entitlement of prisoners to standards of health higher than those outside&#13;
prisons,“ <i>International Journal of Prisoner Health</i>, vol. 2 (2006),&#13;

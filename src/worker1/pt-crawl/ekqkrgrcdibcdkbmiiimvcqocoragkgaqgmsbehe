<BR><BR>

<P> <I> The Chronicon Paschale is a chronicle which was written in about 630 A.D. It is an important source of information about the Byzantine Empire of that time, but for earlier periods it concentrates on sacred (Jewish) history.  It also contains a list of <A HREF="consuls.html">Roman consuls</A>, which is not translated here.</I>

<P> <I> Translated from Dindorf's text (in Migne, PG.92; the references in <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">red</FONT> are the page numbers of that edition). A copy of PG.92, with the Greek text and a Latin translation, can be found in <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=7qEcpMZcnocC&pg=PA419">Google Books</A>.</I>

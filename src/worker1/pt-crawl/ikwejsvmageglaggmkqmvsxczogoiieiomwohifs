/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

          Evolutionist (1823-1848)</font></b>
        
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), English 
        naturalist, evolutionist, geographer, anthropologist, and social critic 
        and theorist, was born 8 January 1823 at Usk, Gwent (now, and at the time 
        of Wallace's birth, Monmouthshire). He was the third of four sons and 
        eighth of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell, 
        a middle-class English couple of modest means. The older Wallace was of 
        Scottish descent (reputedly, of a line leading back to the famous William 
        Wallace of medieval times); the Greenells were a relatively unremarkable 
        but respectable English family who had lived in the Hertford area for 
        generations. Thomas Wallace had trained for the law (and actually was 
        sworn in as an attorney in 1792) but never practiced, income from inherited 
        property securing him a life of leisure for the first fifteen years of 
        his adulthood. With his marriage in 1807 things quickly changed, however, 
        and he was forced into the first of what would turn out to be a long series 
        of relatively unsuccessful ventures, including the publication of a literary 
        magazine. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Alfred's childhood was a happy 
        one, but at times difficult for lack of money. Four of his five older 
        sisters did not live beyond the age of twenty-two, and Wallace himself 
        was not always in the best of health. The Wallaces left Usk for Hertford 
        when Alfred was only five. He found the grammar school he attended there 
        rather tedious, but for a time was privy to plenty of good reading materials, 
        his father being a town librarian for some years. About 1835 the elder 
        Wallace was swindled out of his remaining property and the family fell 
        on really hard times; young Wallace was forced to withdraw from school 
        around Christmas 1836 and was sent to London to room with his older brother 
        John. The ensuing several month experience was critical to his future 
        intellectual development, as there he first came into contact with supporters 
        of the utopian socialist Robert Owen. In his autobiography <i>My Life</i> 
        (S729) he recollects that he even once heard Owen himself speak; from 
        that point on he would describe himself in disciple terms. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By mid 1837 he had left London to join 
        the eldest brother, William, in Bedfordshire. William owned a surveying 
        business, and Wallace was to learn the trade. In 1839 he was temporarily 
        apprenticed to a watchmaker, but by the end of the year he was again working 
        with William, now based in Hereford. Over the next several years he picked 
        up a number of trades-related skills and knowledge, particularly in drafting 
        and map-making, geometry and trigonometry, building design and construction, 
        mechanics, and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, he discovered that he 
        really enjoyed the outdoor work involved in surveying. Soon he was starting 
        to take an interest in the natural history of his surroundings, especially 
        its botany, geology, and astronomy. While working in the area of the Hereford 
        town of Kington in 1841 he became associated with the newly-formed Mechanic's 
        Institution there; some months later, after moving over to the Welsh town 
        of Neath, he began attending lectures given by the members of that area's 
        various scientific societies. He also involved himself with the Neath 
        Mechanics Institute, eventually giving his own lectures there on various 
        technical and natural history subjects. The early 1840s also witnessed 
        his first writing efforts: an essay (<a href="S001A.htm">S1a</a>) on the 
        disposition of mechanics institutes written about 1841 found its way into 
        a history of Kington published in 1845; two of his other essays from this 
        early period (<a href="S001.htm">S1</a> and <a href="S623.htm">S623</a>) 
        are discussed in his 1905 autobiography <i>My Life</i> (S729). 
      </p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In late 1843 a slow work period forced 
          William Wallace to let his brother go. Alfred decided to apply for an 
          open position at the Collegiate School in Leicester, where he was hired 
          on as a master to teach drafting, surveying, English, and arithmetic. 
          Now commenced another period central to his future path. Leicester had some good libraries, and Wallace was able to find and digest 
          several important works on natural history and systematics; moreover, 
          sometime during the year 1844 he made the acquaintance of another young 
          amateur naturalist, Henry Walter Bates. Bates, though two years younger 
          than Wallace, was already an accomplished entomologist, and his collections 
          and collecting activities soon captured Wallace's interest. Around the 
          same time Wallace saw his first demonstration of the practice of mesmerism, 
          then dismissed by most as illusion or trickery. On investigating, however, 
          he found he could personally reproduce many of the effects he had seen 
          exhibited on stage, and learned his &quot;first great lesson in the inquiry 
          into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief 
          of great men, or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as 
          of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other 
          men admittedly sane and honest&quot; (<a href="S478.htm">S478</a>). 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February of 1845 his brother William 
          died unexpectedly and Wallace quit his teaching job at Leicester to 
          return to surveying, now going through a boom period. But he soon found 
          that running the business, even with the help of his brother John, involved 
          responsibilities (such as fee collection) that he hated. He still had 
          enough spare time, however, to continue with his natural history-related 
          activities, and was even made a curator of the Neath Philosophical and 
          Literary Institute's museum. He also kept up a correspondence with his 
          friend Bates. A new book by William H. Edwards entitled <i>A Voyage 
          Up the River Amazon</i> suggested a way out of his situation: he would 
          turn professional and launch a self-sustaining natural history collecting 
          expedition to South America. Bates was enlisted (undoubtedly with little 
          effort), and the two young men (at the time Wallace was 25 and Bates 
          23) left for Par&aacute; (now called Bel&eacute;m), at the mouth of 
          the Amazon, on 25 April 1848.
      </p><p align="left"><a name="path2" id="path2"></a><b><font size="+1">Travels in the Amazon 
          and Malay Archipelago (1848-1862)</font></b>
        
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 28 May 1848 Wallace and Bates disembarked 
        at Par&aacute; and began to organize their operations. At first they worked 
        as a team, but in March 1850 or perhaps as much as eighteen months earlier 
        they split up (for reasons that have never been clarified). Wallace centered 
        his activities in the middle Amazon and Rio Negro regions; Bates would 
        remain in Amazonian South America eleven years, securing his permanent 
        reputation as a leading naturalist and entomologist, and contributing 
        significantly to the early development of the theory of natural selection 
        through his elucidation of the concept of mimetic resemblance--&quot;Batesian 
        mimicry&quot;--and various writings on biogeography. Wallace managed to ascend 
        the Rio Negro system farther than anyone else had to that point, and drafted 
        a map of the Rio Negro region that proved accurate enough to become the 
        standard for many years (the map was published as a part of <a href="S011.htm">S11</a>). 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from playing the role of collector 
        and explorer, Wallace had an overriding reason for coming to the Amazon: 
        to investigate the causes of organic evolution. His contacts with the 
        Owenists had left him with an early interest in social/societal evolution, 
        an interest that had extended itself in the direction of natural science 
        with his mid-1840s readings of two crucial works: Charles Lyell's <i>Principles 
        of Geology</i>, and Robert Chambers's <i>Vestiges of the Natural History 
        of Creation</i>. Lyell's work had become the bible of uniformitarianism, 
        and instilled in Wallace an appreciation of how long-term change could 
        be effected through the operation of slow, ongoing processes. <i>Vestiges</i> 
        was an early, popular, effort to examine the notion of biological evolution; 
        it was a bit short on its appreciation of mechanism but argued pursuasively 
        against both Creationism and Lamarckism. Wallace was apparently an instant 
        convert to the feature arguments of each work, and very quickly recognized 
        how he might go about demonstrating that evolution did in fact take place: 
        by tracing out, over time and space, the geographical/geological records 
        of individual phylogenies. He soon focused on two particular elements 
        of this study: (1) the way geography limited or facilitated the extension 
        of species range, and (2) how ecological station seemed to influence the 
        shaping of adaptations more than did closeness of affinity with other 
        forms. His investigation of these subjects included efforts to come to 
        grips with the region's ornithology, entomology, primatology, ichthyology, 
        botany, and physical geography, but in the end he was unable to come to 
        any conclusion about the actual mechanism of evolutionary change. He also 
        spent much time studying the ways of the native peoples he worked among, 
        including collecting vocabularies of many of their languages (<a href="bib4.htm#zS714">S714</a>). 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By early 1852 Wallace was in ill health 
          and in no condition to proceed any further. He decided to quit South 
          America, and began the long trip back down the Rio Negro and Amazon 
          to Par&aacute;. When he finally reached the town on the 2nd of July, 
          he found that his younger brother Herbert had died. Herbert had been 
          working in the area since 1849, but in 1851 tried to return to England 
          from Par&aacute;, where he caught yellow fever. Moreover, and further 
          to Wallace's dismay, most of the collections from the preceding two 
          years he had been forwarding down the Amazon had been delayed at the 
          dock at Barra do Rio Negro (Manaus) through a misunderstanding; he would 
          therefore have to secure passage for these as well as himself. Within 
          a few days he had been successful in so doing, and soon set out for 
          England. Unfortunately, on the 6th of August the brig on which he was 
          sailing caught fire and sank, taking almost all of his possessions--including 
          some live animals--along with it. For ten days Wallace and his comrades 
          struggled to survive in a pair of badly leaking lifeboats, then were 
          sighted and picked up by a passing cargo ship also making its way back 
          to England. As luck would have it this vessel was also old and slow, 
          and itself nearly foundered when hit by a series of storms. In all, 
          Wallace's ocean crossing took eighty days. 
        
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Wallace stepped back on English 
        soil on 1 October 1852, he was faced with some decisions. His collections 
        had been insured, but only to an extent buying him some time. He was now 
        twenty-nine and reasonably well-known as a travelling naturalist, but 
        he had not been able to come up with the key to the mystery of organic 
        change. Further, he now had no collections he could study at his leisure 
        that might help him do so. For eighteen months his activities were mixed: 
        a vacation in Switzerland, attending professional meetings and delivering 
        papers, and, finally, the production of two books: <i>Palm Trees of the 
        Amazon and Their Uses</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS713">S713</a>) and <i>A 
        Narrative of Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS714">S714</a>). 
        These made a slight but generally positive impression; the first was an 
        ethnobotanical study based in part on drawings he had managed to save 
        from the ship's fire; the second, a pleasant but not terribly profound 
        account of his four years' work and travels. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no other prospects immediately apparent, 
        Wallace decided to carry on with his collecting activities. He chose the 
        Indonesian Archipelago for his next base of operations, using his record 
        of accomplishments to that point to secure a grant from the Royal Geographical 
        Society to cover his passage to what was referred to in those days as 
        &quot;the Malay Archipelago.&quot; He arrived in Singapore on 20 April 1854, to 
        begin what would turn out to be the defining period of his life. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's name is now inextricably linked 
        with his travels in the Indonesian region. He spent nearly eight full 
        years there; during that period he undertook about seventy different expeditions 
        resulting in a combined total of around 14,000 miles of travel. He visited 
        every important island in the archipelago at least once, and several on 
        multiple occasions. His collecting efforts produced the astonishing total 
        of 125,660 specimens, including more than a thousand species new to science. 
        The volume he later wrote describing his work and experiences there, <i>The 
        Malay Archipelago</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS715">S715</a>), is the most 
        celebrated of all writings on Indonesia, and ranks with a small handful 
        of other works as one of the nineteenth century's best scientific travel 
        books. Highlights of his adventures there include his study and capture 
        of birds-of-paradise and orangutans, his many dealings with native peoples, 
        and his residence on New Guinea (he was one of the very first Europeans 
        to live there for any extended period). 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond his travel and collecting activities, 
        Wallace's time in the Malay Archipelago was marked, of course, by the 
        1858 event that would assure his place in history. Three years earlier 
        he had still been cogitating on the causes of organic evolution when an 
        article by another naturalist prompted him to write and publish the essay 
        'On the Law Which Has Regulated the Introduction of New Species' (<a href="bib1.htm#zS020">S20</a>), 
        a theoretical work that all but stated outright Wallace's belief in evolution. 
        The paper was seen by Lyell, who thought highly of it and brought it to 
        Darwin's attention. Darwin, however, took relatively little notice. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he had a provisional model of 
        the relation of biogeography to organic change, Wallace quickly applied 
        the related concepts in two further studies, published in 1856 and 1857 
        (<a href="S026.htm">S26</a> &amp; <a href="S038.htm">S38</a>). 
        In February of 1858, while suffering from an attack of malaria in the 
        Moluccas (it is not fully certain which island he was actually on, though 
        either Gilolo or Ternate seems the likely candidate), Wallace suddenly, 
        and rather unexpectedly, connected the ideas of Thomas Malthus on the 
        limits to population growth to a mechanism that might ensure long-term 
        organic change. This was the concept of the &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; 
        in which those individual organisms that are best adapted to their local 
        surroundings are seen to have a better chance of surviving, and thus of 
        differentially passing along their traits to progeny. Excited over his 
        discovery, Wallace penned an essay on the subject as soon as he was well 
        enough to do so, and sent it off to Darwin. He had begun a correspondence 
        with Darwin two years earlier and knew that he was generally interested 
        in &quot;the species question&quot;; perhaps Darwin would be kind enough to bring 
        the work, titled 'On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely 
        From the Original Type,' (<a href="bib1.htm#zS043">S43</a>) to the attention 
        of Lyell? Darwin was in fact willing to do so, but not for any reasons 
        Wallace had anticipated. Darwin, as the now well-known story goes, had 
        been entertaining very similar ideas for going on twenty years, and now 
        a threat to his priority on the subject loomed. He contacted Lyell to 
        plead for advice on how to meet what just about anyone would have to admit 
        was a very awkward situation. Lyell and Joseph Hooker, a prominent botanist 
        and another of Darwin's close friends, decided to present Wallace's essay, 
        along with some unpublished fragments from Darwin's writings on the subject, 
        to the next meeting of the Linnean Society. This took place on 1 July 
        1858, without obtaining Wallace's permission first (he was contacted only 
        after the fact). 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever one thinks about Wallace's 
          treatment in this matter, the events of summer 1858 did ensure that 
          the world wouldn't have to wait any longer for its introduction to the 
          concept of natural selection. Darwin had been working on a much larger 
          tome on the subject that was still many years away from completion (and 
          in fact never was completed); Wallace's bombshell had the immediate 
          effect of forcing him to get together a more compact, readable, and, 
          ultimately, probably more successful work. <i>On the Origin of Species</i> 
          was published less than eighteen months later, in November of 1859. 
          And, although Darwin would overshadow Wallace from that point on, Wallace's 
          role in the affair was well enough known to insiders, at least, to ensure 
          his future entry into the highest ranks of scientific dialogue. It should 
          in all fairness to Darwin be noted that Wallace took full advantage 
          of this opportunity, an opportunity he might not otherwise have received.
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's discovery of natural selection 
          occurred almost at the midpoint of his stay in the Malay Archipelago. 
          He was to remain there four more years, continuing his agenda of systematically 
          exploring and recording the circumstances of its faunas, floras, and 
          peoples. By the end of his trip (and for the rest of his life) he was 
          known as the greatest living authority on the region. He was especially 
          known for his studies on its zoogeography, including his discovery and 
          description of the faunal discontinuity that now bears his name. &quot;Wallace's 
          Line,&quot; extending between the islands of Bali and Lombok and Borneo and 
          Sulawesi, marks the limits of eastern extent of many Asian animal forms 
          and, conversely, the limits of western extent of many Australasian forms.
      </p><p align="left"><a name="path3" id="path3"></a><b><font size="+1">Wallace the Evolving 
          Polymath (1862-1880)</font></b>
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace left the Malay Archipelago 
          in February of 1862 and returned to England on 1 April. His collecting 
          activities had earned him a sizable nest egg with which he hoped he 
          could retire to a quiet life as a country gentleman. First, however, 
          there was the matter of coming to grips with the implications of his 
          vast personal collection of specimens. For the next three years he immersed 
          himself in them, producing a string of systematic revisions (mainly 
          of birds and insects) and several interpretative works. Over that period 
          (to the end of 1865) he presented at least sixteen papers at professional 
          meetings, to the British Association, and Entomological, Zoological, 
          Linnean, Anthropological and Geographical Societies. He soon met nearly 
          every important English naturalist, and began to count many as friends.
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In certain respects, the period 1862 
          through 1865 also represented a rather difficult time for Wallace. Eager 
          to marry and settle down, he was rebuffed by one woman before wedding 
          the twenty year old daughter of a botanist friend in 1866. Although 
          one of their three children would die only a few years later, their 
          marriage was by all accounts a happy one: his wife Annie proved an excellent 
          companion, and was well enough educated and sufficiently interested 
          to help him from time to time with his work. Further, both Wallaces 
          loved gardening, and spent many hours together pursuing this recreation. 
          The real crisis for Wallace in the years after his return to England 
          revolved, however, around his relation to the theory of natural selection. 
          Although Wallace was known as a co-originator of the natural selection 
          concept, the premature reading of the Ternate essay and Darwin's subsequent 
          publication of<i> On the Origin of Species</i> led everyone to believe 
          he was a full supporter of Darwinian doctrines. Subsequent events would 
          prove he was not. 
        
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We unfortunately do not know whether 
        Wallace felt at the time that his 1858 model of natural selection could 
        be extended to explain the origin and/or development of humankind's higher 
        mental and moral qualities. Surprisingly, he wrote not another word about 
        natural selection (at least, in the sense of doing more than just mentioning 
        it) until late 1863 (the classic analysis 'Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's 
        Paper on the Bee's Cell, and on the Origin of Species,' <a href="S083.htm">S83</a>). 
        In 1864 he presented a milestone paper on the evolution of human races 
        to the Anthropological Society: 'The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity 
        of Man Deduced From the Theory of &quot;Natural Selection&quot;' (<a href="bib1.htm#zS093">S93</a>). 
        In this work Wallace sought to reconcile the positions of the monogenists 
        and polygenists on human origins through an application of the general 
        Darwinian model. But by 1865 at the latest (and possibly going back many 
        years), he had been experiencing some doubt as to whether materialistic 
        models, including Darwinism, could account for humankind's higher attributes. 
        He began investigating the philosophy and manifestations of spiritualism, 
        most likely (in my opinion) in an effort to complete what he had started 
        in 1858. The result was a wholly new evolutionary synthesis, one in which 
        a material process (natural selection) was understood to rule at the biological 
        level, while a spiritual one (as described through spiritualism) operated 
        at the level of consciousness. This overall approach was later taken up 
        by the theosophists (Madame Blavatsky et al.), who based most of their 
        more esoteric teachings (including, for example, theories of cyclic reincarnation) 
        on ancient religious and literary texts, but who also acknowledged a role 
        for natural selection in producing a Darwinian kind of material phylogenesis. 
        (Wallace himself, however, would never take much interest in theosophy, 
        considering it much too abstruse.) 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's conversion to spiritualism 
        in the late 1860s took many of his colleagues by surprise (Hooker would 
        later write in disbelief &quot;that such a man should be a spiritualist is 
        more wonderful than all the movements of all the plants&quot;--a play on the 
        title of a then-recently published work by Darwin). Wallace spent a few 
        years urging them to look into the matter in more detail, but few followed 
        his lead. He would remain a spiritualist the rest of his days, never recanting 
        his belief, and publishing some one hundred writings on the subject. It 
        is in fact generally thought that Wallace's thinking regarding the application 
        of Darwinian concepts to the development of humankind's higher attributes 
        changed around 1865 in response to this apparent new influence in his 
        life; I personally feel this is a mis-reading of the situation, and that 
        the apparent &quot;change&quot; in his position simply represented a solidification 
        of an already-existing, but not yet formally stated, evolutionary model. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever one believes about the influences 
        on Wallace's thoughts during this period, there can be no disagreement 
        as to the sudden broadening of his attention that followed soon thereafter. 
        In 1865 he produced his first published writing on politics (<a href="S110.htm">S110</a>); 
        in 1866 writings on geodesy (<a href="S115-116.htm">S115 &amp; S116</a>); 
        in 1867 his first of many treatments of glacial features (<a href="S124.htm">S124</a>); 
        and in 1869 the first of several essays on museum organization (<a href="S143.htm">S143</a>). 
        Primarily, however, he was gaining recognition as one of Darwin's two 
        main (the other being Thomas Huxley) &quot;right-hand men.&quot; His most important 
        1860s works in that direction include <a href="S083.htm">S83</a>, 
        <a href="bib1.htm#zS093">S93</a>, <a href="bib1.htm#zS096">S96</a>,

        and <a href="S155.htm">S155</a>. His reputation as a naturalist soon extended 
        itself to the popular arena with the publication of his hugely successful 
        <i>The Malay Archipelago</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS715">S715</a>) in early 
        1869, and the essay collection <i>Contributions to the Theory of Natural 
        Selection</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS716">S716</a>) a year later. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the decade that followed, Wallace 
        published over 150 works, including essays, letters, reviews, book notices, 
        and monographs. His scientific writings would focus on natural selection, 
        geographical distribution, and glaciology, and include three classic books: 
        <i>The Geographical Distribution of Animals</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS718">S718</a>) 
        in 1876, <i>Tropical Nature, and Other Essays</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS719">S719</a>) 
        in 1878, and <i>Island Life</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS721">S721</a>) in 
        1880. Each work is still frequently referred to today: <a href="bib4.htm#zS718">S718</a>, 
        for its formalization of the faunal region concept and treatment of zoogeographical 
        methodology; <a href="bib4.htm#zS719">S719</a>, for its attention to the 
        causes and characteristics of tropical floras and faunas (including its 
        discussion of the concept of latitudinal diversity gradients); and <a href="bib4.htm#zS721">S721</a>, 
        for its systemization of island types and biotas, and relation of glaciation 
        processes to the known characteristics of geographical distribution of 
        plants and animals. In Wallace's work in biology and anthropology, further 
        departures from Darwinian thinking were evident. He continued to argue 
        against some of Darwin's positions on human evolution, and in addition 
        the latter's approach to sexual selection and several biogeographic matters. 
        His 1870s writings were also characterized by an increased attention to 
        social issues. In 1870 he spoke out <i>against</i> government aid to science 
        (<a href="S157.htm">S157</a> &amp; <a href="S158.htm">S158</a>); 
        in 1873 he produced essays on the Church of England (<a href="bib2.htm#zS225">S225</a>), 
        free trade principles (<a href="bib2.htm#zS231">S231</a>), and 
        the abolishment of trusts (<a href="bib2.htm#zS236">S236</a>); 
        in 1878 he wrote on a suburban forest management issue (<a href="bib2.htm#zS292">S292</a>); 
        and in 1879, again on free trade (<a href="bib2.htm#zS306">S306</a>, 
        <a href="S310.htm">S310</a> &amp; <a href="S312.htm">S312</a>). 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, personal problems were creating 
        a considerable distraction. Most of the profits accrued from his Malay 
        collections were badly invested, and lost. He was not well suited for 
        most kinds of permanent positions, and despite applying for a number of 
        them never succeeded in landing one. He took on odd jobs (editing other 
        naturalists' manuscripts, correcting state-administered examinations, 
        giving lectures, etc.) to help make ends meet, and moved progressively 
        further and further from London to minimize costs and find more suitable 
        living quarters. In 1870 Wallace took up a 500.-pound challenge from a 
        flat-earther to produce a proof that the earth was not flat; he won the 
        challenge with a neatly conceived demonstration (the so-called &quot;Bedford 
        Canal experiment&quot;: <a href="S162-163.htm">S162</a>, <a href="S162-163.htm">S163</a>, 
        <a href="S200aaAND.htm">S200aa</a>, <a href="S202.htm">S202</a>) but, 
        on a technicality, not a penny of the wager, and was seriously harassed 
        by the loser for over ten years (see Garwood 2001 &amp; 2007 and Schadewald 
        1978). Eventually his financial situation degenerated far enough to cause 
        a friend to intervene; in 1881, with help from Darwin (see Colp 1992), 
        the government was convinced to grant him an annual civil list pension 
        of 200. pounds for his services to science. It was not enough to live 
        on by itself, but it helped.

          Radical and &quot;Grand Old Man of Science&quot; (1880-1913)</font></b>
        
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the completion of his great works 
        on biogeography, Wallace turned in earnest to social issues in the 1880s. 
        He had been interested for many years in the problems associated with 
        land tenure, and in 1870, at the special invitation of John Stuart Mill, 
        had even become peripherally involved with the latter's Land Tenure Reform 
        Association. But in early 1881, following the publication of his 'How 
        to Nationalize the Land' (<a href="bib2.htm#zS329">S329</a>), he fully 
        committed himself to the debate by helping start the Land Nationalisation 
        Society. He also became its first President, holding that position until 
        his death, over thirty years later (though after 1895 his participation 
        in the organization's work was more inspirational than actual). Wallace's 
        two most important writings on land were his<i> Land Nationalisation</i> 
        (<a href="bib4.htm#zS722">S722</a>), published in 1882, and 1883's 'The 
        &quot;Why&quot; and the &quot;How&quot; of Land Nationalisation' (<a href="bib2.htm#zS365">S365</a>). 
        In these he argued that the State should, over the long-term, buy out 
        large land holdings and then institute an elaborate rent system based 
        on a combination of location-specific and value-added-by-renter considerations. 
        Wallace's writings on land nationalization feature many ideas in advance 
        of their time, including suggestions for the legislated protection of 
        rural lands and historical monuments, the construction of greenbelts and 
        parks, and arguments for suburban and rural re-population and organization. 
        In the early 1880s he also became interested in the anti-vaccination movement. 
        As one of its most powerful spokespersons he would produce a series of 
        impassioned writings (<a href="S374-509.htm">S374</a>, <a href="S420.htm">S420</a>, <a href="bib3.htm#zS536">S536</a> 
        &amp; <a href="S616.htm">S616</a>) that featured statistical epidemiological 
        arguments, a great novelty for its time. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace also took up the causes of 
          the labor movement. He was an early proponent of overtime pay rates, 
          but was against strikes: instead, he argued, employees should donate 
          a portion of their pay to funds that could later be used to effect company 
          buy-outs (<a href="S560.htm">S560</a>). Eventually he came around to 
          endorsing socialism, but only as late as 1889, on his reading of the 
          American Edward Bellamy's best-selling utopian novel <i>Looking Backward</i> 
          (<a href="S418.htm">S418</a>). As mentioned earlier, Wallace had since 
          his early teen years had a genuine love for the work of Robert Owen, 
          but had never quite believed in the large-scale practicality of Owen's 
          approach. Neither had he been quite sure about its possible incursion 
          on individual rights and freedoms. <i>Looking Backward</i> changed his 
          mind on both issues. From 1889 on, Wallace would view socialism as a 
          means whereby the average person might obtain a certain basic and acceptable 
          standard of living; freedom from worrying over basics would then (in 
          theory) allow a re-directioning of attention toward various means of 
          moral/ethical self-improvement (including spiritualism). His motto, first mentioned in a speech in 1892 (<a href="S450.htm">S450</a>; later popularized by the English sociologist and writer Benjamin Kidd),  would become 
          &quot;Equality of opportunity!&quot;, a plea for social justice. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preceding list by no means exhausts 
        the range of non-natural science-related subjects that Wallace at one 
        time or another addressed. For example, he was an early supporter of women's 
        suffrage, and was much admired by the members of the women's movement 
        for his unqualified stand on the matter. He also came down heavily on 
        many occasions on societal and governmental responses to eugenics, poverty, 
        militarism, imperialism, and institutional punishment. On several occasions 
        (<a href="S552.htm">S552</a>, <a href="S553-556.htm">S553</a>, <a href="S553-556.htm">S556</a> 
        &amp; <a href="S557.htm">S557</a>) he wrote on the advantages of 
        implementing a paper money standard; his efforts were later recognized 
        by twentieth century economists interested in currency stabilization theory 
        (the renowned American economist Irving Fisher even dedicated a book to 
        him!). He sparred with the legal system at times, suggesting changes in 
        the means of dealing with inherited wealth and trusts. He wrote two essays 
        (<a href="S491.htm">S491</a> &amp; <a href="S635.htm">S635</a>) on how 
        to re-establish confidence in the House of Lords, and one on how to revitalize 
        the Church of England (<a href="bib2.htm#zS225">S225</a>). Many 
        of the more conservative of the social and institutional elite came to 
        wince at the mere mention of his name. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Wallace's travels as a self-supporting 
        naturalist/explorer had ended with his return to England in 1862, he did 
        not lead an entirely sedentary life his remaining years. As already mentioned, 
        he began to move away from London as early as the 1860s; by 1881 he was 
        in Godalming, in 1889, Parkstone, and then, finally, Broadstone (near 
        Wimborne, Dorset, and the English Channel) in 1902. For many years (until 
        about 1890) he travelled around the better part of England giving lectures 
        and attending meetings, and even to Scotland and Ireland. He and his wife 
        also spent several vacations and &quot;botanizing excursions&quot; in locations 
        ranging from Wales and the Lake Country to Switzerland. In 1896 he gave 
        an invited lecture on progress in the nineteenth century in the town of 
        Davos in the latter country. But the main adventure of his post-Malay 
        Archipelago life was a ten-month lecture tour to the United States and 
        Canada in 1886 and 1887. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In late 1885 Wallace was invited to give 
        a series of lectures on Darwinism at the Lowell Institute in Massachusetts. 
        Once this obligation was met he would be free to arrange such other lectures 
        as he might wish. For six months in late 1886 and early 1887 he stayed 
        mainly in the vicinities of Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C., where 
        he met countless individuals of note, up to and including President Cleveland. 
        In early April of 1887 he set out across the country, reaching California 
        in late May of that year. There he was reunited with his older brother 
        John, who he hadn't seen for nearly forty years. For several weeks he 
        vacationed and lectured; one of his presentations was a talk on spiritualism 
        entitled 'If a Man Die, Shall He Live Again?' (<a href="S398.htm">S398</a>)--probably 
        the single most successful lecture he ever gave. Significant events from 
        his stay in the San Francisco area included tours of nearby redwood groves 
        (in the company of the eminent naturalist John Muir), Yosemite Valley, 
        and the future site of Stanford University (with Leland Stanford himself, 
        with whom he had become intimate some months earlier in Washington, D.C.). 
        In early July he left California to return eastward, ultimately back to 
        England. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American tour became the inspiration 
        for Wallace's next major book, in 1889. Titled <i>Darwinism</i> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS724">S724</a>), 
        it consisted largely of the topics he had lectured on, presented one chapter 
        at a time. It did very well, and remains one of his most frequently cited 
        works. <i>Darwinism</i>, while perhaps the highpoint of his later scientific 
        work, was nevertheless only a very small part of it. Although social studies 
        were absorbing more and more of his attention throughout the 1880s and 
        1890s, he was still left with plenty of time to crank out a steady stream 
        of writings on more scientific subjects. During the 1890s alone he again 
        published a total of over 150 works, dozens of these dealing with evolutionary, 
        biogeographic, and physical geography subjects. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the turn of the century, Wallace 
          was very probably Britain's best known naturalist. By the end of his 
          life, moreover, he may well have owned (based on evidence gleaned from 
          contemporary sources) one of the world's most recognized names. While 
          simultaneously continuing to publish scores of short works, between 
          the years 1898 and 1910--mostly during his ninth decade--he managed 
          to turn out (i.e., as author and/or editor) well over four thousand 
          pages of monographic writings! His final two books were published in 
          the year of his death, 1913. He remained active into his ninety-first 
          year but slowly weakened in his final months. He died in his sleep at 
          Broadstone on 7 November 1913; three days later his remains were buried 
          nearby. On 1 November 1915 a medallion bearing his name was placed in 
          Westminster Abbey.
        
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite Wallace's radical associations 
        and links with spiritualism, he was well honored during his lifetime (and 
        he most likely would have been even more so had he not made it clear early 
        on that he was not particularly interested in receiving honoraria). He 
        was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Dublin in 1882 
        and Oxford University in 1889, and important medals from the Royal Society 
        in 1868, 1890 and 1908, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Geographie in 1870, 
        the Royal Geographical Society in 1892, and the Linnean Society in 1892 
        and 1908. He even received the Order of Merit from the Crown in 1908--quite 
        an honor for such an anti-establishment radical. He became a (reluctant) 
        member of the Royal Society in 1893, and at one time or another had professional 
        affiliations with the Royal Geographical Society, Linnean Society, Zoological 
        Society, Royal Entomological Society, Ethnological Society (though apparently 
        not as a member), British Association for the Advancement of Science, 
        Society for Psychical Research, Anthropological Institute of Great Britain 
        and Ireland, Ethological Society (London), British Ornithologists' Union, 
        Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, British National Association of 
        Spiritualists, Land Nationalisation Society, Anti-Vaccination League, 
        and a considerable number of lesser organizations. 
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical descriptions of Wallace dwell 
          on his height (as a young man he was six feet one inch tall), long beard 
          (maintained from his days in the Malay Archipelago on), and snow-white 
          hair (starting in his fifties). He had a fundamentally lean build, and 
          as the years passed came to walk with a bit of a stoop. His eyesight 
          was not strong, with the result that his sparkling blue eyes were framed 
          by spectacles for most of his life. He experienced various illnesses 
          and ailments throughout his life, none of which individually seems to 
          have had any great negative effect on his productivity.
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a person Wallace was decent to a 
          fault; he possessed an apparently infinite tolerance for the weaknesses 
          of others (and was surely victimized on a number of occasions as a result), 
          but he was also known for not suffering fools gladly. He thrived on 
          public debate, but was personally modest, shy, and self-effacing. Still, 
          by all accounts he was good company when at ease, and was much in demand 
          as a public speaker. He also had a solid reputation as a writer and 
          reviewer, and for all his &quot;isms&quot; was generally regarded by his peers 
          as one of the period's greatest scientific reasoners.

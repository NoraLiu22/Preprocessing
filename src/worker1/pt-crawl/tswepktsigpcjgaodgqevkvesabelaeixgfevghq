<H2>Rat (2000)</H2>

<P>D: Steve Barron<BR>
S: Imelda Staunton, David Wilmot</P>

<P>Entertaining comic fantasy clearly inspired by Franz Kafka's <I>Metamorphosis</I>
which follows the fortunes of an ordinary working-class Dublin family when
their father (Pete Postlethwaite) comes home from the pub one night and
transforms into a rat. His shrewish wife (Imelda Staunton) is mostly angry
and resentful at his lack of consideration, his children are alternately
anxious and embarrassed, and his brother in law (Frank Kelly) elaborates
upon the scientific and zoological peculiarities of the situation. But when
a reporter (David Wilmot) comes on the scene proposing to ghost-write a
book about the family's heroic struggle to overcome their difficulties,
things take a decidedly different turn. Egged on by the Wilmot, the family
gradually begin to conspire to turn the situation to their advantage.</P>

<P>Despite a tradition of literature in the genres of the fantastic, there
have been few enough Irish feature films like <I>Rat</I>. Neil Jordan's
predilection for surrealism has resulted in moments of dream imagery in
the likes of <I><A HREF="bb.htm">The Butcher Boy</A></I>, and Martin Duffy's
<A HREF="bm.htm"><I>The Boy From Mercury</I> </A>used a boy's visions of
classic serial sci-fi as a metaphorical system, but Leprechauns and mystical
horses aside, there has really been no sustained sojourn into this territory.
It has now come from the most unlikely of sources, writer Wesley Burrowes.
Burrowes made his reputation as a writer for television, working primarily
on the long running rural soap opera <I>Glenroe</I>. <I>Rat</I> is a remarkably
disciplined and very funny film which not only succeeds as a fantasy fable
but as a suburban satire.</P>

<P>In the style of the best of Bu&ntilde;uel's Mexican films, it succeeds
in telling its story with only a slight shift from normalcy to make its
point. Once you accept the premise, which, as in Kafka's story, is stated
simply as a matter of fact, the rest is more or less rationally extrapolated
from there, including the eventual involvement of a would-be exorcist (Niall
Tob&iacute;n) and a finale with some satisfying twists which reinforce the
thematic concerns. Though the story is universal in character, Burrowes
has injected several scenes which capture the unique flavour of its setting.
Though it doesn't amount to a documentary drama on working-class Dublin,
there are many familiar sights and sounds which seem less forced than those
in <A HREF="agb.htm"><I>Agnes Browne</I> </A>but as ideologically loaded
as those in the Roddy Doyle adaptations. Despite a hefty quotient of international
production involvement, <I>Rat</I> is as Irish a film as it needs to be
to make it worth a view for an Irish audience.</P>

<P>Irish born director Steve Barron is probably best known for <I>Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles</I>. <I>Rat</I> sees him teamed again with artisans
from The Jim Henson Company, though the scale of special effects is considerably
less. In fact most of the scenes involving the rodent star feature actual
rats. Animatronics and puppetry are confined to those where some form of
violence is involved. This is not a special effects movie (nor is it really
a kids' movie), and Barron proves he is able to keep things visually interesting
without overwhelming the script (upon which most of the weight of the picture
lies). Some good use of unusual camera angles and a strong sense of the
enclosed environment of the family home make the drama more intense and
the overall pace is well judged.</P>

<P>The cast are all good, playing their scenes with their rodent co-star
with sincerity and conviction. Staunton is an energetic presence at the
centre of most of the action, with Wilmot (seen also in <I><A HREF="flick.htm">Flick</A></I>)
appropriately sinister and untrustworthy throughout. Pete Postlethwaite
isn't in the movie for very long, but as usual he makes a convincing Irishman
when he does (<I>In the Name of the Father</I>, <I><A HREF="wtsf.htm">When
the Sky Falls</A></I>). Geoffrey Palmer makes a short appearance as the
family's doctor. Despite the presence of several situational clich&eacute;s,
the earnest performances and solid dialogue keep it all together. <I>Rat</I>
is probably the most consistently enjoyable Irish film you're likely to
see this year (given the structural flaws of <I><A HREF="acc.htm">Accelerator</A></I>)
and though it is not the most original story in the world (though mind you
there is a difference between a rat and a cockroach), Burrowes uses the
setting to give it a freshness with makes it both endearing and involving.
It may occasionally be too dark and talky for small children regardless
of how it is marketed, but <I>Rat</I> is well worth a look for general viewers
and should have a wide appeal.</P>

<H2>Michael Collins (1996)</H2>

<P>D: Neil Jordan<BR>
S: Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts</P>

<P>Neil Jordan's strident epic charting the turbulent years of the early
twentieth century in pre- and post-independence Ireland may not have found
an audience at the U.S. box-office, but, not unexpectedly, ranks among the
biggest box-office earners of all time in its home country. Raising all
kinds of awkward questions not only about Irish history, but about the definition
of an 'Irish' film, this multi-million dollar Warner Bros. production has
its generic roots in the epic biopic, a sub-genre of the historical drama
which had been relatively dormant since Richard Attenborough's <I>Gandhi</I>
and <I>Cry Freedom</I>. In offering its central figure as something of a
symbol for larger questions within Irish history and politics in general,
the film inevitably found itself embroiled in immediate controversy both
at home and abroad which threatened to overwhelm consideration of its qualities
and flaws as a work of cinema in its own right. Jordan, trading on the international
standing granted to him by films such as <I>The Crying Game</I> and <I>Interview
With the Vampire</I>, has nonetheless found himself in the unique position
of being able to explore such weighty themes in conjunction with the more
personal ones which have featured in all of his work with a budget far in
excess of anything that any Irish-born director has had to date. The film
is big, blustering, and very powerful, but may not necessarily appeal to
everyone.</P>

<P>It begins with the primal scene of recent Irish history, the defeat of
the rebels at the hands of British troops in 1916 following the ill-fated
proclamation of the Republic. Historical and geographical compression and
distortion begin almost immediately, with the streets of Dublin less than
faithfully re-created to provide a more cinematic battle scene, and Michael
Collins (Liam Neeson) and Eamon de Valera (Alan Rickman) seen standing side
by side in a line-up within minutes of the surrender. Dramatically, this
establishes the relationship between what will become the two central figures
in the patrimonial drama which unfolds between the lost 'good' father of
a would-be modern Ireland (Collins) and the 'bad' one who actually ruled
it (de Valera). This is, of course, an interpretation of history, and a
thematic simplification. It works, but the danger is that it will be accepted
as historical fact. This type of problem dogs the film, and was the basis
of much of the criticism, especially in the British press.</P>

<P>Yet <I>Michael Collins</I> is not a textbook, it is a dramatic interpretation
of a moment in Irish history which has emotional and political resonances
for both its creators and its intended audience. It is a tragic story, and
one which debates the merits and demerits of both belligerence and compromise.
This has unmissable links with the political climate of the late 1990s,
and, in its own way, Jordan's film is an attempt to heal old wounds in the
Irish psyche and invite a communal mourning for all of the hatred and lost
opportunities of the past eighty years.</P>

<P>On a more superficial level, it is a wonderfully made, exciting, and
invigorating film. Its first half proceeds at a blistering pace, and though
it compresses a great deal of history in doing so, it careens from set piece
to set piece with the energy of a serial adventure. The second half gives
way to an inevitable slowing-down which matches the more complex and layered
events which transpire as Collins becomes a politician rather than a fighter
and finds himself mired in a different, more greyscale world of round-table
manoeuvring and hidden agendas. </P>

<P>Towering literally above it all is Liam Neeson. His thundering, powerful
performance is perhaps less intricate than his turn as Oskar Schindler,
but no less worthy of plaudits. Though he physically does not resemble Collins
(supporting actor Brendan Gleeson does, and he played the role in the made-for-TV
drama <I>The Treaty</I>), he gives him the larger-than-life stature which
mythology has always granted the man himself (though, as the film points
out, one of Collins' most powerful weapons was his ability to appear anonymous
and inconspicuous during those years). He is backed by good supporting performances
from many actors including Ian Hart, Brendan Gleeson, Aidan Quinn, Stephen
Rea (a feature of almost every Jordan film since <I>Angel</I>), and Charles
Dance. Ian McIlhenny has an amusing cameo as a Northern Irish intelligence
officer who meets a controversial fate. </P>

<P>In the crucial role of Eamon de Valera, Alan Rickman seems constipated
rather than careful and restrained as de Valera was, and his performance
is partly responsible for the ease with which the story settles into a simplistic
battle between good and evil. De Valera becomes more of a weasel than he
needs to be, and leaves a dangerous wound in the centre of the film. The
quotation from the man himself upon which the film concludes is proof of
Jordan's intention, but again lends itself to <I>JFK</I>-like dangers of
interpretation. The role of Kitty Kiernan has been exaggerated, again for
dramatic purposes, and she is ably played by Julia Roberts, but the focus
on the triangular relationship between Collins, Kiernan, and Harry Boland
(Aidan Quinn) allows Jordan some moments of romantic interlude and personal
conflict during which to draw breath. But it re-treads some of the old clich&eacute;s
of Irish-themed drama, as men fight over a woman whose very soul seems to
represent that of Ireland herself. It is not as obvious as some, but this
aspect is there, and will prove an unfortunate distraction for academic
writing on the film in years to come.</P>

<P>The film is beautifully photographed by Chris Menges and scored with
gusto by Eliot Goldenthal. All of the technical credits are up to par, and
far exceed anything produced within the island of Ireland in the past century.
This gives Jordan even greater freedom to explore the cinematic space he
has created, and many scenes reflect his surrealistic style of filmmaking.
The careful use of filters and lighting cast emotional inflections on otherwise
prosaic moments in the script, from the scenes where Quinn scurries about
in the underground sewers to that where Neeson sits in a hotel room bathed
in red light streaming through huge, conspicuous curtains which cast it
upon him. Jordan's concern as a director has always been with the schism
between desire and necessity where men find themselves lost and hesitant
between the literal and the abstract. Though so rooted an historical subject
as this might have been assumed to produce a more literal film, <I>Michael
Collins</I> is as much a metaphysical rumination on the nature of destiny
and masculine responsibility as any of his previous literary or filmic works.
Collins emerges not so much as an enigma (he's hardly that), but a man cursed
by the need to do what he sees as right in fighting injustice, only to find
that the rules change as quickly as he can break them. As the film winds
its way towards its inevitable conclusion, the audience feels a sick empathy
with him not because of history, but on a human level, which is at the heart
of its great power.</P>

<P>Casual audiences may nonetheless have difficulty understanding the chain
of events as they are portrayed here. The film moves so quickly that it
requires some foreknowledge of circumstances and a willing suspension of
historical narrative to the demands of personal drama before one can appreciate
what it has achieved. It is also violent and quite uncompromising as a vision
of armed struggle, which some may find offensive. It is certainly not romantic,
and a far cry from previous versions of this tale on film (such as the infamous
1936 film <I>Beloved Enemy</I>, which even offered a happy ending). It makes
few compromises to traditionally nationalistic visions of recent Irish history,
and it is more powerful as an appeal to sanity than to jingoism. Some will
label this 'revisionism', and they may have a point. But in the final analysis
this is a powerful, provocative, and engrossing film which represents an
important intersection between Hollywood mainstream filmmaking and a more
intimate 'Irish' style of which Jordan has become the leading figure (after
a rocky start in the early 1980s, at which time he actually began work on
this script). It is well worth seeing and will remain an important contribution
to Irish cinema regardless of whether or not it will be universally fondly
remembered.</P>

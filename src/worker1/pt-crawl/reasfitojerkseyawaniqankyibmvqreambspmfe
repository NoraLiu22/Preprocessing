	<p><em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em> is just as long as the title implies.&nbsp; With a running time of over two and a half hours, It's a pretty interesting film, partially because it feels like an experiment that work out not quite exactly how the filmmakers wanted.&nbsp; Adapter/director Andrew Dominick's previous film was the incendiary <a href="chopper.html"><em>Chopper</em></a> (which, incidentally, was also the film that launched Eric Bana's American career).&nbsp; Dominick does a u-turn here, going Terence Malick on everybody.&nbsp; <em>Jesse James</em> is a thoughtful Western that moves deliberately, languidly, and in its worst moments, slowly.&nbsp; It unfolds like a dream, sometimes literally with a picture that is slightly out of focus around the edges.</p>
    <p>The plot is pretty obvious - just read the title.&nbsp; Dominick adapted the movie from the novel by Ron Hansen.&nbsp; He favors the usage of a bit too much voice over narration by Hugh Ross (<em>For Love of the Game</em>, <em>Zero Effect</em>), which has the effect of slowing down an already slow-paced movie.&nbsp; Unlike most people's vision of a Western, this doesn't involve shoot-outs and chases.&nbsp; There are a few, but the focus here is on the characters, specifically James and Ford.</p>
    <p>Dominick tells the later days of James (Pitt, <em>Ocean's Thirteen</em>, <a href="babel.html"><em>Babel</em></a>) through Ford (Casey Affleck, <em>Ocean's Thirteen</em>, <em>The Last Kiss</em>).&nbsp; Ford is enamored with James.&nbsp; When younger, he collected everything he could about the outlaw.&nbsp; Ford's brother Charley (Sam Rockwell, <em>Joshua</em>, <a href="hitchhikers_guide.html"><em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em></a>) is a member of the James gang, allowing Ford access to James.&nbsp; Through a campaign of non-stop flattery and near-harassment, Ford talks his way onto the gang.&nbsp; From there, the narrative jumps forward in fits and starts.&nbsp; The general story of <em>The Assassination of Jesse James</em> concerns the last days of the James gang, but the movie itself is more concerned with the story of Ford.</p>
    <p>Pitt looks like he's having a grand time.&nbsp; After all, who wouldn't want to play the legendary Jesse James?&nbsp; He keeps the real James somewhat of a mystery.&nbsp; He may be insane and paranoid, or he may be extremely smart, and his behavior is just a ruse.&nbsp; What is clear is that Ford is pretty weird, and that Affleck is the real find here.&nbsp; He's never had anything too substantial or too much of a stretch on his resume.&nbsp; Ford is by far the most different thing he has ever done, and it is fascinating watching him.&nbsp; His Ford is enamored with the idea of becoming friends with James.&nbsp; Ford is childish, petulant, and worships James like an idol.&nbsp; His constant attention would make anybody nervous, so James seems a bit naive to keep him around.</p></td>

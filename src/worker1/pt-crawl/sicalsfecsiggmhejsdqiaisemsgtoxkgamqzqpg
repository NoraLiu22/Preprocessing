<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.1">1</A> The study of Grammar was not even pursued at Rome in early days, still less held in any esteem; and naturally enough, since the state was then still uncultivated and given to war, and had as yet little leisure for liberal pursuits. The beginnings of the subject, too, were humble, for the earliest teachers, who were also both poets and Italian&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref2" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">2</A> Greeks (I refer to Livius and Ennius, who gave instruction in both tongues at home and abroad, as is well known), did no more than interpret the Greeks or give readings from whatever they themselves had composed in the Latin language. For while some tell us that this same Ennius published a book "On Letters and Syllables" and another "On Metres," Lucius Cotta is right in maintaining that these were not the work of the poet, but of a later Ennius, who is also the author of the volumes "On the Science of Augury."

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.1">1</A> In my opinion then, the first to introduce the study of grammar into our city was Crates of Mallos, a contemporary of Aristarchus. He was sent to the senate by king Attalus between the second and third Punic wars, at about the time when Ennius died; and having fallen into the opening of a sewer in the Palatine quarter and broken his leg, he held numerous and frequent conferences during the whole time both of his embassy and of his convalescence, at which he


<A ID="p399"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p399 </SPAN></A>constantly gave instruction, and thus set an example for our countrymen to imitate. Their imitation, however, was confined to a careful criticism of poems which had as yet but little circulation, either those of deceased friends or others that met with their approval, and to making them known to the public by reading and commenting on them. For example, Gaius Octavius Lampadio thus treated the "Punic War" of Naevius, which was originally written in a single volume without a break, but was divided by Lampadio into seven books. At a later time Quintus Vargunteius took up the "Annals" of Ennius, which he expounded on set days to large audiences; and Laelius Archelaus and Vettius Philocomus the satires of their friend Lucilius, which Lenaeus Pompeius prides himself on having read with Archelaus, and Valerius Cato with Philocomus.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.1">1</A> The foundations of the study were laid, and it was advanced in all directions, by Lucius Aelius of Lanuvium and his son-in‑law Servius Clodius, both of whom were Roman knights and men of wide and varied experience in <SPAN CLASS="whole">scholar</SPAN>&shy;ship and statecraft.

	<P CLASS="justify"><A NAME="3.3"></A>
Servius stole one of his <SPAN CLASS="whole">father-in‑law</SPAN>'s books before it was published, and being in consequence disowned, left the city through shame and remorse, and fell ill of the gout. <A NAME="3.4"></A>Unable to endure the pain, he applied a poisonous drug to his feet, which finally killed him,

After this the science constantly grew in favour and popularity, so much so that even the most eminent men did not hesitate to make contributions to it, while at times there are said to have been more than twenty <SPAN CLASS="whole">well-attended</SPAN> schools in the city. <A NAME="3.6"></A>The grammarians too were so highly esteemed, and their compensation was so ample, that Lutatius Daphnis, whom Laevius Melissus, punning on his name, often called the "darling of Pan,"&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="

In fact, Grammar even made its way into the provinces, and some of the most famous teachers gave instruction abroad, especially in Gallia Togata, including Octavius Teucer, Pescennius Iaccus and Oppius Chares; indeed the last named taught until the very end of his life, when he could no longer walk, or even see.

<A ID="p403"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p403 </SPAN></A>applied to those who can speak or write on any subject accurately, cleverly and with authority; but that it should strictly be used of interpreters of the poets, whom the Greeks call <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">grammatici</SPAN>. That these were also called <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">litteratores</SPAN> is shown by Messala Corvinus in one of his letters, in which he says: "I am not concerned with Furius Bibaculus, nor with Ticidas either, or with the <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">litterator</SPAN> Cato." For he unquestionably refers to Valerius Cato, who was famous both as a poet and as a grammarian. Some however make a distinction between <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">litteratus</SPAN> and <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">litterator</SPAN>, as the Greeks do between <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">grammaticus</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">grammatista</SPAN>, using the former of a master of his subject, the latter of one moderately proficient. Orbilius too supports this view by examples, saying: "In the days of our forefathers, when anyone's slaves were offered for sale, it was not usual except in special cases to advertise any one of them as <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">litteratus</SPAN> but rather as <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">litterator</SPAN>, implying that he had a smattering of letters, but was not a finished scholar."

	<P CLASS="justify">
The grammarians of early days taught rhetoric as well, and we have treatises from many men on both subjects. It was this custom, I think, which led those of later times also, although the two professions had now become distinct, nevertheless either to retain or to introduce certain kinds of exercises suited to the training of orators, such as problems, paraphrases, addresses, character sketches and similar things; doubtless that they might not turn over their pupils to the rhetoricians wholly ignorant and unprepared.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="

<A ID="p405"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p405 </SPAN></A>underrated. I remember that at any rate when I was a young man, one of these teachers, Princeps by name, used to declaim and engage in discussion on alternate days; and that sometimes he would give instruction in the morning, and in the afternoon remove his desk and declaim. I used to hear, too, that within the memory of our forefathers some passed directly from the grammar school to the Forum and took their place among the most eminent advocates.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.1">1</A> Lucius Ateius Philologus was a freedman, born at Athens. The well-known jurist Ateius Capito says that he was "a rhetorician among grammarians and a grammarian among rhetoricians." Asinius Pollio, too, in the book in which he criticizes the writings of Sallust, as marred by an excessive effort


<A ID="p413"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p413 </SPAN></A>for archaism, writes as follows: "He was especially abetted in this by Ateius Praetextatus, a famous Latin grammarian, afterwards a critic and famous teacher of declamation, and finally <SPAN CLASS="whole">self-styled</SPAN> Philologus." Ateius himself wrote to Laelius Hermas that he had made great progress in Greek letters and some in Latin, had been a pupil of Antonius Gnipho * * *,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref21" HREF="

He seems to have assumed the title Philologus, because like Eratosthenes, who was first to lay claim to that surname, he regarded himself as a man of wide and varied learning. And that he was such is evident from his commentaries, though very few of them survive; but he gives some idea of their number in a second letter to the aforesaid Hermas: "Remember to recommend my <I>Hyle</I>&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref22" HREF="

This makes me wonder all the more that Asinius believed that Ateius used to collect archaic words and expressions for Sallust; for he knows that the grammarian's strongest recommendation to him was

Publius Valerius Cato, according to some writers, was the freedman of a certain Bursenus from Gaul; but he himself, in a little work called "Indignation," declares that he was freeborn but was left an orphan; so that he was the more easily stripped of his patrimony in the lawless times of Sulla.

He had read some early writers with an elementary teacher in one of the provinces; for the memory of those writers still lingers there and is not wholly lost, as it is in Rome. When he took these up again with greater care, and sought to extend his acquaintance to others of the same period, although he perceived that they were all held in contempt and brought rather reproach to those who read them than honour and profit, he nevertheless persisted in his purpose. After getting together a large number of copies, he gave his attention to correcting and punctuating them, and furnishing them with critical notes, devoting himself to this branch of grammar to the exclusion of all others. He had a few followers, rather than pupils; for he never taught in such a way as to assume the rôle of a master. He used to receive one or two, or at most three or four, in the afternoon hours, when he would lie upon a couch

The statue is not known to be extant; although several Roman statues are shown in Benevento as being that of Orbilius, none matches Suetonius' description.

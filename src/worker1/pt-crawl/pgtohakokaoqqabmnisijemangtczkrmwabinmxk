University of North Carolina alumni Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm were named the Greatest Male and Female Athletes of the Atlantic Coast Conference's first 50 years as announced by Commissioner John Swofford. The selections of Jordan and Hamm were determined by a vote of a 120-member blue-ribbon committee that was selected by the league's 50th Anniversary Committee.

<p>
Jordan and Hamm were two of seven Tar Heels named among the 10 best men and women in ACC history. Jordan was joined by #7 Lawrence Taylor, the greatest outside linebacker in football history, and #9 <dfn><a href="/staff.aspx?staff=216" rel="smarttag" rev="216">Phil Ford</a></dfn>, one of the finest point guards in college basketball history and UNC's alltime leading scorer.<p>
<p>
Hamm was joined in the Top10 by #2 Marion Jones, #6 <dfn><a href="/staff.aspx?staff=210" rel="smarttag" rev="210">Sue Walsh</a></dfn> and #10 Charlotte Smith. <p>
<p>
Jones started as a freshman at point guard on Carolina's 1994 women's basketball NCAA title team and won five medals in track at the 2000 Olympics. She is the fastest women in the world.<p>
<p>
Walsh is one of the most dominant swimmers in ACC and NCAA history, winning 10 NCAA titles. She is now an executive in the Educational Foundation.<p>
<p>
Smith, an assistant coach at UNC, hit the game-winning shot to give the Tar Heels the 1994 NCAA crown and was a National Player of the Year.<p>
<p>
One of the greatest women's soccer players in the world, Hamm led the Tar Heels to four NCAA National Championships - 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993 - and a combined 92-1-2 (.979) overall record in her four years in Chapel Hill. The Burke, Va., product missed the 1991 season while helping the United States win the first Women's World Cup in soccer. Hamm was the unanimous National Player of Year in 1992 and 1993 and ACC Player of Year in 1990, 1992 and 1993. The NCAA Tournament career and single-game record holder for goals, assists and points, Hamm led the nation in scoring in 1990, 1992 and 1993. In her junior season of 1992, Hamm set the NCAA single-season scoring record with 97 points on 32 goals and 33 assists. Hamm starred on U.S. National and Olympic Teams throughout her career and has scored more goals in international play than any player in history, male or female. <p>
<p>
Likely the greatest player to ever play the game, Jordan was the Consensus National Player of the Year, ACC Player of the Year and ACC Athlete of the Year in 1984. A three-year starter at North Carolina from 1982 to 1984, the Wilmington, N.C., native earned ACC Freshman of the Year honors in 1982 and was a unanimous All-ACC selection and first-team All-American in 1983 and 1984. As a freshman, Jordan hit the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA championship game against Georgetown as the Tar Heels claimed their second national title and the ACC's third. <p>
<p>
Jordan averaged 17.7 points and 5.0 rebounds in three years at Chapel Hill and played for U.S. Olympic gold medal-winning basketball teams in 1984 and 1992. The third overall selection in the 1984 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls, Jordan went on to become a bonafide superstar in the pro ranks being named the league's Rookie of the Year in 1985 and its Most Valuable Player in 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996 and 1998. Jordan, a 10-time NBA scoring leader and the league's third all-time leading scorer with 31,826 points, led the Bulls to six NBA titles and was named NBA Finals MVP six times. <p>

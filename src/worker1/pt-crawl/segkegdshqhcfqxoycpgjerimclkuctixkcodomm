							<h5>PCF Career Programs</h5>
							<p>In May of 2020, the NFL Player Care Foundation launched its NFL PCF Career Portal. The Portal allows players to browse and apply for opportunities that were posted by hiring managers across the country. We are proud that we were able to provide career resources, opportunities, and hope to players at a time when our country was facing record unemployment numbers that were fueled by COVID-19. Since its initial launch, we have had over 850 former players register to network and interview with 60+ employers, including PepsiCo, FedEx Ground, Visa, Lowe’s, NBC Sports, and many of our NFL clubs. Additionally, with assistance from Atrium Workforce Solutions, PCF has been able to review, update and improve over 340 player resumes.</p>
<p>In addition to the introduction of our Inaugural Kickoff Career Fair in September 2021, which followed a successful 3rd Annual Super Bowl Career Fair in February 2021, PCF is making a concerted effort to diversify the career offerings on our portal. We have started engaging with municipalities and national non-profits to hire NFL Legends. Visa will also be launching their “NFL Players in Business Development Program” this fall. The 2-year paid rotational program will expose NFL Legends to different departments across Visa. I believe this innovative model is one that other employers will adopt in the years to come."</p>
<p>PCF looks forward to the continued growth of its NFL PCF Career Programs in the upcoming fiscal year.</p>

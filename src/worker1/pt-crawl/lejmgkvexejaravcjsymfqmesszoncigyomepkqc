        Nobel Prize winner 1921 </i> 
      <p>The latest indications we have suggest that Einstein was vegetarian only 
        for the last year or so of his life, though he appears to have supported 
        the idea for many years before practising it himself. 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>&quot;So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but 
          am feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not 
          born to be a carnivore.&quot;</b></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This was from a letter written to Hans Muehsam, and dated March 30, 1954, 
        which was about 1 year before Einstein died. This indicates he adopted 
        a vegetarian diet at the end of his life. Previously, on August3, 1953 
        Einstein had written the following in a letter to Max Kariel, suggesting 
        that he was still eating meat at that time: 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>&quot;I have always eaten animal flesh with a somewhat guilty conscience.&quot; 
          </b><br>

      <p><i>The above quotes are from: The Expanded Quotable Einstein, collected 
        and edited by Alice Calaprice. The book flap of Ms. Calaprice's book says:

        where she has specialized in the sciences and worked with the Einstein 
        Papers for over twenty years.&quot; </i>

      <p>David Hurwitz, who contributed the quotes at the top of this page, has 
        added the following:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Alice Calaprice, has released the latest edition of her collected and 
          edited quotes by Albert Einstein entitled, &quot;The New Quotable Einstein.&quot;

          number in the Einstein Archive.</p>
        <p>&quot;<b>Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from 
          observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to 
          the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism

          of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would 
          most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.</b>&quot; Translation

      <p><img src="../societies/pics/warte.jpg" width="150" height="209" align="right">A 
        biography of Einstein says that he was still living in Germany in 1930, 
        only emigrating to the USA in 1932. It also says that he suffered a health 
        breakdown in the late 1920s which would be consistent with giving some 
        thought to his diet, but we have no indications that he actually became 
        vegetarian himself at this time.</p>
      <p>Between 1882 and 1935 the <i>Deutscher Vegetarier-Bund</i> (German Vegetarian 
        Federation) published <i>Vegetarische Warte. </i>The picture on the right 
        is the cover of the December 15, 1898 issue. An English/German dictionary 
        translates 'Warte' as: <i>observation point, viewpoint, control room</i> 
        - it seems likely that this is the 'Vegetarian Watch-Tower' (a slightly 
        odd translation but quite possible). </p>
      <p> The date of the letter and that given to the magazine are identical - December 
        27, which could suggest that the attribution to a magazine was mistaken 
        as it would have appeared some time later than the letter. It seems likely 
        that the magazine printed the date of the letter and that got confused, 
        with the date of the later magazine.</p>
      <p>Hildegund Scholvien, of the Vegetarier-Bund Deutschlands (re-formed in 
        1945), has most of the old issues of the <i>Vegetarische Warte</i>. She 
        sent the following comments:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I tried to find that Einstein quotation in the &quot;Vegetarische Warte&quot;, 
          issue 12, Dez. 1930, but I could not find it. However I do not have 
          the original magazine, only copies of the articles. The pages are complete, 
          365-392, only the cover is missing. Maybe the quotation, due to its 
          importance, was on the front cover.</p>
        <p>At that time the president of the Vegetarier-Bund Dr. Gustav Schl&auml;ger 
          und Mr. Friedrich Schulenburg were editors of the &quot;Vegetarische 
          Warte&quot;. Mr. Hermann Huth was vice-president of the society.</p>
        <p>However: Dr. Schl&auml;ger was ill and died at the end of November 
          1930. Therefore it might be possible that Hermann Huth (as vice president) 
          was the editor of this special issue. 
          In December 1930 a new board of the Vegetarier-Bund was elected, and 
          Dr. Bruno Wolff was elected president and editor, Mr. Hermann Huth vice 
          president again.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately I don't have issue no. 1 of 1931, so I can't check, whether 
          the quotation could be in that issue.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr width="50%" size="1">
      <p>These quotes give some insight into other aspects of Einstein's thinking:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;What is the meaning of human life, or, for that matter, of the 
          life of any creature? To know an answer to this question means to be 
          religious. You ask: Does it make any sense, then, to pose this question? 
          I answer: The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures 
          as meaningless is not merely unhappy but hardly fit for life.&quot; 
          - <i>Mein Weltbild, Amsterdam: Querido Verlag, 1934.</i></p>
        <p>A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the 'Universe', 
          a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts 
          and feelings, as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical 
          delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for 
          us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few 
          persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this 
          prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures 
          and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this 
          completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part 
          of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.<i> - New York 
          Post, 28 November 1972</i> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The following quotes are completely unverified, information about the 
        sources of any of them would also be useful: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> &quot;Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival 
          of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.&quot;<em> 
        (this looks like a bad translation from German of the one above, we can find no other source for it...) </em></p>
        <p> &quot;Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions 
          which differ from that of their social environment. &quot; </p>
        <p> &quot;It is easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil 
          spirit of man.&quot; </p>
        <p> &quot;The important thing is not to stop questioning.&quot; </p>
        <p> &quot;Only a life lived for others is a life worth living!&quot; </p>

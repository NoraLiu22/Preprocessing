<title>Data for discussing the meaning of 'pseudos' as used by Eusebius in PE XII, 31.</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1 align="center">Data for discussing the meaning of <i>pseudos</i> and
Eusebius in PE XII, 31.</h1>
<p>In his <i>Vindication</i>, in order to justify an attack on the honesty of
Eusebius of Caesarea, Gibbon alleged:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I shall only observe, that the Bishop of Caesarea seems to have claimed a privilege of a still more dangerous and extensive nature. In one
of the most learned and elaborate works that antiquity has left us, the Thirty-second Chapter of the Twelfth Book of his Evangelical Preparation
bears for its title this scandalous Proposition,&nbsp;"How it may be lawful and fitting to use falsehood as a medicine, and for the benefit of those who want to be deceived."
&quot;<i>**Ancient Greek**</i>&quot; (P 356,
Edit. Graec. Rob. Stephani, Paris 1544.) In this chapter he alleges a passage of Plato, which approves the occasional
practice of pious and salutary frauds; nor is Eusebius ashamed to justify the sentiments of the Athenian philosopher by the example of the sacred
writers of the Old Testament.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This page contains all the data I could gather relevant to the discussion,
except the Greek.&nbsp; It would be very nice to have this - I simply lack the
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This page contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eusebius, <i>Praeparatio Evangelica</i>, Book XII, chapter titles,
    chapters 1-5, 30-32.&nbsp; (Gifford's translation: Eusebii Pamphilii
    Evangelicae Praeparationis Libri XV, E.H. Gifford, Oxford University Press,
    1903, vol. III part 2.)&nbsp; (The only English translation).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Plato, <i>The Laws</i>, Book II, 663C,D,E (Loeb edition
    p.125, tr. R.G.Bury, 1926)</li>

    <p align="left">Plato, <i>The Republic</i>, Book II, 376D-377D, Penguin
    edition, pp.129-131. Tr. Desmond Lee, 1955.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Richard Carrier's version, created for an anti-Christian
    web-site and taking Gibbon's line even further.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">These portions have been included for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The opening chapters of the book help us to see the approach
    of Eusebius to the subject in this book of the <i>PE</i>.&nbsp; Gifford has
    followed Gibbon in his translation of the chapter title.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The chapter in question (31, not 32) quotes this section of <i>The
    Laws</i>, which is therefore included.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">In chapter 4 the same idea is discussed rather more clearly,
    and the word which Gibbon translates as 'falsehood' (<i>pseudos</i>) is
    there used also, and translated as 'fiction'.&nbsp; This is a quote from the
    <i>Republic</i>, so I have included a translation of that, which includes an
    interesting note on this very word.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Mr. Carrier's version is placed here for convenience of
    comparison.&nbsp; It is being repeated fairly extensively on usenet.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The problem seems to be that <i>pseudos</i> can mean 'lie,
deceive, falsehood' (see Liddell &amp; Scott, for instance) but also has the
meaning of 'fiction'. (The French <i>mensonge</i> seems also to have both
meanings and is used in the <i>Sources Chr&eacute;tiennes</i> translation).&nbsp; The
former words imply ill-intent; the latter is more neutral, and is employed by
the translator of <i>The Laws</i>.&nbsp; I would suggest that it is in fact the
word we want.</p>
<p>I hope this is&nbsp; helpful.&nbsp; Gibbon's attack in general is described
and discussed by Lightfoot, <a href="lightfoot.htm">here</a>.&nbsp; Some curious
forms of the allegation in circulation are available <a href="index.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER I</p>

<p>OUR twelfth Book of the <i>
Preparation for the Gospel</i> will now
from this point supply what was lacking in the preceding Book in proof of
Plato's accordance with the Hebrew Oracles, like the harmony of a well-tuned
lyre. We shall begin with a defence of our Faith, that is reviled among the
multitude.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PLATO 'It
would be another question therefore whether one is right or wrong in finding
fault with the constitutions of Lacedaemon and Crete: perhaps, however, I
should be better able than either of you to tell what most people say of them.
For if your laws are even moderately well framed, one of the best of them must
be a law allowing none of the young to inquire what is right or wrong in them,
but bidding all with one voice and one mouth to agree that everything is well
settled by the appointment of the gods; and if any one says otherwise, they
must not endure to listen to him at all. But if an old man observes any fault
in your laws, he may discuss such subjects with a ruler and one d of his own
age, no young man being present.'</p>

<p>'What you
enjoin, Stranger, is perfectly right.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With good
reason then the Hebrew Scriptures at an earlier time require faith before
either the understanding or
examination of the sacred writings, where it says, 'If ye will not believe,
surely ye shall not understand,' and again, 'I believed, and therefore have I
spoken.'</p>

<p>For which
cause also among us those who are newly admitted and in an immature condition,
as if infants in soul, have the reading of the sacred Scriptures imparted to
them in a very simple way, with the injunction that they must believe what is
brought forward as words of God. But those who are in a more advanced
condition, and as it were grown grey in mind, are permitted to dive into
the deeps, and test the meaning of the words: and these the Hebrews were wont
to name 'Deuterotists,' as being interpreters and expounders of
the meaning of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>[
Plato, Laws, i. 634 D] [Isa. vii. 9][Ps. cxv. i ]</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER II</p>

<blockquote>

<p>PLATO&nbsp; 'IN the
next place therefore we should say: It seems, Tyrtaeus, that you praise
most highly those who distinguish themselves in foreign and external war. He
would admit this, I suppose, and agree?</p>

<p>'Of course.</p>

<p>'But we say
that, though these are brave, those are far braver who show their valour
conspicuously in the greatest of all wars. And we too have a poet as witness on
our side, Theognis, a citizen of Megara in Sicily, who says:&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>

<p>"Cyrnus, when factions rage, a
faithful man&nbsp;<br>
 Is worth his weight in silver and in gold."</p>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<p>'Such a man
then, we say, is very much braver than the other in a harder warfare, almost as
much as justice and temperance and wisdom combined with valour are better than
valour by itself alone. For a man would never be found faithful and true in
civil wars without possessing all virtue. But there are very many mercenaries
who are willing to die in war, standing firm and fighting, as Tyrtaeus says,
the greater part of whom, with very few exceptions, are violent and unjust and
insolent and the d most senseless of mankind.</p>

</blockquote>

  <blockquote>

  <p>'To what conclusion then does our
  present argument lead? And what does it wish to make clear by these
  statements?  Evidently this, that before
  all things both the heaven-sent lawgiver in this country, and every other of
  the least usefulness, will always enact his laws with a view chiefly to the
  greatest virtue: and this is, as Theognis says, faithfulness in dangers,
  which one might call perfect justice.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Among us also the Word of
  salvation, joining wisdom with faith, commends the man who is adorned
  with both, saying, in His own words: `Who then is the faithful and
  wise steward?' and again, ' Well done, good and faithful servant,
  thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things.'         Certainly in these passages He clearly shows that He approves not
  unreasoning faith, but that which is combined with the greatest virtues, such
  certainly being wisdom and goodness.</p>

<p>[ Plato, <i>Laws, </i>i. 629 E] [Theognis, <i>Elegiac&nbsp; Gnomes, </i>v. 77
f.] [Tyrtaeus, 1. 16] [Matt. xxiv. 45; ibid. xxv. 21]</p>

  <p align="center">CHAPTER III</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>'FOR indeed it seems to me that in
  our former arguments we stated opportunely that the souls of the dead
  have a certain power after death, and take an interest in human affairs.   There are tales treating of these matters,
  which are tedious though true but on such subjects besides the other reports
  which we ought to believe, as being so many and so ancient, we must also
  believe the lawgivers who say that these things are true, unless they are
  shown to be utter fools.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the Book of the Maccabees also it is said that
  Jeremiah the Prophet after his departure from life was seen praying for the
  people, as one who took thought for men upon earth.   And
  Plato also says that we ought to believe these stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>[Plato, <i>Laws</i>, xi. 926 E] [2 Macc. xv. 12]&nbsp;<a name="ch4"></a></p>
  <p align="center">CHAPTER IV</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>PLATO&nbsp; ' THERE are two kinds of stories, the one true, and the other false ?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'And we must instruct children in both, and in the false first ?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do not understand, said he,
  what you mean.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you not understand, said I, that what we
  first tell children is a fable? And this, I suppose, is, generally speaking,
  fiction, though there is also some truth in it. And we use fables with
  children earlier than gymnastics.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is true.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Plato writes. And among the Hebrews also it is
  the custom to teach the histories of the inspired Scriptures to those of
  infantine souls in a very simple way just like any fables, but to teach those
  of a trained mental habit the more profound and doctrinal views of the
  histories by means of the so-called Deuterosis and explanation of the
  thoughts that are unknown to the multitude.</p>
  <p>[Plato, <i>Republic</i>, ii. 376 E]&nbsp; [See Desmond Lee's note on the
  use of the word 'fiction' here]</p>
  <p align=center>CHAPTER V</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>PLATO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you not know then that the beginning is the
  chief part of every work, especially for any young and tender mind? For at
  that age any character that one wishes to impress on each is most easily
  formed and imparted.                                                                                       &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Quite so.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall we then just carelessly permit our
  children to listen to casual fables (composed by casual persons), and to
  receive into their souls opinions for the most part opposite to those which,
  when they are grown up, we shall think they ought to hold?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We must by no means permit it.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' In the first place then, it seems, we must
  supervise the writers of fables, and approve any good fable they may compose,
  and reject any that are not good. And we must persuade nurses and mothers to
  tell their children those which are approved, and d to form their souls by the fables much more carefully than their
  bodies with their hands. But the greater number of the tales which they tell
  them now must be rejected.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These
  precautions also had been taken by the Hebrews before Plato's time. For
  those who had a divine spirit fit for discerning of spirits approved what was
  rightly said or written with help from the Holy Spirit, and the contrary they
  rejected, just as they rejected the words of the false prophets. Moreover it
  was the custom of parents and nurses to soothe their infant children by
  singing the most edifying narratives from the divine Scriptures, just like any
  fables, for the sake of preparing beforehand for the religion which they
  were to learn when approaching to manhood.</p>

  <p>[Plato, <i>Republic<b>, </b> </i>ii. 377 B]</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER VI</p>
<p align="left">[etc]</p>
<hr>
<p align="center">CHAPTER XXX</p>
<p>AMONG US also there is this saying concerning all sophistry practised among
men: 'For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written,
I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will set at nought the prudence of
the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of
this world?'</p>
<p>Moreover that those who study a divine philosophy ought to have no
narrow-minded thoughts, we are taught in the saying: 'While we look not at the
things which are seen, but at those which are not seen: for the things which are
seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.'</p>
<p>And of the fact that wickedness gathers close around the earth and this
mortal life, the word of God says somewhere: 'Redeeming the time, because the
days are evil.' And: 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.' The
prophet also says: 'Cursing, and stealing, and adultery, and murder, are
poured out upon the earth, and they mingle blood with blood.'</p>
<p>And with regard to escaping from this world to God, Moses says: 'Thou shalt
walk after the Lord thy God, and to b Him shalt thou cleave.' And the same
Moses teaches us to imitate God, saying: 'Ye shall be holy, for the Lord your
God is holy.'</p>
<p>David also knowing that God is righteous, and urging us to become imitators
of Him ourselves, says: 'Righteous is the Lord, and loveth righteousness.'
The same David taught us to despise wealth, saying: 'If riches increase, set
not your heart upon them'; and, 'Be not thou afraid, when a man is made
rich, and when the glory of his house is increased: for when he dieth, he shall
carry nothing away, nor shall his glory descend with him.'</p>
<p>Also in the following words he taught us not to admire the ruling powers
among mankind: 'Put not your trust in princes, nor in any sons of men, in whom
there is no safety. His breath will go forth, and he will return to his earth:
in that day shall all his thoughts perish.'</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XXXI</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>PLATO&nbsp; 'BUT even if the case were not such as our argument has now
  proved it to be, if a lawgiver, who is to be of ever so little use, could have
  ventured to tell any falsehood at all to the young for their good, is there
  any falsehood that he could have told more beneficial than this, and better
  able to make them all do everything that is just, not by compulsion but
  willingly?</p>
  <p>'Truth, O Stranger, is a noble and an enduring thing; it seems, however,
  not easy to persuade men of it.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you may find in the Hebrew Scriptures also thousands of such passages
concerning God as though He were jealous, or sleeping, or angry, or subject to
any other human passions, which passages are adopted for the benefit of those
who need this mode of instruction.</p>
<p>[ Plato, <i>Laws, </i>663 D]<a name="ch32"></a></p>
<p align="center">CHAPTER XXXII</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>PLATO 'ARE we then agreed as to our former statements?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>'About what?</p>
  <p>'That every one, man and boy, free and slave, male and female, and the
  whole city, should never cease from reciting to themselves these charms which
  we have just described, changed from time to time in some way or other, and
  presenting every kind of variation, so that the singers may have an insatiable
  desire for the hymns, and pleasure in them.</p>
  <p>'How could there be any doubt that this practice ought to be adopted?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In the fifth Book also of the <i>Republic </i>he writes to the like
effect, saying as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'Do you then know any human occupation, in which the male sex is not
  superior in all these respects to the female? Or need we waste time by
  mentioning the art of weaving, and the making of pancakes and preserves, in
  which the female sex is thought forsooth to be great, and in which their utter
  inferiority is most ridiculous?</p>
  <p>&nbsp; 'You say with truth, said he, that the one sex is far surpassed by
  the other, I might almost say, in everything. Many women, no doubt, are better
  than many men in many points, but the general truth is as you say.</p>
  <p>'No occupation then, my friend, of those who manage the affairs of the
  state belongs to a woman as woman nor to a man as man; but the natural
  qualities are found here and there in both sexes alike, and while woman has by
  nature a share in all pursuits, and man in all, yet woman is in all weaker
  than man.</p>
  <p>'Yes, certainly.</p>
  <p>'Are we then to assign all employments to men, and none to women?</p>
  <p>'How can we?</p>
  <p>'In fact, we shall say, I suppose, that among women also one has a
  natural gift of healing and another has not, and one is musical and another
  unmusical?</p>
  <p>'Certainly.</p>
  <p>'Also one fit for gymnastics and for war, and another unwar&Acirc;-like and
  with no taste for gymnastics?</p>
  <p>'So I suppose.</p>
  <p>'Again, one woman is a philosopher, another hates philosophy?</p>
  <p>'And one is high-spirited, another spiritless?</p>
  <p>'This too is true</p>
  <p>'So there is one woman fit for a guardian, and another unfit.</p>
  <p>'Or was not such the nature which we selected as that of men who were fit
  for guardians?</p>
  <p>'Yes, it was such.</p>
  <p>'Both woman and man therefore have the same natural fitness for
  guardianship of the state, except in so far as one is weaker and another
  stronger.</p>
  <p>'So it appears.</p>
  <p>'We must then select women also who are of this character to live with
  men of the same character, and to share in their guardianship, since they are
  competent, and akin to them in nature.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With good reason then our Word also admits to its divine instruction and
philosophy every class not only of men but also of women, and not only of free
men and slaves, but also of Barbarians and Greeks.</p>

<p align="center">PART THREE: EDUCATION: THE
FIRST STAGE</p>

<p><i>In reading what follows it is important to have in mind one or two of the main features of Greek
education in Plato's day. It was, normally, a matter for the private
individual: and in making it the concern of the state, Plato was doing something
that to the Athenian (though not to the Spartan; and Plato was to some extent
influenced by Sparta) was an innovation. Education had three principal sub&Acirc;-divisions:
reading and writing, physical education, and what we may call secondary or
literary education. This last consisted mainly in a study of the works of the
poets, which were learnt to be recited and, where necessary, sung to the lyre,
so that it included a knowledge of music; it corresponded, broadly, to the
secondary stage of our own system, and was followed by two years' military
training which began at eighteen. It must also be remembered that the Greeks
had no Bible, and what the Bible has been to us as a source of theology and
morals, the poets were to the Greeks. And if Plato seems very preoccupied with
the moral and theological aspect of the poets it is because it was from them that
the ordinary Greek was expected to acquire his moral and theological notions.</i></p>

<p align=center>*</p>

<p align="center">&Acirc;&sect;I.
SECONDARY OR LITERARY EDUCATION</p>

<p><i>Since the minds of the young are very
impressionable we must, if we are to educate them properly, make sure that the
poetry on which they are brought up is suitable for the purpose. Most existing
poetry is unsuitable: (a) theologically, because it misrepresents God. God is
perfectly good, and therefore changeless and incapable of deceit, and must
never be otherwise represented.</i></p>

<p>'THAT then would
be our Guardians' basic character. But how are they to be brought up and
educated? If we try to answer this question, I wonder whether it will help us
at all in our main inquiry into the origin of justice and injustice in society?
We do not want to leave out anything relevant but we don't want to embark on
too long a discussion.'</p>

<p>To which
Adeimantus replied, 'I expect the discussion will help our inquiry all right.'</p>

<p>'Then, my
dear Adeimantus, we must certainly pursue question,' I rejoined, 'even though
it proves a long business.'</p>

<p>'We must.'</p>

<p>'So let us
tell the tale of the education of our imaginary guardians as if we had all the leisure
of the traditional story-teller.'</p>

<p>'Let us by
all means.'</p>

<p>'What kind
of education shall we give them then? We shall find it difficult to improve on
the time-honoured distinction between the physical training we give to the body
and the education<sup>1</sup> we give to the mind and character.'</p>

<p>'True.'</p>

<p>'And we
shall begin by educating mind and character, shall we not?'</p>

<p>'Of
course.'</p>

<p>'In this education
you would include stories, would you not?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'These are
of two kinds, true stories and fiction.<sup>2</sup> Our education must use both, and start
with fiction.'</p>

<p>'I don't
know what you mean.'</p>

<p>'But you
know that we begin by telling children stories. These are,
in general, fiction, though they contain some truth. And we tell children
stories before we start them on physical training.'</p>

<p>'That is
so.'</p>

<p>'That is
what I meant by saying that we must start to educate the mind before training
the body.'</p>

<p>'You are
right,' he said.</p>

<p>'And the
first step, as you know, is always what matters most,<sup>3</sup> particularly when we are
dealing with those who are young and tender. That is the time when they are easily
moulded and when any impression we choose to make leaves a permanent mark.'</p>

<p>'That is
certainly true.'</p>

<p>'Shall we
therefore readily allow our children to listen to any stories made up by
anyone, and. to form opinions that are for the most part the opposite of those
we think they should have when they grow up?'</p>

<p>'We
certainly shall not.'</p>

<p>'Then it seems
that our first business is to supervise the production of stories, and choose
only those we think suitable, and reject the rest. We shall persuade mothers
and nurses to tell, our chosen stories to their children, and by means of them
to mould their minds and characters which are more important than their bodies.<sup>4</sup>
The greater part of the stories current today we shall have to reject.'</p>

<p>'Which are
you thinking of?'</p>

<p>'We can
take some of the major legends as typical. For all, whether major or minor, should
be cast in the same mould and have the same effect. Do you agree?.'</p>

<p>'Yes: but'
I'm not sure which you refer to as major.'</p>

<p>'The
stories inHomer and Hesiod and the poets. For it is the poets who have
always made up fictions and stories to tell to men.'</p>

<p>'What sort
of stories do you mean and what fault do you find in them?'</p>

<p>[etc]</p>

<p>----------&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Greek <i>mousice. </i>There is no English equivalent.
The word covers the secondary or literary education referred to in the opening
heading to Part III, p. 129. Shorey, in the Loeb translation, comments that the
word covers 'playing the lyre, music, poetry, letters, culture, philosophy
according to the context'. Throughout this Part it is translated as 'education'
or 'stage of education' (to distinguish it from the further stage described in
Part viii) because it is with its educational aspect that Plato is concerned.
But the reader should remember the wider overtones behind the Greek word so translated.
<i>Mousice </i>is the sphere of the Muses,
of whom there were nine, presiding between them over all the arts, literary,
plastic, graphic, musical, and even (in philosophy) intellectual. 'Mind and
character' in this passage translates <i>psuche.</i></p>

<p>2. The
Greek word <i>pseudos </i>and its
corresponding verb meant not only 'fiction' &mdash; stories, tales &mdash; but also 'what
is not true' and so, in suitable contexts, 'lies': and this ambiguity should be
borne in mind.</p>

<p>3. There is
a Greek proverb, 'The beginning is everything'.</p>

<p>4. Lit:
'rather than their bodies with their hands'. A rather obscure phrase, but the
intention seems to be to emphasize the importance of training mind and character
(<i>psuche</i>) as against body <i>(soma).</i></p>

<h3>Richard Carrier's online translation, as part of a repetition of the same
idea</h3>
<p>This is from his article at <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/NTcanon.html#6">http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/NTcanon.html#6</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That it is necessary sometimes to use falsehood as a medicine for
those who need such an approach. [As said in Plato's <i>Laws</i> 663e by the
Athenian:] 'And even the lawmaker who is of little use, if even this is not as
he considered it, and as just now the application of logic held it, if he dared
lie to young men for a good reason, then can't he lie? For falsehood is
something even more useful than the above, and sometimes even more able to bring
it about that everyone willingly keeps to all justice.' [then by Clinias:]
'Truth is beautiful, stranger, and steadfast. But to persuade people of it is
not easy.' You would find many things of this sort being used even in the Hebrew
scriptures, such as concerning God being jealous or falling asleep or getting
angry or being subject to some other human passions, for the benefit of those
who need such an approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the basis of this, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So in a book where Eusebius is proving that the pagans got all their good
  ideas from the Jews, he lists as one of those good ideas Plato's argument that
  lying, indeed telling completely false tales, for the benefit of the state is
  good and even necessary. Eusebius then notes quite casually how the Hebrews
  did this, telling lies about their God, and he even compares such lies with
  medicine, a healthy and even necessary thing. Someone who can accept this as a
  &quot;good idea&quot; worth both taking credit for and following is not the
  sort of person to be trusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand from Mr. Carrier that he translated from the Thesaurus Lingua
Graeca text, as the relevant portion of his copy of Gifford was lacking.</p>
<p>The differences are interesting, not in the portion of Eusebius, but rather
in the unusual version of Plato's comments, different from both Gifford and the
Loeb, and meaning something radically different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

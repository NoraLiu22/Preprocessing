1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        Evolution of an Evolutionist.</i></b></strong></p><br />
      <p align="center"><font size="+1"><strong>Introduction</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first contact with the work of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) came during the
second semester of my senior year in college in 1972, when I elected to take a reading tutorial on
&quot;biology-related geological subjects&quot; from one of my professors. During the course of this survey
I came upon several of Wallace's classic writings, including his book <em>The Geographical
Distribution of Animals</em>. I didn't know it at the time, but serious historical study of Wallace had
only begun in earnest just a few years earlier, most notably with the pioneer efforts of Gerald
Henderson, Wilma George, Barbara Beddall, and H. Lewis McKinney (all of whom have now
passed on). People had been at least vaguely aware of Wallace in the years after his death in
1913, of course, but it took the centennial celebration of the 1858 Darwin-Wallace Linnean
Society papers on natural selection in 1958 to really ignite interest, and within ten years the die
had been cast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not until the late 1970s that I again ran into Wallace. By that time I had begun a Ph.D.
program in biogeography, and anyone involved in such an intellectual trajectory cannot help but
become familiar with his work. Wallace is in fact recognized as the &quot;father of biogeography&quot; (or,
at the very least, of zoogeography, one of its two main subdivisions), and it did not take me long
to conclude that, co-discoverer of natural selection or not, Wallace was most fundamentally a
geographer--that is, a geographer who happened to be interested in evolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having always been the kind of person who liked to compile lists and such, I took up the
challenge of putting together a bibliography of Wallace's published writings, for continuing
reference. I quickly found that the only substantial attempt at such work had been made by one
James Marchant in 1916, in a commemorative volume on Wallace published three years after his
death. It listed around four hundred Wallace items, but it soon became apparent that it contained
various inaccuracies, and even more omissions. I began to &quot;collect&quot; Wallace publications that
had been missed in 1916, and hardly before I knew it the new additions totaled over two hundred
in number. This success made me try all the harder to come up with even more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time I thought I recognized a basic element in Wallace's model of natural selection
that had largely escaped other observers (save a few, like Gregory Bateson, who commented on
the similarity of certain elements of his thought to modern cybernetics theory). This became the
philosophical starting point for my Ph.D. Dissertation, concerning biogeochemical cycle controls
on range change in vertebrates. Eventually I came to feel that the development of Wallace's
entire cosmology, including natural selection, appeared to be due to his adoption of a unique
brand of final causes-related thinking. I made it a long term goal to explore the evolution of his
thought, including some aspects of that evolution on which others had already formed different
opinions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although a fair number of investigators had done good work on Wallace by the mid-1980s,
few had apparently looked at more than a sample of his writings overall (perhaps feeling--wrongly--that he can be understood through a reading of his major books alone). Considering the
actual range of Wallace's attention, it is amazing how little respect has been given to that range,
or its significance. The best survey of Wallace's life and work in the years immediately
following 1958, by Wilma George in 1964, touches on that diversity, but doesn't put all the
pieces together very satisfactorily, coming up short in explaining the reasons for his diverging
interests. McKinney's excellent 1972 analysis looks at a good percentage of Wallace's pre-1858
writings, but wholly ignores the remaining fifty-five years of his life. Brackman in 1980 and
Brooks in 1984 in their monographic studies follow parallel routes, veering off the main subject
in an effort to tie Wallace's later overshadowing to misconduct by Darwin. Meanwhile, those
engaged in shorter analyses were even more assuming in their appreciations. Historian Joel
Schwartz, for example, published a well known paper in 1984 attempting to link Wallace's
changing views on humankind to Darwin's publication of <em>The Descent of Man</em> in which the
grand total of four Wallace works are cited in the development of his argument.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plain fact of the matter is that until quite recently only a very limited number of
investigators had bothered to read and fully digest the whole, or nearly the whole, of Wallace's
oeuvre. Things have improved over the past ten years, but the momentum of earlier fragmented
opinion is difficult to reverse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 1991 I felt I had found most, at least, of Wallace's publications and brought 
        out an anthology and bibliography of his writings for Oxford University 
        Press. This included more than three hundred works of his that had not 
        been listed in the 1916 Marchant memoir. Most of these &quot;rediscovered&quot; 
        writings were individually of limited import, but together they significantly 
        clarified the trend of Wallace's thought. Since 1991 (and as of this writing, 
        3/06) I have added another eighty-five items to his bibliography: again, 
        most of them minor, but a few affording important clues as to what was 
        going on in his mind at various periods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there really still a need to continue harping on such fundamentals in the 
        study of the man's work? I believe there is. In reviewing the literature 
        on Wallace <em>en masse</em> one is impressed with the number of inaccurate 
        statements that continue to find their way into print. A brief sample 
        of this morasse is perhaps necessary to make my point (the authors of 
        the sources of the following statements will not be given, but the reader 
        may rest assured that the errors both exist and are accurately represented).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are plenty of things to find fault with in the popular 
        literature, but I will spare the reader mention of these here (see my 
        online essay <a href="http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/essays/ITSONWEB.htm" target="_top">&quot;'It's 
        on the Web...'--Or, When is a 'Russel' a 'Russel'?&quot;</a> for some examples 
        of erroneous statements about Wallace one can find on the free Web) and 
        move directly on to the scholarly literature. In a recent ethnological 
        study, for example, Wallace is incorrectly referred to--twice--as &quot;Sir&quot; 
        Alfred Russel Wallace, a very inept, or possibly even deliberately devious, 
        error. The same paper states that Wallace's field endeavors were subsidized 
        by the British and Dutch colonial regimes (they weren't, except for the 
        fact that he was able to secure free passage from London to Singapore 
        at the beginning of his eight-year stay as the result of a small grant 
        from the Royal Geographical Society), and that Wallace adhered to the 
        &quot;'conservative evolutionary gradualism' which pervaded scientific and 
        anthropological discourse in the late nineteenth century&quot;--nonsense, as 
        he did not. All of this is just a bit much for a paper published in a 
        prominent journal. In another recent work, a second investigator (who 
        has actually done some very good work on Wallace) states that there is 
        no &quot;testimony&quot; by Wallace himself as to whether his long-assumed change 
        of mind regarding the application of natural selection to man was due 
        to his adoption of spiritualist beliefs--there is, however, and in a most 
        conspicuous place: the Preface to <em>On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</em>. 
        The same source states &quot;there is no evidence&quot; that Wallace was &quot;in any 
        way&quot; influenced by the writings of William Whewell--despite the fact that 
        Wallace himself discusses Whewell on several occasions, and that the recent 
        literature (including an entire Master's Thesis) includes several articles 
        on this very subject.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Wallace scholar has recently backed up the statement that Wallace 
        &quot;had at least enough income to support himself&quot; by quoting a section of 
        <em>My Life</em> (Vol 1, p. 414) referring to the value of his collections, 
        ignoring the subsequent loss of his money in bad investments and the very 
        well known story of Darwin's intervention on his behalf to secure him 
        a pension. Elsewhere, one of the most prominent of current historians 
        of science states in a book review that Wallace thought that as of 1858 
        his 1855 paper ('On the law...') had been &quot;totally ignored&quot;--despite the 
        inclusion of the well-known 4 January 1858 letter to his friend Bates 
        in the Marchant collection stating how Darwin had written to him and &quot;he 
        agrees with 'almost every word' of my paper.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now one can of course forgive such errors as mere oversights, but again, they do point up
what seems to be a clear problem in Wallace studies--a general lack of familiarity with Wallace's
own writings (and to a certain but lesser extent, secondary analysis thereof). All the more reason,
I feel, for the emphasis of the present work on those writings themselves.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another independent--but not wholly unimportant--point 
        that needs to be taken is that Wallace was anything but unappreciated 
        for his accomplishments in his own time. Some sources have suggested that 
        his work went unrecognized in the latter half of the nineteenth century 
        and the start of the twentieth. The truth of the matter, however, is that 
        by the end of his life Wallace was very likely the most famous scientist 
        in the world. This conclusion is easy enough to arrive at if one takes 
        the time to survey both the obituary notices that appeared after his death, 
        and interviews that were printed during his last years. There should be 
        little reason to doubt that this evidence reflects the truth of the situation. 
        It must be remembered that Wallace's work and writings extended far beyond 
        natural science, and that he was well known in general as a humanist and 
        advocate for social reform. This point is made here not only to correct 
        other impressions, but for the important reason that it needs to be recognized 
        that the effect of his ideas on other thinkers of his time is likely a 
        good deal more pervasive than he is usually given credit for. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following work I present a summary 
      of my interpretation of the basic development of Wallace's intellectual 
      evolution. In it I deliberately avoid more than passing references to Darwin, 
      since in my opinion Darwin is not the key to understanding Wallace, Wallace 
      is. I do not disagree with many of the specific conclusions that have been 
      drawn by past students of Wallace's work such as Beddall, McKinney, Kottler, 
      Brooks and others, but I do question the accuracy of their interpretations 
      of the overall evolution of his thought. There is one matter in particular 
      that is crucial.

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a few years after the publication of Darwin's <em>On 
      the Origin of Species</em>, Wallace shocked the scientific community with 
      the announcement of his opinion that natural selection was not an all-sufficient 
      cause of the evolution of man--particularly, as regards the higher human 
      faculties (moral, artistic, and mathematical abilities, etc.). Most workers 
      have drawn the direct conclusion that Wallace &quot;changed his mind&quot; about the 
      theory he originally set out--perhaps because of an inability to reconcile 
      &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot; with his utopian social views, or in conjunction 
      with his adoption of spiritualist beliefs. In the present work, however, 
      a rather different interpretation of the events is presented: that Wallace's 
      natural selection views derive from a cosmological position utterly distinct 
      from that underlying Darwinian principles, that Wallace never believed natural 
      selection could explain the presence of man's higher faculties to begin 
      with, and that in turn he never needed to have the change of mind usually 
      attributed to him. In my opinion, Wallace's approach to evolution was shaped 
      by his youthful rejection of the doctrine of first causes and by a distrust 
      of then-existing notions regarding continuity. His first response was to 
      adopt a unique brand of anti-first causes teleology, but this position later 
      matured into a body of ideas compatible with materialist logic upon his 
      recognition of the principle of natural selection and his adoption of spiritualism.

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus I interpret Wallace as before 1858 having rejected the argument that adaptations 
      were necessarily adaptive: previously he had equated such acceptance with 
      endorsements of first causes-based doctrine. The 1858 Ternate essay not 
      only signaled his recognition of this mistake, but anticipated his later 
      arguments that the adaptive process was associated with a hierarchical domain 
      of causality. Wallace had been trying from the beginning to develop an evolutionary 
      model that described a continuity of causality extending beyond the immediate 
      domain within which natural selection operates. Wallace did not view his 
      adoption of spiritualism as a retreat from natural selection; rather, he 
      considered spiritualism the best available accounting of the overall meaning 
      of evolution at the level of consciousness, and endorsed it accordingly. 
      
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three interrelated analyses comprise the present study. In the first 
        I argue that Wallace's eventual adoption of spiritualism was assured many 
        years before either his initial studies of the belief, or earlier discovery 
        of natural selection. The second discussion focuses on the development 
        of Wallace's evolutionary views, my conclusion being that these were broadly 
        enough constituted to accommodate both natural selection and spiritualism 
        without internal inconsistency. Lastly, the idea that Wallace supposedly 
        underwent a &quot;change of mind&quot; regarding the applicability of natural selection 
        to the evolution of man is refuted by reference to earlier discussion, 
        by showing how certain contentious passages in his writings are more easily 
        accounted for through the interpretation of his work presented here, and 
        by taking note of the significant fact that Wallace himself never wrote 
        anything referring to, or conceding, such a change. The analysis remains 
        close to Wallace's own writings; not only is this not the place to attempt 
        to treat fully of all period connections, but frequent reference to what 
        he actually wrote is still necessary in view of the many dubious conclusions 
        that have been reached in the past about his various ideas and positions.</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years I have been fortunate enough to correspond extensively 
        with Wallace scholars and other historians of science, and I would especially 
        like to thank several of these individuals--Martin Fichman, James Moore, 
        Michael Shermer, John van Wyhe, Andrew Berry, and John Lynch--for their 
        continuing willingness to share and discuss their Wallace-related thoughts. 
        I am also indebted to the interlibrary loan group here at Western Kentucky 
        University for their excellent work in coming up with copies of all the 
        obscure documents I continually pester them to find for me.</p>

<h3>Passage Illustrated: Toby or "Trotty" Veck</h3>

<p class="one">Wet weather was the worst; the cold, damp, clammy wet, that wrapped him up 
like a moist great-coat—the only kind of great-coat Toby owned, or could have added to 
his comfort by dispensing with.  Wet days, when the rain came slowly, thickly, 
obstinately down; when the street’s throat, like his own, was choked with mist; when 
smoking umbrellas passed and re-passed, spinning round and round like so many teetotums, 
as they knocked against each other on the crowded footway, throwing off a little 
whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings; when gutters brawled and waterspouts were full 
and noisy; when the wet from the projecting stones and ledges of the church fell drip, 
drip, drip, on Toby, making the wisp of straw on which he stood mere mud in no time; 
those were the days that tried him.  Then, indeed, you might see Toby looking anxiously 
out from his shelter in an angle of the church wall — such a meagre shelter that in 
summer time it never cast a shadow thicker than a good-sized walking stick upon the sunny 
pavement — with a disconsolate and lengthened face. But coming out, a minute afterwards, 
to warm himself by exercise, and trotting up and down some dozen times, he would brighten 
even then, and go back more brightly to his niche. ["The First Quarter," pp. 8-10]</p>

<h3>Commentary: The Exemplary "Working Man"</h3>

<p class="one">Trotty (Toby) Veck, the London messenger, is the central figure of all 
narrative-pictorial sequences of <span class="book">The Chimes</span>. As both Meg's 
father and the one who takes in Will Fern and his niece, Lilian, Trotty is the touchstone 
who connects all the other characters in the novella. Although he is neither a miser nor 
a misanthrope like Ebenezer Scrooge in the first Christmas Book, <span class="book">A 
Christmas Carol</span>, Trotty has adopted the misguided notion from the press that the 
labouring poor are "born bad," a phrase that he has picked up from reading conservative 
newspapers.</p>

<p>The epiphany he experiences as a result of his dream-vision is that the poor are as 
worthy of a place in this world as their social superiors, and that these affluent and 
powerful beings such as Alderman Cute may actually possess less sympathy and less 
fundamental decency than the proletariat. In the original scarlet-and-gold volume the 
team of artists, led by caricaturist <a href="../leech/index.html">John Leech</a>, show 
characterisations of the humble ticket porter that are more or less consistent with 
Dickens's description, if not with Leech's original, cartoon-like conception. The 
comparable illustration to Green's fourth is Leech's <a href="../chimes/4.html"><span
class="illustration">Trotty Veck</span></a>, although the little, elderly man wearing a 
ticket-porter's apron appears in a total of nine of the 1844 book's thirteen 
wood-engravings.</p>

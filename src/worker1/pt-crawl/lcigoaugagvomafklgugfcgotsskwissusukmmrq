<h1>Who is Scott Ventura?</h1>
<h2>At Play</h2>
<p> I sing with the
<a href="http://www.chorusofthegenesee.org/">Chorus of the Genesee</a>,
a barbershop chorus. That also makes me a member of <a
href="http://www.spebsqsa.org/">SPEBSQSA</a>, the Society for the
Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in
America. &#34;It's <strong>great</strong>
to be a barbershopper!&#34; I'm also singing in a quartet
called <a href="http://FeverPitchQuartet.com/">Fever Pitch</a>. </p>
<p>I derive a great deal of enjoyment from
driving, pinball, and roller coasters. I've got a few sims on my
machine, but nothing compares to the real thing. For year-round
rollercoaster-esque enjoyment, I've now got a <a
href="/gallery/chaos/">Chaos Tower</a>.</p>
<p>
I used to have an unhealthy obsession with good web implementation.
(Now it's a healthy one.)
I wanted to be a web mender, someone travelling the country making
the suggestions that push web sites from junk to not junk. It
hasn't worked out as a business venture, so I tried turning it into
a blog. See ramblings on imperfect sites at <a
href="http://webmender.com/" >WebMender.com</a>. </p>
<p> As if that isn't geeky enough, I love numbers and math. I've
solved more than fifty of the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project
Euler</a> problems, mostly with Python. I take pictures of my odometer
when it hits cool numbers. I even wrote a <a href="/clock.html">prime
factors clock</a> because a webcomic hinted at it.
</p>
<p>
And because enough of my friends were doing it, I started keeping a <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tfofurn/">LiveJournal</a>. I
particularly enjoy the cross-blog tools and the comment system, which
would be quite difficult to implement on my own site.
</p>
<p>For a few years, I was a big movie buff. I wrote up a few hundred
<a href="/movies/">movie reviews</a> during that phase. I don't watch
movies nearly as often any more, and most of my writing energy goes
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>I also enjoy unusual clocks. I've got three clocks from <a
href="http://www.chronoart.com/">Chronoart</a>,
and I'm usually on the lookout for other artistic ones to add to my
collection. </p>
<h2>At Work</h2>
<p>
I've been employed by <a href="http://www.allworx.com/">Allworx</a>
since May 2008. I'm in the consulting division, which means I get
a lot of variety. I've already done some driver development and
worked on the guts of a box that runs Linux, but whose only UI is
a USB port. Before Allworx, I spent ten years in a research
department at Xerox.
</p>
<h2>A Brief History</h2>
<p> I grew up in the Pittsburgh area, and lived there through high
school. I spent my undergraduate years at the <a
href="http://www.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a> in
<a href="http://www.rochester.ny.us/">Rochester NY</a>, majoring in the
then-new <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/">Computer Science</a>
program. I graduated in May of 1997, and never left town. </p>

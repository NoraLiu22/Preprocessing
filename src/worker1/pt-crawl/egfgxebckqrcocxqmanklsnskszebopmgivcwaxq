<P> <I>This decree was the latest in a series of decrees in honour of successive kings of the Bosporos. It was important for the Athenians to maintain a good relationship with the kings, who controlled a large proportion of the city's grain supply; see P.Harding, &quot;Athens Transformed, 404–262 BC&quot;, pp.48-9 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=ylOhCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA48">Google Books</A> ).</I>

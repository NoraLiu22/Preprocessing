<P> <I>These two inscriptions illustrate the important role played by private benefactors in supporting religious activities; see V. Pirenne-Delforge, &quot;Myths, Martyrs, and Modernity&quot;, pp. 232-3 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=IuF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA232
">Google Books</A >). &nbsp; There is a French translation of <B>A</B> by P. Foucart, &quot;Inscription inédite de Mantinée&quot; ( <A HREF="https://www.tpsalomonreinach.mom.fr/Reinach/MOM_TP_135718/MOM_TP_135718_0001/PDF/MOM_TP_135718_0001.pdf">PDF</A> ).</I>

<P> <I>Both inscriptions are dated by what modern writers call 'the Achaean era'. It is generally agreed that the first year of this era began in about July 145 B.C.; see for instance T.C. Brennan, &quot;The Praetorship in the Roman Republic&quot;, p. 343, n. 33 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.coM/books?id=Jd8N4LTUv8YC&pg=PA343">Google Books</A> ) .</I>

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="A">[A]</A> &nbsp; With good fortune. Since Nikippa daughter of Pasias, who is <I>descended</I> from glory-loving ancestors, herself chooses to hold on to the virtue of her ancestors, and she has maintained righteous <I>behaviour</I>, not only towards men but also towards the gods; with a pious disposition she honours all the [gods, and] gives service to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/p/persephone.html#1">Kor&#275;</A> at every opportunity, joining with the priests in office to regulate <I>her cult</I>, and unstintingly providing to each <I>of the priests</I> what is needed for the honour and adornment of the goddess; [and similarly], in the [eighth] month of the eighty-fifth year, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> when the sacrifice-festival of the Koragia was imminent, and the secret mysteries of the goddess were [about] to be performed, at the prompting of the priests Nikippa took on the task {<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy_(ancient_Greece)">liturgy</A>} without demur, and generously and earnestly <I>undertook</I> every expense that was needed for the goddess and the assembly; she managed the procession of the Koragia splendidly and magnanimously, and in a sacrifice to the goddess she provided a fine offering on behalf of the assembly, in a manner worthy of herself and of the assembly; and in addition she contributed eighty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma">drachmas</A> for urgent requirements, and presented a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peplos">peplos</A> to the goddess; <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> and she accommodated and arranged the affairs of the secret mysteries of the goddess; and she received the goddess into her own home, as is customary for the priests in office; and she magnanimously performed the customary <I>rites</I> on the thirtieth <I>days</I>, when the temple was opened: and she took care of whatever building <I>work</I> 
 the temple needed; therefore, on account of all this, it is resolved by the assembly {<FONT CLASS="exotic">synodos</FONT>} of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://ancientassociations.ku.dk/assoc/428">Koragoi</A> to praise Nikippa for the generosity that she has <I>shown</I>, and for her piety towards the gods, and for her goodwill towards the assembly; and that the public hosts in office shall invite her for privileged portions <I>of food</I>, <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> just as <I>they invite</I> the others who have honoured the assembly in the days <I>of the festival</I>, and they shall send her a share <I>of the food</I>; if any of the public hosts does not invite her, the inspector {<FONT CLASS="exotic">epign&#333;ta</FONT>} shall summon him, and he shall be forced to invite <I>her</I>; and anyone who fails to do any of this shall [pay a fine of fifty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma">drachmas</A>]; and he shall be liable to prosecution by Nikippa for ignoring the privileges given to her [by the assembly], in order that when <I>all</I> this is performed, the assembly shall be seen to be suitably grateful <FONT CLASS="verse">40</FONT> and [to have] good expectations about the future. The priests shall appoint men to inscribe a copy of this decree on a stone <A CLASS="help" HREF="../glossary.html#stele">stele</A> and to set it up in the most prominent place in the temple; similarly <I>they shall write a copy</I> in the public tablets.
<P> <I>Men</I> appointed: Alexinikos son of Alexon, Thy&#333;nidas son of Thy&#333;nidas, Simias son of Anthemokritos, Aristarchos son of Menippos, Philesios son of Samidas, Alkamenes son of Mandr&#275;kidas, <FONT CLASS="verse">50</FONT> Aithon son of Philosthenes, and Menas son of Menas.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="B">[B]</A> &nbsp; Since Pha&#275;na [Antigonika {? "of Antigoneia"}, daughter of Damatrios], is virtuous and pious and in her whole life she has behaved well and piously towards all the gods, and especially towards <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/d/demeter.html#1">Demeter</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/p/persephone.html#1">Kor&#275;</A> and the priestesses of Demeter; and she has given clear proof of her personal magnanimity and her zeal towards the divinity; for she served magnificently as priestess of Demeter, taking no account of the expense <I>she bore</I> for the goddess herself, or for the correct annual rites of the goddess, or for the priestesses; and she provides assistance to the priestesses whenever they ask her, <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> and spends from her personal wealth unhesitatingly; she attends to every task {<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy_(ancient_Greece)">liturgy</A>} and expense that is needed for the goddess and the priestesses; and not only in these matters has she behaved as a benefactor, but also after her time as priestess, she continued to assist with magnificent dinners and the other benefactions and payments that she <I>made</I> for the goddess and for the priestesses; and she contributed another great and enduring boon to the goddess and the priestesses; for she instructed that the annual expenses that she <I>bore</I> should be paid in her stead, <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> if she suffered <I>the fate</I> of humans, by her descendants, <I>namely</I> her daughter Theodora and Pha&#275;na daughter of Damasilas, the daughter of her daughter, so that her zeal towards the goddess and the priestesses should continue to receive eternal remembrance; and not only in the aforesaid benefactions did she behave honourably, but also, in her desire to further enhance <I>the affairs of</I> the goddess and the assembly of priestesses, she (?) dedicated one hundred and twenty <A 
 CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma">drachmas</A> for the repair of the hall {<FONT CLASS="exotic">megaron</FONT>} and for any other requirement, whatever the priestesses decided was an appropriate use of the gift provided by her; therefore, so that the assembly {<FONT CLASS="exotic">synodos</FONT>} of the priestesses of Demeter <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> may be seen to be grateful and to commemorate those persons who behave towards it in a fine and honourable manner, it was resolved by the community {<FONT CLASS="exotic">koinon</FONT>} of the priestesses to praise Pha&#275;na Antigonika daughter of Damatrios for her noble conduct and for the benefactions she has made to the goddess and the priestesses, and to invite her for privileged portions on every <I>occasion</I> when there are annual sacrifices and distributions of food {<FONT CLASS="exotic">sitarchiai</FONT>}; the priestesses and <FONT CLASS="exotic">sitarchoi</FONT> in office shall make this announcement: "The community of the priestesses of Demeter invites for privileged portions Pha&#275;na daughter of Damatrios, their benefactor." The customary privileged portions shall be given to her throughout her life. <FONT CLASS="verse">40</FONT> This decree shall be inscribed on a stone <A CLASS="help" HREF="../glossary.html#stele">stele</A> and set up in the Koragion, just as was resolved by the magistrates and councillors in the one hundred and third year. If anyone does not invite <I>her</I> for a privileged portion or does not give <I>her</I> the aforesaid privileged portions, he shall be liable to prosecution for <I>a fine of</I> a hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma">drachmas</A> by her or her descendants.

    <td width="503"><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">On December 16, 1944, the Germans
    launched their largest offensive of the war on the Western Front. The primary goals of the
    offensive were to capture the Belgian port of Antwerp and to drive a wedge between the
    British and American armies. This offensive is often referred to as the &quot;Battle of
    the Bulge.&quot; It's failure was due largely to American resistance around St. Vith, on
    the northern shoulder of the Bulge, and by American forces holding Bastogne on the
    southern shoulder of the Bulge. </font></strong><p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>The
    town of Bastogne is strategically located at the center of the road network of the
    Ardennes. The Germans referred to it as a &quot;road octopus&quot; since the majority of
    roads in that region of the Ardennes pass through the town. The town's strategic location
    made it vitally important to the outcome of the offensive. The Allies realized its
    importance and General Eisenhower dispatched the 101st Airborne Division to hold the town
    at all costs. This victory resulted in the first full Army Division Presidential
    Distinguished Unit Citation. This interview focuses on the story surrounding the German's
    request for the American forces at Bastogne to surrender and the American General's
    response as witnessed by Lt. General Harry Kinnard, at the time of the siege of Bastogne,
    a Lt. Col. and Division G-3. These are some of his personal recollections. </strong></font></p>
    <hr>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We got into Bastogne late on the night of 18 December,
    1944. We were not well equipped, having just gotten out of combat in Holland. We were
    particularly short of winter clothing and footwear. On the 21st of December we became
    completely surrounded by Germans and our field hospital was overrun by a German attack. We
    had put the hospital in what would normally have been a safe place, but no place is safe
    when you are completely surrounded. At this time, we were not able to receive air resupply
    because the weather was absolutely frightful. It was very, very cold and snowy. Visibility
    was often measured in yards. Our lack of winter gear was partially offset by the citizens
    of Bastogne who gave us blankets and white linens that we used for camouflage. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While we were still surrounded, on the morning of December
    22, a German surrender party, consisting of two officers and two NCOs, and carrying a
    white flag, approached our perimeter in the area of our Glider Regiment, the 327th. The
    party was taken to a nearby platoon command post. While the enlisted men were detained the
    officers were blind folded and taken to the command post of the 327th where they presented
    their surrender ultimatum. The ultimatum in essence said the 101st's position was hopeless
    and that if we elected not to surrender a lot of bad things would happen. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The message was brought in to the Division Headquarters by
    Major Alvin Jones, the S-3, and Colonel Harper, the Regimental Commander. They brought the
    message to me, the G-3 and Paul Danahy, the G-2. My first reaction was that this was a
    German ruse, designed to get our men out of their fox holes. But be that as it might, we
    agreed that we needed to take the message up the line. We took it first to the acting
    Chief of Staff of the Division, Lt. Col. Ned Moore. With him, we took the message to the
    acting Division Commander General Tony McAuliffe. Moore told General McAuliffe that we had
    a German surrender ultimatum. The General's first reaction was that the Germans wanted to
    surrender to us. Col. Moore quickly disabused him of that notion and explained that the
    German's demanded our surrender. When McAuliffe heard that he laughed and said: &quot;Us
    surrender? Aw, nuts!&quot; the date was December 22nd, 1944<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    To the U.S.A. Commander of the encircled town of Bastogne.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Courier"></p>
    <p>The fortune of war is changing. This time the U.S.A. forces in and near Bastogne have
    been encircled by strong German armored units. More German armored units have crossed the
    river Our near Ortheuville, have taken Marche and reached St. Hubert by passing through
    Hompre-Sibret-Tillet. Libramont is in German hands. </p>
    <p>There is only one possibility to save the encircled U.S.A. troops from total
    annihilation: that is the honorable surrender of the encircled town. In order to think it
    over a term of two hours will be granted beginning with the presentation of this note. </p>
    <p>If this proposal should be rejected one German Artillery Corps and six heavy A. A.
    Battalions are ready to annihilate the U.S.A. troops in and near Bastogne. The order for
    firing will be given immediately after this two hours' term. </p>
    <p align="left">All the serious civilian losses caused by this artillery fire would not
    correspond with the well known American humanity.<br>
    <br>
    The German Commander.<br>
    </font><br>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But then McAuliffe realized that some sort of reply was in
    order. He pondered for a few minutes and then told the staff, &quot;Well I don't know what
    to tell them.&quot; He then asked the staff what they thought, and I spoke up, saying,
    &quot;That first remark of yours would be hard to beat.&quot; McAuliffe said, &quot;What
    do you mean?&quot; I answered, &quot;Sir, you said 'Nuts'.&quot; All members of the staff
    enthusiastically agreed, and McAuliffe decided to send that one word, &quot;Nuts!&quot;
    back to the Germans. McAuliffe then wrote down: &quot;To the German Commander,
    &quot;Nuts!&quot; The American Commander.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">McAuliffe then asked Col. Harper to deliver the message to
    the Germans. Harper took the typed message back to the company command post where the two
    German officers were detained. Harper then told the Germans that he had the American
    commanders reply. The German captain then asked, &quot;Is it written or verbal?&quot;
    Harper responded that it was written and added, &quot;I will place it in your hand.&quot; </font></p>

    <small><strong><small><em><font face="Arial">General Anthony McAuliffe<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The German major then asked, &quot;Is the reply negative or
    affirmative? If it is the latter I will negotiate further.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At this time the Germans were acting in an arrogant and
    patronizing manner and Harper, who was starting to lose his temper, responded, &quot;The
    reply is decidedly not affirmative.&quot; He then added that, &quot;If you continue your
    foolish attack your losses will be tremendous.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Harper then put the German officers in a jeep and took them
    back to where the German enlisted men were detained. He then said to the German captain,
    &quot;If you don't know what 'Nuts' means, in plain English it is the same as 'Go to
    Hell'. And I'll tell you something else, if you continue to attack we will kill every
    goddam German that tries to break into this city.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The German major and captain saluted very stiffly. The
    captain said, &quot;We will kill many Americans. This is war.&quot; Harper then responded,
    &quot;On your way Bud,&quot; he then said, &quot;and good luck to you.&quot; Harper later
    told me he always regretted wishing them good luck. </font></td>

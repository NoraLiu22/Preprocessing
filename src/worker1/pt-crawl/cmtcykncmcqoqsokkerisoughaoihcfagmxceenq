						<p>Urban VIII, Pope<br>
For an Everlasting Memorial</p>
<p>If there is anything Divine among man's possessions which might excite the 
envy of the citizens of Heaven (could they ever be swayed by such a passion), 
this is undoubtedly the Most Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, by means of which men, 
having before their eyes and taking into their hands the very Creator of Heaven 
and earth, experience, while still on earth, a certain anticipation of Heaven.</p>
<p>How keenly then, must mortals strive to preserve and protect this inestimable 
privilege with all due worship and reverence and be ever on their guard lest 
their negligence offend the angels who vie with them in eager adoration!</p>
<p>In view of this consideration, following in the footsteps of the Supreme 
Pontiffs, Our Predecessors, Pius V and Clement VIII, who undertook to review and 
restore most diligently the rite and prayers pertaining to the celebration of 
this sacred Mystery, We have ordered that these be again examined and that if by 
chance anything, as often happens, has been corrupted in the course of time, it 
shall be restored to its former standard.</p>
<p>Wherefore, just as We have recently achieved the reform of the Breviary for 
the greater splendor of the Divine Office, so also, following this example, We 
have ordered that the Missal be corrected with a view to bestowing greater 
beauty and luster upon the Divine Sacrifice.</p>
<p>And since it is highly becoming that the wings, as it were, of the liturgy 
which the priest, like the cherubim of the old Mystical Tabernacle, daily 
spreads over the true Mercy seat of the world, should be twofold and fashioned 
exactly in the same shape and form, We have entrusted this task to learned and 
pious men who have carried it out so carefully as to leave nothing to be 
desired.</p>
<p>The rubrics which had been allowed to gradually degenerate from the old usage 
and rite, have been restored to their former pattern; those which did not seem 
to be easily intelligible to the readers, have been more clearly stated; and 
moreover, having compared the pertinent texts with the Vulgate edition of Holy 
Writ, the differences which had crept into the Missal have been emended 
according to this standard and norm.</p>
<p>The competence of the revisers, however, is likely to bear little fruit, 
unless the skill and diligence of proficient printers measure up to it. We have, 
therefore, ordered Our dear son Andrew Brugiotto, director of Our printing 
establishment, to publish the Missal thus emended, and We allow it to be printed 
in the future outside the City, but only according to the standard now edited by 
Our printing establishment and after the printers have requested and obtained in 
writing the permission of Our most dear sons, the Inquisitors against heretical 
depravity, in those places where they are established and of the Ordinaries 
where there are no Inquisitors. Otherwise, if henceforth without this permission 
they dare to print the above-mentioned Missal or the booksellers dare to sell 
it, the printers and the booksellers established outside Our Ecclesiastical 
State shall incur excommunication <i>latae sententia</i>e from which, save on 
the point of death, they may not be absolved except by the Roman Pontiff. The 
printers and booksellers established in the City and in other parts of the 
Ecclesiastical State shall incur the fine of five hundred gold ducats of the 
Treasury and forfeit unpardonably without any further declaration all their 
books and types which are to be devolved on the said Treasury. And nevertheless 
We forbid and prohibit for all places and peoples under the same penalties the 
use of such Missals as might be printed and sold without the necessary 
permission.</p>
<p>Before granting this permission, the Inquisitors or the Ordinaries must very 
diligently compare the Missals to be printed, both before and after they have 
been printed, with the standard text revised by Our authority, and they must not 
allow anything to be added to, or removed from, it. In granting the original 
license, they must attest in their own handwriting that, having made the 
collation, the Missals are found to agree perfectly with the standard edition. 
This document must be printed always at the beginning or at the end of every 
Missal.</p>
<p>If they behave otherwise, the Inquisitors shall incur, on that account, the 
penalty of being deprived of their office and of being debarred from obtaining 
it back and acquiring other offices in the future; the Ordinaries shall incur 
the penalty of suspension <i>a divinis</i> and of interdiction from entering the 
Church; and their Vicars shall be similarly deprived of their offices and 
benefices, they shall be debarred from obtaining these and other offices and 
benefices in the future and they shall incur excommunication, without any 
further declaration.</p>
<p>Wishing in Our Apostolic benignity to secure and protect from any loss all 
poor churches, clerics and ecclesiastics, printers and booksellers, We allow 
them to keep, use and sell respectively the Missals hitherto printed which they 
possess. Notwithstanding whatsoever license, indults, and privileges granted to 
the printers by Us or by the Roman Pontiffs, Our Predecessors, to print the 
Missal, which by these presents We expressly revoke and which We wish to be 
revoked, as well as the constitutions, Apostolic ordinances, general and 
special, granted in whatever manner, contrary to the above prescriptions, 
confirmed and approved.</p>
<p>From all these ordinances, for this time only, We specially and expressly 
derogate, although particular, specific and express mention is to be made of 
them and of their whole tenor considering their tenor as expressed in these 
presents.</p>
<p>We wish that the same authority attaching to these presents, if exhibited and 
shown, be attributed to their copies, even printed ones, bearing the signature 
of a Notary Public and vouched for by the seal of a Church dignitary.</p>
<p>Given in Rome at St. Mary Major's under the ring of the Fisher man, on the 
2nd day of September, 1634, XIIth year of Our Pontificate.</p>

<font size="+3">&nbsp;</font>

<br>Civil rights leaders adopted the "Double V" slogan as their rallying

cry during World War II. Demanding victory against fascism abroad and discrimination

at home, they exhorted black citizens to support the war effort and to

fight for equal treatment and opportunity for Negroes everywhere. Although

segregation was their main target, their campaign was directed against

all forms of discrimination, especially in the armed forces. They flooded

the services with appeals for a redress of black grievances and levied

similar demands on the White House, Congress, and the courts.



<p>Black leaders concentrated on the services because they were public

institutions, their officials sworn to uphold the Constitution. The leaders

understood, too, that disciplinary powers peculiar to the services enabled

them to make changes that might not be possible for other organizations;

the armed forces could command where others could only persuade. The Army

bore the brunt of this attention, but not because its policies were so

benighted. In 1941 the Army was a fairly progressive organization, and

few institutions in America could match its record. Rather, the civil rights

leaders concentrated on the Army because the draft law had made it the

nation's largest employer of minority groups.



<p>For its part, the Army resisted the demands, its spokesmen contending

that the service's enormous size and power should not be used for social

experiment, especially during a war. Further justifying their position,

Army officials pointed out that their service had to avoid conflict with

prevailing social attitudes, particularly when such attitudes were jealously

guarded by Congress. In this period of continuous demand and response,

the Army developed a racial policy that remained in effect throughout the

war with only superficial modifications sporadically adopted to meet changing

conditions.

<center>&nbsp;</center>



<center><i>A War Policy: Reaffirming Segregation</i></center>





<p>The experience of World War I cast a shadow over the formation of the

Army's racial policy in World War II.<sup><font size="-2"><a href="#1">1</a></font></sup>

The chief architects of the new policy, and many of its opponents, were

veterans of the first war and reflected in their judgments the passions

and prejudices of that era.<sup><font size="-2"><a href="#2">2</a></font></sup>

Civil rights activists were determined to eliminate the segregationist

practices of the 1917 mobilization and to win a fair representation for

Negroes in the Army. The traditionalists of the Army staff, on the other

hand, were determined to resist any radical change in policy. Basing their

arguments on their evaluation of the performance of the 92d Division and

some other black units in World War I, they had made, but not publicized,

mobilization plans that recognized the Army's obligation to employ black

soldiers yet rigidly maintained the segregationist policy of World War

I.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> These plans increased the number of types

of black units to be formed and even provided for a wide distribution of

the units among all the arms and services except the Army Air Forces and

Signal Corps, but they did not explain how the skilled Negro, whose numbers

had greatly increased since World War I, could be efficiently used within

the limitations of black units. In the name of military efficiency the

Army staff had, in effect, devised a social rather than a military policy

for the employment of black troops.



<p>The White House tried to adjust the conflicting demands of the civil

rights leaders and the Army traditionalists. Eager to placate and willing

to compromise, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought an accommodation

by directing the War Department to provide jobs for Negroes in all parts

of the Army. The controversy over integration soon became more public,

the opponents less reconcilable; in the weeks following the President's

meeting with black representatives on 27 September 1940 the Army countered

black demands for integration with a statement released by the White House

on 9 October. To provide "a fair and equitable basis" for the use of Negroes

in its expansion program, the Army planned to accept Negroes in numbers

approximate to their proportion in the national population, about 10 percent.

Black officers and enlisted men were to serve, as was then customary, only

in black units that were to be formed in each major branch, both combatant

and noncombatant, including air units to be created as soon as pilots,

mechanics, and technical specialists were trained. There would be no racial

intermingling in regimental organizations because the practice of separating

white and black troops had, the Army staff said, proved satisfactory over

a long period of time. To change would destroy morale and impair preparations

for national defense. Since black units in the Army were already "going

concerns, accustomed through many years to the present system" of segregation,

"no experiments should be tried . . . at this critical time."<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>



<p>The President's "OK, F.D.R." on the War Department statement transformed

what had been a routine prewar mobilization plan into a racial policy that

would remain in effect throughout the war. In fact, quickly elevated in

importance by War Department spokesmen who made constant reference to the

"Presidential Directive," the statement would be used by some Army officials

as a presidential sanction for introducing segregation in new situations,

as, for example, in the pilot training of black officers in the Army Air

Corps. Just as quickly, the civil rights leaders, who had expected more

from the tone of the President's own comments and more also from the egalitarian

implications of the new draft law, bitterly attacked the Army's policy.



<p>Black criticism came at an awkward moment for President Roosevelt, who

was entering a heated campaign for an unprecedented third term and whose

New Deal coalition included the urban black vote. His opponent, the articulate

Wendell L. Willkie, was an unabashed champion of civil rights and was reportedly

attracting a wide following among black voters. In the weeks preceding

the election the President tried to soften the effect of the Army's announcement.

He promoted Col. Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., to brigadier general, thereby

making Davis the first Negro to hold this rank in the Regular Army. He

appointed the commander of reserve officers' training at Howard University,

Col. Campbell C. Johnson, Special Aide to the Director of Selective Service.

And, finally, he named Judge William H. Hastie, dean of the Howard University

Law School, Civilian Aide to the Secretary of War.



<p>A successful lawyer, Judge Hastie entered upon his new assignment with

several handicaps. Because of his long association with black causes, some

civil rights organizations assumed that Hastie would be their man in Washington

and regarded his duties as an extension of their crusade against discrimination.

Hastie's War Department superiors, on the other hand, assumed that his

was a public relations job and expected him to handle all complaints and

mobilization problems as had his World War I predecessor, Emmett J. Scott.

Both assumptions proved false. Hastie was evidently determined to break

the racial logjam in the War Department, yet unlike many civil rights advocates

he seemed willing to pay the price of slow progress to obtain lasting improvement.

According to those who knew him, Hastie was confident that he could demonstrate

to War Department officials that the Army's racial policies were both inefficient

and unpatriotic. <sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>



<p>Judge Hastie spent his first ten months in office observing what was

happening to the Negro in the Army. He did not like what he saw. To him,

separating black soldiers from white soldiers was a fundamental error.

First, the effect on black morale was devastating. "Beneath the surface,"

he wrote, "is widespread discontent. Most white persons are unable to appreciate

the rancor and bitterness which the Negro, as a matter of self-preservation,

has learned to hide beneath a smile, a joke, or merely an impassive face."

The inherent paradox of trying to inculcate pride, dignity, and aggressiveness

in a black soldier while inflicting on him the segregationist's concept

of the Negro's place in society created In him an insupportable tension.

Second, segregation wasted black manpower, a valuable military asset. It

was impossible, Hastie charged, to employ skilled Negroes at maximum efficiency

rhythm the traditionally narrow limitations of black units. Third, to insist

on an inflexible separation of white and black soldiers was "the most dramatic

evidence of hypocrisy" in America's professed concern for preserving democracy.



<p>JUDGE HASTIE [Photgraph not included.]



<p>Although he appreciated the impossibility of making drastic changes

overnight, Judge Hastie was disturbed because he found "no apparent disposition

to make a beginning or a trial of any different plan." He looked for some

form of progressive integration classified and assigned, not by race, by

which qualified Negroes could be but as individuals, according to their

capacities and abilities.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>



<p>Judge Hastie gained little support from the Secretary of War, Henry

L. Stimson, or the Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, when he

called for progressive integration. Both considered the Army's segregated

units to be in accord with prevailing public sentiment against mixing the

races in the intimate association of military life. More to the point,

both Stimson and Marshall were sensitive to military tradition, and segregated

units had been a part of the Army since 1863. Stimson embraced segregation

readily. While conveying to the President that he was "sensitive to the

individual tragedy which went with it to the colored man himself," he nevertheless

urged Roosevelt not to place "too much responsibility on a race which was

not showing initiative in battle."<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Stimson's

attitude was not unusual for the times. He professed to believe in civil

rights for every citizen, but he opposed social integration. He never tried

to reconcile these seemingly inconsistent views; in fact, he probably did

not consider them inconsistent. Stimson blamed what he termed Eleanor Roosevelt's

"intrusive and impulsive folly" for some of the criticism visited upon

the Army's racial policy, just as he inveighed against the "foolish leaders

of the colored race" who were seeking "at bottom social equality," which,

he concluded was out of the question "because of the impossibility of race

mixture by marriage."<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> Influenced by Under

Secretary Robert P. Patterson, Assistant Secretary John J. McCloy, and

Truman K. Gibson, Jr., who was Judge Hastie's successor, but most of all

impressed by the performance of black soldiers themselves, Stimson belatedly

modified his defense of segregation. But throughout the war he adhered

to the traditional arguments of the Army's professional staff.



<p>GENERAL MARSHALL AND SECRETARY STIMSON [Photograph not included.]



<p>General Marshall was a powerful advocate of the views of the Army staff.

He lived up to the letter of the Army's regulations, consistently supporting

measures to eliminate overt discrimination in the wartime Army. At the

same time, he rejected the idea that the Army should take the lead in altering

the racial mores of the nation. Asked for his views on Hastie's "carefully

prepared memo,"<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> General Marshall admitted

that many of the recommendations were sound but said that Judge Hastie's

proposals

<br><font size="-1">would be tantamount to solving a social problem which

has perplexed the American people throughout the history of this nation.

The Army cannot accomplish such a solution and should not be charged with

the undertaking. The settlement of vexing racial problems cannot be permitted

to complicate the tremendous task of the War Department and thereby jeopardize

discipline and morale. </font><sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>



<p>As Chief of Staff, Marshall faced the tremendous task of creating in

haste a large Army to deal with the Axis menace. Since for several practical

reasons the bulk of that Army would be trained in the south where its conscripts

would be subject to southern laws, Marshall saw no alternative but to postpone

reform. The War Department, he said, could not ignore the social relationship

between blacks and whites, established by custom and habit. Nor could it

ignore the fact that the "level of intelligence and occupational skill"

of the black population was considerably below that of whites. Though he

agreed that the Army would reach maximum strength only if individuals were

placed according to their abilities, he concluded that experiments to solve

social problems would be "fraught with danger to efficiency, discipline,

and morale." In sum, Marshall saw no reason to change the policy approved

by the President less than a year before. <sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>



<p>The Army's leaders and the secretary's civilian aide had reached an

impasse on the question of policy even before the country entered the war.

And though the use of black troops in World War I was not entirely satisfactory

even to its defenders, <sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> there appeared to

be no time now, in view of the larger urgency of winning the war, to plan

other approaches, try other solutions, or tamper with an institution that

had won victory in the past. Further ordering the thoughts of some senior

Army officials was their conviction that wide-scale mixing of the races

in the services might, as Under Secretary Patterson phrased it, foment

social revolution.<sup><a href="#13">l3</a></sup>



<p>These opinions were clearly evident on 8 December 1941, the day the

United States entered World War II, when the Army's leaders met with a

group of black publishers and editors. Although General Marshall admitted

that he was not satisfied with the department's progress in racial matters

and promised further changes, the conference concluded with a speech by

a representative of The Adjutant General who delivered what many considered

the final word on integration during the war.

<br><font size="-1">The Army is made up of individual citizens of the United

States who have pronounced views with respect to the Negro just as they

have individual ideas with respect to other matters in their daily walk

of life. Military orders, fiat, or dicta, will not change their viewpoints.

The Army then cannot be made the means of engendering conflict among the

mass of people because of a stand with respect to Negroes which is not

compatible with the position attained by the Negro in civil life .... The

Army is not a sociological laboratory; to be effective it must be organized

and trained according to the principles which will insure success. Experiments

to meet the wishes and demands of the champions of every race and creed

for the solution of their problems are a danger to efficiency, discipline

and morale and would result in ultimate defeat</font>. <sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>



<p>The civil rights advocates refused to concede that the discussion was

over. Judge Hastie, along with a sizable segment of the black press, believed

that the beginning of a world war was the time to improve military effectiveness

by increasing black participation in that war.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup>

They argued that eliminating segregation was part of the struggle to preserve

democracy, the transcendent issue of the war, and they viewed the unvarying

pattern of separate black units as consonant with the racial theories of

Nazi Germany.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> Their continuing efforts to

eliminate segregation and discrimination eventually brought Hastie a sharp

reminder from John J. McCloy. "Frankly, I do not think that the basic issues

of this war are involved in the question of whether colored troops serve

in segregated units or in mixed units and I doubt whether you can convince

people of the United States that the basic issues of freedom are involved

in such a question." For Negroes, he warned sternly, the basic issue was

that if the United States lost the war, the lot of the black community

would be far worse off, and some Negroes "do not seem to be vitally concerned

about winning the war." What all Negroes ought to do, he counseled, was

to give unstinting support to the war effort in anticipation of benefits

certain to come after victory. <sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>



<p>Thus very early in World War II, even before the United States was actively

engaged, the issues surrounding the use of Negroes in the Army were well

defined and the lines sharply drawn. Was segregation, a practice in conflict

with the democratic aims of the country, also a wasteful use of manpower?

How would modifications of policy come�through external pressure or internal

reform? Could traditional organizational and social patterns in the military

services be changed during a war without disrupting combat readiness?

<center><i>Segregation and Efficiency</i></center>





<p><font size="+0">In the years before World War II, Army planners never

had to consider segregation in terms of manpower efficiency. Conditioned

by the experiences of World War I, when the nation had enjoyed a surplus

of untapped manpower even at the height of the war, and aware of the overwhelming

manpower surplus</font> of the depression years, the staff formulated its

mobilization plans with little regard for the economical use of the nation's

black manpower. Its decision to use Negroes in proportion to their percentage

of the population was the result of political pressures rather than military

necessity. Black combat units were considered a luxury that existed to

indulge black demands. When the Army began to mobilize in 1940 it proceeded

to honor its pledge, and one year after Pearl Harbor there were 399,454

Negroes in the Army, 7.4 percent of the total and 7.95 percent of all enlisted

troops.<sup><a href="#18">l8</a></sup>



<p>The effect of segregation on manpower efficiency became apparent only

as the Army tried to translate policy into practice. In the face of rising

black protest and with direct orders from the White House, the Army had

announced that Negroes would be assigned to all arms and branches in the

same ratio as whites. Several forces, however, worked against this equitable

distribution. During the early months of mobilization the chiefs of those

arms and services that had traditionally been all white accepted less than

their share of black recruits and thus obliged some organizations, the

Quartermaster Corps and the Engineer Corps in particular, to absorb a large

percentage of black inductees. The imbalance worsened in 1941. In December

of that year Negroes accounted for 5 percent of the Infantry and less than

2 percent each of the Air Corps, Medical Corps, and Signal Corps. The Quartermaster

Corps was 15 percent black, the Engineer Corps 25 percent, and unassigned

and miscellaneous detachments were 27 percent black.



<p>The rejection of black units could not always be ascribed to racism

alone. With some justification the arms and services tried to restrict

the number and distribution of Negroes because black units measured far

below their white counterparts in educational achievement and ability to

absorb training, according to the Army General Classification Test (AGCT).

The Army had introduced this test system in March 1941 as its principal

instrument for the measurement of a soldier's learning ability. Five categories,

with the most gifted in category I, were used in classifying the scores

made by the soldiers taking the test <i>(Table 1). </i>The Army planned

to take officers and enlisted specialists from the top three categories

and the semiskilled soldiers and laborers from the two lowest.



<p>Although there was considerable confusion on the subject, basically

the Army's mental tests measured educational achievement rather than native

intelligence, and in 1941 educational achievement in the United States

hinged more on geography and economics than color. Though black and white

recruits of comparable educations made comparable scores, the majority

of Negroes came from areas of the country where inferior schools combined

with economic and cultural poverty to put them at a significant disadvantage.

<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> Many whites

<p>suffered similar disadvantages, and in absolute numbers more whites

than blacks appeared in the lower categories. But whereas the Army could

distribute the low-scoring white soldiers throughout the service so that

an individual unit could easily absorb its few illiterate and semiliterate

white men, the Army was obliged to assign an almost equal number of low-scoring

Negroes to the relatively few black units where they could neither be absorbed

nor easily trained. By the same token, segregation penalized the educated

Negro whose talents were likely to be wasted when he was assigned to service

units along with the unskilled.



<p>Segregation further hindered the efficient use of black manpower by

complicating the training of black soldiers. Although training facilities

were at a premium, the Army was forced to provide its training and replacement

centers with separate housing and other facilities. With an extremely limited

number of Regular Army Negroes to draw from, the service had to create

cadres for the new units and find officers to lead them. Black recruits

destined for most arms and services were assured neither units, billets,

nor training cadres. The Army's solution to the problem: lower the quotas

for black inductees.



<p>The use of quotas to regulate inductees by race was itself a source

of tension between the Army and the Bureau of Selective Service.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>

Selective Service questioned the legality of the whole procedure whereby

white and black selectees were delivered on the basis of separate calls;

in many areas of the country draft boards were under attack for passing

over large numbers of Negroes in order to fill these racial quotas. With

the Navy depending exclusively on volunteers Selective Service had by early

1943 a backlog of 300,000 black registrants who according to their order

numbers, should have been called to service but had been passed over. Selective

Service wanted to eliminate the quota system altogether. At the very least

it demanded that the Army accept more Negroes to adjust the racial imbalance

of the draft rolls. The Army, determined to preserve the quota system,

tried to satisfy the Selective Service's minimum demands, making room for

more black inductees by forcing its arms and<b> </b>services to create

more black units. Again the cost to efficiency was high.

<br>&nbsp;



<p><font size="-1">Under the pressure of providing sufficient units for Negroes,

the organization of units for the sake of guaranteeing vacancies became

a major goal. In some cases, careful examination of the usefulness of the

types of units provided was subordinated to the need to create units which

could receive Negroes. As a result, several types of units with limited

military value were formed in some branches for the specific purpose of

absorbing otherwise unwanted Negroes. Conversely, certain types of units

with legitimate and important military functions were filled with Negroes

who could not function efficiently in the tasks to which they were assigned</font>.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>

<p>The practice of creating units for the specific purpose of absorbing

Negroes was particularly evident in the Army Air Forces.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>

Long considered the most recalcitrant of branches in accepting Negroes,

the Air Corps had successfully exempted itself from the allotment of black

troops in the 1940 mobilization plans. Black pilots could not be used,

Maj. Gen. Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, explained, "since this

would result in having Negro officers serving over white enlisted men.

This would create an impossible social problem."<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup>

And this situation could not be avoided, since it would take several years

to train black mechanics; meanwhile black pilots would have to work with

white ground crews, often at distant bases outside their regular chain

of command. The Air Corps faced strong opposition when both the civil rights

advocates and the rest of the Army attacked this exclusion. The civil rights

organizations wanted a place for Negroes in the glamorous Air Corps, but

even more to the point the other arms and services wanted this large branch

of the Army to absorb its fair share of black recruits, thus relieving

the rest of a disproportionate burden.



<p>SERGEANT DRESSING THE LINE. <i>Aviation squadron standing inspection,

<p>When the War Department supported these demands the Army Air Forces

capitulated. Its 1941 mobilization plans provided for the formation of

nine separate black aviation squadrons which would perform the miscellaneous

tasks associated with the upkeep of airfields. During the next year the

Chief of Staff set the allotment of black recruits for the air arm at a

rate that brought over 77,500 Negroes into the Air Corps by 1943. On 16

January 1941 Under Secretary Patterson announced the formation of a black

pursuit squadron, but the Army Air Forces, bowing to the opposition typified

by General Arnold's comments of the previous year, trained the black pilots

in separate facilities at Tuskegee, Alabama, where the Army tried to duplicate

the expensive training center established for white officers at Maxwell

Field, just forty miles away.<sup><a href="#24">24</a> </sup>Black pilots

were at first trained exclusively for pursuit flying, a very difficult

kind of combat for which a Negro had to qualify both physically and technically

or else, in Judge Hastie's words, "not fly at all."<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup>

The 99th Fighter Squadron was organized at Tuskegee in 1941 and sent to

the Mediterranean theater in April 1943. By then the all-black 332d Fighter

Group with three additional fighter squadrons had been organized, and in

1944 it too was deployed to the Mediterranean.

<p>These squadrons could use only a limited number of pilots, far fewer

than those black cadets qualified for such training. All applicants in

excess of requirements were placed on an indefinite waiting list where

many became overage or were requisitioned for other military and civilian

duties. Yet when the Army Air Forces finally decided to organize a black

bomber unit, the 477th Bombardment Group, in late 1943, it encountered

a scarcity of black pilots and crewmen. Because of the lack of technical

and educational opportunities for Negroes in America, fewer blacks than

whites were included in the manpower pool, and Tuskegee, already overburdened

with its manifold training functions and lacking the means to train bomber

crews, was unable to fill the training gap. Sending black cadets to white

training schools was one obvious solution the Army Air Forces chose instead

to postpone the operational date of the 477th until its pilots could be

trained at Tuskegee. In the end, the 477th was not declared operational

until after the war. Even then some compromise with the Army Air Forces'

segregation principles was necessary, since Tuskegee could not accommodate

B-25 pilot transition and navigator-bombardier training. In 1944 black

officers were therefore temporarily assigned to formerly all-white schools

for such training. Tuskegee's position as the sole and separate training

center for black pilots remained inviolate until its closing in 1946, however,

and its graduates, the "Tuskegee Airmen," continued to serve as a powerful

symbol of armed forces segregation.<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>



<p>Training for black officer candidates other than flyers, like that of

most officer candidates throughout the Army, was integrated. At first the

possibility of integrated training seemed unlikely, for even though Assistant

Secretary of War for Air Robert A. Lovett had assured Hastie that officer

candidate training would be integrated, the Technical Training Command

announced plans in 1942 for a segregated facility. Although the plans were

quickly canceled the command's announcement was the immediate cause for

Hastie's resignation from the War Department. The Air staff assured the

Assistant Secretary of War in January of 1943 that qualified Negroes were

being sent to officer candidate schools and to training courses "throughout

the school system of the Technical Training Command."<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>

In fact, Negroes did attend the Air Forces' officer candidate school at

Miami Beach, although not in great numbers. In spite of their integrated

training, however, most of these black officers were assigned to the predominantly

black units at Tuskegee and Godman fields.



<p>The Army Air Forces found it easier to absorb the thousands of black

enlisted men than to handle the black flying squadrons. For the enlisted

men it created a series of units with vaguely defined duties, usually common

labor jobs operating for the most part under a bulk allotment system that

allowed the Air Forces to absorb great numbers of new men. Through 1943

hundreds of these aviation training squadrons, quartermaster truck companies,

and engineer aviation and air base security battalions were added to the

Air Forces' organization tables. Practically every American air base in

the world had its contingent of black troops performing the service duties

connected with air operations.



<p>The Air Corps, like the Armor and the Artillery branches, was able to

form separate squadrons or battalions for black troops, but the Infantry

and Cavalry found it difficult to organize the growing number of separate

black battalions and regiments. The creation of black divisions was the

obvious solution, although this arrangement would run counter to current

practice, which was based in part on the Army's experience with the 92d

Division in World War I. Convinced of the poor performance of that unit

in 1918, the War Department had decided in the 1920's not to form any more

black divisions. The regiment would serve as the basic black unit, and

from time to time these regiments would be employed as organic elements

of divisions whose other regiments and units would be white. In keeping

with this decision, the black 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments were combined

in October 1940 with white regiments to form the 2d Cavalry Division.



<p>Before World War II most black leaders had agreed with the Army's opposition

to all-black divisions, but for different reasons. They considered that

such divisions only served to strengthen the segregation pattern they so

opposed. In the early weeks of the war a conference of black editors, including

Walter White, pressed for the creation of an experimental integrated division

of volunteers. White argued that such a unit would lift black morale, "have

a tremendous psychological effect upon white America," and refute the enemy's

charge that "the United States talks about democracy but practices racial

discrimination and segregation."<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> The NAACP

organized a popular movement in support of the idea, which was endorsed

by many important individuals and organizations.<sup><a href="#29">29</a>

</sup>Yet this experiment was unacceptable to the Army. Ignoring its experience

with all-volunteer paratroopers and other special units, the War Department

declared that the volunteer system was "an ineffective and dangerous" method

of raising combat units. Admitting that the integrated division might be

an encouraging gesture toward certain minorities, General Marshall added

that "the urgency of the present military situation necessitates our using

tested and proved methods of procedure, and using them with all haste.

" <sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>



<p>Even though it rejected the idea of a volunteer, integrated division,

the Army staff reviewed in the fall of 1942 a proposal for the assignment

of some black recruits to white units. The Organization-Mobilization Group

of G-3, headed by Col. Edwin W. Chamberlain, argued that the Army General

Classification Test scores proved that black soldiers in groups were less

useful to the Army than white soldiers in groups. It was a waste of manpower,

funds, and equipment, therefore, to organize the increasingly large numbers

of black recruits into segregated units. Not only was such organization

wasteful, but segregation "aggravated if not caused in its entirety" the

racial friction that was already plaguing the Army. To avoid both the waste

and the strife, Chamberlain recommended that the Army halt the activation

of additional black units and integrate black recruits in the low-score

categories, IV and V, into white units in the ratio of one black to nine

whites. The black recruits would be used as cooks, orderlies, and drivers,

and in other jobs which required only the minimum basic training and which

made up 10 to 20 percent of those in the average unit. Negroes in the higher

categories, I through III, would be assigned to existing black units where

they could be expected to improve the performance of those units. Chamberlain

defended his plan against possible charges of discrimination by pointing

out that the Negroes would be assigned wholly on the basis of native capacity,

not race, and that this plan would increase the opportunities for Negroes

to participate in the war effort. To those who objected on the grounds

that the proposal meant racial integration, Chamberlain replied that there

was no more integration involved than in "the employment of Negroes as

servants in a white household."<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup>



<p>The Chamberlain Plan and a variant proposed the following spring prompted

discussion in the Army staff that clearly revealed general dissatisfaction

with the current policy. Nonetheless, in the face of opposition from the

service and ground forces, the plan was abandoned. Yet because something

had to be done with the mounting numbers of black draftees, the Army staff

reversed the decision made in its prewar mobilization plans and turned

once more to the concept of the all-black division. The 93d Infantry Division

was reactivated in the spring of 1942 and the 92d the following fall. The

2d Cavalry Division was reconstituted as an all-black unit and reactivated

in February 1943. These units were capable of absorbing 15,000 or more

men each and could use men trained in the skills of practically every arm

and service.



<p>This absorbency potential became increasingly important in 1943 when

the chairman of the War Manpower Commission, Paul V. McNutt, began to attack

the use of racial quotas in selecting inductees. He considered the practice

of questionable legality, and the commission faced mounting public criticism

as white husbands and fathers were drafted while single healthy Negroes

were not called.<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup> Secretary Stimson defended

the legality of the quota system. He did not consider the current practice

"discriminatory in any way" so long as the Army accepted its fair percentage

of Negroes. He pointed out that the Selective Service Act provided that

no man would be inducted <i>"unless and until" </i>he was acceptable to

the services, and Negroes were acceptable "only at a rate at which they

can be properly assimilated."<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup> Stimson later

elaborated on this theme arguing that the quota system would be necessary

even after the Army reached full strength because inductions would be limited

to replacement of losses. Since there were few Negroes in combat, their

losses would be considerably less than those of whites. McNutt disagreed

with Stimson's interpretation of the law and announced plans to abandon

it as soon as the current backlog of uninducted Negroes was absorbed, a

date later set for January 1944.<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup>



<p>A crisis over the quota system was averted when, beginning in the spring

of 1943, the Army's monthly manpower demands outran the ability of the

Bureau of Selective Service to provide black inductees. So long as the

Army requested more Negroes than the bureau could supply, little danger

existed that McNutt would carry out his threat.<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup>

But it was no victory for the Army. The question of the quota's legality

remained unanswered, and it appeared that the Army might be forced to abandon

the system at some future time when there was a black surplus.



<p>There were many reasons for the sudden shortage of black inductees in

the spring of 1943. Since more Negroes were leaving the service for health

or other reasons, the number of calls for black draftees had increased.

In addition, local draft boards were rejecting more Negroes. But the basic

reason for the shortage was that the magnitude of the war had finally turned

the manpower surpluses of the 1930's into manpower shortages, and the shortages

were appearing in black as well as white levies for the armed forces. The

Negro was no longer a manpower luxury. The quota calls for Negroes rose

in 1944, and black strength stood at 701,678 men in September, approximately

9.6 percent of the whole Army.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup> The percentage

of black women in the Army stayed at less than 6 percent of the Women's

Army Auxiliary Corps-after July 1943 the Women's Army Corps-throughout

the war. Training and serving under the same racial policy that governed

the employment of men, the women's corps also had a black recruitment goal

of 10 percent, but despite the active efforts of recruiters and generally

favorable publicity from civil rights groups, the volunteer organization

was unable to overcome the attitude among young black women that they would

not be well received at Army posts.<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup>



<p>Faced with manpower shortages, the Army began to reassess its plan to

distribute Negroes proportionately throughout the arms and services. The

demand for new service units had soared as the size of the overseas armies

grew while black combat units, unwanted by overseas commanders, had remained

stationed in the United States. The War Department hoped to ease the strain

on manpower resources by converting black combat troops into service troops.

A notable example of the wholesale conversion of such combat troops and

one that received considerable notice in the press was the inactivation

of the 2d Cavalry Division upon its arrival in North Africa in March 1944.

Victims of the change included the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments, historic

combat units that had fought with distinction in the Indian wars, with

Teddy Roosevelt in Cuba, and in the Philippine Insurrection. <sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup>



<p>By trying to justify the conversion, Secretary Stimson only aggravated

the controversy. In the face of congressional questions and criticism in

the black press, Stimson declared that the decision stemmed from a study

of the relative abilities and status of training of the troops in the units

available for conversion. If black units were particularly affected, it

was because "many of the Negro units have been unable to master efficiently

the techniques of modern weapons."<sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup> Thus,

by the end of 1944, the Army had abandoned its attempt to maintain a balance

between black combat and service units, and during the rest of the war<u>

</u>most Negroes were assigned to service units.



<p>According to the War Department, the relationship between Negroes and

the Army was a mutual obligation. Negroes had the right and duty to serve

their country to the best of their abilities; the Army had the right and

the duty to see that they did so. True, the use of black troops was made

difficult because their schooling had been largely inferior and their work

therefore chiefly unskilled. Nevertheless, the Army staff concluded, all

races were equally endowed for war and most of the less mentally alert

could fight if properly led.<sup><a href="#40">40</a></sup> A manual on

leadership observed:

<br>
  <font size="-1">War Department concern with the Negro is focused directly and 
  solely on the problem of the most effective use of colored troops .... the Army 
  has no authority or intention to participate in social reform as such but does 
  view the problem as a matter of efficient troop utilization. With an imposed 
  ceiling on the maximum strength of the Army it is the responsibility of all 
  officers to assure the most efficient use of the manpower assigned</font>.<sup><a href="#41">41</a></sup> 
<p>But the best efforts of good officers could not avail against poor policy.

Although the Army maintained that Negroes had to bear a proportionate of

the casualties, by policy it assigned the majority to noncombat units and

thus withheld the chance for them to assume an equal risk. Subscribing

to the advantage of making full use of individual abilities, the Army nevertheless

continued to consider Negroes as a group and to insist that military efficiency

required racially segregated units. Segregation in turn burdened the senice

with the costly provision of separate facilities for the races. Although

a large number of Negroes served in World War II, their employment was

limited in opportunity and expensive for the service.

<center><i>The Need for Change</i></center>





<p>If segregation weakened the Army's organization for global war, it had

even more serious effects on every tenth soldier, for as it deepened the

Negro's sense of inferiority it devastated his morale. It was a major cause

of the poor performance and the disciplinary problems that plagued so many

black units. And it made black soldiers blame their personal difficulties

and misfortunes, many the common lot of any soldier, on racial discrimination.<sup><a href="#42">42</a></sup>



<p>Deteriorating morale in black units and pressure from a critical audience

of articulate Negroes and their sympathizers led the War Department to

focus special attention on its race problem. Early in the war Secretary

Stimson had agreed with a General Staff recommendation that a permanent

committee be formed to evaluate racial incidents, propose special reforms,

and answer questions involving the training and assignment of Negroes.<sup><a href="#43">43</a></sup>

On 27 August 1942 he established the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop

Policies, with Assistant Secretary McCloy as chairman.<sup><a href="#44">44</a></sup>

Caught in the cross fire of black demands and Army traditions, the committee

contented itself at first with collecting information on the racial situation

and acting as a clearinghouse for recommendations on the employment of

black troops.<sup><a href="#45">45</a></sup>



<p>SERVICE CLUB, FORT HUACHUCA [Photograph not included.]



<p>Serious racial trouble was developing by the end of the first year of

the war. The trouble was a product of many factors, including the psychological

effects of segregation which may not have been so obvious to the committee

or even to the black soldier. Other factors, however, were visible to all

and begged for remedial action. For example, the practice of using racially

separated facilities on military posts, which was not sanctioned in the

Army's basic plan for black troops, took hold early in the war. Many black

units were located at camps in the south, where commanders insisted on

applying local laws and customs inside the

<br>military reservations. This practice spread rapidly, and soon in widely

separated sections of the country commanders were separating the races

in theaters, post exchanges, service clubs, and buses operating on posts.

The accommodations provided Negroes were separate but rarely equal, and

substandard recreational and housing facilities assigned to black troops

were a constant source of irritation. In fact the Army, through the actions

of local commanders, actually introduced Jim Crow in some places at home

and abroad. Negroes considered such practices in violation of military

regulations and inconsistent with the announced principles for which the

United States was fighting. Many believed themselves the victims of the

personal prejudices of the local commander. Judge Hastie reported their

feelings: "The traditional mores of the South have been widely accepted

and adopted by the Army as the basis of policy and practice affecting the

Negro soldier .... In tactical organization, in physical location, in human

contacts, the Negro soldier is separated from the white soldier as completely

as possible."<sup><a href="#46">46</a></sup>



<p>In November 1941 another controversy erupted over the discovery, that

the Red Cross had established racially segregated blood banks. The Red

Cross readily admitted that it had no scientific justification for the

racial separation of blood and blamed the armed services for the decision.

Despite the evidence of science and at risk of demoralizing the black community,

the Army's Surgeon General defended the controversial practice as necessary

to insure the acceptance of a potentially unpopular program. Ignoring constant

criticism from the NAACP and elements of the black press, the armed forces

continued to demand segregated blood banks throughout the war. Negroes

appreciated the irony of the situation, for they were well aware that a

black doctor, Charles R. Drew, had been a pioneer researcher in the plasma

extraction process and had directed the first Red Cross blood bank.<sup><a href="#47">47</a></sup>



<p>Black morale suffered further in the leadership crisis that developed

in black units early in the war. The logic of segregated units demanded

a black officer corps, but there were never enough black officers to command

all the black units. In 1942 only 0.35 percent of the Negroes in the Army

were officers, a shortcoming that could not be explained by poor education

alone.<sup><a href="#48">48</a></sup> But when the number of black officers

did begin to increase, obstacles to their employment appeared: some white

commanders, assuming that Negroes did not&nbsp; possess leadership ability

and that black troops preferred white officers, demanded white officers

for their units. Limited segregated recreational and living facilities

for black officers prevented their assignment to some bases, while the

active opposition of civilian communities forced the Army to exclude them

from others. The Army staff practice of forbidding Negroes to outrank or

command white officers serving in the same unit not only limited the employment

and restricted the rank of black officers but also created invidious distinctions

between white and black officers in the same unit. It tended to convince

enlisted men that their black leaders were not full-fledged officers. Thus

restricted in assignment and segregated socially and professionally, his

ability and status in question, the black officer was often an object of

scorn to himself and to his men.



<p>The attitude and caliber of white officers assigned to black units hardly

compensated for the lack of black officers. In general, white officers

resented their assignment to black units and were quick to seek transfer.

Worse still, black units, where sensitive and patient leaders were needed

to create an effective military force, often became, as they had in earlier

wars, dumping grounds for officers unwanted in white units.<sup><a href="#49">49</a></sup>

The Army staff further aggravated black sensibilities by showing a preference

for officers of southern birth and training, believing them to be generally

more competent to exercise command over Negroes. In reality many Negroes,

especially those from the urban centers, particularly resented southern

officers. At best these officers appeared paternalistic, and Negroes disliked

being treated as a separate and distinct group that needed special handling

and protection. As General Davis later circumspectly reported, "many colored

people of today expect only a certain line of treatment from white officers

born and reared in the South, namely, that which follows the southern pattern,

which is most distasteful to them."<sup><a href="#50">50</a></sup>



<p>Some of these humiliations might have been less demeaning had the black

soldier been convinced that he was a full partner in the crusade against

fascism. As news of the conversion of black units from combat to service

duties and the word that no new black combat units were being organized

became a matter of public knowledge, the black press asked: Will any black

combat units be left? Will any of those left be allowed to fight? In fact,

would black units ever get overseas?



<p>Actually, the Army had a clear-cut plan for the overseas employment

of both black service and combat units. In May 1942 the War Department

directed the Army Air Forces, Ground Forces, and Service Forces to make

sure that black troops were ordered overseas in numbers not less than their

percentage in each of these commands. Theater commanders would be informed

of orders moving black troops to their commands, but they would not be

asked to agree to their shipment beforehand. Since troop shipments to the

British Isles were the chief concern at that time, the order added that

"there will be no positive restrictions on the use of colored troops in

the British Isles, but shipment of colored units to the British Isles will

be limited, initially, to those in the service categories."<sup><a href="#51">51</a></sup>



<p>The problem here was not the Army's policy but the fact that certain

foreign governments and even some commanders in American territories wanted

to exclude Negroes. Some countries objected to black soldiers because they

feared race riots and miscegenation. Others with large black populations

of their own felt that black soldiers with their higher rates of pay might

create unrest. Still other countries had national exclusion laws. In the

case of Alaska and Trinidad Secretary Stimson ordered, "Don't yield." Speaking

of Iceland, Greenland and Labrador, he commented, "Pretty cold for blacks."

To the request of Panamanian officials that a black signal construction

unit be withdrawn from their country he replied, "Tell them [the black

unit] they must complete their work�it is ridiculous to raise such objections

when the Panama Canal itself was built with black labor." As for Chile

and Venezuela's exclusion of Negroes he ruled that "As we are the petitioners

here we probably must comply."<sup><a href="#52">52</a></sup> Stimson's

rulings led to a new War Department policy: henceforth black soldiers would

be assigned without regard to color except that they would not be sent

to extreme northern areas or to any country against its will when the United

States had requested the right to station troops in that country.<sup><a href="#53">53</a></sup>



<p>Ultimately, theater commanders decided which troops would be committed

to action and which units would be needed overseas, their decisions were

usually respected by the War Department where few believed that Washington

should dictate such matters. Unwilling to add racial problems to their

administrative burdens, some commanders had been known to cancel their

request for troops rather than accept black units. Consequently, very few

Negroes were sent overseas in the early years of the war.



<p>Black soldiers were often the victims of gross discrimination that transcended

their difficulties with the Army's administration. For instance, black

soldiers, particularly those from more integrated regions of the country,

resented local ordinances governing transportation and recreation facilities

that put them at a great disadvantage in the important matters of leave

and amusement. Infractions of local rules were inevitable and led to heightened

racial tension and recurring violence.<sup><a href="#54">54</a></sup> At

times black soldiers themselves, reflecting the low morale and lack of

discipline in their units, instigated the violence. Whoever the culprits,

the Army's files are replete with cases of discrimination charged, investigations

launched, and exonerations issued or reforms ordered.<sup><a href="#55">55</a></sup>

An incredible amount of time and effort went into handling these cases

during the darkest

<br>days of the war�cases growing out of a policy created in the name of

military efficiency.



<p>Nor was the violence limited to the United States Racial friction also

developed in Great Britain where some American troops, resenting their

black countrymen's social acceptance by the British, tried to export Jim

Crow by forcing the segregation of recreational facilities. Appreciating

the treatment they were receiving from the British, the black soldiers

fought back, and the clashes grew at times to riot proportions. General

Davis considered discrimination and prejudice the cause of trouble, but

he placed the immediate blame on local commanders. Many commanders, convinced

that they had little jurisdiction over racial disputes in the civilian

community or simply refusing to accept responsibility, delegated the task

of keeping order to their noncommissioned officers and military police.<sup><a href="#56">56</a></sup>

These men, rarely experienced in handling racial disturbances and often

prejudiced against black soldiers, usually managed to exacerbate the situation.



<p>In an atmosphere charged with rumors and counterrumors, personal incidents

involving two men might quickly blow up into riots involving hundreds.

In the summer of 1943 the Army began to reap what Ulysees Lee called the

"harvest of disorder." Race riots occurred at military reservations in

Mississippi, Georgia, California, Texas, and Kentucky. At other stations,

the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies somberly warned, there were

indications of unrest ready to erupt into violence.<sup><a href="#57">57</a></sup>

By the middle of the war, violence over racial issues at home and abroad

had become a source of constant concern for the War Department.

<center><i>Internal Reform: Amending RaciaI Practices</i></center>





<p>Concern over troop morale and discipline and the attendant problem of

racial violence did not lead to a substantial revision of the Army's racial

policy. On the contrary, the Army staff continued to insist that segregation

was a national issue and that the Army's task was to defend the country,

not alter its social customs. Until the nation changed its racial practices

or until Congress ordered such changes for the armed forces, racially separated

units would remain.<sup><a href="#58">58</a></sup> In 1941 the Army had

insisted that debate on the subject was closed,<sup><a href="#59">59</a></sup>

and, in fact, except for discussion of the Chamberlain Plan there was no

serious thought of revising racial policy in the Army staff until after

the war.



<p>Had the debate been reopened in 1943, the traditionalists on the Army

staff would have found new support for their views in a series of surveys

made of white and black soldiers in 1942 and 1943. These surveys supported

the theory that the Army, a national institution composed of individual

citizens with pronounced views on race, would meet massive disobedience

and internal disorder as well as national resistance to any substantial

change in policy. One extensive survey, covering 13,000 soldiers in ninety-two

units, revealed that 88 percent of the whites and 38 percent of the Negroes

preferred segregated units. Among the whites, 85 percent preferred separate

service clubs and 81 percent preferred separate post exchanges. Almost

half of the Negroes thought separate service clubs and post exchanges were

a good idea.<sup><a href="#60">60</a> </sup>These attitudes merely reflected

widely held national views as suggested in a 1943 survey of five key cities

by the Office of War Information.<sup><a href="#61">61</a></sup> The survey

showed that 90 percent of the whites and 25 percent of the blacks questioned

supported segregation.



<p>Some Army officials considered justification by statistics alone a risky

business. Reviewing the support for segregation revealed in the surveys,

for example, the Special Services Division commented: "Many of the Negroes

and some of the whites who favor separation in the Army indicate by their

comments that they are opposed to segregation in principle. They favor

separation in the Army to avoid trouble or unpleasantness." Its report

added that the longer a Negro remained in the Army, the less likely he

was to support segregation.<sup><a href="#62">62</a></sup> Nor did it follow

from the overwhelming support for segregation that a policy of integration

would result in massive resistance. As critics later pointed out, the same

surveys revealed that almost half the respondents expressed a strong preference

for civilian life, but the Army did not infer that serious disorders would

result if these men were forced to remain in uniform.<sup><a href="#63">63</a></sup>



<p>By 1943 Negroes within and without the War Department had just about

exhausted arguments for a policy change. After two years of trying, Judge

Hastie came to believe that change was possible only in response to "strong

and manifest public opinion." He concluded that he would be far more useful

as a private citizen who could express his views freely and publicly than

he was as a War Department employee, bound to conform to official policy.

Quitting the department, Hastie joined the increasingly vocal black organizations

in a sustained attack on the Army's segregation policy, an attack that

was also being translated into political action by the major civil rights

organizations. In 1943, a full year before the national elections, representatives

of twenty-five civil rights groups met and formulated the demands they

would make of the presidential candidates: full integration (some groups

tempered this demand by calling for integrated units of volunteers); abolition

of racial quotas; abolition of segregation in recreational and other Army

facilities; abolition of blood plasma segregation; development of an educational

program in race relations in the Army; greater black participation in combat

forces; and the progressive removal of black troops from areas where they

were subject to disrespect, abuse, and even violence.<sup><a href="#64">64</a></sup>



<p>The Army could not afford to ignore these demands completely, as Truman

K. Gibson, Jr., Judge Hastie's successor, pointed out.<sup><a href="#65">65</a></sup>

The political situation indicated that the racial policy of the armed forces

would be an issue in the next national election. Recalling the changes

forced on the Army as a result of political pressures applied before the

1940 election, Gibson predicted that actions that might now seem impolitic

to the Army and the White House might not seem so during the next campaign

when the black vote could influence the outcome in several important states,

including New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Michigan. Already the Chicago

<i>Tribune </i>and other antiadministration groups were trying to encourage

black protest in terms not always accurate but nonetheless believable to

the black voter. Gibson suggested that the Army act before the political

pressure became even more intense.<sup><a href="#66">66</a></sup>



<p>Caught between the black demands and War Department traditions, the

Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies launched an attack�much too

late and too weak, its critics agreed�on what it perceived as the causes

of the Army's racial disorders. Some of the credit for this attack must

go to Truman Gibson. No less dedicated to abolition of racial segregation

than Hastie, Gibson eschewed the grand gesture and emphasized those practical

changes that could be effected one step at a time. For all his zeal, Gibson

was admirably detached.<sup><a href="#67">67</a></sup> He knew that his

willingness to recognize that years of oppression and injustice had marred

the black soldier's performance would earn for him the scorn of many civil

rights activists, but he also know that his fairness made him an effective

advocate in the War Department. He worked closely with McCloy's committee,

always describing with his alternatives for action their probable effect

upon the Army, the public, and the developing military situation. As a

result of the close cooperation between the Advisory Committee and Gibson

the Army for the first time began to agree on practical if not policy changes.



<p>The Advisory Committee's first campaign was directed at local commanders.

After a long review of the evidence, the committee was convinced that the

major cause of racial disorder was the failure of commanders in some echelons

to appreciate the seriousness of racial unrest and their own responsibility

for dealing with the discipline, morale, and welfare of their men. Since

it found that most disturbances began with real or fancied incidents of

discrimination, the committee concluded that there should be no discrimination

against Negroes in the matter of privileges and accommodations and none

in favor of Negroes that compromised disciplinary standards. The committee

wanted local commanders to be reminded that maintaining proper discipline

and good order among soldiers, and between soldiers and civilians, was

a definite command responsibility.<sup><a href="#68">68</a></sup>



<p>General Marshall incorporated the committee's recommendations in a letter

to the field. He concluded by saying that "failure on the part of any commander

to concern himself personally and vigorously with this problem will be

considered as evidence of lack of capacity and cause for reclassification

and removal from assignment."<sup><a href="#69">69</a></sup> At the same

time, the Chief of Staff did not adopt several of the committee's specific

recommendations. He did not require local commanders to recommend changes

in War Department policy on the treatment of Negroes and the organization

and employment of black units. Nor did he require them to report on steps

taken by them to follow the committee's recommendations. Moreover, he did

not order the dispatch of black combat units to active theaters although

the committee had pointed to this course as "the most effective means of

reducing tension among Negro troops."



<p>Next, the Advisory Committee turned its attention to the black press.

Judge Hastie and the representatives of the senior civil rights organizations

were judicious in their criticism and accurate in their charges, but this

statement could not be made for much of the black press. Along with deserting

credit for spotlighting racial injustices and giving a very real impetus

to racial progress, a segment of the black press had to share the blame

for fomenting racial disorder by the frequent publication of inaccurate

and inflammatory war stories. Some field commanders charged that the constant

criticism was detrimental to troop morale and demanded that the War Department

investigate and even censor particular black newspapers. In July 1943 the

Army Service Forces recommended that General Marshall officially warn the

editors against printing inciting and untrue stories and suggested that

if this caution failed sedition proceedings be instituted against the culprits.<sup><a href="#70">70</a></sup>

General Marshall followed a more moderate course suggested by Assistant

Secretary McCloy.<sup><a href="#71">71</a></sup> The Army staff amplified

and improved the services of the Bureau of Public Relations by appointing

Negroes to the bureau and by releasing more news items of special interest

to black journalists. The result was a considerable increase in constructive

and accurate stories on black participation in the war, although articles

and editorials continued to be severely critical of the Army's segregation

policy.



<p>The proposal to send black units into combat, rejected by Marshall when

raised by the Advisory Committee in 1943, became the preeminent racial

issue in the Army during the next year.<sup><a href="#72">72</a> </sup>It

was vitally necessary, the Advisory Committee reasoned, that black troops

not be wasted by leaving them to train endlessly in camps around the country,

and that the War Department begin making them a "military asset." In March

1944 it recommended to Secretary Stimson that black units be introduced

into combat and that units and training schedules be reorganized if necessary

to insure that this deployment be carried out as promptly as possible.

Elaborating on the committee's recommendation, Chairman McCloy added:



<p><font size="-1">There has been a tendency to allow the situation to develop

where selections are made on the basis of efficiency with the result that

the colored units are discarded for combat service, but little is done

by way of studying new means to put them in shape for combat service.</font>

<br><font size="-1">With so large a portion of our population colored, with

the example of the effective use of colored troops (of a much lower order

of intelligence) by other nations, and with the many imponderables that

are connected with the situation, we must, I think, be more affirmative

about the use of our Negro troops. If present methods do not bring them

to combat efficiency, we should change those methods. That is what this

resolution purports to recommend</font>.<sup><a href="#73">73</a></sup>



<p>Stimson agreed, and on 4 March 1944 the Advisory Committee met with

members of the Army staff to decide on combat assignments for regimental

combat teams from the 92d and 93d Divisions. In order that both handpicked

soldiers and normal units might be tested, the team from the 93d would

come from existing units of that division, and the one from the 92d would

be a specially selected group of volunteers. General Marshall and his associates

continued to view the commitment of black combat troops as an experiment

that might provide documentation for the future employment of Negroes in

combat.<sup><a href="#74">74</a></sup> In keeping with this experiment,

the Army staff suggested to field commanders how Negroes might be employed

and requested continuing reports on the units' progress.



<p>The belated introduction of major black units into combat helped alleviate

the Army's racial problems. After elements of the 93d Division were committed

on Bougainville in March 1944 and an advanced group of the 92d landed in

Italy in July, the Army staff found it easier to ship smaller supporting

units to combat theaters, either as separate units or as support for larger

units, a course that reduced the glut of black soldiers stationed in the

United States. Recognizing that many of these units had poor leaders, Lt.

Gen. Lesley J. McNair, head of the Army Ground Forces, ordered that, "if

practicable," all leaders of black units who had not received "excellent"

or higher in their efficiency ratings would be replaced before the units

were scheduled for overseas deployment.<sup><a href="#75">75</a></sup>

Given the "if practicable" loophole, there was little chance that all the

units would go overseas with "excellent" commanders.

shells, cross the West Branch Texas River.</i> [Photograph not included.]



<p>A source of pride to the black community, the troop commitments also

helped to reduce national racial tensions, but they did little for the

average black soldier who remained stationed in the United States. He continued

to suffer discrimination within and without the gates of the camp. The

committee attributed that discrimination to the fact that War Department

policy was not being carried out in all commands. In some instances local

commanders were unaware of the policy; in others they refused to pay sufficient

attention to the seriousness of what was, after all, but one of many problems

facing them. For some time committee members had been urging the War Department

to write special instructions, and finally in February 1944 the department

issued a pamphlet designed to acquaint local commanders with an official

definition of Army racial policy and to improve methods of developing leaders

in black units.&nbsp; <i>Command of Negro Troops </i>was a landmark publication.<sup><a href="#76">76</a></sup>

Its frank statement of the Army's racial problems, its scholarly and objective

discussion of the disadvantages that burdened the black soldier, and its

outline of black rights and responsibilities clearly revealed the committee's

intention to foster racial harmony by promoting greater command responsibility.

The pamphlet represented a major departure from previous practice and served

as a model for later Army and Navy statements on race. <sup><a href="#77">77</a></sup>



<p>But pamphlets alone would not put an end to racial discrimination; the

committee had to go beyond its role of instructor. Although the War Department

had issued a directive on 10 March 1943 forbidding the assignment of any

recreational facility, "including theaters and post exchanges," by race

and requiring the removal of signs labeling facilities for "white" and

"colored" soldiers, there had been little alteration in the recreational

situation. The directive had allowed the separate use of existing facilities

by designated units and camp areas, so that in many places segregation

by unit had replaced separation by race, and inspectors and commanders

reported that considerable. confusion existed over the War Department's

intentions. On other posts the order to remove the racial labels from facilities

was simply disregarded. On 8 July 1944 the committee persuaded the War

Department to issue another directive clearly informing commanders that

facilities could be allocated to specific areas or units, but<b> </b>that

all post exchanges and theaters must be opened to all soldiers regardless

of race. All government transportation, moreover, was to be available to

all troops regardless of race. Nor could soldiers be restricted to certain

sections of government vehicles on or off base, regardless of local customs.<sup><a href="#78">78</a></sup>



<p>Little dramatic change ensued in day-to-day life on base. Some commanders,

emphasizing that part of the directive which allowed the designation of

facilities for units and areas, limited the degree of the directive's application

to post exchanges and theaters and ignored those provisions concerned with

individual rights. This interpretation only added to the racial unrest

that culminated in several incidents, of which the one at the officers'

club at Freeman Field, Indiana, was the most widely publicized.<sup><a href="#79">79</a></sup>

After this incident the committee promptly asked for a revision of WD Pamphlet

20-6 on the command of black troops that would clearly spell out the intention

of the authors of the directive to apply its integration provisions explicitly

to "officers' clubs, messes, or similar social organizations." <sup><a href="#80">80</a></sup>

In effect the War Department was declaring that racial separation applied

to units only. For the first time it made a clear distinction between Army

race policy to be applied on federal military reservations and local civilian

laws and customs to be observed by members of the armed forces when off

post. In Acting Secretary Patterson's words:&nbsp;<font size="-1">&nbsp;</font>



<p><font size="-1">The War Department has maintained throughout the emergency

and present war that it is not an appropriate medium for effecting social

readjustments but has insisted that all soldiers, regardless of race, be

afforded equal opportunity to enjoy the recreational facilities which are

provided at posts, camps and stations. The thought has been that men who

are fulfilling the same obligation, suffering the same dislocation of their

private lives, and wearing the identical uniform should, within the confines

of the military establishment, have the same privileges for rest and relaxations</font>.

<sup><a href="#81">81</a></sup>



<p>Widely disseminated by the black press as the "anti-Jim Crow law," the

directive and its interpretation by senior officials produced the desired

result. Although soldiers most often continued to frequent the facilities

in their own base areas, in effect maintaining racial separation, they

were free to use any facilities, and this knowledge gradually dispelled

some of the tensions on posts where restrictions of movement had been a

constant threat to good order.



<p>With some pride, Assistant Secretary McCloy claimed on his Advisory

Committee's first birthday that the Army had "largely eliminated discrimination

against the Negroes within its ranks, going further in this direction than

the country itself."<sup><a href="#82">82</a></sup> He was a little premature.

Not until the end of 1944 did the Advisory Committee succeed in eliminating

the most glaring examples of discrimination within the Army. Even then

race remained an issue, and isolated racial incidents continued to occur.

<center><i>Two Exceptions</i></center>





<p>Departmental policy notwithstanding, a certain amount of racial integration

was inevitable during a war that mobilized a biracial army of eight million

men. Through administrative error or necessity, segregation was ignored

on many occasions, and black and white soldiers often worked and lived

together in hospitals,<sup><a href="#83">83</a> </sup>rest camps, schools,

and, more rarely, units. But these were isolated cases, touching relatively

few men, and they had no discernible effect on racial policy. Of much more

importance was the deliberate integration in officer training schools and

in the divisions fighting in the European theater in 1945. McCloy referred

to these deviations from policy as experiments "too limited to afford general

conclusions."<sup><a href="#84">84</a></sup> But if they set no precedents,

they at least challenged the Army's cherished assumptions on segregation

and strengthened the postwar demands for change.



<p><font size="+0">The</font> Army integrated its officer candidate training

in an effort to avoid the mistakes of the World War I program. In 1917

Secretary of War Newton D. Baker had established a separate training school

for black officer candidates at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, with disappointing

results. To fill its quotas the school had been forced to lower its entrance

standards, and each month an arbitrary number of black officer candidates

were selected and graduated with little regard for their qualifications.

Many World War I commanders agreed that the black officers produced by

the school proved inadequate as troop commanders, and postwar staff studies

generally opposed the future use of black officers. Should the Army be

forced to accept black officers in the future, these commanders generally

agreed, they should be trained along with whites.<sup><a href="#85">85</a></sup>

<p>Despite these criticisms, mobilization plans between the wars all assumed

that black officers would be trained and commissioned, although, as the

1937 mobilization plan put it, their numbers would be limited to those

required to provide officers for organizations authorized to have black

officers.<sup><a href="#86">86</a></sup> No detailed plans were drawn up

on the nature of this training, but by the eve of World War II a policy

had become fixed: Negroes were to be chosen and trained according to the

same standards as white officers, preferably in the same

<br>schools.<sup><a href="#87">87</a></sup> The War Department ignored

the subject of race when it established the officer candidate schools in

1941. "The basic and predominating consideration governing selections to

OCS," The Adjutant General announced, would be "outstanding qualities of

leadership as demonstrated by actual services in the Army."<sup><a href="#88">88</a></sup>

General Davis, who participated in the planning conferences, reasoned that

integrated training would be vital for the cooperation that would be necessary

in battle. He agreed with the War Department's silence on race, adding,

"you can't have Negro, white, or Jewish officers, you've got to have American

officers."<sup><a href="#89">89</a></sup>



<p>TANKERS OF THE 761ST MEDIUM TANK BATTALION <i>prepare for action in

the European theater, August 1944</i> [Photograph not included.]



<p>The Army's policy failed to consider one practical problem: if race

was ignored in War Department directives, would black candidates ever be

nominated and selected for officer training? Early enrollment figures suggested

they would not. Between July 1941, when the schools opened, and October

1941, only seventeen out of the 1,997 students enrolled in candidate schools

were Negroes Only six more Negroes entered during the next two months.<sup><a href="#90">90</a></sup>



<p>Some civil rights spokesmen argued for the establishment of a quota

system, and a few Negroes even asked for a return to segregated schools

to insure a more plentiful supply of black officers. Even before the schools

opened, Judge Hastie warned Secretary Stimson that any effective integration

plan "required a directive to Corps Area Commanders indicating that Negroes

are to be selected in numbers exactly or approximately indicated for particular

schools.''<sup><a href="#91">91</a></sup> But the planners had recommended

the integrated schools precisely to avoid a quota system. They were haunted

by the Army's 1917 experience, although the chief of the Army staff's Organizations

Division did not allude to these misgivings when he answered Judge Hastie.

He argued that a quota could not be defended on any grounds "except those

of a political nature" and would be "race discrimination against the whites."<sup><a href="#92">92</a></sup>



<p>General Marshall agreed that racial parity could not be achieved at

the expense of commissioning unqualified men, but he was equally adamant

about providing equal opportunity for all qualified candidates, black and

white. He won support for his position from some of the civil rights advocates.<sup><a href="#93">93</a></sup>

These arguments may not have swayed Hastie, but in the end he dropped the

idea of a regular quota system, judging it unworkable in the case of the

officer candidate schools. He concluded that many commanders approached

the selection of officer candidates with a bias against the Negro, and

he recommended that a directive or confidential memorandum be sent to commanders

charged with the selection of officer candidates informing them that a

certain minimum percentage of black candidates was to be chosen. Hastie's

recommendation was ignored, but the widespread refusal of local commanders

to approve or transmit applications of Negroes, or even to give them access

to appropriate forms, halted when Secretary Stimson and the Army staff

made it plain that they expected substantial numbers of Negroes to be sent

to the schools.<sup><a href="#94">94</a></sup>



<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People meanwhile

moved quickly to prove that the demand for a return to segregated schools,

made by Edgar G. Brown, president of the United States Government Employees,

and broadcaster Fulton Lewis, Jr., enjoyed little backing in the black

community. "We respectfully submit," Walter White informed Stimson and

Roosevelt, "that no leader considered responsible by intelligent Negro

or white Americans would make such a request."<sup><a href="#95">95</a></sup>

In support of its stand the NAACP issued a statement signed by many influential

black leaders.



<p>WAAC REPLACEMENTS <i>training at Fort Huachuca, December 1942.</i> [Photograph

<p>The segregationists attacked integration of the officer candidate schools

for the obvious reasons. A group of Florida congressmen, for example, protested

to the Army against the establishment of an integated Air Corps school

at Miami Beach. The War Department received numerous complaints when living

quarters at the schools were integrated. The president of the White Supremacy

League complained that young white candidates at Fort Benning "have to

eat and sleep with Negro candidates," calling it "the most damnable outrage

that was ever perpetrated on the youth of the South." To all such complaints

the War Department answered that separation was not always possible because

of the small number of Negroes involved.<sup><a href="#96">96</a></sup>



<p>In answering these complaints the Army developed its ultimate justification

for integrated officer schools: integration was necessary on the grounds

of efficiency and economy. As one Army spokesman put it, "our objection

to separate schools is based primarily on the fact that black officer candidates

are eligible from every branch of the Army, including the Armored Force

and tank destroyer battalions, and it would be decidedly uneconomical to

attempt to gather in one school the materiel and instructor personnel necessary

to give training in all these branches."<sup><a href="#97">97</a></sup>



<p>Officer candidate training was the Army's first formal experiment with

integration. Many blacks and whites lived together with a minimum of friction,

and, except in flight school, all candidates trained together.<sup><a href="#98">98</a></sup>

Yet in some schools the number of black officer candidates made racially

separate rooms feasible, and Negroes were usually billeted and messed together.

In other instances Army organizations were slow to integrate their officer

training. The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, for example, segregated black

candidates until late 1942 when Judge Hastie brought the matter to McCloy's

attention.<sup><a href="#99">99</a></sup> Nevertheless, the Army's experiment

was far more important than its immediate results indicated. It proved

that even in the face of considerable opposition the Army was willing to

abandon its segregation policy when the issues Of economy and efficiency

were made sufficiently clear and compelling.



<p>The Army's second experiment with integration came in part from the

need for infantry replacements during the Allied advance across Western

Europe in the summer and fall of 1944.<sup><a href="#100">100</a> </sup>The

Ground Force Replacement Command had been for some time converting soldiers

from service units to infantry, and even as the Germans launched their

counterattack in the Ardennes the command was drawing up plans to release

thousands of soldiers in Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee's Communications Zone

and train them as infantrymen. These plans left the large reservoir of

black manpower in the theater untapped until General Lee suggested that

General Dwight D. Eisenhower permit black service troops to volunteer for

infantry training and eventual employment as individual replacements. General

Eisenhower agreed, and on 26 December Lee issued a call to the black troops

for volunteers to share "the privilege of joining our veteran units at

the front to deliver the knockout blow." The call was limited to privates

in the upper four categories of the Army General Classification Test who

had had some infantry training. If noncommissioned officers wanted to apply,

they had to accept a reduction in grade. Although patronizing in tone,

the plan was a bold departure from War Department policy: "It is planned

to assign you without regard to color or race to the units where assistance

is most needed, and give you the opportunity of fighting shoulder to shoulder

to bring about victory.... Your relatives and friends everywhere have been

urging that you be granted this privilege."<sup><a href="#101">101</a></sup>



<p>The revolutionary nature of General Lee's plan was not lost on Supreme

Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force. Arguing that the circular promising

integrated service would embarrass the Army, Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith

the chief of staff, recommended that General Eisenhower warn the War Department

that civil rights spokesmen might seize on this example to demand wider

integration. To avoid future moves that might compromise Army policy, Smith

wanted permission to review any Communications Zone statements on Negroes

before they were released.



<p>General Eisenhower compromised. Washington was not consulted, and Eisenhower

himself revised the circular, eliminating the special call for black volunteers

and the promise of integration on an individual basis. He substituted instead

a general appeal for volunteers, adding the further qualification that

"in the event that the number of suitable Negro volunteers exceeds the

replacement needs of Negro combat units, these men will be suitably incorporated

in other organizations so that their service and their fighting spirit

may be efficiently utilized.''<sup><a href="#102">l02</a></sup> This statement

was disseminated throughout the European theater.



<p>The Eisenhower revision needed considerable clarification. It mentioned

the replacement needs of black combat units, but there were no black infantry

units in the theater;<sup><a href="#103">103</a></sup> and the replacement

command was not equipped to retrain men for artillery, tank, and tank destroyer

units, the types of combat units that did employ Negroes in Europe. The

revision also called for volunteers in excess of these needs to be "suitably

incorporated in other organizations," but it did not indicate how they

would be organized. Eisenhower later made it clear that he preferred to

organize the volunteers in groups that could replace white units in the

line, but again the replacement command was geared to train individual,

not unit, replacements. After considerable discussion and compromise, Eisenhower

agreed to have Negroes trained "as members of Infantry rifle platoons familiar

with the Infantry rifle platoon weapons." The platoons would be sent for

assignment to Army commanders who would provide them with platoon leaders,

platoon sergeants, and, if needed, squad leaders.



<p>Unaware of how close they had come to being integrated as individuals,

so many Negroes volunteered for combat training and duty that the operations

of some service units were threatened. To prevent disrupting these vital

operations, the theater limited the number to 2, 500, turning down about

3,000 men. Early in January 1945 the volunteers assembled for six weeks

of standard infantry conversion training. After training, the new black

infantrymen were organized into fifty-three platoons, each under a white

platoon leader and sergeant, and were dispatched to the field, two to work

with armored divisions and the rest with infantry divisions. Sixteen were

shipped to the 6th Army Group, the rest to the 12th Army Group, and all

saw action with a total of eleven divisions in the First and Seventh Armies.



<p>VOLUNTEERS FOR COMBAT IN TRAINING, <i>47th Reinforcement Depot, February

1945.</i> [Photograph not included.]



<p>In the First Army the black platoons were usually assigned on the basis

of three to a division, and the division receiving them normally placed

one platoon in each regiment. At the company level, the black platoon generally

served to augment the standard organization of three rifle platoons and

one heavy weapons platoon. In the Seventh Army, the platoons were organized

into provisional companies and attached to infantry battalions in armored

divisions. General Davis warned the Seventh Army commander, Lt. Gen. Alexander

M. Patch, that the men had not been trained for employment as company units

and were not being properly used. The performance of the provisional companies

failed to match the performance of the platoons integrated into white companies

and their morale was lower.<sup><a href="#104">l04</a></sup> At the end

of the war the theater made clear to the black volunteers that integration

was over. Although a large group was sent to the 69th Infantry Division

to be returned home, most were reassigned to black combat or service units

in the occupation army.



<p>The experiment with integration of platoons was carefully scrutinized.

In May and June 1945, the Research Branch of the Information and Education

Division of Eisenhower's theater headquarters made a survey solely to discover

what white company-grade officers and platoon sergeants thought of the

combat performance of the black rifle platoons. Trained interviewers visited

seven infantry divisions and asked the same question of 250 men�all the

available company officers and a representative sample of platoon sergeants

in twenty-four companies that had had black platoons. In addition, a questionnaire,

not to be signed, was submitted to approximately 1,700 white enlisted men

in other field forces for the purpose of discovering what their attitudes

were toward the use of black riflemen. No Negro was asked his opinion.



<p>More than 80 percent of the white officers and noncommissioned officers

who were interviewed reported that the Negroes had performed "very well"

in combat; 69 percent of the officers and 83 percent of the noncommissioned

officers saw no reason why black infantrymen should not perform as well

as white infantrymen if both had the same training and experience. Most

reported getting along "very well" with the black volunteers; the heavier

the combat shared, the closer and better the relationships. Nearly all

the officers questioned admitted that the camaraderie between white and

black troops was far better than they had expected. Most enlisted men reported

that they had at first disliked and even been apprehensive at the prospect

of having black troops in their companies, but three-quarters of them had

changed their minds after serving with Negroes in combat, their distrust

turning into respect and friendliness. Of the officers and noncommissioned

officers, 77 percent had more favorable feelings toward Negroes after serving

in close proximity to them, the others reported no change in attitude;

not a single individual stated that he had developed a less favorable attitude.

A majority of officers approved the idea of organizing Negroes in platoons

to serve in white companies; the practice, they said, would stimulate the

spirit of competition between races, avoid friction with prejudiced whites,

eliminate discrimination, and promote interracial understanding. Familiarity

with Negroes dispersed fear of the unknown and bred respect for them among

white troops; only those lacking experience with black soldiers were inclined

to be suspicious and hostile. <sup><a href="#105">105</a></sup>



<p>General Brehon B. Somervell, commanding general of the Army Service

Forces, questioned the advisability of releasing the report. An experiment

involving 1,000 volunteers�his figure was inaccurate, actually 2,500 were

involved�was hardly, he believed, a conclusive test. Furthermore, organizations

such as the NAACP might be encouraged to exert pressure for similar experiments

among troops in training in the United States and even in the midst of

active operations in the Pacific theater�pressure, he believed, that might

hamper training and operations. What mainly concerned Somervell were the

political implications. Many members of Congress, newspaper editors, and

others who had given strong support to the War Department were, he contended,

"vigorously opposed" to integration under any conditions. A strong adverse

reaction from this influential segment of the nation's opinion-makers might

alienate public support for a postwar program of universal military training.<sup><a href="#106">106</a></sup>



<p>General Omar N. Bradley, the senior American field commander in Europe,

took a different tack. Writing for the theater headquarters and drawing

upon such sources of information as the personal observations of some officers

General Bradley disparaged the significance of the experiment. Most of

the black platoons, he observed, had participated mainly in mopping-up

operations or combat against a disorganized enemy. Nor could the soldiers

involved in the experiment be considered typical, in Bradley's opinion.

They were volunteers of above average intelligence according to their commanders.<sup><a href="#107">107</a></sup>

Finally, Bradley contended that, while no racial trouble emerged during

combat, the mutual friendship fostered by fighting a common enemy was threatened

when the two races were closely associated in rest and recreational areas.

Nevertheless, he agreed that the performance of the platoons was satisfactory

enough to warrant continuing the experiment but recommended the use of

draftees with average qualifications. At the same time, he drew away from

further integration by suggesting that the experiment be expanded to include

employment of entire black rifle companies in white regiments to avoid

some of the social difficulties encountered in rest areas. <sup><a href="#108">108</a></sup>



<p>General Marshall, the Chief of Staff, agreed with both Somervell and Bradley. 
  Although he thought that the possibility of integrating black units into white 
  units should be "followed up," he believed that the survey should not be made 
  public because "the conditions under which the [black] platoons were organized 
  and employed were most unusual."<sup><a href="#109">109</a></sup> Too many of 
  the circumstances of the experiment were special�the voluntary recruitment of 
  men for frontline duty, the relatively high number of noncommissioned officers 
  among the volunteers, and the fact that the volunteers were slightly older and 
  scored higher in achievement tests than the average black soldier. Moreover, 
  throughout the experiment some degree of segregation, with all its attendant 
  psychological and morale problems, had been maintained. 
<p>The platoon experiment was illuminating in several respects. The fact

that so late in the war thousands of Negroes volunteered to trade the safety

of the rear for duty at the front said something about black patriotism

and perhaps something about the Negro's passion for equality. It also demonstrated

that, when properly trained and motivated and treated with fairness, blacks,

like whites, performed with bravery and distinction in combat. Finally,

the experiment successfully attacked one of the traditionalists' shibboleths,

that close association of the races in Army units would cause social dissension.

<p>It is now apparent that World War II had little immediate effect on

the quest for racial equality in the Army. The Double V campaign against

fascism abroad and racism at home achieved considerably less than the activists

had hoped. Although Negroes shared in the prosperity brought by war industries

and some 800,000 of them served in uniform, segregation remained the policy

of the Army throughout the war, just as Jim Crow still ruled in large areas

of the country. Probably the campaign's most important achievement was

that during the war the civil rights groups, in organizing for the fight

against discrimination, began to gather strength and develop techniques

that would be useful in the decades to come. The Army's experience with

black units also convinced many that segregation was a questionable policy

when the country needed to mobilize fully.



<p>For its part the Army defended the separation of the races in the name

of military efficiency and claimed that it had achieved a victory over

racial discrimination by providing equal treatment and job opportunity

for black soldiers. But the Army's campaign had also been less than completely

successful. True, the Army had provided specialist training and opened

job opportunities heretofore denied to thousands of Negroes, and it had

a cadre of potential leaders in the hundreds of experienced black officers.

For the times, the Army was a progressive minority employer. Even so, as

an institution it had defended the separate but equal doctrine and had

failed to come to grips with segregation. Under segregation the Army was

compelled to combine large numbers of undereducated and undertrained black

soldiers in units that were often inefficient and sometimes surplus to

its needs. This system in turn robbed the Army of the full services of

the educated and able black soldier, who had every reason to feel restless

and rebellious.



<p>The Army received no end of advice on its manpower policy during the

war. Civil rights spokesmen continually pointed out that segregation itself

was discriminatory, and Judge Hastie in particular hammered on this proposition

before the highest officials of the War Department. In fact Hastie's recommendations,

criticisms, and arguments crystallized the demands of civil rights leaders.

The Army successfully resisted the proposition when its Advisory Committee

on Negro Troop Policies under John McCloy modified but did not appreciably

alter the segregation policy. It was a predictable course. The Army's racial

policy was more than a century old, and leaders considered it dangerous

if not impossible to revise traditional ways during a global war involving

so many citizens with pronounced and different views on race.



<p>What both the civil rights activists and the Army's leaders tended to

ignore during the war was that segregation was inefficient. The myriad

problems associated with segregated units, in contrast to the efficient

operation of the integrated officer candidate schools and the integrated

infantry platoons in Europe, were overlooked in the atmosphere of charges

and denials concerning segregation and discrimination. John McCloy was

an exception. He had clearly become dissatisfied with the inefficiency

of the Army's policy, and in the week following the Japanese surrender

he questioned Navy Secretary James V. Forrestal on the Navy's experiments

with integration. "It has always seemed to me," he concluded, "that we

never put enough thought into the matter of making a real military asset

out of the very large cadre of Negro personnel we received from the country.''<sup><a href="#110">110</a></sup>

Although segregation persisted, the fact that it hampered military efficiency

was the hope of those who looked for a change in the Army's policy.

rarely critical of segregation. The material is now located in the U.S.

for several reasons not related to race (for instance, language and nationality)

the German Army also organized separate units. Its 162d Infantry Division

was composed of troops from Turkestan and the Caucasus, and its 5th SS

Panzer Division had segregated Scandinavian, Dutch, and Flemish regiments.

Unlike the racially segregated U.S. Army, Germany's so-called Ost units

were only administratively organized into separate divisions, and an Ost

infantry battalion was often integrated into a "regular" German infantry

regiment as its fourth infantry battalion. Several allied armies also had

segregated units, composed, for example, of Senegalese, Gurkhas, Maoris,

and Algerians.</font>

school graduates and men scoring in AGCT categories I, II, and III among

the black infantry volunteers was somewhat higher than that of all Negroes

in the European theater. As against 22 percent high school graduates and

29 percent in the first three test score categories for the volunteers,

the percentages for all Negroes in the theater were 18 and 17 percent.

At the same time the averages for black volunteers were considerably below

those for white riflemen, of whom 41 percent were high school graduates

and 71 percent in the higher test categories�figures that tend to refute

the general's argument. See ASF l&amp;E Div Rpt B-157, 3 Jul 45.</font>

<h2>Aircraft Markings</h2></a>

<p>Since 1959 , the royal air force of Oman (al-Quwwat al-Jawwiya al-Sultanat 
Oman) has had five markings, according to
[<A HREF="bib-c0a.html#c2e98">Cochrane &amp; Elliott (1998)</A>.
I must admit that I couldn't find all of them in photos, and I think that the
last two (which are really fin flashes) are used side by side with a third
fin flash which is the national flag.<br>
According to 
[<A HREF="bib-c0a.html#c2e98">Cochrane &amp; Elliott (1998)</A> the first roundel was like the Japanese (red disc with
white border) and the fin flash was a white shield charged with the national
emblem in red (a mirror of a later flash). Those markings were in use
between 1959-1965<br>
In 1965 a new marking was adopted. The roundel was charged also with the
national emblem (as on <A HREF="om1970af.html">Air Force Flag 1970-1995</A>. The fin flash reversed its colors and 
consisted of a red shield
and white emblem.<br>
In 1970, a green border replaced the white, and wings were added to the emblem. The
fin flash was removed.<br>
In 1977, the roundel was removed and the previous fin flash became the sole
marking.<br>
In 1983, the color of the shield was changed to light blue.<br>
All the above is based on
[<A HREF="bib-c0a.html#c2e98">Cochrane &amp; Elliott (1998)</A>.<br>
[<A HREF="bib-wfa.html#whe86">Wheeler (1986)</A> reported the blue shield and the 
national flag both as fin flashes. He
also reported the some aircraft are using the old red shield.<br>
Photos of the national flag being used as fin flash can be seen at
<A HREF="http://www.airliners.net/open.file/468818/L/">http://www.airliners.net/open.file/468818/L/</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.airliners.net/open.file/339253/L/">http://www.airliners.net/open.file/339253/L/</A>. 
A photo of the red shield can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.airliners.net/open.file/190425/L/">http://www.airliners.net/open.file/190425/L/</A>&nbsp; (photo 
taken in 1961 when, according to
[<A HREF="bib-c0a.html#c2e98">Cochrane &amp; Elliott (1998)</A> it was a white shield....) and
<A HREF="http://www.rob.clubkawasaki.com/jas26.jpg">http://www.rob.clubkawasaki.com/jas26.jpg</A> (photo taken in 1972 when, 
according to [<A HREF="bib-c0a.html#c2e98">Cochrane &amp; Elliott (1998)</A> this fin flash was not in use anymore....)<br>
<A HREF="http://www.scramble.nl/om.htm">http://www.scramble.nl/om.htm</A> shows at 
the top the red shield with two photos, one
with blue and one with red (Strikemaster served 1968-2000, Jaguar serving
since 1977)<br>
Seems to be a complex story.<br>

<p>The Aircraft Fin Flash in Correction 3 is the same as in Album 2000 - it seems to be a very rudimentary yellow shape of the national emblem in a light blue shield. The RAFO <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force_of_Oman">Wikipedia page</A> shows a much more elaborate design for the fin flash.<br>
It also mentions a roundel (white-edged red disk with white silhouette of the national emblem).<br>

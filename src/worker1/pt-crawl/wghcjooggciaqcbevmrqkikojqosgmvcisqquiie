											Championship and Australian Open 
											Championship titles from 1939 
											undefeated until 1949.<br><br>His 
											impressive record in championship 
											competition and his peerless 
											coaching record have resulted in 
											Watson being widely considered the 
											legend of squash sport in Australia, 
											as both player and coach, for 48 
											years from 1931 to 1979.<br><br>
											Watson commenced his squash career 
											at the age of sixteen. He gained 
											employment as a masseur and 
											gymnasium instructor in the first 
											commercial squash courts in 
											Melbourne built in 1926. Watson went 
											on to become the club&#39;s squash 
											professional in 1931. Due to his 
											employment at the club, Watson was 
											classed as a professional and only 
											eligible to compete in the 
											Australian Professional Squash 
											Championships.<br><br>This 
											competition was first held in 1931; 
											the same year as the inaugural 
											Australian Men&#39;s Amateur 
											Championship. Watson started 
											competing in earnest after his first 
											overseas trip, to England and 
											Germany, in 1936. In 1939 Watson 
											defeated Jim Watson and went on to 
											remain Australian Open champion 
											until 1949. Remarkably, during this 
											decade of Watson&#39;s domination at the 
											top level of competition, he 
											surrendered only a single game.<br>
											<br>He travelled to contest British 
											Open (which is equal to World 
											Championship now) in England in 1950 
											and was the first Australian male 
											squash player to tour overseas. He 
											was defeated in Semi Finals by 
											India&#39;s Abdul Bari. 1950 closed with 
											the world rankings as Karim No. 1; 
											Bari No. 2; and Gordon Watson No. 3.<br>
											<br>Watson retired from competition 
											in 1950 and built a successful 
											coaching career. He established 
											Watson&#39;s Squash Academy in 
											Melbourne. As a coach, Watson 
											quickly demonstrated his total 
											understanding of the sport and 
											amassed similarly unprecedented 
											success as that which he had enjoyed 
											as a competitor.<br><br>Before his 
											retirement from the sport in 1979, 
											he coached no fewer than 21 
											Australian title holders and 
											countless winners of state 
											championships.<br><br>These included 
											many early champions of the women&#39;s 
											game: Betty Meagher; Val Watts; and 
											Joan Watson (his sister-in-law). 
											Between them these women took 7 
											Australian Amateur and 9 Victorian 
											Amateur championships between 1946 
											and 1955. Watson also coached 
											national male champions Frank 
											Harris, Merv Weston and Ian Carson 
											who retained 7 Australian Amateur 
											titles between them.<br><br>Watson 
											retired from the sport of squash in 
											1979 and died in 1992<br><br>

											Danielle Drady is a former 
											professional squash player from 
											Australia.<br><br>She turned 
											professional in 1987, and began to 
											steadily climb the world rankings 
											and was ranked the PSA World No. 2<br>
											woman player in march 1990.<br><br>
											Drady became interested in squash as 
											a young child when she started going 
											with her mother to her social squash 
											gatherings<br>at a local club.<br>
											<br>She won the Queensland under-12 
											championship in 1978, and then went 
											on to claim state and national 
											championships and an under-19 world 
											team crown in her junior years.<br>
											<br>In 1984, Drady joined the 
											Australian Institute of Sport in 
											Brisbane.<br><br>She got married to 
											squash legend Rodney Martin but left 
											him to get married to his manager 
											Phil Harte.<br><br>Having reached 
											the World No. 2 ranking in 1990, the 
											World No. 1 spot appeared to be 
											within Drady's reach. However, her 
											chances were dashed when she snapped 
											her achilles tendon during a 
											practice match.<br><br>The injury 
											required immediate surgery and kept 
											her out of the game for some time.<br>
											<br>In a bid to attract attention 
											and sponsorship for Drady's comeback 
											from injury, and to promote the 
											world's first outdoor squash 
											tournament in 1994, Drady's husband 
											(Phil Harte) wrapped her in glad 
											wrap to play her matches outside 
											Sydney's Martin Place shopping 
											center in 1994.<br><br>Drady played 
											and won the World Outdoor Pro-Am 
											wrapped in plastic, and posed for 
											photographs with a 'For Sale' sign 
											strung around her neck.<br><br>This 
											created a great deal of media 
											coverage and sparked debate about 
											the lengths female athletes should 
											and need to go to in order to 
											attract funding and sponsors.<br>
											<br>The publicity soon led to Drady 
											becoming the most sponsored player 
											in squash for a period.<br><br>Drady 
											continued to play top-level squash 
											into the late-1990s. She won the 
											Australian Open in 1996 and the 1998 
											World Open Pro-AM Sydney. However, 
											her international career began to 
											take a backseat following her 
											marriage to her husband Phil Harte 
											and the birth of her daughter Tayla.<br>
											<br>Between 2010 and 2015, Drady 
											established the first squash and 
											fitness academy at the Emirates Golf 
											and Country Club in Dubai. As of 
											now, Drady lives between Sydney and 
											Dubai. She and her husband run Harte 
											International Events Manager. She 
											also manages an international

											later, he won the national junior

											he was the National Intercollegiate 
											squash champion (1964).<br><br>He 
											won the U.S. Nationals five times (a

											Pearson, who won his sixth in 1923).<br>
											<br>He also won three national 
											doubles titles with his partners 
											(Vic Elmaleh, Jim Zug Sr. and Colin

											the U.S. Open Squash, losing a close

											Hashim Khan, considered by most 
											people to be the greatest squash 
											player in the world.<br><br>A fierce 
											competitor, Khan complimented his 
											coach Jack Barnaby on Niederhoffer's 
											obsession to win. "You coached that 
											boy good," he said. "He takes the 
											game serious."<br><br>SQUASH 
											COMEBACK<br><br>In 1972, stating 
											that he had made his point about 
											prejudice at squash clubs, 
											Niederhoffer made his return to 
											squash.<br><br>In his absence, the 
											Indian hall of fame player, Anil 
											Nayar, had risen to prominence and 
											won the past three National 
											Championships.<br><br>In the first 
											tourney of that season, with 
											Niederhoffer rusty and out of shape, 
											Niederhoffer lost to Nayar in the 
											finals.From that point on, though, 
											to the amazement of most observers, 
											Niederhoffer dominated Nayar and won 
											back the championship at Detroit.<br>
											<br>Niederhoffer gave up competitive 
											squash. At 34, it was getting harder 
											for him to keep in shape, the 
											demands on his time were greater 
											with business booming (Hedge Fund 
											Manager).<br><br>He sprained his 
											ankle very badly in the 1976 
											Metropolitan Open. Niederhoffer had 
											been searching for words to explain 
											his retirement and now he found 
											them. "What it is," he said, "is 
											that I've lost the killer instinct."<br>

											Azam Khan a squash player who won 
											the British Open Championships four 
											times between 1959 and 1962.<br><br>
											He was born into a Pashtun family at 
											Nawakville, a small village near 
											Peshawar At first, he became a 
											tennis coach at the officers' club 
											of the Pakistan Air Force.Soon after 
											that, his older brother Hashim Khan 
											(7 times British Open champion) 
											asked him to change his career to 
											squash playing from tennis.<br><br>
											When Azam Khan switched over to 
											playing squash, he was such a quick 
											learner that he became the 2nd best 
											player behind his famous brother 
											Hashim Khan within six months.<br>
											<br>Both brothers had settled in 
											London by 1956. He surprised many 
											people by adapting so easily from 
											concrete courts in Pakistan to 
											England's wooden court floors.<br>
											<br>Azam had to abstain from 
											competitive squash due to an 
											Achilles tendon injury. The injury 
											healed in 18 months but there was 
											another wound that he sustained and 
											which never could be healed. He 
											completely lost interest in 
											competition when his 14-year-old son 
											died.<br><br>Thereafter, his squash 
											activities were confined to his 
											club, the New Grampians Club in 
											London. Azam had joined the club in 
											1956 as a full time coach. Soon, the 
											clubâs owner, who was not keeping 
											good health, asked him to buy the 
											club.<br>Azam bought the club by 
											paying him in installments and he 
											decided to retire from the game in 
											1962.<br><br>Azam could have won at 
											least 12 British Open titles if he 
											had wanted to. Had it not been for 
											two factors first, respect for the 
											elder brother and, later, mourning 
											his son Azam Khan might have been 
											the greatest squash player of all 
											time.<br><br>ACHIEVEMENTS:<br><br>

            the playing time of your players is one of the most important jobs you 
            have as a youth coach. Outside of whatever your league rules are in 
            regards to playing time, you have a responsibility to your players and 
            to their parents to have a policy in place, to stick with that policy 
            and to make it known to both your players and your parents.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif;">My 
            philosophy has always been that the kids I coach get a lot of playing 
            time. Although all of my kids played some &quot;select sports&quot;, 
            in general I think that the philosophy is screwed up because it usually 
            becomes more about recruiting than developing players. Kids come and 
            go because the coach doesn't play them enough or the parents think there 
            child should be on a better team but to me the focus always seams to 
            move from development to winning. Now the flip side of that is that 
            in pure recreational teams you have a difficult time with player and 
            parent committment and the skill levels can be way below some of your 
            better players. So it can be a very difficult thing to find a happy 
            medium. In fact that is probably why players and parents move to &quot;select 
            leagues&quot; as there childrens skill level or the whole teams skill 
            level has outgrown the league skill level and it starts to be a waste 
            of time as you end up blowing out all of the teams you play or the individual 
            athlete just isn't being challenged.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif;">The 
            other problem that I see with &quot;select teams&quot; is the burnout 
            factor. Most of the &quot;select teams&quot; expect a year around committment 
            and I have a lot of concern with younger players playing a sport year 
            around. This can be a real issue for younger players both from a burnout 
            standpoint and from an injury standpoint. I have seen many players who 
            by the time they get to high school now have injuries to shoulders and 
            knees and I believe a lot of it stems from over use from playing year 
            around or by the time they get to high school they just don't want to 
            play anymore.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">Managing 
            playing time requires planning and coordination and practice. Whatever 
            your playing time policy is whether its each player plays half the game 
            or equal playing time for all players or whatever it is, each of you 
            needs to set and abide by that policy and stick with it win or lose. 
            As the head coach you must plan the way you are going to accomplish 
            the minimum playing goals that you set.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">The 
            first step in this process is to determine who your starters are. Try 
            to figure out how to put a competitive starting unit on the field or 
            floor while maximizing the number of stronger players. You will have 
            to learn to mix and match your stronger players with your weaker ones 
            so that you always have some balance on the floor. The fact is that 
            you will always have some players that will play a littile more than 
            others and you just have to try and balance it out. You also don't want 
            to get into a situation where you become overly dependent on a few kids 
            as the rest of the team won't develop and they also will start to depend 
            on those kids. That's not fair to either those few players or the rest 
            of your team. Make sure that you sit your better players a least a portion 
            of the game so that your other players can learn to play without them. 
            Practice your substitutions regularly in practice. If you have assistant 
            coaches assign them the responsibility of subbing at particular positions. 
            Make sure the players know who they are going in for and have the subbing 
            player yell out the players name he is replacing. Before the game and 
            during practice spend 5 minutes just sending kids in and out, with your 
            assistant coaches monitoring all of the substitutions. Get good at it, 
            it's something few coaches spend time working on and it can make a big 
            difference in the outcome of your game.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">Playing 
            time isn't just about the amount of playing time a player gets but the 
            opportunities a player gets. So the second part of this equation is 
            getting players opportunities to maximize their confidence in their 
            abilities. Now with that said, life is not fair and kids need to learn 
            that too. Sometimes a kid will need to play a certain position as it 
            is for the good of the team. Part of what you are teaching is &quot;teamwork&quot; 
            after all. For example one of my soccer teams was always very competitive, 
            I made sure that everyone got a lot of playing time and I would move 
            kids around to different positions once they became skilled at the position 
            they played most. I didn't move all of them around alot as some kids 
            had a natural understanding of the game and some kids were completely 
            lost. So if I moved everyone around all of the time no one would have 
            learned how to play their position.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">I 
            had some kids that never wanted to move they enjoyed the position they 
            played and I had some kids who always wanted to play forward as they 
            wanted to score and to be honest some of the ones who wanted to play 
            certain position just didn't have the skills to play those positions. 
            So I had to have a game plan to accomplish that. So in this case I would 
            have two substitution charts. One for if the game was close and one 
            for if we were getting blown away or blowing away the other team. If 
            the game was tight, the players would sub into the position that would 
            best benefit the team. If the game was a blowout the players would sub 
            into positions that they wanted to have more opportunities to play. 
            Believe me when I say that this approach still did not make everyone 
            happy. I still had a few parents that were not happy my philosophy. 
            But I never waived. In fact I had a parent come across the field during 
            a playoff game that we were winning and tell me that if I didn't put 
            their son at forward during the last quarter they were not going to 
            show up for the next game. It was a tight game and the player in question 
            happended to be one of my best defenders. In fact the kid enjoyed defense 
            and took pride in playing it. He was tough as nails and never backed 
            down. Their thought was that he was better than one of the players that 
            I was playing at forward and the fact was that he was. But I couldn't 
            play the other player at defense because that player just wasn't strong 
            enough and in order to get everyone equal playing time I need to keep 
            that player at forward. So I kept him at defense and we won the game. 
            They did show up the next day because it was the championship game. 
            I never took it out on the kid because it wasn't his fault. We lost 
            the championship game that year and they didn't return the following 
            year, but the year after that they returned and asked if they could 
            again join the team. </font></p>

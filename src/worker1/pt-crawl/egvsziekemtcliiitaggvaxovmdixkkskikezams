                Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established 
                in 1988 by the United nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and 
                the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its role is to assess 
                a range of information relevant for the understanding of the risk 
                of human-induced climate change.</p>
              <p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) is one of 
                a series of international agreements and treaties on global environmental 
                issues that were adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit at Rio. It provides 
                the overall policy framework for addressing the climate change 
                issue and so forms the foundation of global efforts to combat 
                global warming.</p>
              <p>The ultimate goal of the FCCC is...</p>
              <p><b>&#145;stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the 
                atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic 
                human induced interference with the climate system. Such a level 
                should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems 
                to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production 
                is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed 
                in a sustainable manner&#146;</b></p>
              <p>The FCCC does not yet specify what the stabilization level should 
                be, with another 10 years probably needed before the uncertainties 
                can be largely removed and an ideal target GHG level decided upon.</p>
              <p>The treaty promotes action against global warming in spite of 
                the current uncertainty on the basis that its better to be precautionary 
                than wait until irreversible damage is done.</p>
              <p>The FCCC entered into force in March 1994 following ratification 
                by 50 of its signatory parties. In 1995 the FCCC set out some 
                guiding principles and general commitments for the international 
                response to climate change This was the first Conference of the 
                Parties (COP)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3 align="center">The Kyoto Protocol</h3>
              <p>The Kyoto protocol was drawn up to set specific targets for reductions 
                in greenhouse gas concentrations in the global atmosphere. Emission 
                restrictions were made for the rich countries of annex 1 - the 
                biggest greenhouse gas producers, and also the countries most 
                able to cut emissions. Targets range from an 8 per cent cut for 
                the EU to a 10per cent increase for Iceland, depending on the 
                individual country. </p>
              <p>Annexe 1 also includes several 'transition countries', like the 
                Russian federation, whose economies still need some development 
                and are allowed 'a certain degree of flexibility'. The emission 
                reduction targets for these countries were laid out in Annexe 
                B. To become legally binding the protocol had to be ratified by 
                at least 55 countries which between them account for at least 
                55 percent of the total 1990 GHG emissions of developed countries.</p>
              <h3>Details of the Kyoto Protocol</h3>
              <p>A theme which runs through much of the Kyoto protocol is for 
                countries to cooperate. Sharing both advances in GHG technology 
                and science. The greatest achievement of the protocol so far is 
                to get so many countries together and talking on a central issue.</p>
              <p>A cautionary note in the protocol is to be careful of the wider 
                impacts GHG reduction schemes may have. Some may be too costly 
                to maintain for the benefit they provide, others may cause an 
                unreasonable degree of disruption to the populace, industry etc.</p>
              <p>Article 3.4 caused a great deal of argument as it did not specify 
                what could be constituted as a valid sink or source and what 'additional 
                activities' meant. The US took this article to mean that it could 
                count forests which already existed in its sinks, other countries 
                argued that this was not fair and would allow countries like the 
                US to do relatively little. </p>
              <h4>Joint Implementation</h4>
              <p>This is one of the so called 'flexibility mechanisms' designed 
                to help rich (annexe 1) countries meet their Kyoto commitment 
                using methods other than directly via cuts in their own emissions. 
                The flexibility mechanisms have caused some of the biggest arguments 
                about the Kyoto protocol, but it is generally agreed that without 
                them the size of the agreed reduction targets would have had to 
                be much smaller. <br>
                Annexe 1 Countries can transfer 'emissions units' between them 
                and implement joint initiatives to curb GHG emissions. </p>
              <p>This kind of joint implementation could involve a coordinated 
                forest management scheme. However, there is concern that some 
                of the richer countries may use the JI to bypass cutting their 
                own domestic emissions by claiming the 'emissions credits' from 
                schemes they implement in 'transition' annexe 1 countries like 
                Russia.</p>
              <h4>GHG Equity</h4>
              <p>GHG emission is extremely skewed geographically. We in the rich 
                west produce many times more GHG per person than people in developing 
                countries. Though our rich countries have only about 20% of the 
                world's population, we use about 80 percent of the worlds resources. 
                The ominous thing is that our high standard of living - along 
                with its high GHG emissions, is what many people in developing 
                countries strife for. Part of Kyoto aims to tackle this big potential 
                increase in GHG emissions by helping developing countries to avoid 
                the polluting mistakes the rich countries have made and become 
                developed with out the usual balooning in GHG emission - sustainable 
                development'.</p>
              <h4>The Clean Development Mechanism</h4>
              <p>The clean development mechanism allows governments or private 
                entities in rich countries to set up emission reduction projects 
                in developing countries. They get credit for these reductions 
                as 'certified emission reductions (CER's). This system is different 
                from the Joint Implementation as it promotes sustainable development 
                on developing countries.</p>
              <h4>Emissions Trading</h4>
              <p>A key feature of the protocol is the agreement on the use of 
                some form of emissions trading. If introduced the trading system 
                should allow the holder of a 'credit' the emission of a specified 
                amount of GHG. A tradeable carbon credit unit called AAU's (Assigned 
                Amount Units) has been proposed which would represent one tonne 
                of CO2 emissions.The advantages of this trading are that it drives 
                countries to better efficiency in their own greenhouse gas emissions. 
                However, this is probably the most contentious of all the' flexibility 
                mechanisms'. </p>
              <p>There is a worry that some rich countries will simply 'buy off' 
                the GHG they produce and not take any action themselves. The idea 
                of a 'cap on the amount of trading has been suggested, but has 
                produced even more argument'. Taken a step further, per capita 
                emissions have been discussed as a Utopian way to be fair to all.. 
                Maybe one day. But these credits will only have value for reductions 
                made in the commitment period 2008-2012. Despite this some traders 
                are already speculating in 'carbon credits' and its worth all 
                businesses being aware of where they would stand in a world of 
                'carbon credits'. Farmers for instance may be sitting on 'pots 
                of carbon gold' in the form of the potential of their land as 
                a carbon sink.</p>

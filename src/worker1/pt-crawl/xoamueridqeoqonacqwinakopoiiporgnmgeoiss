<h2 align="center">Women in Early Modern European MEDICINE<br>
</h2>
<p>Women have played a very integral part in the medical field in the past, and
continue to do so in the present. Some of the important roles women play in
medicine are wet nurses, mid wives, and healers. These were the main association
to the women regarding medicine. These jobs have women connected to the
children. These are the positions that laid the groundwork for later physicians.
That is why this subject is important to discuss.</p>
<p>Though women were known to be physicians from earliest recorded history,
their roles, except in rare instances, did not involve formal leadership
positions. Even in the fifteenth century, women who held health and hospital
administration roles were forbidden to continue them due to the Council of Trentwhich
did not allow it. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that women were
allowed formal higher education. However, there seemed to be an interest in the
role of women in medicine, and scientific development. This is illustrated
through the book of an Italian author, Christine de Pisan, who wrote The City of
Women, which described women rulers, inventors, and scientists in the fifteenth
century. In the usual circumstances, women served as midwives and herbalists and
practiced household medicine. Midwives are commonly mentioned in ancient
literature. Some women bear the title on their gravestones, because it was
recognized as an honorable profession. Without midwives, many mothers, during
and after their pregnancy, would not have gotten the proper care for themselves
and their newly born child. Women were also known to practice witchcraft. This
was the healing and medicine through spells and potions. Many people believed
this form of treatment was beneficial to the sick, but never medically proven.
Women were also the ancient healers. They would mix many herbs to find the
correct combinations to soothe an ailment. . Women always held the capabilities
to be physicians, and practice medicine, but often were not given the chance.
The reasons include a repetitively held belief in womenís inadequacy for
intellectual pursuits and for leadership in particular.</p>
<p>This subject of study is fascinating. There are so many women who overcame
obstacles hard to imagine. They suffered through torment, ridicule, and
disbelief to practice medicine for the general good of the community. The
information available to research this subject is sparse, but very interesting.</p>

<p>Barber, Elizabeth. <i>Women's Work: First 20,000 Years</i>. New York, N.Y.:
W.W. Norton and Company, 1994.</p>
<p>There was an sufficient amount of information provided in this book, however
it was very boring and difficult to follow.&nbsp; The information was very vague
and did not describes anything in depth. I would not recommend using this site
to research information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bradley, Harriet. <i>Men's Work. Women's Work</i>. Minneapolis, MN:
University of Minnesota Press, 1989.</p>
<p>Bradley found it necessary to write a book reflecting social priorities. In
the book, the reader can find many interesting details about the process of
women at work. There is an entire chapter devoted to women in the medical field.
Bradley refers to many other readings, some of which are the Malleus Maleficarum,
and Women in English Life. Chapter twelve speaks of witchcraft, and midwifery as
the early forms of women in medicine. This book is full of useful information,
and is easy to follow and understand.</p>

<p>Burton, Antionette. Consenting the zenana: the mission to make lady doctors
for India. <i>Journal of British Studies</i>. 35(July1996): 368-97.</p>
<p>This journal is about the profession of women doctors in Britain&nbsp; It
also speaks of the origins of the London School of Medicine for Women. It
stresses that the women in India where women's rights are almost the strictest
anywhere, are trapped in a sex-segregated society, and must find a way out. Very
useful information is found on this web site and it is good for doing research..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cadden, Joan. <i>Meaning of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages</i>. Cambridge:
University Press, 1993.</p>
<p>Cadden also worked on medieval theories of nutrition and growth, so she is no
stranger to the ideas and history of medieval times. She worked with many people
to make this book a success. This book mainly emphasizes the ideas of womens
medicine, but does provide some valuable information on the importance of
midwifes. Although this book is fascinating, only a limited amount of
information is provided concerning women in medicine.</p>

<p>Cass, Victoria. Female healers in the Ming and the Lodge of Ritual and
Ceremony, <i>Journal of American Oriental Society</i>. 106(Jan./March 1986):
233-40.</p>
<p>The main profession for many years for women in medicine was wet nursing and
midwifery This journal explains the main reasons for this. It is very
informative and useful to use if information is needed. The only draw back of
this site is that it speaks of the Oriental Society, instead of the European.
This can usually show some bias toward one group of people. </p>

<p>Chinn, Carl. <i>They Worked All Their Lives</i>. New York, N.Y.: Manchester
University Press, 1988.</p>
<p>Chinn's book is about the poor women of urban England. The midwife was the
one who took care of the pregnant poor working woman.&nbsp; The book also speaks
of the Midwives Act of 1902, which sought to do away with practitioners of
midwifery. This book is very important for understanding the need for midwives,
and the role they changed throughout the years. This is a very useful book for
researching a topic as well as very interesting to read.</p>

<p>Dickstein, Leah M.D. <i>Women Physicians in Leadership Roles</i> Washington
D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1986.</p>
<p>This book gives us the history of women in the medical profession. In
Dicksteins book, we see the challenges women had to face, and how they overcame
them through hard work and persistence. The author is the chairwoman for the
American Psychiatric Association. This is a wonderful book, not only for women,
but for those interested in the accomplishments women have made in the medical
profession.</p>

<p>Hendricks, Ricky. Feminism and maternalism in early hospitals for children. <i>Journal
of the West</i>. 32(July 1993): 61-9.</p>
<p>Women have always been in close association with children because they&nbsp;
bear them. In this article, we see the importance of women physicians in the
healing of sick young children. The maternal instinct of the woman is sometimes
very useful in the therapy of a sick child. This is a good source to use when
researching a topic.</p>

<p>Herlihy, David. <i>Opera Muliebria</i>. Philadelphia, Pa: Temple University
Press, 1990.</p>
<p>Professor Herlihy is a distinguished scholar of medieval Europe. The process
of this book moves smoothly and efficiently. Herlihy points out that women mixed
medicine and cosmetics, cooked, and wove for wages as well as love. This is a
statement that captures the essence of the woman at home, and her strife for
success in the working world. Women were seen as healers. This book provides
informative material, along with moving stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McClain, Carol. <i>Women as Healers</i>. London: Rutgers University Press,
1989.</p>
<p>This book was written by McClain, but had many contributors, mostly
physicians. It speaks of the medical anthropology that women were associated
with. All of the information is found in the beginning of the book, because the
latter part is full of captivating stories. The information that is available is
very useful, and interesting.</p>

<p>Riska, Elainne. Women's careers in medicine: developments in the United
States and Finland. <i>Scandanavian Studies</i>. 61(Spring/Summer 1989) 185-98.</p>
<p>This journal shows the relation to the medical studies of the United States
to those in Finland. We see that the U.S. is setting the stepping stone for the
Finish women doctors. The article shows how women are laying the foundation for
other women. This is a very interesting article, and easy to follow.</p>

(18 March 1998).</p>
<p>This site was very informative. It spoke of the ancient woman, Agnodice, who
dressed like a man to be able to practice medicine. She was a very good doctor.
This site also speaks of the policies involving women in medicine in the ancient
world. It is very educational and entertaining.</p>

<p>Whitaker, Elaine E. Reading the Paston Letters Medically. <i>English Language
Notes</i>. 31(September 1993): 19-27.</p>
<p>This journal speaks of the attitudes of physicians toward women practicing
medicine. I found this article to be very boring and difficult to read. The
information was not worth the struggle trying to read it.</p>

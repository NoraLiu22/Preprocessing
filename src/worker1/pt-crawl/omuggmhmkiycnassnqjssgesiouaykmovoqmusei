<p><strong>Above:</strong>  This image shows the site as it was in 1951, before the park was created and opened in 1962. Green House and its grounds would be transformed into the gardens, and the old stable blocks and outbuildings would become the car park. We can also see the old pond, which would become the location for the boating pool. The houses on Manor Road would be demolished and another entrance sited there.</p>

<p><strong>Above:</strong> This map dates to 1931 and shows the boundary of the Green House estate which would be transformed into Green Park. After the end of World War Two the council were looking for a site for a public park in Ossett, and this image illustrates its suitability. After the death of its owner Herbert Harrop in 1960 the council purchased the house and its grounds, and developed the park which we see today.</p>

<p><strong>Above:</strong> This photograph shows the rear of Green House, and features which date to the 17th century. The house was much extended in later years but here we can see early mullioned windows and the date stone above the door which dates it to 1699. This stone shows the initials of Richard Foster and his wife Hannah, who had the original house built and gave it its original name, Hassel Hall. </p>
<p>After its demolition stone from the old house was reused to build the park keeper's bungalow. </p>

<h3>The History of Green Park by Ossett Historian, Neville Ashby</h3>
<p>Green Park was officially opened on 23rd April 1962, created on the site of a mansion named Green House and its grounds. This page gives details of over 250 years of the history of the house and the formation of the park.</p>
<p>The house appears to have been built in 1699, with a substantial additional development and enlargement which had taken place by the early 19th century. Looking at aerial photographs it appears as if the extension may have occurred on more than one occasion, at different periods. At the back was a half bricked up Norman-style archway surmounted by an inscription on the stone &quot;F R H 1699&quot;. The top two thirds of this old doorway had been blocked off with masonry, the lower part being fitted with a window which gave light to steps leading down to the cellars. </p>
<p>This door was at the 'back' of the house when it was demolished, but would have been the front door to the original house. There was also some 17th century walling and a mullioned window. It appears that the original house was facing more to the north, but when it was substantially altered and extended the new front door faced south. </p>
<p>It appears to have been originally built in 1699 for R F and his wife H. Whether there was a house on the site before this, or if this was a development of an already existing house we will never know. As for the family whose surname began with F, that may well be lost in the mists of time. Old family names from 18th century Ossett who could be the name on the stone include Fothergill, Fozard, France, Farrah, Fligg, Fearnside, Fearnley and Fenton.  </p>
<p>However, an indenture dated 20th July 1716 tells us that Richard Foster leased 'Hassell Hall' in Ossett to his brother in law John Lumb of Silcoates Hall and his wife, and son John the younger. The hall is described as &quot;that dining room or house recently built and erected by Richard Foster, the old man, in which he now lives&quot;. Richard's wife was called Hannah, so this fits with the date stone initials R and H F. The document also mentions other land in Ossett owned by Richard Foster, including Tophill Close, Middle Close, Rye Spring, Brooke Close and Laith Close. Richard left land to John Lumb which was situated in the area of upper Green in Ossett. </p>
<p>In 1725 a transfer of land from Richard Foster to Joshua Thornes is recorded.  Another indenture dated 1758 shows that Richard Foster's grandson John (born in 1723) sold lands to John Denison of Leeds, and his son Robert Denison. One of the occupants of these lands is Joseph Thorn. The document also records the passing of Hassell Hall to Robert Denison, along with its barns, buildings, stables, shop, outhouse, edifices, orchard, garden, fold etc. Also several closes of arable, meadow or pasture ground adjoining upon or lying near to the said property. These were the same lands named on the 1716 indenture, and were estimated to cover 20 acres. In April 1765 it appears that Robert Denison received &pound;600 from Joseph Thornes re: mortgage on Hassell Hall. This seems to record the building passing to the Thornes family. </p>
<p>With regard to the name Hassell Hall, there are a few possibilities where the name came from. The land on which it was built may have already borne the name. I think the strongest argument is that the word 'hassell' is a corruption of the word 'hazel', referring to hazel trees which grew in the place. (There is an 18th century farm to the south of Thornhill called Hazle Greave, which was sometimes referred to in the 18th century Thornhill parish register as Haslegreave.) It is a theory that the Thornes family greatly extended the house some time in the later 18th century, and it could be that it was re-named Green House at this time. </p>
<p>In 1841 Joseph Thornes was living in the house with his 45 year old sister Amelia and their niece and nephew, Sarah (15) and Joseph (8). They had a servant living there too, 25 year old Sarah Hanson. They were all Ossett born. Joseph was described as a maltster by trade. (Sarah and Joseph's parents had been Joshua Thornes junr and Mary Ann Walshaw, married at Thornhill church on 29th November 1824. She was the daughter of the late Robert Walshaw of Horbury Bridge, corn dealer and miller. The Walshaw family had been millers at Horbury Bridge since at least the early 18th century. Their mill was within the parish of Thornhill. By the time of the 1841 census young Sarah and Joseph's parents had died.) </p>
<p>In 1851 Joseph, his sister Amelia and their niece &amp; nephew were all still there, Joseph's occupation now showing as a proprietor of land and houses. He was 68 years old and his farming interests had gained him much land. That year he donated the plot of land on which South Ossett church was built.</p>
<p>However, Joseph died in June 1853, leaving Amelia (57), Sarah (27) and Joseph (20) living at the house. </p>
<p>On 28th October 1858 Joseph was married at Thornhill church to Elizabeth Charlesworth of Lees Moor, Thornhill. Joseph was a farmer, as was Elizabeth's father. It appears he had now taken over his uncle's land and property. His aunt Amelia had died a few months before he was married, and now he was occupant and head of household Green House.</p>
<p>In 1861 Joseph (28) and Elizabeth Thornes (26) now reside at Green House, with their two children, Mary Ann Thornes (1), possibly named after Joseph's mother, and Matthew Charlesworth Thornes (1 month). Also living there is Elizabeth's 32 year-old sister, Judith Sarah Charlesworth. They have three staff - Rebecca Worrall (57) who is a nurse, Elizabeth Snowden (27), a servant and Sarah Whitehead (18), also a servant. Joseph is a farmer of 125 acres, employing four labourers. They had another son a couple of years later who they name Joshua, but he died in 1864 in his second year. A third son Joseph was born in 1864, and baptised at Thornhill church on 22nd September that year.</p>
<p>In 1871 Joseph Thornes is described as 'yeoman' with 160 acres, employing five people. Elizabeth is still with him, as are their two youngest children, William (3) and Norland (1). Matthew Charlesworth Thornes was at The Elms boarding school in Nuneaton, as was his younger brother Joseph. Hannah Mitchell and Elizabeth Haigh, both 19, were servants at Green House. </p>
<p>On Monday 10th March 1873 various freehold properties were sold at an auction which took place at the Coopers Arms, Ossett, commencing at 5 o' clock in the evening. It was much of the estate of Joseph Thornes, who was moving to Conisborough Priory, a mansion house in South Yorkshire. The Green House estate was sold the following year by auction, and was purchased by George Harrop of Ossett for &pound;3,800.  Around the beginning of 1874 George Harrop had bought land in Horbury and the construction of Rock House had begun. George was in the woollen cloth manufacturing business at Albion Mills, Horbury Bridge (these premises later became the home of Slazengers). When the house was completed, he moved there. </p>
<p>In 1881 George Harrop's son John (42) was living at Green House with his wife Mary (38) and their children - Jane Annie (12), Alice Mary (10), Herbert (9), George (8) and Ada (6). John and Mary were both born is Ossett, as were their children, and John was a master woollen manufacturer. Also living at the house were Rachel Shepherd (34), a cook, Sarah Cadman (22), a house maid, and Mary Tully (28, from Dublin), a general servant. John had married Mary Westerman, also of Ossett, on 22nd December 1864 at Dewsbury parish church. </p>
<p>In 1891 John Harrop is still there with his wife Mary, and their children Sarah (25), Harriet (24), Jane Annie, Alice Mary, Herbert and George. Margaret Potts is a 28 year-old general servant.  </p>
<p>The family continued to live in the house. Mary Harrop died on 24th May 1903, and John Harrop died on 28th April 1910. By the time of the 1911 census brothers and sisters Sarah (45), Harriet (44), Jane Annie (42), Herbert (39) and George (38) are all now the occupants. Herbert and George are both cloth manufacturers, the sisters living by private means. None of them are married. Additionally there are Adelaide Westwood, a 20 year old cook, and Pollie Westwood, a 19 year old housemaid. </p>
<p>Jane Annie died in 1912, Harriet died in 1919 and so did George. He was living in Batley at the time. Sarah died in 1944, leaving Herbert living in the house alone. </p>
<p align+"center"><img src="../images/Green_Park_Steps.jpg" width="1000" height="750" alt="Green Park Steps"></p>
<p>Herbert Harrop died at noon on 29th January 1960 at Green House. He had been in his 90th year and had never married, having been born in the house. He had been in business at Albion Mills in Horbury Bridge (his grandfather's premises) with his father John Harrop, and subsequently with his uncle Joshua Harrop. When that company was dissolved he went into business with his brother George, and they formed the Horbury Bridge Mill Company. George died a few years later in June 1919, and Herbert retired when the firm closed down in the 1930s.  He had been a keen sportsman, following the Badsworth hunt on horseback, and was keen on going to the horse racing. He was also an early motorist, buying his first car in 1910, and had indulged in car rides until quite recently before his death.  Herbert left a nephew in South Alford, Lincolnshire, and a niece in Surbiton, Surrey. His funeral took place on Tuesday 2nd February 1960, at Ossett parish church. Many wreaths were sent. (It was reported a few months later that he left &pound;103,887.) </p>
<p>For some years after the second world war the council had been discussing the possibility of providing a public park for Ossett.  The finance chairman, councillor Clark, had begun putting &pound;1,000 per year from the rates into a fund for this scheme. At the Ossett Town Council meeting of 26th March 1958 it was said that &pound;9,000 had now been set aside. </p>
<p>At the Ossett Town Council meeting on Wednesday 27th April 1960 the district valuer was asked to negotiate for the purchase of Green House and its land, with a view to making a public open space. The council had had this small estate in mind for a number of years. It was 6 acres, partly wooded, and included the house which is not in a good state of repair. </p>
<p>At the council's meeting on 27th July it was recorded that agreement has been reached with executors of the Green House estate, to purchase the unoccupied house with its 6 acres of grounds. The house and outbuildings were in an almost derelict state and would have to be demolished. A layout plan is in preparation. The purchase for &pound;1,500 would leave &pound;7,000 or &pound;8,000 for development. </p>
<p>On 13th August it was reported in the Ossett Observer that very window has been smashed at Green House by vandals. They were nearly all half inch plate glass. The house had 16 rooms and only one pane was left intact. Floorboards had been ripped up, and lead pipes and electric light switches had been stolen, as well as metal stair rails. The council removed the remaining lead pipes and other fittings, and they removed the entrance gates to prevent them from being damaged. At the council meeting of Sept 29th it was reported that purchase had now been completed. Certain works were to be carried out as soon as possible. These included the demolition of the house and outbuildings, clearing the undergrowth and some trees, and repairing and lowering existing boundary walls. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/Green_Park_Lodge.jpg" width="1000" height="750" alt="Green Park Lodge"></p>
<p>Development waited throughout winter, and began in the Spring of 1961. The land was neglected and overgrown, and would need ploughing up and re-seeding with grass. A bandstand had been a part of the original plans, but this idea was scrapped. However, a decision was made to include a model boating pool. There was an area where the water gathered and this would be the ideal place. On 10th June the Ossett Observer reported that the demolition was now almost complete.</p>
<p>During the summer the public had been allowed access to the Green Park site, but towards the end of September 1961 they were now being asked to co-operate in not using the place. The grass had been sown and trees and shrubs were being planted. </p>
<p>At the town council meeting of Wednesday 25th October, plans were approved for a refreshment pavilion incorporating conveniences, a store room and kitchen. Tenders were sought as soon as possible. By Spring 1962 three were received, ranging in price between &pound;5,197-9-3 and &pound;6,410-5-0. The lowest one was accepted, that of Sharlston (Builders) Ltd. </p>
<p>The park was to be opened at Easter 1962. Mr Clark had been invited to perform the ceremony, the finance chairman who had been instrumental in the formation of the scheme. However, he would be out of the country and unavailable, so the Mayor, councillor Robb, was chosen instead. </p>
<p>The Hannah Pickard fountain, in storage for a few years, was part of the plan in the park, and was to be installed in the old kitchen garden of Green House. It would be working again, being situated above one of the old wells which served the house. However, the operation of this turned out to be not possible, so it was placed there as an ornamental feature instead. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/Green_Park_Lake.jpg" width="999" height="650" alt="Green Park Lake"></p>
<p>The workmen had been busy laying tarmac paths, creating the pool, and planting ornamental and flowering trees and shrubs, and building new walls and entrances. The original wooden gates to the house had been restored and painted white. 20 cherry trees had been planted along the boundary wall between the two entrances from The Green.  </p>
<p>A car park and grassed area had been created on the site of the old stables and outbuildings. A driveway linked the two entrances, and this was bordered by laurels, hollies, mixed shrubs, wallflowers etc. The model boating pond was surrounded by crazy paving and had two seats. Circular seats had been fitted around a few trees in the park and a wooden shelter was built in the top corner nearest to Manor Road. The entrance from Manor Road had sections of railings fitted on either side which came from the demolition of the old Wesleyan chapel in Wesley Street.</p>
<p>The official opening took place on Easter Monday, 23rd April 1962, on a bright sunny day. Almost 4,000 people came to see the new attraction for the town. Councillor Alex Robb unveiled a commemorative plaque which was set on a piece of stone taken from the quarry at Storrs Hill, and a Union Jack was hoisted to the top of a flag pole. Over a hundred balloons were released, bought by visitors to have their address details tagged to them. A prize was to be awarded to the balloon which travelled the furthest. </p>
<p>Ossett Borough Brass Band had marched from the town centre to the park for the opening ceremony, and they played a two-hour concert. The Ossett and Horbury Marine Modellers Society gave an exhibition on the pool. Punch and Judy shows were also given.</p>
<p>The construction of the pavilion and park keeper's lodge continued, the lodge being constructed from materials left over from the demolition of Green House. On 15th September the Ossett Observer reported that Ossett Rotary Club had offered to gift a sundial for the park. In June 1963 the council declared they were going to obtain tea and coffee making equipment for the pavilion, as well as the necessary crockery and furniture for serving refreshments there. Mrs Dews would be offered the job of serving there, she was the wife of the park keeper and lived in the lodge. If she declined the job would be advertised. </p>
<p>An enquiry had been made into the possibility of hiring out the pavilion for private functions, such as weddings etc, but this was declined. The pavilion was opened on the weekend of 3rd August 1963. It was staffed by the park keeper, Mr Dews, and his wife, who had accepted the job offer from the council. It served pop and crisps, as well as tea and coffee. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/Green_Park_Autumn.jpg" width="1001" height="563" alt="Green Park in Autumn"></p>
<p>Today the park has a rich variety of plants, shrubs and trees, and retains many clues to its past. The pavilion, boating pond and fountain have gone, but in more recent years fitness equipment has been added and the play area has been improved to meet modern safety standards. There is a 'Friends Of Green Park' group which, amongst other things, maintains the planters around the car park and keeps the area free of litter. </p>
<p>Further information and memories about the park can be found on the Ossett history website <a href="https://ossett.net/" target="_blank">www.ossett.net</a> and on the Facebook group Ossett Through The Ages.</p>

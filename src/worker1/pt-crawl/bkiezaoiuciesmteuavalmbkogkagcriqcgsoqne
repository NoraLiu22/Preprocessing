<p align="left">Early in her life, Mary Wollstonecraft began making great
contributions and brought forth new and not well-received views on women and
society. When she was nineteen, she and her sister founded and taught in a
school, an experience which led her to write Thoughts on the Education of
Daughters. In this, she asserted her view that the young girls she taught had
been &quot;enslaved&quot; by men through their social training. Wollstonecraft
disagreed with the traditional teachings and believed that girls should study
new topics.</p>
<p align="left">Richard Price, a minister at the local Dissenting Chapel, and
friend to Wollstonecraft preached a sermon praising the French Revolution. He
believed that the French had a right to remove a bad king from the throne.
Edmund Burke wrote a reply to this sermon called Reflections on the Revolution
in France. In his reply he argued that there should be inherited rights of the
monarchy. Wollstonecraft was upset by this and wrote A Vindication of the Rights
of Men in defense of Price’s sermon. She not only defended Price but also
included what she thought was wrong in society, including slave trade and the
manner in which the poor were treated.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Wollstonecraft's most famous work, through which she gained her
the reputation as a feminist, was A Vindication of the Rights of Women. This
controversial work argued for the need for more civil rights for women, a cause
which Wollstonecraft believed could only be furthered by permitting women better
education .She asserted that a woman was capable of any intellectual feat that a
man was--provided that her early training did not brainwash her into deference
to man. Wollstonecraft believed that women's freedom should extend to their
sexual lives. In her writings, she compared married life for a woman to
prostitution. She pursued her own sexual freedom through an affair, and bore an
illegitimate child.</p>
<p align="left">The ideas in Wollstonecraft’s book were revolutionary and
caused much controversy at the time. Her ideas that were once considered to be
absurd are now what a majority of what the Western World believe. Later, she
fell in love with William Godwin, the father of her second daughter, Mary
Wollstonecraft Shelley. Tragically, Mary died from complications while
delivering her child.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">During her lifetime, Wollstonecraft raised arguments in support
of women's rights that would figure prominently in the women's rights movements
of the following two centuries. Her work in pursuit of equality for women led to
her being dubbed the founder of the British Women's Rights Movement.&nbsp;<br>

<p align="left"><b><u><br>
</u>Flexner, Eleanor. <i>Mary Wollstonecraft: A Biography</i><u>.</u> New York:
Coward, McCann, &amp; Geoghegan, Inc. 1972.</b><br>
&nbsp;This book contains not only bibliographic information, but also letters
that were previously un-cited in other books about Wollstonecraft. Flexner
highlights how Wollstonecraft's early life had a great impact on the development
of her ideas.&nbsp; It also updates the biography by Ralph Wardle from 1951.&nbsp;
Flexner tone is somewhat critical of Wollstonecraft.</p>
<p align="left"><b>George, Margaret. <i>One Woman's Situation</i><u>.</u>
Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1970.</b><br>
Except for a passive and negative history, Margaret George maintains that women
do not have a history; however, women do have a pre-history in which Mary
Wollstonecraft's achievements are an important pre-historic document. This is
the basis for George's biography of Wollstonecraft, in which she focuses on
Mary's position as one of the earliest feminists.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gordon, Lyndall. <i>Vindication.</i> New York, NY:
HarperCollins, 2005.</b><br>
&nbsp;Vindication brings about new ideas on how she influenced early American
political thought in England. It also places emphasis on how much influence
Wollstonecraft’s writings had on American figures. Gordon has written
biographies on other famous individuals such as T.S. Eliot, Charlotte Bronte,&nbsp;
and Virginia Woolf.<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gordon, Lyndall. <i>Mary Wollstonecraft: A New Genius, </i>UK:
Warner Books, 2005.</b>Other biographers have focused on the negative
characteristics of Wollstonecraft, such as her self-pitying and egocentric
tones, but Gordon examines her life without these negative judgments. Gordon
discusses the lives of Wollstonecraft's first lover, Imlay, and his friend Joel
Barlow. She provides great detail of their lives and also explains&nbsp; the
business venture of Imlay's that took Wollstonecraft to Scandinavia.&nbsp; This
book would be good if you wanted a deeper look in Wollstonecraft's personal
dealings in addition to her contributions and literature.<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ingpen, Roger. </b><i><b>Preface. The Love Letters of Mary
Wollstonecraft to Gilbert Imlay. By Wollstonecraft.</b></i> <b>Folcroft:
Folcroft Library Editions, 1974.</b><br>
Roger Ingpen has gathered what he calls &quot;the most passionate love letters
in our literature,&quot; the letters of Mary Wollstonecraft to Gilbert Imlay.
Ingpen begins the book with a brief biography contained in the preface. The
biography is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather simply an introduction to
Wollstonecraft. This book would be useful for anyone researching the love affair
of Wollstonecraft and Imlay. It also illustrates Mary's unconventional
existence, and the actions for which many of her time would have condemned her.</p>

(1759 - 1797). 1996. &lt;<a href="http://www,philosophypages.com/ph/woll.htm">www.philosophypages.com/ph/woll.htm</a>&gt;
(November 13, 2000).</b><br>
This site reiterates some of Wollstonecraft's observations at the school where
she taught. It also mentions her book, History and Moral View of the Origins and
Progress of the French Revolution, written as a result of her interest in
revolutionary politics. Kemerling states that this interest was connected to the
democratic ideals inherent in the Revolution, which also factored in women's
rights. Wollstonecraft's political leanings are examined in some detail.&nbsp;</p>

(May 13, 2004).</b><br>
This website provides a short biography of Mary Wollstonecraft. It is important
because it does provide links to her writings and to important people in her
life. This site would be good if the reader is just looking for an overview of
Mary Wollstonecraft’s life.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lewis, Jone Johnson. <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman:

</a>(2005).</b>This website provides an overview of Mary Wollstonecraft’s life
and literature works. It also provides links to quotations, A Vindication of the
Rights of Women, other writings, a book list, and also analysis and criticism of
her work.&nbsp;</p>

<b>O'Quinn, Daniel. &quot;Trembling: Wollstonecraft, Godwin, and the resistance
to literature.&quot; EHL 64 (1997): 761-88.</b><br>
This scholarly article would be beneficial for those studying resistance to
literature. The goal of the article is to &quot;tease out how the resistance to
novels participates in a formulation of community and class consolidation.&quot;</p>

<b>Smith, Amy Elizabeth. &quot;Roles for readers in Mary Wollstonecraft's A
vindication of the rights of women.&quot; Studies in English Literature 32
(1992): 555-70.</b><br>
The focus of this article is the debate by scholars over the primary audience
intended by Mary Wollstonecraft in &quot;The Vindication of the Rights of
Women.&quot; One side of the debate justifies this as intended for a female
audience. Because women were unaccustomed to rational discourse, this might have
been why Wollstonecraft wrote in such an informal manner for her intended female
audience.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sunstein, Emily. <i>A Different Face.</i> New York: Harper
and Row, Publishers, 1975.</b><br>
Sunstein's biography of Mary Wollstonecraft focuses on her search for personal
independence, and how it contributed to the larger feminist movement. The author
writes a comprehensive biography in which she follows the trials and triumphs of
Mary Wollstonecraft's life. Sunstein then asks, &quot;What kind of life should a
woman ask for?&quot;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Taylor, Barbara. <i>Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist
Imagination</i><u>.</u> Cambridge,U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2003.</b><br>
This book provides an in-depth look at the thoughts and works of Mary
Wollstonecraft. An important aspect of this book is that Taylor makes a
connection between her troubled personal life and her feminist radicalism.
Taylor states that this book is “a study of Mary Wollstonecraft’s radical
imagination, particularly her feminist imaginings.” This book can be difficult
to read without prior knowledge of feminism and the history of Britain in the
late 1700’s and early 1800’s.<br>
<br>
<b>Tomalin, Claire. <i>The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft.</i> New York:
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1974.</b><br>
Claire Tomalin looks at the life of Mary Wollstonecraft with emphasis on her
reputation both before and after her death. She explores the influence and
relationship between Mary's life and that of other feminists, such as Jane
Austen and Helen Maria Williams. Claire Tomalin has written several other noted
biographies.<br>
<br>
<b>Todd, Janet. <i>Mary Wollstonecraft A Revolutionary Life.</i> New York, NY:
Columbia University Press, 2000.</b><br>
This biography examines that it was Mary Wollstonecraft’s life and letters
that have remained her most lasting legacy. Todd includes Mary
Wollstonecraft’s published work as well as her letters and examines the
psychological revelations between them. This biography is easy to follow and
reads like a novel. Janet Todd&nbsp; is a Research Professor of English at the
University of Glasgow. She is the editor of <i>A Wollstonecraft Anthology</i>.<br>

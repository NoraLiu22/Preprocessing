<A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T540x">(540)</A><A NAME="T540"></A> As for Pontus, Mithridates Eupator established himself as king of it; and he held the country bounded by the Halys River as far as the Tibarani and Armenia, and held also, of the country this side the Halys, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T541a">541</A> the region extending to Amastris and to certain parts of Paphlagonia. And he acquired, not only the sea‑coast towards the west as far as Heracleia, the native land of Heracleides the Platonic philosopher, but also, in the opposite direction, the sea‑coast extending to Colchis and Lesser Armenia; and this, as we know, he added to Pontus. And in fact this country was comprised within these


<A ID="p373"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p373 </SPAN></A>boundaries when Pompey took it over, upon his overthrow of Mithridates. The parts towards Armenia and those round Colchis he distributed to the potentates who had fought on his side, but the remaining parts he divided into eleven states and added them to Bithynia, so that out of both there was formed a single province. And he gave over to the descendants of Pylaemenes the office of king over certain of the Paphlagonians situated in the interior between them,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/12C*.html#note1
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">1</A> just as he gave over the Galatians to the hereditary tetrarchs. But later the Roman prefects made different divisions from time to time, not only establishing kings and potentates, but also, in the case of cities, liberating some and putting others in the hands of potentates and leaving others subject to the Roman people. As I proceed I must speak of things in detail as they now are, but I shall touch slightly upon things as they were in earlier times whenever this is useful. I shall begin at Heracleia, which is the most westerly place in this region.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.2">2</A>
Now as one sails into the Euxine Sea from the Propontis, one has on his left the parts which adjoin Byzantium (these belong to the Thracians, and are called "the Left-hand Parts" of the Pontus), and on his right the parts which adjoin Chalcedon. The first of these latter belong to the Bithynians, the next to the Mariandyni (by some also called Caucones), the next to the Paphlagonians as far as the Halys River, and the next to the Pontic Cappadocians and to the people next in order after them as far as Colchis. All these are called the "Right-hand Parts" of the Pontus. Now Eupator reigned over the whole of this sea‑coast, beginning at Colchis


<A ID="p375"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p375 </SPAN></A>and extending as far as Heracleia, but the parts farther on, extending as far as the mouth of the Pontus and Chalcedon, remained under the rule of the king of Bithynia. But when the kings had been overthrown, the Romans preserved the same boundaries, so that Heracleia was added to Pontus and the parts farther on went to the Bithynians.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.3">3</A>
Now as for the Bithynians, it is agreed by most writers that, though formerly Mysians, they received this new name from the Thracians — the Thracian Bithynians and Thynians — who settled the country in question, and they put down as evidences of the tribe of the Bithynians that in Thrace certain people are to this day called Bithynians, and of that of the Thynians, that the coast near Apollonia and Salmydessus is called Thynias. And the Bebryces, who took up their abode in Mysia before these people, were also Thracians, as I suppose. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T542a">542</A> It is stated that even the Mysians themselves are colonists of those Thracians who are now called Moesians.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref2" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/12C*.html#note2
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">2</A> Such is the account given of these people.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.4">4</A>
But all do not give the same account of the Mariandyni and the Caucones; for Heracleia, they say, is situated in the country of the Mariandyni, and was founded by the Milesians; but nothing has been said as to who they are or whence they came, nor yet do the people appear characterised by any ethnic difference, either in dialect or otherwise, although they are similar to the Bithynians. <A NAME="3.4.2"></A>Accordingly, it is reasonable to suppose that this tribe also was at first Thracian. <A NAME="3.4.3"></A>Theopompus says that Mariandynus ruled over a part of Paphlagonia, which was under the rule of many potentates, and then invaded and took possession of the country of the


<A ID="p377"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p377 </SPAN></A>Bebryces, but left the country which he had abandoned named after himself. <A NAME="3.4.4"></A>This, too, has been said, that the Milesians who were first to found Heracleia forced the Mariandyni, who held the place before them, to serve as Helots, so that they sold them, but not beyond the boundaries of their country (for the two peoples came to an agreement on this), just as the Mnoan class,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref3" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.5">5</A>
As for the Cauconians, who, according to report, took up their abode on the sea‑coast next to the Mariandyni and extended as far as the Parthenius River, with Tieium as their city, some say that they were Scythians, others that they were a certain people of the Macedonians, and others that they were a certain people of the Pelasgians. <A NAME="3.5.2"></A>But I have already spoken of these people in another place.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="

Now Heracleia is a city that has good harbours and is otherwise worthy of note, since, among other things, it has also sent forth colonies; for both Chersonesus&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/12C*.html#note8
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">8</A> and Callatis are colonies from it. It was at first an autonomous city, and then for some time was ruled by tyrants, and then recovered its freedom, but later was ruled by kings, when it became subject to the Romans. The people received a colony of Romans, sharing with them a part of their city and territory. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T543a">543</A> But Adiatorix, the son of Domnecleius, tetrarch of the Galatians, received from Antony that part of the city which was occupied by the Heracleiotae; and a little before the Battle of Actium he attacked the Romans by night and slaughtered them, by permission of Antony, as he alleged. But after the victory at Actium he was led in triumph and slain together with his son. The city belongs to the Pontic Province which was united with Bithynia.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.7">7</A>
Between Chalcedon and Heracleia flow several rivers, among which are the Psillis and the Calpas and the Sangarius, which last is mentioned by the poet.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/12C*.html#note9
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">9</A> The Sangarius has its sources near the village Sangia, about one hundred and fifty stadia from Pessinus. It flows through the greater part of Phrygia Epictetus, and also through a part of Bithynia, so that it is distant from Nicomedeia a little more than three hundred stadia, reckoning from the place where it is joined by the Gallus River, which has its beginnings at Modra in Phrygia on the Hellespont. This is the same country as Phrygia Epictetus, and it was formerly occupied by the Bithynians. Thus increased, and now having


<A ID="p381"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p381 </SPAN></A>become navigable, though of old not navigable, the river forms a boundary of Bithynia at its outlets. Off this coast lies also the island Thynia. The plant called aconite grows in the territory of Heracleia. This city is about one thousand five hundred stadia from the Chalcedonian temple and five hundred from the Sangarius River.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.8">8</A>
Tieium is a town that has nothing worthy of mention except that Philetaerus, the founder of the family of Attalic Kings, was from there. Then comes the Parthenius River, which flows through flowery districts and on this account came by its name;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">10</A> it has its sources in Paphlagonia itself. And then comes Paphlagonia and the Eneti. Writers question whom the poet means by "the Eneti," when he says, "And the rugged heart of Pylaemenes led the Paphlagonians, from the land of the Eneti, whence the breed of wild mules";&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref11" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/12C*.html#note16
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">16</A> But the thing upon which there is general agreement is, that the Eneti, to whom Pylaemenes belonged, were the most notable tribe of the Paphlagonians, and that,


<A ID="p383"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p383 </SPAN></A>furthermore, these made the expedition with him in very great numbers, but, losing their leader, crossed over to Thrace after the capture of Troy, and on their wanderings went to the Enetian country,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref17" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.9">9</A>
As for the Paphlagonians, they are bounded on the east by the Halys River, "which," according to Herodotus,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref19" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/12C*.html#note19
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">19</A> "flows from the south between the Syrians and the Paphlagonians and empties into the Euxine Sea, as it is called"; by "Syrians," however, he means the "Cappadocians," and in fact they are still to‑day called "White Syrians," while those outside the Taurus are called "Syrians." As compared with those this side the Taurus, those outside have a tanned complexion, while those this side do not, and for this reason received the appellation "white." And Pindar says that the Amazons "swayed a 'Syrian' army that reached afar with their spears," thus clearly indicating that their abode was in Themiscyra. Themiscyra is in the territory of the Amiseni; and this territory belongs to the White Syrians, who live in the country next after the Halys River. On the east, then, the Paphlagonians are bounded by the Halys River; on the south by Phrygians and the Galatians who settled among them; on the west by the Bithynians and the Mariandyni (for the race of the Cauconians has


<A ID="p385"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p385 </SPAN></A>everywhere been destroyed) and on the north by the Euxine. Now this country was divided into two parts, the interior and the part on the sea, each stretching from the Halys River to Bithynia; and Eupator not only held the coast as far as Heracleia, but also took the nearest part of the interior,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref20" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

After the Parthenius River, then, one comes to Amastris, a city bearing the same name as the woman who founded it. It is situated on a peninsula and has harbours on either side of the isthmus. Amastris was the wife of Dionysius the tyrant of Heracleia and the daughter of Oxyathres, the brother of the Dareius whom Alexander fought. Now she formed the city out of four settlements, Sesamus and Cytorum and Cromna (which Homer mentions in his marshalling of the Paphlagonian ships)&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref23" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/12C*.html#note23
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">23</A> and, fourth, Tieium. This last, however, soon revolted from the united city, but the other three remained together; and, of these three, Sesamus is called the acropolis of Amastris. Cytorum was once the emporium of the Sinopeans; it was named after


<A ID="p387"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p387 </SPAN></A>Cytorus, the son of Phryxus, as Ephorus says. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T545a">545</A> The most and the best box‑wood grows in the territory of Amastris, and particularly round Cytorum. The Aegialus is a long shore of more than a hundred stadia, and it has also a village bearing the same name, which the poet mentions when he says, "Cromna and Aegialus and the lofty Erythini,"&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref24" HREF="

Themiscyra is a plain; on one side it is washed by the sea and is about sixty stadia distant from the city, and on the other side it lies at the foot of the mountainous country, which is well-wooded and coursed by streams that have their sources therein. So one river, called the Thermodon, being supplied by all these streams, flows out through the plain; and another river similar to this, which flows out of Phanaroea, as it is called, flows out through the same plain, and is called the Iris. It has its sources in Pontus itself, and, after flowing through the middle of the city Comana in

Here the Lycus River, which has its beginnings in Armenia, joins it, and itself also becomes the Iris. Then the stream is received by Themiscyra and by the Pontic Sea. On this account the plain in question is always moist and covered with grass and can support herds of cattle and horses alike and admits of the sowing of millet-seeds and sorghum-seeds in very great, or rather unlimited, quantities. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T548a">548</A> Indeed, their plenty of water offsets any drought, so that no famine comes down on these people, never once; and the country along the mountain yields so much fruit, self-grown and wild, I mean grapes and pears and apples and nuts, that those who go out to the forest at any time in the year get an abundant supply — the fruits at one time still hanging on the trees and at another lying on the fallen leaves or beneath them, which are shed deep and in great quantities. And numerous, also, are the catches of all kinds of wild animals, because of the good yield of food.

Some change the text and make it read "Alazones," others "Amazones," and for the words "from Alybê" they read "from Alopê," or "from Alobê," calling the Scythians beyond the Borysthenes River "Alazones," and also "Callipidae" and other names — names which Hellanicus and Herodotus and Eudoxus have foisted on us — and placing the Amazons between Mysia and Caria and Lydia near Cymê, which is the opinion also of Ephorus, who was a native of Cymê. And this opinion might perhaps


<A ID="p407"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p407 </SPAN></A>not be unreasonable, for he may mean the country which was later settled by the Aeolians and the Ionians, but earlier by the Amazons.

These objections Ephorus solves by his change of the text, for he writes thus: "But the Amazons were led by Odius and Epistrophus, from Alopê far away, where is the race of Amazons." But in solving these objections he has fallen into another fiction; for Alopê is nowhere to be found in this region; and, further, his change of the text, with innovations so contrary to the evidence of the early manuscripts, looks like rashness. But the Scepsian apparently accepts neither the opinion of Ephorus nor of those who suppose them to be the Halizoni near Pallenê, whom I have mentioned in my description of Macedonia.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref52" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">52</A> He is also at a loss to understand how anyone could think that an allied force came to help the Trojans from the nomads beyond the Borysthenes River; and he especially approves of the opinions of Hecataeus of Miletus, and of Menecrates of Elaea, one of the disciples of Xenocrates, and all of that of Palaephatus. The first of these says in his <I>Circuit of the Earth</I>: "Near the city Alazia is the River Odrysses, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T551a">551</A> which flows out of


<A ID="p409"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p409 </SPAN></A>Lake Dascylitis from the west through the plain of Mygdonia and empties into the Rhyndacus." But he goes on to say that Alazia is now deserted, and that many villages of the Alazones, through whose country the Odrysses flows, are inhabited, and that in these villages Apollo is accorded exceptional honour, and particularly on the confines of the Cyziceni. Menecrates in his work entitled <I>The Circuit of the Hellespont</I> says that above the region of Myrleia there is an adjacent mountainous tract which is occupied by the tribe of the Halizones. One should spell the name with two <SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">l</SPAN>'s, he says, but on account of the metre the poet spells it with only one. But Palaephatus says that it was from the Amazons who then lived in Alopê, but now in Zeleia, that Odius and Epistrophus made their expedition. How, then, can the opinions of these men deserve approval? For, apart from the fact that these men also disturb the early text, they neither show us the silver-mines, nor where in the territory of Myrleia Alopê is, nor how those who went from there to Ilium were "from far away," even if one should grant that there actually was an Alopê or Alazia; for these, of course, are much nearer the Troad than the places round Ephesus. But still those who speak of the Amazons as living in the neighbourhood of Pygela between Ephesus and Magnesia and Prienê talk nonsense, Demetrius says, for, he adds, "far away" cannot apply to that region.

Neither can Apollodorus impute such an opinion to the early writers, as though they, one and all, voiced the opinion that no peoples from the far side of the Halys River took part in the Trojan war. <A NAME="3.25.2"></A>One might rather find evidence to the contrary; at any rate, Maeandrius says that the Eneti first set forth from the country of the White Syrians and allied themselves with the Trojans, and that they sailed away from Troy with the Thracians and took up their abode round the recess of the Adrias,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref61" HREF="

Apollodorus somewhere states, also, that the poet got an account of those Paphlagonians who lived in the interior from men who had passed through the country on foot, but that he was ignorant of the Paphlagonian coast, just as he was ignorant of the rest of the Pontic coast; for otherwise he would have named them. On the contrary, one can retort and say, on the basis of the description which I have now given, that Homer traverses the whole of the coast and omits nothing of the things that were then worth recording, and that it is not at all remarkable if he does not mention Heracleia and Amastris and Sinopê, cities which had not yet been founded, and that it is not at all strange if he has mentioned no part of the interior. And further, the fact that Homer does not name many of the known places is no sign of ignorance, as I have already demonstrated in the foregoing part of my work;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref67" HREF="

<A ID="p419"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p419 </SPAN></A>was ignorant of many of the famous things round the Pontus, for example, rivers and tribes, for otherwise, he says, Homer would have named them. This one might grant in the case of certain very significant things, for example, the Scythians and Lake Maeotis and the Ister River, for otherwise Homer would not have described the nomads by significant characteristics as "Galactophagi" and "Abii" and as "men most just," and also as "proud Hippemolgi,"&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref68" HREF="

But in the case of things not so significant, either not at that time or for the purposes of his work, how could anyone find fault with Homer for omitting them? <A NAME="3.27.2"></A>For example, for omitting the Tanaïs River, which is well known for no other reason than that it is the boundary between Asia and Europe. <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T554a">554</A> <A NAME="3.27.3"></A>But the people of that time were not yet using either the name "Asia" or "Europe," nor yet had the inhabited world been divided into three continents as now, for otherwise he would have named them somewhere because of their very great significance, just as he mentions Libya and also the Lips, the wind that blows from the west parts of Libya. <A NAME="3.27.4"></A>But since the cliffs had not yet been distinguished, there was no need of mentioning the Tanaïs either. <A NAME="3.27.5"></A>Many things were indeed worthy of mention, but they did not occur to him; for of course

Above the region of Pharnacia and Trapezus are the Tibareni and the Chaldaei, whose country extends to Lesser Armenia. This country is fairly fertile. Lesser Armenia, like Sophenê, was always in the possession of potentates, who at times were


<A ID="p425"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p425 </SPAN></A>friendly to the other Armenians and at times minded their own affairs. They held as subjects the Chaldaei and the Tibareni, and therefore their empire extended to Trapezus and Pharnacia. But when Mithridates Eupator had increased in power, he established himself as master, not only of Colchis, but also of all these places, these having been ceded to him by Antipater, the son of Sisis. And he cared so much for these places that he built <SPAN CLASS="whole">seventy-five</SPAN> strongholds in them and therein deposited most of his treasures. The most notable of these strongholds were these: Hydara and Basgoedariza and Sinoria; Sinoria was close to the borders of Greater Armenia, and this is why Theophanes changed its spelling to Sinoria.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref73" HREF="

But long afterwards Moaphernes, my mother's uncle, came into distinction just before

Now in the times of the kings the affairs of Comana were administered in the manner already described, but when Pompey took over the authority, he appointed Archelaüs priest and included within his boundaries, in addition to the sacred land, a territory of two schoeni (that is, sixty stadia) in circuit and ordered the inhabitants to obey his rule. Now he was governor of these, and also master of the temple-servants who lived in the city, except that he was not empowered to sell them. And even

When Gabinius was sent into Syria, Archelaüs himself also went there in the hope of sharing with him in his preparations for the Parthian War, but since the Senate would not permit him, he dismissed that hope and found another of greater importance. For it happened at that time that Ptolemaeus, the father of Cleopatra, had been banished by the Egyptians, and his daughter, elder sister of Cleopatra, was in possession of the kingdom; and since a husband of royal family was being sought for her, Archelaüs proffered himself to her agents, pretending that he was the son of Mithridates Eupator; and he was accepted, but he reigned only six months. Now this Archelaüs was slain by Gabinius in a pitched battle, when the latter was restoring Ptolemaeus to his kingdom.

For learning about this, as it seems, after the men had already been put to death, Caesar was grieved, and he regarded the survivors as worthy of his favour and care, giving them the honour in question.

Many persons had abused and reduced both the multitude of temple-servants and the rest of the resources of the temple. The adjacent territory, also, was reduced, having been divided into several domains — I mean Zelitis, as it is called (which has the city Zela on a mound); for in early times the kings governed Zela, not as a city, but as a sacred precinct of the Persian gods, and the priest was the master of the whole thing.

Sir William Ramsay (<I>Journal of Hellenic Studies</I> 1918,


<A ID="p431x"></A>vol. 38, pp148 ff.) argues that "Mên" is a grecized form for the Anatolian "Manes," the native god of the land of Ouramma; and "Manes Ourammos was Hellenized as Zeus Ouruda-menos or Euruda-menos." See also

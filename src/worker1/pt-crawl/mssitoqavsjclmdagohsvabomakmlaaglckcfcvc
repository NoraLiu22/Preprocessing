<h2>Not a bit reprehensible</h2> <p> Every decade or so, a genre is
declared dead. The movie musical was theoretically killed off some time
in the 1960s. Some people complain that it's not realistic when
characters break into song.
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0299658"
 class=imdb title="IMDB information on Chicago"
><i>Chicago</i></a>
 has a brilliant gimmick that allows it to sidestep most of the
verisimilitude issues with musicals: all of the songs take place only
in the imagination of one character. The adaptation skips a lot of the
stage show numbers in order to maintain the illusion. Sadly, the song
"Class", a delightfully crude duet, was among the omitted, although it
makes an appearance on the soundtrack album. The good news is that most
of the other songs lost are no great loss. </p> <p> One of the best
things about Chicago is its attitude. This is a dark, seedy story
populated with characters who only look out for themselves. It's
got sex. It's got murder. It's got a prison full of women who
play friendly on the surface and attack each other behind closed doors.
Watching the tension between Roxie and Velma is a hoot, to put it
mildly. The one character that ever thinks of anyone else is a first
rate doormat, and his solo number, "Mr. Cellophane", talks about just
how much of a doormat he is. In fact, one of the most appealing aspects
of the story and the songs is the strength of the female characters.
There isn't a pushover or love interest or damsel in distress in
the plot at all, and it's a refreshing change from the standard, G-
rated, goody two-shoes, romanti-comedy shlock. </p> <p> Even when the
plot fails to supply an out, I don't have a problem with musical
numbers in terms of the believability. Even if I were the type to
object, Chicago offers some of the best musical numbers I've ever
seen. "We Both Reached For the Gun" recasts a press conference as a
huge marionette show. The effect is stunning. "Cell Block Tango"
combines skimpy costumes, sexy choreography, and a fatally infectious
beat into a showstopper that supposedly had the film crew applauding
between takes.

 hams it up in "When You're Good to Mama", making use of her
powerful voice and powerful stage presence.

 makes the most of his curious singing voice, bringing real character
to his songs. A lot of the credit for the spectacle belongs squarely on
the collective shoulders of cinematographer

 Their inventiveness sets a new standard. </p> <p> The closest thing to
disappointment I experienced watching Chicago was seeing digital
effects experts in the credits. Chicago is descended from a stage
musical, and its fantasy dance sequences are staged like those from a
stage musical. At every step of the way, the film looked like it was
done entirely with practical shots, requiring nothing at all in the
post-production except perhaps some color correction. The producers
make a big deal about the three cast primaries doing their own dancing
and singing. Why couldn't they do everything else in real life? A
bit of reeeeeesearch later, and I see that I'm almost certainly
overreacting. Most of the 3D work involved recreating period Chicago
without practical sets. The effects are pretty large, but with the
exception of some wire work, they don't seem to have permeated the
dance sequences. That would've been unforgivable. </p> <p> If I
haven't mentioned the cast very much, it's only because I'd
be here all night saying how great they all were. There's one scene
that I thought was ineptly acted, but it's only obviously ineptly
acted because it's surrounded by so much great acting.
Unfortunately, it's much harder for a critic to write a compelling
review about a great film than it is to sling trash. I loved Chicago. I
expect I'll feel a thrill every time I see it. </p>

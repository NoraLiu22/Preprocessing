          </font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Born, 1882, Kidderminster 
          Worcestershire, Great Britain</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Died, 1968, Lower 
          Hutt, New Zealand, aged 86</font></p>
        <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Labour Party 
          Prime Minister from 12 December 1957 to 12 December 1960</font></i></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Walter Nash was 
          born on 12 February 1882 in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. Nash attended 
          St Johns School until 1893 and then won a scholarship to King Charles 
          I Grammar School. However the additional cost was prohibitive so he 
          became office boy for a solicitor. In 1896 the Nash family moved to 
          Selly Oak near Birmingham and Nash worked as a clerk in a bicycle factory.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1906 Walter 
          Nash married Lotty May Eaton. He also set up a tobacco and a confectionery 
          shop. After a brief recession Nash decided to emigrate to New Zealand 
          in April 1909 and arrived in Wellington in May.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He settled in Brooklyn 
          and became a share holder in, and secretary of, a tailoring business. 
          Nash also became active in the Church of England and his strong Christian 
          beliefs shaped his political outlook and much of his life. In 1913 he 
          shifted to Palmerston North and became a commercial traveler. Then in 
          1916 he moved to New Plymouth and established a co-operative tailoring 
          company. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1918 he formed 
          the New Plymouth branch of the Labour Party , traveled overseas in 1920 
          and on his return was fined for importing seditious literature. In 1922 
          he became national secretary of the Labour Party and remained in this 
          job until 1932. He also served as Labour Party President from 1935 – 
          36.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Nash stood for 
          Hutt in 1925 and 1928 and finally got elected in a by-election in 1929. 
          In 1935 when Labour won office Nash became Minister of Finance and was 
          the third ranked minister. He helped nationalise the Reserve Bank and 
          bring in guaranteed dairy prices. Nash also spent much time overseas 
          negotiating agreements for trade and loans. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">During WWII Nash 
          spent much time overseas including 16 months as the resident Minister 
          in the US where he was an advocate of a world peace council. In April 
          1944 he was elected President of the International Labour Organisation 
          and attended the Breton Woods conference which created the International 
          Monetary Fund. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Labour lost office 
          in 1949 and their leader Peter Fraser died in December 1950. Nash at 
          the age of 68 was elected unopposed to replace him in January 1951. 
          Later that year was the waterfront snap election which Labour lost massively. 
          Nash spent six years as Opposition Leader before winning the 1957 election 
          by one seat and becoming Prime Minister at the age of 75.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Nash inherited 
          a balance of payments which was blowing out so had to introduce import 
          controls, followed by what is known as &quot;the Black Budget&quot; 
          in 1958 which increased taxes on beer, tobacco and petrol. This led 
          to a huge public backlash. Nash’s Government also tried to industrialiase 
          the country more by building aluminum smelters, a cotton mill and new 
          railway link to it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Labour and Nash 
          lost the 1960 election and he became Leader of the Opposition. His wife 
          died in December 1961 and in February 1963 he stood down as Leader to 
          be replaced by Nordmeyer. Nash remained MP for Hutt and was knighted 
          with a GCMG in 1965. He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War in his 
          final years and died on 4 June 1968.</font></p>

<p class="one">arold Hume Piffard, born in Marylebone, London, on 10 August 1867, was the 
sixth son of Charles Piffard (4 July 1829 – 2 July 1884) and his wife Emily, <em>née</em> 
Hume (1837 – 1911); she was the daughter of James Hume, a barrister and Magistrate at 
Calcutta. Charles was the Clerk of the Crown in the High Court of Calcutta. H. H. 
Piffard's four older brothers were, unlike him, all born in India. He was educated at 
Lancing College, in Sussex's Adur Valley, where he had gone with his older brother, Lawrence Grahame 
Woodroffe (born in 1865), in September 1877. Both left the school in July 1888.</p>

<p>"Piff" as he was known to his schoolmates, entered ancing at the age of ten. He often acted the class clown, for 
example, performing an aboriginal "war dance" on the railway bridge at the nearby Beeding 
Cement Works in front of an oncoming locomotive before diving into the river below. Not 
surprisingly, he was remembered by his classmates for his involvement in the school's 
theatrical productions. However, the Piffard who became a touring actor was his brother 
Hamilton Adrian Balfour (1862 - 1927). In 1889, H. H. Piffard himselk took up the formal study of 
art at the Royal Academy Schools, and exhibited his first painting at the Royal Academy 
in 1895.</p> 

<p>Piffard's career as a painter was assured when he exhibited four large-scale oil 
canvasses on historical subjects at the Royal Academy from 1895 to 1899, beginning with 
<span class="painting">The Last of the Garrison</span> (6 May through 5 August, 1895). 
His other entries likewise realised events in the Napoleonic wars. His most famous 
large-scale historical canvas, <span class="painting">Saragossa 10 February 1809</span>, 
dramatically (one might even say, sensationally) depicts Napoleon's forces brutally 
putting down the resistance of Spanish patriots inside the cathedral of Zaragoza during 
the Peninsular War: "gun smoke fills the interior of the church as French soldiers 
trample Spanish monks to the floor" (<span class="book">The Knohl Collection</span>).</p>

<p>Piffard then developed his artistic career in novel directions, as he moved from being 
a military artist to a book and magazine illustrator and then to an aviation pioneer. As 
a source of additional income after establishing himself as a painter, he illustrated
such periodicals as
<a href="../pagets/284.html"><span class="book">The Strand Magazine</span></a> beginning 
in April 1894, <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/intro.html"><span class="book">The 
Illustrated London News</span></a>, and <span class="book">The Pictorial Magazine</span>. 
At the age of twenty-eight he began to illustrate books for three publishers: Tower, C. 
Arthur Pearson, and S. W. Partridge, eventually illustrating over a hundred novels 
by such authors as <a href="../../../authors/eliot/index.html">George Eliot</a>, 
<a href="../../../authors/dickens/index.html">Charles Dickens</a>, Richard Marsh, Max 
Pemberton, and Guy Boothby. Between 1902 and 1912 he illustrated nearly seventy books for 
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. In 1908 he began working for Collins of 
London and Glasgow, illustrating their reprints of such classic novels as Thackeray's 
<span class="book">The Virginians</span>, <span class="book">Vanity Fair</span>, and 
<span class="book">Christmas Books</span>, as well as Dickens's <span 
class="book">Mystery of Edwin Drood</span>, and George Eliot's <span class="book">Felix 
Holt, the Radical</span>. He developed a socialist realistic strain in illustrating 
Robert Harborough Sherard's <span class="book">The White Slaves of England, Being True 
Pictures of Certain Social Conditions in the Kingdom of England in the year 1897</span>,
published by James Bowden that same year. The most memorable piece is the gruesome
frontispiece <span class="illustration">Done to Death</span>, which depicts the body of a 
nineteen-year-old inmate of the Newcastle Workhouse who died of lead poisoning. </p>

<p>Besides 
being a painter and commercial artist, he was much interested in aviation. While at his 
studio in Bedford Park in London, he began in 1907 to make model aircraft, receiving a 
prize for one of them at the Olympia in 1909.  In the <span class="book">Lancing College Magazine</span> (1910), H. H. Piffard was 
noted as an alumnus famous not in the arts but in the history of aviation. He wheeled 
around the airfield at the Shoreham-by-Sea aerodrome, but crashed his forty-horse-power 
aircraft <span class="book">The Hummingbird</span> in June of that year after he 
overstressed the landing gear, damaging the hand-carved wooden propeller. His crashing 
again that October rendered the plane inoperable. In September of 1910 he actually got a 
plane off the ground, and flew up to a height of forty feet for about half a mile. In 
1911, he unsuccessfully tested yet another new aircraft, the <span class="book">Piffard 
Hydroplane</span>, but this proved to be his last attempt at flying.</p>

<p>After that near-fatal accident, Piffard turned his attention once again to war 
painting at the outbreak of the First World War, notably <span class="painting">The Real 
Angel of Mons</span> (1916), <span class="painting">Daddy's Away</span>, and <span 
class="painting">Daddy Returns</span>. His most famous celebration of the heroism of 
British forces in the trenches of the the Great War is the much-circulated colour 
lithograph <span class="illustration">The Thin Red Line</span>. In 1917, among his few 
book illustrations were contributions to <span class="book">Canada in Khaki</span>. After 
1920 his work rarely appeared in books and periodicals. Although his grave marker in Old 
Chiswick Cemetery, London, bears the date "1938," he in fact died at Lambeth on 17 
January 1939. He was pointedly <em>not</em> a satirist and political cartoonist in the 
manner of French illustrator Caran d'Ache (Emmanuel Poir&eacute;), despite Simon Houfe's 
assertion.</p>

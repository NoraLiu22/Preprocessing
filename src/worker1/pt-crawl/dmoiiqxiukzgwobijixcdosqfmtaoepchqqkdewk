<p>Maria Theresa (1717-1780), archduchess of Austria, Holy Roman Empress, and queen of
Hungary and Bohemia, began her rule in 1740. She was the only woman ruler in the 650
history of the Habsburg dynasty.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was also one of the most
successful Habsburg rulers, male or female, while bearing sixteen children
between 1738 and 1756.</p>

<p> Maria Theresa was the eldest daughter of Holy Roman
Emperor Charles VI.&nbsp; In 1711, Charles VI found himself the sole remaining male Habsburg. An old European law, the
Salic Law, prohibited a woman from inheriting her father's kingdom. Concerned that he may
not father a son, Charles VI issued a decree in 1713, known as the Pragmatic
Sanction. This document guaranteed the right of succession to his daughter. At this
time, many of the great powers of Europe agreed to her succession of power, at a
price.&nbsp;
Upon the death of Charles VI in 1740, however, challenges to the Habsburg
lands
led to the War of the Austrian Succession.</p>

<p>During the last several years of her father's reign, two wars had already left the monarchy
financially compromised, and the army weakened. And since Charles VI had believed that his daughter
would surrender true power to her husband, Francis Stephen of Lorraine, he did not
take the time to teach her the workings of the government. Without money, a strong army, and
knowledge of state affairs, Maria Theresa knew she had to rely on her judgment and
strength of character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>King Frederick II of Prussia was her first challenger, when he took
the occasion of Charles VI's death to occupy Silesia, beginning the War of
Austrian Succession (1740-1748). Bavaria and France joined in and
invaded Maria Theresa's lands from the west. This challenge by Frederick II became the
dominating element of Maria Theresa's long reign. The archduchess was determined that her
internal and external policies would focus on the strengthening of her state and the
creation of positive diplomacy in order to defeat the Prussian monarch. Maria Theresa was
determined not to surrender to her enemies, but to reconquer all of her lands. She began by
initiating reforms. Maria Theresa strengthened the army by doubling the number of troops
from her father's reign, reorganized the tax structure to insure a predictable annual
income to support the costs of the government and army, and centralized an office to
assist in the collection of the taxes. Economic reform fueled prosperity for her empire.&nbsp;
The war ended with the loss of Silesia, but her state intact, and her husband
recognized as Holy Roman Emperor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1756, Maria Theresa felt that Austria was strong enough to renew her conflict with
Frederick II.
With the direction of her state chancellor, Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz, the empress
reorganized Austria's foreign policy in the so-called Diplomatic
Revolution.&quot; On the advice of Kaunitz, Maria Theresa abandoned
its accord with Great Britain and secured an alliance with France and Russia.&nbsp;
Yet, Frederick II surprised everyone when he attacked first,
invading one of Austria's allies, Saxony. This conflict began what is known as the Seven
Years'
War (which combined with the French &amp; Indian war in the American Colonies). In
1763, after much bloodshed, Maria Theresa signed the Treaty of Hubertusberg, ending all
hostilities and recognizing Prussian possession of Silesia once and for all.</p>

<p>Two years later, Maria Theresa suffered a great personal loss, the unexpected death of her
husband, Francis Stephen of Lorraine. Her love for him was so deep that from the day of
his death until her own death in 1780, she dressed in mourning. After Francis
Stephen's
death, Maria Theresa became increasingly withdrawn. She continued reforms, but they came
at a slower and more systematic pace. She changed her foreign policy from vigorously
trying to regain Silesia to maintaining peace. After fifteen years of war and frustration,
Maria Theresa was reluctant to get involved in conflicts that might prove unsuccessful.
After the death of Francis Stephen, Maria Theresa recognized the eldest of her sixteen children, Joseph
II,
as emperor and coregent. Joseph II's&nbsp; many fundamental differences in
beliefs with his mother, caused anxiety and
arguments. Periodically, Maria Theresa considered
abdication of the throne. However, she never did abdicate. Instead, she allowed Joseph II
only limited powers, since she felt his judgment too rash.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was courageous, generous and kind. She respected the rights of others and
expected others to respect her rights. In the later part of her rule, the empress focused
more on human concerns, and less on financial and administrative improvements. She became
increasingly involved with the problem of serf reform. Throughout the empire, the peasants
were obligated to pay monetary and work dues to their lords. In 1771, Maria Theresa issued
the Robot Patent, the serf reform designed to regulate the peasants' labor payments in all
of the Habsburg lands.</p>

<p>The empress had a long reign which spanned forty years. She died on November 29, 1780.
Some historians have termed Maria Theresa as the savior of the Habsburg Dynasty. Her
efforts to transform her empire into a modern state solidified the Habsburg rule. Although
when she came to the throne, her state appeared on the brink of dismemberment, Maria
Theresa provided a strong foundation for the continuation of the Habsburg Dynasty into
the modern era.</p>

</b>A detailed account of the statesmanship of Maria Theresa from the War of the Austrian
Succession to the Seven Years War. This can be of assistance when looking for details
about the life of Maria Theresa, and how war influenced her to begin the now
common practice of drafting of soldiers.</p>

<p><b>Colton, Joel and R.R. Palmer. <i>A History of the Modern World</i>. 3rd ed. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf, 1965.</b><br>
This book is a reference for the Austrian War of Succession and the Pragmatic Sanction.
This shows how Maria Theresa got her start on the throne. From the detail in this
book, it is possible to see how she was accepted as an Empress, since she
actually gave much of the credit for the ruling of the country to her husband.</p>

<p><b>Crankshaw, Edward. <i>Maria Theresa</i>. New York: The Viking Press, 1969.</b><br>
The author used many sources from the Vienna archives to give an heroic picture of the
only woman to rule the Habsburg lands. This book gives much detail regarding the fact that
she was the only women up to this time to control the Habsburg dynasty. A clearer picture
is given of how she did it.</p>

1963.</b><br>
This book gives an account of the final century of the Habsburg Dynasty, the longest
running dynasty in Europe. This talks of the fall of the Habsburgs, but it also returns to
its origins and describes how they gained power, and how they maintained power through
their powerful rulers, such as Maria Theresa.</p>

Theresa. Maria had always talked of the love she had for her husband, and how she had made

efforts of Maria Theresa.</p>

A. Knopf, 1937.</b><br>

Row, 1966.</b><br>

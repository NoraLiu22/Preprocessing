Their interest was such that even single   commercial products were studied at length by the best scientists.   J. Wiederhold published between 1862 and 1863 a number of papers   in which he analyzed the properties of a commercial product coming   from the United States, which had been launched on the market as a   substitute for turpentine. Thus, it is obvious that Meucci moved   on the crest of the wave, as it were, in a very promising   direction...</I></FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>However, to fully   comprehend their importance, one must bear in mind what E. Kopp,   one of the most famous European experts, wrote in 1862: "It must   not be forgotten that the exploitation, processing and transport   of mineral oils is still carried out in a rather primitive way. It   is an industry which is now taking its first steps, and which in   effect is only two or three years old."</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>Thus Meucci was a pioneer   also in this field.</I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Faculty of Sciences MFN, University ofTurin </B></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/cerruti.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=34 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Prof. Dr. Luigi Cerruti<BR>Associate Professor of History of Chemistry<BR></B></FONT></P></CENTER><H2><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><HR><BR></FONT></CENTER></H2><H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME=paper></A>MEUCCI'S PATENTS ON PAPERPULP MAKING, ASSESSED BY AN EXPERT TODAY</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>by Dr. Clemente Nicolucci (Favini PaperManufacturing Co., Rossano Veneto,Vicenza)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial"><B><BR></B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>With his three   patents (1864, 1865, and 1866) Antonio Meucci is to be considered   one of the innovators in paper making.

This was particularly true in the United   States, which were gaining, in those years, the rank of first food   producers in the world. </I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>For this reason, Dr. H.   W. Wiley of Chicago began a scientific investigation on food   adulteration, which was to last over 20 years, and ended up   uncovering a scandal, given the vastness of the adulteration   phenomenon detected. His research strongly represented, for the   first time, the necessity of a legislation to fight food   adulteration, based on official standards and methods of food   testing (see the "Pure Food and Drug Act" of 1906).</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>Antonio Meucci's   invention came into this picture well in advance of time, since,   in 1875, it was aimed to determine the degree of genuineness or,   more precisely, any milk adulteration arising from dilution of   milk with water. Before Meucci, lacto-densimeters were used (e.g.   Quevenne) . . . . which were far from solving the problem, given   the difficulty -- then deemed insurmountable -- to separate and   exactly evaluate by simple and practical methods the most variable   part of the milk, i.e. the fat.</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>Meucci's lactometer   bears, in this framework, a notable importance, not much for the   precision of measurement (somewhat impaired by the use of strong   reagents, liable to partly solubilize the milk-solids) but because   it was a forerunner of the following, more sophisticated, methods   of determining the fat contents of milk. We don't know how much   Meucci's method was employed in the United States, but we must   recall that his method was quoted by the founder of our Institute,   Carlo Besana, in a note of 1886, dealing with the methods of milk   testing</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>.</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>Several years after   Meucci's patent, Prof. Stephen Moulton Babcock of the Wisconsin   University devised a simple and quick method for the precise   dosage of fat in milk, that became a standard starting from 1890.   . . .

The most popular material was degreased   hair (Saussure, 1782), substituted today by modern organic and   synthetic fibers. With the progress of technology, however, they   have lost importance as sensitive hygroscopic elements, mainly   because of their unsatisfactory reproducibility and also for want   of knowledge of their mode of operation.</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>At Meucci's times,   hygroscopic materials were used in form of strips of suitable   length. Evaporation of humid air would cause variation in length,   depending on the humidity content of the air, which is as larger   as longer the strip. The strip was maintained in tension with one   end fixed and the other elastically connected to the periphery of   a pulley. The elongation or the shortening of the strip caused the   indication of the value of the humidity on a graduated face by   means of a pointer solidly connected with the   pulley.</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>The hygrometer conceived   by Antonio Meucci has the advantage of constituting an instrument   of least encumbrance, because he substituted the strip with a   spiral coil, free to wind or unwind according to the variation in   the humidity of the air. The hygroscopic material was obtained   from a whalebone in form of a strip with rectangular   cross-section. The strip was wound upon a pivot pin, that allowed   the spiral motion of the strip without friction. The upper surface   of the helix was varnished with a waterproof substance, whereas   the lower surface was left hygroscopic, thus increasing the   resulting elongation by tension of the spring. The strip coil is   fixed at one end, the other end bearing a pointer, whose rotation   gave the indication of the value of the humidity, as a function of   the spiral displacement of the helix.<BR>   </I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B>Polytechnic ofTurin</B></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B><IMG SRC="immagini/ferro.gif" WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B>(Prof. Vincenzo Ferro, Chairof Applied Physics)</B></FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B>Note: </B><I>ProfessorFerro's original comment included an extended treatise on the Historyof Hygrometry, with particular reference to Meucci's times, notreported here for brevity.</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B><HR></B></FONT></P><H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME=plastic></A>OPINION OF AN EXPERT ONMEUCCI'S PATENT "PLASTIC PASTE"</FONT></H2><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>by Dr. Gianfranco Ferrari, Director ofResearch &amp; Development, Istituto Donegani-Enichem,Novara</B></FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>   </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>This patent describes   an original method for the preparation of a "plastic paste,"   suitable to be hot-poured into molds of various shapes and sizes   in order to manufacture billiard-balls, statuary, vases, and   objects of various kinds.</I></FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>This patent can be seen   today as an example of ingenious manipulation of the reagents   forming the typical "chemical armamentarium" of the epoch, such as   resins and natural solvents, starches, mineral and vegetable   acids, cooked oil, as well as "fillers" (to confer consistency to   the final product), composed of vegetable fibers or ground horn,   ivory, bone, or mineral oxides or salts.</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>From the choice of   constituents, but, above all, from their manipulation, it is   evident that the result, though reflecting the empiricism of the   epoch, is not reached by hazard, but through a non marginal   knowledge of chemical processes as well as a valuable work of   research and development. </I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>A meaningful example, in   this respect, is the preprocessing of vegetable fillers   (illustrated in Meucci's previous patent of 1865), that the author   employed towards obtaining a better adhesiveness.

15 fastballs off the bullpen mound at Yankee Stadium on Saturday morning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNormally a routine of that intensity —\u0026nbsp;can we even call it a workload?

Cole declined to give a timeline for that. When pressed on where he is, with zero being unable to lift his arm and 10 being ready to start an actual game, Cole, after a long delay, calculated that he is “under five somewhere.” So not even halfway back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You certainly know what Gerrit brings to the table hopefully at some point this summer,” Yankees\u0026nbsp;manager Aaron Boone said of allowing himself to start contemplating the return. “But right now it’s about Gerrit doing what he needs to do to get back and get right and get healthy.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCole, who has been throwing off flat surfaces since late last month, said the baseball felt good coming out of his\u0026nbsp;hand and added that there was no discomfort.

Onward and upward.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing Cole was definitive about is how much he has missed pitching and how much even Saturday’s snippet of a workout meant to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I enjoyed today,” he said. “This is the most taste I have had of it in a while.

Then they managed only two hits in 24 at-bats in the first eight innings against the Tigers, dropping that batting average to .162 (24-for-148), before producing four straight hits with none out in the ninth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got time,” Giancarlo Stanton said of the dugout feeling going into the ninth. “If we’ve got outs left, we’ve got time.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron Judge, 1-for-13 in Baltimore, led off with a sharp single against Manhasset’s Jason Foley and Alex Verdugo bunted down the third-base line for a single, a “very high IQ play,” Stroman said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanton lasered an RBI double into the rightfield corner to tie the score and, with the infield in, Rizzo scorched a grounder past second baseman Andy Ibanez’s diving backhand attempt for the much-needed game-winner. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think Judgie getting on set the tone there,” Rizzo said. “He’s always so big for us.

Taylor is on his seventh team in 13 years, so he’s played with different offenses and against all types of defenses. Between the two of them, they have played in 323 NFL games and more than 14,000 snaps.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTravis plans to be a sponge around them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I observe a lot,” he said. “I watch every little thing that they do. I’m going to ask a lot of questions for sure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You have two great quarterbacks ahead of you. I’ve been looking up to them for a long time and watching them for a long time. So I have an opportunity to pick their brains every single day, see how they treat their teammates, see how they carry themselves off and on field. I’m looking forward to it for sure.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s possible that Travis would be competing for a starting job or at least a backup position on another team had the injury not happened. Instead of being bitter, Travis is focused on getting better.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a dream come true at the end of the day,” Travis said. “It’s an opportunity for me to get better. That’s how I look at every single thing that God has a plan for me. Every day I wake up, I just want to be the best person I could be, the best teammate I could be. I just want to be the best I can be in everything I do.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003eThere’s Mr. Irrelevant\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSafety Jaylen Key, who the Jets took with the last pick in the draft, is having a good time with being known as “Mr. Irrelevant.” Key said, “Everybody’s [saying], ‘Hey, Mr. Irrelevant’ while you’re walking around the facility.” In late June, Key will go to California for Irrelevant Week, an annual NFL celebration that includes a parade in Disneyland.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It’s definitely kind of cool for you to be recognized for a week,” Key said. “Go to Disney, play some golf, get on the beach, things of that nature.

Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who has filled in for Pesce, got banged up in the Hurricanes’ series against the Islanders, but Brind’Amour said he is good to go.

The Rangers have home ice advantage in this series, and so they’ll get the last line change in four of the seven\u0026nbsp;games if the series goes that long. Rangers coach Peter Laviolette likes to use a checking line at times, too, but he’s got four defensively capable centers in Zibanejad, Trocheck, Alex Wennberg and Barclay Goodrow, so he can more easily match any of his lines against any of Brind’Amour’s lines.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNet positive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith Igor Shesterkin as their goaltender, the Rangers are usually going to have the advantage in net against almost any opponent they face, but Frederik Andersen was fabulous down the stretch for Carolina as they chased the Rangers in the battle for the Metropolitan Division title.

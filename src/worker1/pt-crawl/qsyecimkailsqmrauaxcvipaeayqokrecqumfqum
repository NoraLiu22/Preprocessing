To get there, order and timing are key. First, you'll want to make your hollandaise. While intimidating in theory, the process is a lot like making mayonnaise. If the emulsion is stable, it won't break, even when held at room temperature. Next, poach your eggs, and toast the English muffins while you crisp up the Canadian bacon. From there, it's as simple as stacking your ingredients and sprinkling them with herbs, salt and pepper. Once you’ve mastered this basic version, you can explore its variations: Add sliced avocado, or even swap in some smoked salmon (eggs Hemingway) or wilted greens for the Canadian bacon (eggs Florentine).</p></div></div><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k topnote_showMore__e4U16" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Read More</span></button></div></div><ul class="recipeintro_tools-block__c81nP"><li><div class="popover_popover-container__huJIK"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_primary__Hsbni saveorganize_unsavedButton__jYqLm" type="button"><svg width="20" height="20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14.706 4.294H6.294v10.587l4.206-2.669 4.206 2.67V4.293ZM5 3h11v14.235l-5.5-3.49-5.5 3.49V3Z" fill="#fff"></path></svg><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Save</span></button><div style="opacity:0" class="popover_popover__Yn69l popover_position-bottom___YMPK popover_popover--logged-out-message__yMhe_"><div class="popover_popover-body__aWR9h popover_popover-body--message__fjyF9"><div><p class="pantry--ui"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k popover_popover--logged-out-action__FUUmm" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Log in</span></button> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k popover_popover--logged-out-action__FUUmm" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">sign up</span></button> <!-- -->to save this recipe.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_default__wXRq7 giftrecipe_nonSubGiftButton__3Jw3S" type="button"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 25 20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18.29 5.42h-2.32a3.18 3.18 0 0 0 .05-3.37A3.1 3.1 0 0 0 13.96.68a3.52 3.52 0 0 0-2.5.48 3.86 3.86 0 0 0-1.55 2.37 3.79 3.79 0 0 0-1.55-2.37A3.49 3.49 0 0 0 5.87.68a3.08 3.08 0 0 0-2.06 1.37 3.16 3.16 0 0 0 0 3.37H1.54a1 1 0 0 0-.94.95v3.64a1 1 0 0 0 .94.95h.23v7.24a1.16 1.16 0 0 0 1.15 1.15h14a1.15 1.15 0 0 0 1.14-1.15v-7.24h.23a1 1 0 0 0 1-.95V6.37a1 1 0 0 0-1-.95Zm-1.73 5.59v6.84h-5.9v-6.84h5.9Zm-5.44-5.82.17-1.13a2.47 2.47 0 0 1 1-1.65 2 2 0 0 1 1.41-.28 1.65 1.65 0 0 1 1.08.72 1.78 1.78 0 0 1-.53 2.31l-3.13.03Zm6.61 1.73v2.54h-7.07V6.92h7.07Zm-8.57 4.09v6.84H3.29v-6.84h5.87ZM5.08 2.85a1.6 1.6 0 0 1 1.07-.72 2 2 0 0 1 1.41.28A2.37 2.37 0 0 1 8.49 4l.21 1.19H5.61a1.77 1.77 0 0 1-.53-2.34Zm4.08 4.07v2.54H2.1V6.92h7.06Z" fill="#231F20"></path></svg><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Give</span></button><dialog class="buttondialog_dialog__jwPUh buttondialog_popoverMasquerade__0oHjb" id="gift-recipe-button"><div><div class="giftrecipe_headlineMessage__fYaIo">Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone</div><div class="giftrecipe_panelMessage__hzCls"><div>As a subscriber, you have<!-- --> <strong>10<!-- --> gift recipes</strong> to give each month.

Cut refrigerated butter into 8 pieces  Put four of the pieces into a small sauce pan with the eggs, lemon juice, etc. Put the heat on low and beat everything together with a whisk. Keep beating and as soon as the butter is almost all melted add another piece and keep doing so. This will maintain the temperature and that is all there is to it.

I melt the butter in the microwave rather than in a double boiler.  For the eggs, I crack them in a pan with some butter, then immediately add half a glass of water and then cover the pan to let them steam.  That produces an egg with a firm white and still a liquid yolk.  We don't have English muffins here in Latvia, where I live, so instead it was buttered toast.

also iffy.  Silicone egg-poaching pouches are reportedly more chemically-stable.  They work very well; put a bit of butter in each poacher, put them in the pan of boiling water (lid on) until the butter melts, take them back out, break an egg in each, and return to the pan of boiling water (lid on) until the eggs are done.

- Hollandaise was complicated and came out tasting terrible. Way too spicy; the cayenne amount shown is way too much

- the method shown for poaching eggs simply does not work. You can't make four eggs in one pot, and trying to use a pot big enough causes the eggs to all fly apart wasting most of the white. Eggs came out ugly and gross looking and the water was coated in film

"runny yolk."

Poaching is a method. As with boiling or frying an egg, you can choose a less or more well-cooked result to suit your preference.

Personally I like to poach my eggs until the yolks are "jammy" -- just barely set enough not to spurt all over the plate upon my first forkful. It is, as other commenters have noted, a tricky matter of timing. But so is a soft-boiled egg.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Fred</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">11 months ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">Much easier: First, ditch the Canadian bacon. Nothing is less interesting or has less flavor. In its place use country or smoked ham.  For the hollandaise, put everything but the sizzling hot butter in a narrow container.

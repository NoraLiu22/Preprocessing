Only children are unique in birth order in that they are the first- andlast-born children in their families. Various theories of prominent psychologists such asAdler, Freud, Skinner, and Eysenck will be examined in their application to theimportance of birth order in personality development.  A theory concerning only childrenwill then be presented, dealing chiefly with their difficulty with the labels ofintroversion and extraversion.  Personal observations as well as a proposal for testingthe theory will be given.</blockquote></blockquote><p><hr><p><blockquote>        Procreation has been an essential task for all human beings in order to continue theexistence of the species.  Before the advent of modern medicine and birth control, commonsense would dictate that females would give birth to a large number of children, helpingto ensure that at least one would survive to adulthood and thus create children of his orher own.  However, as time has passed, humans have become able to control the number ofchildren they have.  Many choose to have more than one child, some choose to have none atall.  Still others choose to have only one.  Whatever the decision, the number and orderof birth of human offspring seems to have at least a small effect on their personalitydevelopment.  Only children are special cases and must be looked at in a slightlydifferent manner.<p><h2><center>Birth Order and Its Repercussions</center></h2><h3>Adler and Birth Order</h3>        Adler (Weiten, 1998), best known for his theories regarding striving for superiority,was also concerned with the effects of birth order on personality.  Adler had asuccessful older brother, but Adler was weak as a child and thus was most likely affectedwith the desire to assert himself and prove his worth.<p>        Adler's theory stressed the social aspect of personality development and thereforeproposed the possibility of birth order and its significance in the interpersonalrelationships of family life.  He felt that each position in the order, whether first orlast, had distinct characteristics.  For example, he hypothesized that firstborns areproblem children and that only children are likely to be spoiled due to parentaloverindulgence (Weiten, 1998, pp. 483-484).<p><h3>Characteristics of Positions in Birth Order</h3>        Studies have shown that environment is not the sole personality determinant. However, environment is not trivial and should be considered, especially because studiesregarding birth order have been shown to have some consistency.  Firstborns have beenshown to be more conscientious, ambitious, academically oriented, conforming,conservative, inclined toward leadership, and respectful of their parents than theirlater-born siblings.  Conversely, children born later in the birth order tend to be moreunconventional, flexible, and rebellious  (Sulloway, 1997, p. 5).  Only children, beingfirstborn themselves, tend to exhibit traits more similar to those of other firstbornchildren.  However, only children seem to have better self-esteem and are higherachievers than children who have siblings (Brophy, 1989, p. 54).<p>        Children who have siblings must also contend with something that does not affect onlychildren, namely sibling rivalry.  Children who have siblings must compete for parentalattention and familial resources.  Only children do not have to deal with this kind ofcompetition.  Not having siblings allows for greater variance of personality types amongonly children; however, lack of siblings has repercussions for the only child's latersocial interactions (Koontz, 1989, p. 38).<p><h3>Stereotypes of Only Children</h3>        The only child is automatically stigmatized.  When asked to describe personalitycharacteristics of an only child, many people will respond negatively, indicating thepresupposition that only children are spoiled brats.  In China, couples are encouraged tohave only one child in order to help curb population growth.  These children, or "littleemperors," as they have been called, are generally seen as spoiled monsters.  However,research conducted by Falbo (Brophy, 1989), a psychologist known for work in the area ofbirth order, indicates otherwise.  Falbo found that Chinese only children fared no worsein personality or achievement than their counterparts with siblings. However, onlychildren are also often seen as high-achieving, motivated, and successful  (Brophy, 1989,p.56).<p><h3>Social Interaction</h3>        Because only children lack siblings, they lose the immediate availability of othersnear their own age with whom to interact socially.  In order to develop normal socialskills, only children must be exposed to other children of the same age through othermeans.  For example, play groups can be valuable for the learning of social skills. However, only children must work to win friends because family life does not providethem.<p><h2><center>Introversion/Extraversion and the Only Child</center></h2>        According to Skinner's behaviorist theory of operant conditioning, only childrenwould undergo conditioning to affect their behavior in social situations.  Operantconditioning involves the conditioning of behavior according to the consequences itproduces (Mischel, 1993, p. 307).  In this way, only children would be conditioned tobehave in an outgoing manner, if they are to win friends, because they have no guaranteedfamilial playmates.  Said the pediatrician M. Kappelman, "Only children don't easilyassimilate into large groups, and when they do they tend to dominate" (Brophy, 1989, p.55).  This conditioning would take place regardless of a child's natural inclinationstoward extraversion or introversion if the child wishes to make friends.<p>        Jung was the first psychologist to describe the inner- and outer-directed types ofpersonality.  Inner-directed persons, or introverts, tend to be concerned with theinternal world of their thoughts and feelings.  Outer-directed persons, or extraverts,tend to be interested in the external world of things and people (Weiten, 1998, p. 483). Because only children have a greater variation of personality types, logic would dictatethat introversion and extraversion are equally likely traits in only children.<p>        The psychologist Eysenck (Weiten, 1998), while largely endorsing the role of geneticsin determining personality, was also a pioneer in the ideas of extraversion andintroversion.  He suggested that introverts tend to have higher levels of arousal thanextroverts.  Therefore, introverts are more easily conditioned than extraverts and,because social situations cause arousal, the heightening of arousal will make introvertsuneasy and wont to avoid social interaction.  Hence they become introverted (Weiten,1998, pp. 495-496).<p><h2><center>The Dilemma of the Only Child</center></h2>        Because only children do not have siblings with whom to interact, they learn to bechildren on their own.  Parents and play groups can help, but ultimately children becomeconditioned to depend on themselves.  Says one adult only child, "Possibly the best partwas developing the ability to enjoy being alone and to entertain myself.  I've always hadplenty of friends, yet people are surprised by how much of a loner I can be" (Koontz,1989, p. 39).  Although this self-sufficiency can have its benefits, it can also meanthat only children are inherently alone as their personalities develop.<p>        Because only children must develop in social situations that may not be suited totheir personalities, the concepts of introversion and extraversion must be re-evaluatedin the consideration of only children.  Ultimately, an only child's environment forceshim or her to take on both characteristics of introversion and extraversion despitenatural inclinations to be one or the other.  A naturally introverted child must showextraverted qualities if he or she wishes to make friends; likewise, a naturallyextraverted child must learn to show introverted qualities by being content to focus onhis or her own thoughts when playmates are unavailable.<p>        Of course, very few humans are strictly extraverted or introverted; most fallsomewhere in between the two.  The term "ambivert" has been coined to describe thosepersons who show both characteristics.  However, the term "ambivert" is notaccurate in describing only children.   To call an only child introverted, extraverted,or ambiverted would be to imply that the child developed into its natural tendency towardthat certain personality type with little influence from its environment.   Thus onlychildren are caught in a dilemma.  Although environmental influence is not the soleinfluence in personality development, only children must develop their personalities inunique environmental situations.  Their environments force them to act against theirnatural tendencies in order to function normally.  These "only-verts" then must always attimes be acting in ways against their natural tendencies.  Perhaps this struggle helpsexplain some of the common characteristics that emerge among only children, such as thetendency to not participate in many activities but leading the ones in which they doparticipate or learning to be comfortable being "loners" by learning to retreat withinthemselves. Perhaps because the emotional difficulties that only children are prone tohave such as excessive sensitivity, hypochondria, or trouble expressing anger (Brophy,1989, p. 55) are results of environmental influence but not in the way most commonlyassumed.  Rather than solely the effects of sibling-free socialization, these emotionaldifficulties could be attributed to an almost Freudian struggle between opposing forces:the natural tendency toward extraversion or introversion versus the environmentalpressures to subdue those tendencies in order to function.<p>        Of course, Freud's theory, although testable, cannot be proven or disprovenscientifically (Gr&uuml;nbaum, 1986, p. 221) and any situation analogous to Freudiantheory would be difficult to test as well.  However, a questionnaire could be designedmuch like one to measure extraversion and introversion with modifications to take intoaccount the special case of only children to try to get some sense of how only childrenfeel about themselves and their interaction with the world around them.  For example, astudy could be used to determine how adults feel their upbringing as only childrenaffected them.<p>         Ever since Adler brought forth the idea of birth order's effect on personality (andpossibly before), the only child has been seen as having distinct personality traits. Although environment has not been shown to be the only influence in personalitydevelopment, only children develop in a unique social setting.  Therefore, perhaps theirenvironments exert enough influence in their development to accentuate personality traitsand force a struggle against natural tendencies.<p></blockquote><p><hr><p><blockquote><a name=jones><i>Peer Commentary</i><p><h2><center>A Monkey Wrench in the Study of Birth Order</center></h2><center><b><a href="mailto:n-jones@northwestern.edu">Nathan Jones</a></b></center><center><b><a href=http://www.northwestern.edu/>Northwestern University</a></b></center><p>        As Eischens points out, the only child is a unique breed.  Acting as the first- andlast-born in a family, the only child takes on a multitude of roles and responsibilitiesunlike those of any other sibling.  The only child breaks down the positions in birthorder. The author of the article lays down these differences in a concise manner, takingtime to give a strong base to her argument.  She then elaborates on the real issue thatseparates only children from others, introversion versus extroversion.<p>        Although nobody exists as purely introverted or extroverted, the only child cannotshow a strong tendency towards one or the other.  Instead, both introversion andextroversion become important as the only child is forced to take on both personalitytypes depending on the given situation.  Because of the lack of familial bonds, one hasto learn to depend upon oneself for thoughts and entertainment.  In this isolatedenvironment, the only child takes on the characteristics of an introvert.  The lack offamilial bonds also becomes important when the child looks for entertainment outside ofher- or himself.  In social settings, the only child is much more desperate for thefriendships of others his or her own age than the child with siblings.  In order to makethese necessary friendships, the only child must take on the qualities of an extrovert. The result is that the only child is a hybrid of the two personality types.  The authordoes not have empirical evidence of this theory, yet she offers possible tests that wouldgive proof.  She does not state her ideas as concrete, but instead offers them assuggestions to understand the differences between the only child and all others.<p>           The shortcomings of the article come in the lack of evidence for the points made bythe author.  She makes questionable statements as truth and then builds her argumentprogressively from these.  Early in the paper, she states that, "Not having siblingsallows for greater variance of personality types among only children."  Although this maybe true, inadequate evidence is given and the author uses this statement as a base forthe rest of the paper.  Although it is true that only children have no siblingcomparisons for personality development, there are several factors that extend past thisdifference.  It could be argued that a variety of things could outweigh this difference,including genetic aspects and other environmental variables.  These things might make thedilemma of the only child minimal.<p>          Also, perhaps sibling rivalry creates personality differences that the only childdoes not experience.  It is true that brothers or sisters will help define personality,but siblings will also be a source of differences.  Differences will appear in childrenbecause of their desire to define themselves within the family.  This goes along with thedefinition of the word rivalry itself.  Instead of emulating other siblings, children maybreak away in order to win parents' favor.  Perhaps only children, instead of emulatingsiblings, will turn to the other familial constant, and their personality types will beguided more by their parents.  It is difficult to take the personality definitions ofbirth order as truth, and adding the only child as a source of variation is difficult toprove.<p>        Using the variation within the only child, Eischeus goes on to say that, "logic woulddictate that introversion and extroversion are equally likely traits in only children." But would not logic also dictate that introversion and extroversion are also both highlylikely in all children?  All children have to extend outside of their natural tendencies. Home does not provide a complete social outlet, and therefore children are alwaysdesperate in social situations. Natural introverts need to interact to buildrelationships.  Likewise, natural extroverts must learn how to function on their own aswell.  These are things present in all children, not merely in only children.  The onlychild is just a more extreme example of the hybrid nature of personality.  The naturaltendencies of introversion and extroversion do not disappear in only children, they justbecome more hazy.  Only children establish more of a balance between the two, but cannever be rid of the natural tendencies that appear in all children.<p>        Finally, the author does not take the necessary steps to prove that only children donot fit into their stereotypes.  Her only evidence comes from a study of Chinesefamilies.  Although the study is most likely true, one must question whether the studycan be applied to our own culture.  Cultural differences could present enormous problemsfor these findings.  The study is from a world that functions differently on most everylevel, including the family.  There are indeed constants in family life the world over,but there are also differences put into place by culture that cannot be ignored.  The"high-achieving, motivated, and successful" only children of the study are part of aChinese community that puts different stress on success and education than our own.  Itis quite possible that the research is generalizable to all nations, but without anotherexample of such findings, one cannot help being hesitant with the author's proof.<p>        Overall, the author brings to light some very interesting ideas that separate theonly child from other children.  We are given not only an overview of the importance ofbirth order, but also a look at a unique role that has qualities greatly different fromothers.  Their social setting leaves definite traces in the personality of only childrenthat prevent them from falling under the characteristics of birth order that have beenpreviously studied.  Eischens may leave out empirical evidence to back up her claims, butthe claims seem to make sense and it is easy to follow her logic.  Based on what shestates, the only child brings confusion to the usual stdy of birth order.  Her essayfinds its success not in proving points, but instead in its ability to make us questionand re-evaluate our understanding and study of birth order.<p></blockquote><p><hr><p><blockquote><a name=rawal><i>Peer Commentary</i><p><h2><center>Only Children Develop Unique Socialization Trends; However, EmpiricalEvidence Is Needed</center></h2><center><b><a href="mailto:phr287@hecky.acns.northwestern.edu">Purva H. Rawal</a></b></center><center><b><a href=http://www.northwestern.edu/>Northwestern University</a></b></center><p>        "The Dilemma of the Only Child," by Eischens, describes the socialization pressuresand effects on only born children. Although the author raises interesting theories, muchof the evidence cited lacks an empirical basis. Eischens presents intriguing theories onthe introversion and extroversion dichotomy forced onto only children by the inherentfact that, although they have no siblings, they must learn to interact and formmeaningful peer relations.<p>        Adler's work is presented in a speculative light, as the author develops her owninterpretation for Adler's research and obvious interest in birth order. She establisheswell that Adler established that one's birth order is accompanied by distinctcharacteristics. However, no empirical evidence is cited for his work and following thespeculative discussion on his interest in the field, the reader becomes unsure as towhether the discussion on Adler's theory was not also prone to speculation.<p>        The author succinctly and clearly describes the well-established findings of birthorder characteristics. The inclusion of descriptions of first-born children and laterborn children act as a baseline for comparison to only born children through theremainder of the paper. Most people can think back to a time when they were affected bysuch familial phenomena as sibling rivalry. The effects of such social mechanisms oftenhave important ramifications, both positive and negative, for child development and latersibling relations. Eischens mention the concept of sibling rivalry, but fails toelaborate on a topic that is relevant to many. Sibling rivalry may act as a socializingagent in the sense that it teaches children how to constructively cope with conflict. Thecomparison of the effects of sibling rivalry to the effects of its absence in onlychildren provides insight into the unique development of only children.<p>        One of the paper's greatest strengths is the inclusion of cross-cultural myths andfindings on only children. The relevance and importance of cross-cultural work has oftenbeen ignored in psychological research; however, an increasing modern trend towardglobalization and cultural understanding has fostered an increasing interest incross-cultural work throughout the twentieth century. Psychology by its very definitionis the study of human culture and it is imperative to construct a culturally holisticpicture. Having the advantage of examining other cultures' outlooks on what we mayclassify as phenomena exclusive to our social realm encourages a more critical andcosmopolitan perception of psychological occurrences.<p>        One of the greatest argued losses to only children is their lack of socialinteraction within the family structure as a consequence of the absence of potentialsibling playmates. A study conducted by Mueller and Vandell (1995) found that childrenwith older siblings offering an outlet for interaction were more responsive socially toother children their own age. This interaction propels them into social situations inwhich they actively seek out playmates in settings away from home. The foundation fordeveloping healthy peer relations is laid in the home at an early age. This foundation issolidified via the exposure to siblings as they communally partake in activitiesincluding social-role playing and scripts. Children are socialized as to acceptablesocial roles, and actions within those social roles, largely through interaction withtheir siblings. The author perhaps could have elaborated on this point as it is of utmostimportance to the social development of the only child.<p>        The Jungian theory and Eysenck's elaboration on the introversion and extroversiontendencies provide a firm basis for the presentation of the theory that the only child'sunique familial environment forces the child to incorporate qualities of both introvertsand extroverts into the child's personality. Only children must learn when each trait isappropriate so that they are able to establish healthy peer relations, while alsolearning to develop on their own in a lonely environment.  However, Skinner's theory onoperant conditioning, although well laid out, is not tied into the argument of theinclusion of both introvert and extrovert tendencies in only children. Likewise, the fewsentences outlining a Freudian interpretation of only child characteristics do notbolster the credibility of the author's argument. Freud's theories lack a scientificfoundation and are largely speculative in nature. Nevertheless, the author captures thereader's attention with her theory on the unique personality development of onlychildren.<p>        The paper presents a unique argument for the incorporation of both introvert andextrovert tendencies into the personalities of only children. However, the author isunable to adequately provide support for the theory supplementary to Jung's and Eysenck'scontribution. Some of the psychologists cited, such as Freud and Adler, do not add to theauthor's arguments. Overall, Eischens provides readers with an interesting outlook on theunique personality development and environmental forces involving only children.<p></blockquote><p><hr><p><blockquote><a name=trzop><i>Peer Commentary</i><p><h2><center>The Real Dilemma Lies in the Birth Order Theory</center></h2><center><b><a href="barb@round.table.com">Barbara M. Trzop</a></b></center><center><b><a href=http://www.northwestern.edu/>Northwestern University</a></b></center><p>        Birth order is an interesting, but scientifically weak, phenomenon that attempts toexplain how a child manifests the personality characteristics that he or she exhibits.Eischens's paper describes in nice detail the foundations and framework of the theory. However, the lack of empirical evidence does not lend support to a theory that, at best,makes generalized statements about correlative behaviors that may or may not really haveanything to do with the order in which children are born.<p>        Eischens's description of procreation seems to be a weak introduction to why birthorder is considered important to personality theorists, and to psychologists in general.Of course the goal of human beings is to successfully reproduce themselves, therebygiving rise to future generations. However, what does birth order have to do with this,and why would birth order influence personality, according to this evolutionary point ofview?<p>        In order to give this introduction the support it needs, Eischens needed to introducethe theories of sociobiology and, more specifically, evolutionary psychology. As Eischenspoints out, humans of past generations did not have the advantages of modern medicinethat we have today.  Infant mortality rates were high, given the vulnerable states ofnewborns, and the squalid conditions into which many were born. Having a child survivepast its first year of life took as much luck as it did resources. Therefore, it madesense that parents would lavish their attention and care on a child who "made it" pasthis or her critical period. First-borns are guaranteed the most resources, because theyare the "survivors." It is better to place one's bets on an older child who has alreadypassed the most critical period of his or her life than to waste them on the weaker,younger child who is not yet guaranteed to survive.  Therefore, the stereotypes of thesuccessful, confidant, domineering first-born, and the dependent, overcompensating,last-born could stem from this theory. It is a harsh, almost cruel way of looking atfamily structure, but it fits the "survival of the fittest" paradigm.<p>        Taking this viewpoint, it makes sense that only children emulate first-borns in theirpersonality structures. Parents who have only one child must make sure that this childsurvives, because there are no "backups" to take his or her place. Therefore, parentsspend all of their resources on the child, molding the child into an individual with themost chance for survival. In fact, the only child should have an even better chance forsuccess, because there are no other children to take resources away from him or her. Thechild grows up to be an independent, self-sufficient, successful individual, becausethese are the traits necessary for survival.<p>         However, can one take this viewpoint and say with complete certainty that all onlychildren grow up to be high-achievers? Of course not, because the outcome of anyindividual depends on the interaction of inherent traits and environment. Any child withhigh achievement motivation who grows up in a supportive family has the potential forsuccess, whether this child be the tenth-born or the only-born. Of course, a child withpersonality traits that predispose him or her to dependent behavior may come out anotherway.<p>         As Eischens points out, only children often have the stereotypes of being "spoiled brats." Eischens does a nice job of explaining the cultural significance ofthis, by citing examples of a similar phenomenon in Chinese cultures. However, not all"spoiled brats" grow up to be the high-achieving, successful individuals that Eischensmakes them out to be. Being "spoiled" often indicates lavish and overindulgent attentionby the parents, which sometimes indicates a lack of discipline or control on the parents'part.  This type of behavior, interacting with a child's tendency for low acheivementmotivation, may result in the opposite effect. The child may grow up expecting things tobe done for the child all of the time, and may learn to become dependent on others to doeverything for him or her. Living a life of luxury, without the normal, everydayconflicts that having siblings bring, may cause the child to have a distorted view of theworld. The transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency might be difficult for such achild, who may find himself or herself seeking others onto whom he or she could cling.<p>        I disagree with Eischens as she says that only children essentially learn to bechildren on their own. Children will behave like children. This is inherent. An onlychild does not need to be taught how to play. Also, it is not necessarily correct to saythat only children deal with a "unique" environment that forces them to go against theirnatural tendencies. The natural tendency of a child is to be a child! If the child isintroverted, the child will seek out other introverts as part of his or her peer group.The same is true for extroverts. It is no different than any other form of socialinteraction. Although I agree that sometimes only children may have to learn how to actagainst their nature (i.e., acting more extroverted in an aggressive play situation),this is not <i>always</i> necessary, as Eischens suggests. In fact, I would go so far asto say that siblings are more prone to act against their natural tendencies towardintroversion-extroversion, because they are often forced to play together and to agreewith each other. In order to get along, siblings must sometimes modify theirpersonalities, or else they will hear it from their parents! Only children have theluxury of choosing their playmates, and if they find none suitable, they are perfectlyhappy playing on their own.<p>          Most of these observations come from personal experience, because I myself am an onlychild. I will be the first to admit that self-report is not always reliable, nor is italways valid. However, I believe that this is the general problem with considering birthorder to be a causal factor in shaping personality. It is extremely difficult to come upwith a systematic way of doing this. Of course, one could take an inventory of the kindsof traits that children in a specific "birth order slot" possess, and see if there areany correlations. However, this does not seem to be any different than assessing the validityof astrological signs. Do not the signs of the Zodiac dictate traits as a function ofbirth order? Using this model, one could even argue that people treat one differentlyaccording to the month in which one is born. You and I would both agree that this is badscience, with little empirical foundation. I would have to say the same for birth order.Individuals are all different. The interaction of traits and states dictates personality development, and they do not combine in the same way for everyone. Therefore, it isdifficult to say that birth order makes a difference. Perhaps birth order makes a slightdifference, but I believe that there are more influential causal factors that determinepersonality in children.<p></blockquote><p><hr><p><blockquote><a name=eischens><i>Author Response</i><p><h2><center>Merely Scratching the Surface of the Birth Order Dilemma</center></h2><center><b><a href="mailto:a-eischens@northwestern.edu">Alissa D.

Imake no claims about the significance of birth order, but I do suggest that it can be afactor in a child's environment that could affect his or her personality.  I take theidea of birth order one step further and suggest that perhaps only children are affectedin a unique way by growing up in an environment lacking siblings.  My suggestion dealsspecifically with the tendencies toward introversion and extraversion and how onlychildren may have to fight against their natural tendencies.  I thank <b>Jones</b>,<b>Rawal</b>, and <b>Trzop</b> for their commentaries concerning my paper.<p>        <b>Jones</b> does well to recognize the ideas I wish to put forth in my paper.  Infact, he seems to be so clear as to my intention that I was somewhat taken aback by thecriticisms that followed his summary.  That said, I wish to address some of the criticismJones presents.<p>        <b>Jones</b>' main criticism lies in his finding fault with my lack of support for myarguments.  I agree that my examination of birth order theory is indeed cursory andwarrants further research and empirical evidence to be deemed credible.  However, asJones recognizes when he says, "Her essay finds its success not in proving points, butinstead in its ability to make us question and re-evaluate our understanding and study ofbirth order," he makes my point exactly.  I did not presume to build an airtight case formy argument about only children.  Rather, I intended to introduce the possibility thatbirth order can affect only children differently than children with siblings.  I offersome evidence as a means to begin building an argument; clearly, I need more support ifmy ideas are even to be tested, let alone be called a theory.<p>        <b>Jones</b> also makes an argument for the effect of birth order and sibling rivalryon children who have siblings.  I agree fully that children who do not have siblings arein a position different than that of only children; it is precisely this difference insituations that I wished to examine while focusing on the only child.  Finally, Jonessays that families do not provide total social support, and all children, regardless oftheir birth order, must strive to make friends.  I agree and did not mean to argueotherwise; however, I would argue that the presence of siblings at least gives children"practice" in socializing with others their age, whereas only children are immediately"put to the test."<p>        <b>Rawal</b> echoes this sentiment in her commentary.  She sites a study in whichsocialization with older siblings allowed for a sort of social practice that encouragedchildren to seek out playmates outside the family.  Like <b>Jones</b>, she too summarizesmy paper clearly.  Unlike Jones, she sees the inclusion of information concerning Chineseonly children as positively cross-cultural.  Jones felt that information to be tooselective.<p>        <b>Rawal</b> finds fault with my lack of empirical evidence and my inclusion ofAdler's and Freud's theories as support for my argument.  I will not repeat my reasonsfor lack of empirical evidence--I have stated them previously in my response.  However,in response to her criticism concerning the inclusion of Adler and Freud, I will comment. She will notice that Adler appears in the introduction of my paper.  As one of theearliest psychologists to be interested in birth order theory, I thought it amiss not toinclude his ideas.  As for Freud, I was merely using his ideas as an analogy to helpclarify the point I was trying to make concerning the inner and societal struggles withwhich only children must grapple.  I did not intend the inclusion of Freud to addcredibility to my argument.<p>        I take exception to the manner in which <b>Trzop</b> offers her criticism.  As I havealready stated, I intended to introduce the topic of only children and birth order, notsupport it wholeheartedly or begin to prove it.  Although Trzop makes valid criticism, Ido not believe making a mockery of my paper is the best way for her to bring her ideas tomy or the readers' attention.  She first criticizes my introduction.  I thank her for hersuggestion for the consideration of evolutionary psychology; her suggestion is valid, andshould I pursue this topic further it would definitely be taken into account.  However,the purpose of my introduction was not to illuminate the harsh realities of survival butrather to introduce the topic of birth so I could move on to point out that people areobviously born in a certain order within a family, and to suggest that perhaps that orderplays a role in personality development.  Trzop also says, "The natural tendency of achild is to be a child!" and I could not agree with her more.  But I would say thatalthough children developmentally go through similar stages, their "natural tendency"when personality is involved cannot be defined.  I would ask Trzop to further explainwhat exactly "being a child" entails.  She draws upon personal experience for herargument, and I could do the same if I chose, being something of an introvert myself. But as Trzop recognizes, personal experience is not the best way to prove a point, so Ishall refrain from sharing mine.  As for her likening birth order theory to being a "badscience" along the lines of astrology, I will not comment.  My horoscope told me thatavoiding conflict would be in my best interest today.<p></blockquote><p><hr><p><blockquote><h2><center>References</center></h2>        Brophy, B.

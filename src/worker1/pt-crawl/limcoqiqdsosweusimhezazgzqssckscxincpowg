<br/>

<p class="lq">There began to be a great talking about the Fine Arts. It was a tempting time
for ambitious ignorance. If the knowing had failed to instruct, why should
not others try their hand? There was little difficulty in setting about it. Every
quack was an example; — abuse all the old and the regular bred of the faculty. Do
as a celebrated one did; — rub a good itching disorder into the backs of people,
and tell them boldly that's the way to get health and a sound taste.... If
possible, be "a graduate," and be sure to repeat the title upon every occasion.  — "The Fine Arts and Public Taste in l853,"<span class="lqbook">Blackwood's</span>  74 (1853), 92.
</p>

<p class="one">The writer here is the Reverend John Eagles of <span class="book">Blackwood's</span>, and that
troublesome graduate, of course, is John Ruskin, the giant of Victorian
art criticism whose long shadow cast many such competitors into the
shade. Eagles's attack upon the author of<span class="nook"> Modern Painters</span> furnishes a
convenient point of departure for a brief exploratory voyage through
Victorian art criticism, reminding us, first of all, of its essentially polemical
nature and, second, of the central importance of both Ruskin and periodical reviewing.</p>

<p>Their importance derives from the increasing democratization of the
art public in Victorian England. As the conservative <span class="book">Blackwood's</span> pointed
out in 1862, "Patronage is now not solely in the sovereignty of the state
or in the power of the   <a href="../../../religion/denom1.html">church</a>, but in the hands of the people. Palaces and
churches in these days call for fewer pictures than the private dwellings of
merchants and manufacturers" ([J. B. Atkinson], "Pictures British and Foreign: International Exhibition," <span class="book">Blackwood's</span> 92 (1862): 360.) This movement of patronage
downward in the social scale had major effects upon the nature of the [125/126] 
painter's audience, his relation to it, and the kind of art he consequently
produced. Although the relation of the artist to patron did not change
either as rapidly or as decisively as did that of the English author to his
public, one can nonetheless note obvious parallels between the situation
in each art.</p>


<h3>Eighteenth-Century Changes in Literary Patronage</h3>

<p class="one"> Shortly after the middle of the eighteenth century  <a href="../../previctorian/johnson/sjov.html">Dr.
Johnson</a> had announced the decline of the literary patron, whom he had
defined for Lord Chesterfield as "one who looks with unconcern on a 
Man struggling for life in the Water and when he has reached ground
encumbers him with help." Although chapbooks and broadsides had"
existed to supply ephemeral reading matter for the lower and middle
classes for more than a century, serious literature generally required a
generous sponsor to defer the cost of publication. One of the most important changes in the relation of the writer to his public is thus signaled
when writers, like Dr. Johnson himself, publish works by subscription,
for this mode of printing and distribution divides the power of a single
wealthy, usually aristocratic patron among several hundred sponsors.</p>

<p>A far more drastic enlargement of the reading public occurs in the next
century: repeal of repressive taxation on periodicals allowed the rapid
growth of magazines and newspapers, while the growth of large lending
libraries, such as  <a href="../../../economics/mudie.html">Mudie</a>'s, effectively subsidized publication of novels and
other literature. Students of the Victorian age increasingly call it a second
English Renaissance — and with reason, for during these years the
movement down the social scale of financial and political power was
accompanied by a rapid expansion of the English reading public, which
by the second half of the century already included many members of the
working class; this greatly enlarged audience, in turn, called forth and
magnificently sustained the golden age of the English novel.</p>

<h3>The Decline of Church and Other Institutional Patronage for Artists</h3>

<p class="one">One may doubt to what extent the situation in Victorian art can resemble that in literature, because the nature of painting makes it so
difficult for a work to reach a large number of people. In particular, since
oil painting is a medium which produces a single work at a time, a work
in an edition of one, it cannot ever be quite as popular as a novel which
can be printed in an edition of thousands or even tens of thousands.
Nonetheless, despite these essential difficulties, similar changes in the
relation of artist to audience did take place. First of all, as <span class="book">Blackwood's</span>
emphasized, most Victorian commissions came not from church, state,
or aristocracy but from merchants and manufacturers. But to attract this
new, expanding group of potential buyers the artist had to make them [126] 
<A NAME="display">aware of his works</a>, and this he could only do by exhibiting them in
public. Such public display of paintings in turn produces periodical criticism [see note 1 at left]: periodical art reviews require periodic exhibitions, a practice
which begins in England with the first annual summer show of the Royal
Academy in 1769. Throughout most of the nineteenth century this exhibition remained the major event of the art world, for if an artist wished
to establish his reputation and command good prices for his creations, he
usually had to make his mark at this show.</p>


<h3>The Royal Academy and Other Institutional Exhibitors</h3>

<p class="one">Furthermore, he could secure both his reputation and his financial
position by gaining election to the Royal Academy, first as an associate
and then as a full member of that powerful body. But because the art
world was far less centralized in England than it was in France, where
access to the salons was a matter of financial survival, painters, such as
<a href="../../../painting/whh/index.html">Hunt</a> and <a href="../../../painting/dgr/index.html">Rossetti</a>, could make their way outside of the Academy. Artists,
for instance, could make use of exhibitions in Manchester, Liverpool, and
other cities of the industrial north, while in London they could send pictures to the various watercolor societies, the British Institution (until
1867), the Society of Female Artists, and, later in the century, private
galleries, such as the <a href="../../../decadence/grosvenor.html">Grosvenor</a>, which became increasingly important as
ways to reach the public. To the dismay of many artistically and politically conservative critics, the new middle-class patron, who was apt to be
independent-minded and unwilling to follow the lead of the art establishment, 
greatly weakened the authority of the Royal Academy. As F.
G. Stephens, an original member of the <a href="../../../painting/prb/1.html">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a>
turned art critic, pointed out in 1871,</p>

<p class="lq">
The so-called middle-class of
England has been that which has done the most for English art. While its
social superiors 'praised' Pietro Perugino, neglected Turner, let Wilson
starve, and gave as much for a Gaspar Poussin as for a Raphael, the
merchant princes bought of Turner, William Hunt, Holman Hunt, and
Rossetti"  ["English Painters of the Present Day. XXI. —  William Holman Hunt," <span class="book">Portfolio</span> 2
(1871): 38. —  for a late-nineteenth century discussion of these institutions, see <a href="../../../art/institutions1.html">"Victorian Art Institutions" (1897)</a> 
</p>

<h3>Artist-Organized Exhibitions</h3>

<p class="one">In addition to attracting individual patrons at the Royal Academy or similar 
  shows, the artist could exhibit major works, either by himself or with the assistance 
  of a dealer. By charging the public for admission to such a private show the 
  painter effectively transferred his financial dependence from a single buyer 
  to a large number of people. During the course of the nineteenth century one 
  can occasionally observe painters both English and foreign, thus exhibiting 
  their works in London, but the great master of this technique for reaching the 
  middle-class public was [126-127] Holman Hunt, who after 1860 chose to show 
  all his major productions in this manner. Turner, of course, long had his own 
  exhibition gallery, and Haydon had charged for admission to exhibitions of single 
  pictures. The American Ruskinian landscape painter, Frederick Church, and M. 
  Munkacsy, a painter of large sacred histories, exemplify foreign competitors 
  in the London exhibition scene. In 1860 Hunt exhibited his  
  <a href="../../../painting/whh/replete/finding2.html"><span class="painting">Finding of the Saviour</span></a> 
  in the Temple, in 1873  
  <a href="../../../painting/whh/replete/shadow.html"><span class="painting">The Shadow of Death</span></a>, 
  and in 1885 <span class="painting">The Triumph of the Innocents</span>, and he continued the practice in later 
  years. The many long reviews his works received demonstrate how effective a 
  method of reaching his audience this exhibition of a single work had become.In 
  part because these exhibitions remained relatively uncommon — to make a success 
  of them the artist had already to have achieved his reputation — they had the 
  further advantage of securing major periodical reviews, which provided necessary 
  publicity.</p>
  
<h3>The Rise of the Public Museum in the Late Nineteenth Century</h3>
<p class="one">The final
adjustment of the art world to a mass audience occurred in the late
decades of the century when the museum movement acknowledged that
the lower classes also form part of the artist's public.
As the <a href="../../../periodicals/iln/intro.html"><span class="book">Illustrated London News</span></a> for November 28, 1885, pointed out, "It is only within" the last twenty or thirty years that the vital importance of an art education to our manufacturing classes has been recognised. But although the recognition is tardy, it is now very thorough.... Birmingham, one of the first towns to recognise the necessity for some such teaching, has just built a magnificent gallery for the housing of her treasures" (550).
</p>


<h3>Reproductive Steel-<A NAME="engraving">Engraving</a> as a Way of Reaching an Audience</h3>
<p>In addition to these changes in exhibition practice, there are other
indications that painting was acquiring far larger audiences than ever
before. For example, the practice of making engraved reproductions of
important contemporary paintings, such as Hunt's <a href="../../../painting/whh/replete/P16.html"><span class="painting">Light of the World</span></a>,
simultaneously provided an important source of income to many Victorian 
artists while making available to the middle and lower classes works
which they could not otherwise have afforded.</p>

<p>
 <a href="../../../painting/turner/index.html">Turner</a>, who perhaps earned more money from his art than any previous English
 painter, derived a large portion of his income from engravings after his works. The
middle-class market for these editions of his works enabled him to paint as daringly as he
wished. One must point out, however, that many of the engravings after Turner were taken
from watercolors and drawings originally designed to be reproduced, whereas the later
Victorian engravings were meant to make available to a large public major exhibited works
that had demonstrated popularity. For valuable information about this practice, see Hilary
Beck's <span class="book">Victorian Engravings</span>, the catalogue of the 1973 exhibition at London's Bethnal Green
Museum.
</p>
<h3>Wood-Engraving and Book Illustration</h3>

<p>Finally, for those artists who did not wish — or could not afford — to restrict themselves to the more 
  prestigious medium of oil painting, there was the opportunity to work in book 
  and periodical illustration, an area in which the artist could match the writer 
  as both acquired a mass audience. Many of the most important Victorian painters, 
  including Millais, <a href="../../../art/illustration/whh/index.html">Hunt</a>, <a href="../../../art/illustration/dgr/index.html">Rossetti</a>, 
  <a href="../../../painting/bj/graphics/index.html">Burne-Jones</a>, and Hughes, provided 
  designs for wood-engraving illustrations, and there was also a large group of 
  excellent draftsmen (of whom the finest is perhaps <a href="../../../art/illustration/houghton/index.html">Arthur Boyd Houghton</a>) who 
  devoted ost of their  energies to this mode.</p>

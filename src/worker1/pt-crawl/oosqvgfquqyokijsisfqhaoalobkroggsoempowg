<h3>Undergraduate Program of Study</h3>




<p>Theater and Performance Studies (TAPS) seeks to animate the intersection of practice and theory in the arts. TAPS offers studio classes, seminars, and studio-seminars, which combine academic and practice-based inquiry. TAPS courses are taught by distinguished faculty as well as professional artists from Chicago's vibrant theater community.</p>




<p>Students work closely with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and faculty advisors to shape an individual course of study that reflects the student’s interests while fulfilling the program’s requirements. Each student’s coursework may be organized around one or more clusters, including, for example, acting, dance, devising and writing (across media), design, directing, dramaturgy, media arts, performance studies, theater history, or some combination of the above.</p>




<p>Students majoring in other fields of study may double major or complete a minor in TAPS.</p>




<a name="requirementsforthemajor"></a>
<h3><a name="requirementsforthemajor"></a>Requirements for the Major</h3>




<p>The major requires a total of 13 courses, comprising 11 elective courses and a capstone BA project. At least seven of the elective courses counted toward the major must have a TAPS course number. Course selection is subject to the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. It is generally expected that courses in the major will be at the 20000-level or higher; 10000-level courses will be approved sparingly. Coursework includes:</p>




<ol>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=TAPS%2022900" title="TAPS 22900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'TAPS 22900');">TAPS 22900</a> Introduction to Theater &amp; Performance Studies</span>, designed to introduce students to foundational ideas and critical skills relevant to the study of theater and performance.</li>

	<li>Four elective courses in theater, dance, and/or performance theory, considered broadly to include history, theory, aesthetics, or analysis. Theory courses may be selected from the TAPS course offerings below or from related course offerings in the College. At least two of these courses will have a TAPS course number.</li>
	<li>Four elective courses in artistic practice. Artistic practice courses may be selected from the TAPS course offerings below or from related course offerings in the College, including Cinema and Media Studies, Creative Writing, Media Arts and Design, Music, or Visual Arts. At least two of these courses will have a TAPS course number.</li>
	<li>Three other elective courses selected from the TAPS course offerings listed below or from related course offerings in the College.</li>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=TAPS%2029800" title="TAPS 29800" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'TAPS 29800');">TAPS 29800</a> Theater and Performance Studies BA Colloquium</span>, to be taken in the student's fourth year, is devoted to the preparation of the BA project. Although TAPS 29800 extends over two quarters, students register for the course in only Autumn <em>or </em>Winter Quarter, receiving 100 units of credit and one grade for the course.</li>

</ol>





<a name="baproject"></a>
<h3>BA Project</h3>




<p>The TAPS BA project marks the culmination of a student’s studies in TAPS and is typically presented during Spring Quarter of the  student's fourth year. There are two project formats from which to choose: (1) an original artistic work (e.g., staged reading, site-specific installation, solo performance, choreography) with an accompanying critical piece of writing, OR (2) a written academic thesis with an accompanying presentation (in the form of a talk or performative component).</p>




<p>With the support of the Director of Undergraduate Studies and other TAPS faculty, students will select a faculty advisor for their BA project, develop the project proposal, and submit a BA Project Statement during Spring Quarter of the third year. Proposals are subject to the approval of the Chair of Theater and Performance Studies.</p>




<p>In the fourth year, students will enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=TAPS%2029800" title="TAPS 29800" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'TAPS 29800');">TAPS 29800</a> Theater and Performance Studies BA Colloquium</span>, which offers a weekly forum in Autumn and Winter Quarters to develop the BA project in collaboration with peers and in accordance with a carefully designed set of deadlines. During Spring Quarter of the fourth year, students will present their artistic work(s) and submit their final complete project by Friday of fourth week for honors consideration, or by Friday of the eighth week for the completion of the major. Students graduating in any quarter other than Spring should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies about an appropriate timeline. </p>





<a name="honors"></a>
<h3>Honors</h3>




<p>Eligibility for honors requires an overall cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher, a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the TAPS major, and a BA project that is judged by the designated advisors to display exceptional intellectual and creative merit. If the faculty advisors recommend the project for honors, the Chair of TAPS in consultation with the TAPS faculty will issue a recommendation to the Associate Dean and Master of the Humanities Collegiate Division, who makes the ultimate decision.</p>

This course offers an introduction to a number of significant dramatic works and seminal figures in the theorization of theater and performance. But the course's aspirations go much further: we will be concentrating upon the intersection of interpretation and enactment, asking how these pieces appear on stage and why. This will not be merely descriptive work, but crucially it will be interpretive and physical work. Students will prepare and present applied interpretations-that is, interpretations that enable conceptual insights to take artistic form. Throughout, we will be searching for that elusive combination of philological rigor, theoretical sophistication, and creative inspiration-probing the theoretical stakes of creativity and testing the creative implications of analytic insights.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Performance exists in repetition. Theater is a space where we continue to bring the past to the present, making new moments while maintaining old memories. In this class, we will explore the relationship between performance and repetition by looking at how classical performance in East Asia continue/discontinue on modern stages. From Royal Shakespeare Company's translation and adaptation of Yuan drama to avant-garde Japanese theatre' artists recycling of classical performance training techniques, from museum performances that breathe life into the collected theatrical objects to underground variety theater that revives Edo-kabuki--all the materials in the class center on the ways in which modern East Asia negotiates with the disruption of traditions as well as social and personal dislocations that modernity has brought about. By closely looking at a variety of cases, we will consider: How does performance provide us alternative lens to probe into the changing cultural values, historical backgrounds, and social identities in East Asia? What are some ways that we can rethink the premodern/modern divide in East Asian Studies? How can the studies of East Asian performance, both classical and modern, enrich our understandings of the interplay between theater, history, and memory?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>TAPS 20730.  What makes a Classic Theater: from Core Mission to Concept.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
Instinctively we know what a classic is and does in our culture. From Coca Cola to Air Jordans, a classic is a material artifact that resonates across time, class, race, creed and nationality. A classic has staying power, whether it evolves, remains fresh, or re-invents itself in new contexts. In drama, a classic is a more fraught concept. The tradition of a classic canon has been rightly and thoroughly critiqued as racist, misogynist, and exclusionary. In spite of this, the idea of a classic still abides and holds sway in the cultural imaginary. Taught by Associate Artistic Director Gabrielle Randle-Bent, this course takes as its point of departure that Court Theatre is &quot;The Center for Classic Theatre.&quot; We begin with the question: What are the practical, critical, and dramaturgical implications for an institution committing to the production of classic work? We will read literary and dramatic criticism to better understand the idea of classic text, we will study the structure of modern regional theatre to interrogate the economic necessity for the production of classic work on contemporary stages, and finally we will read canonical, a-canonical, and new works of theatre to begin to articulate a dramaturgy of Classic Theatre on our own terms.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This is a highly participatory, exploratory class designed for students to study, write and perform dramatic texts.  We will read the short stories and major plays of Anton Chekhov and identify signature elements of Chekhovian structure, style and themes.  We will read plays that reinterpret, reimagine or recontextualize his work, including works by Thomas Bradshaw, Haruki Murakami, Tanya Saracho, Zach Galifianakis, Claude Miller and Regina Taylor.  Working in small groups, we will devise our own short performances in response to Chekhov and how they relate to ourselves, other cultures, and other eras. We will use Chekhov's precise, compassionate yet unsentimental writing as a launchpad to explore theatre, short story and acting in the 20th and 21st Centuries.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The creation of a TV Pilot is a unique, exciting, and demanding task for a writer. In addition to the responsibility of telling a compelling story, writers are also charged with setting up a &quot;world&quot; and establishing characters and plotlines that will sustain the show over multiple episodes and seasons. In this class, we will delve into the processes required to succeed in this challenging endeavor. This includes creation of pitch materials, plot and character development, outlining, creation of a show bible, and ultimately, writing the pilot episode of an original TV series. 
The classroom will function as part development workshop and part informal TV writer's room. Through weekly reading and writing assignments we will dissect successful entries into the TV space and tap into our artistic inspirations to evolve our show concepts. From there, we would collaborate as a class by actively brainstorming and workshopping our scripts and series. By the end of the quarter, each student will complete a draft of an original pilot script, as well as a short &quot;Series Bible&quot; detailing the broader scope of the show.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course traces the creative, political, and scholarly legacies of Katherine Dunham (1909-2006), exploring the immeasurable impact of her career as a dancer, choreographer, anthropologist, activist, and creator of the Dunham Technique. Students will merge embodied practice with in-class discussions of theoretical texts, questioning the role of Black dance traditions of the 20th century in helping shape transnational and Black diaspora studies. In keeping with the geographic scope of Dunham's practice and research, we will engage Black dance and social movements of the Caribbean, Latin America, the United States, and beyond. Central concepts of performance ethnography, Caribbean studies, and Black feminisms will anchor an investigation of dance as an intellectual process and as social action. We will contemplate the methods of artist-activists and artist-scholars in traversing disciplines and foregrounding new fields of thought. This course will balance training with a certified practitioner in Dunham Technique with field studies, archival research, and short choreographic experiments while taking advantage of concurrent city-wide events celebrating Dunham's legacy.

The course will offer an introduction to The Ring, including its complicated place in history (including its reception and production history), and how it has been thought about in recent musicology and critical theory. But first and foremost, we will be exploring how the piece is being staged today. To that end, we will explore four productions of the tetralogy that are currently being prepared at leading opera houses around the world - in Munich, London, Berlin, and Oslo - speaking, via Zoom, with artistic directors and the production teams about their ideas and ambitions. What are the interpretive challenges and opportunities in staging this mammoth work? How do these productions seek to engage the tetralogy's exceedingly complicated aesthetic ambitions, political baggage, and production history? And how do specific geographical, cultural, and historical conditions affect the artistic project of each production? Our discussions will encompass a range of fields, approaches, and topics. Among the themes we plan to examine are the aspiration to aesthetic totalization, the politics of community, the relationship between canonicity and critique, the notion of distress or emergency (the German term is Not), and some astonishingly lurid fantasies of family life-mostly of family dissolution.

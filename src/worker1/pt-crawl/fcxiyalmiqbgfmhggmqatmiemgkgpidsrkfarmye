<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='color:red'>Isaac Newton
: Principia <o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>translated and annotated by<br>
<span style='color:black'>Ian Bruce<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p style='tab-stops:0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is a new translation of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principia</i>.
The Principia in the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition was translated in 1729 by Andrew Motte,
and his is the translation usually referred to; however, most helpful as it is
as a contemporary source, the Latin sentences have been largely paraphrased,
which means that you are not reading what Newton said, but rather what Motte
thought he said, and the two things are not always exactly the same; for
example, it is due to Motte that we have Newton's first law in the form we know
it, which is not exactly what Newton intended. Note especially in Motte's
translation that sentences in italics have been added by Motte himself trying
to make clear what Newton<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>is saying.
Occasional sentences in addition have just been mistranslated; this error in
translation can be held against the two modern translators, Cajori and Cohen,
and rather than getting closer to what Newton actually said, or more precisely
what Cotes and Bentley made out that he wanted to say, they have on numerous
occasions strayed away from the original text even further; these comments
apply mostly to the introductory material, which is mainly non mathematical in
nature. The Principia is just as much a book of problems as it is a book of
solutions to problems; Newton has solved a great many problems that he posts as
Corollaries, but leaves for his readers ; lemmas are often new results; a thorough
knowledge of the geometry of conic sections is required to tackle this work.
Various notes have been added to help you do this.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One gradually becomes aware that differential
and integral calculus form the backbone of this work, but the use of these
tools has been carefully concealed, or at least not being given pride of place;
there are however, occasions when a proposition can only be demonstrated by
calculus, such as Prop. 39 of Section 7 in Book I ; in fact, Newton kept
scurrying backwards and forwards from the brave new world of differential and
integral calculus to the world of Euclidian geometry, with which he was far
more familiar, and this may account for some of the apparent lack of detail in
proofs, which are often given in the form of conclusions, with no mathematics.
One should not expect everything written down by Newton, in the original Latin,
or in some translation, to be understood without coming across items that
require some or considerable effort ; thus, even matters that were mainly
incorrect, such as the flow of water from an aperture in a tank, need to be
looked at more carefully; some enlightenment can be derived from Leseur &amp;
Jacquier, but of course they themselves did not know the full answers to some
of the questions posed by Newton. What one can say with some definiteness is,
that Newton's work was the common starting point for numerous subsequent
investigations by others, and it is this aspect perhaps that makes Newton's <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principia</i> still a useful book to read,
at least superficially, at least as a starting point for some subsequent
discussion, or for an in depth historical investigation. The gravitational
theory cannot really be faulted, as it represents the classical view of
gravitation, still a valid approximation to what we now believe to be reality ;
as such it is an enduring monument to Newton's genius.</p>

asking for his advice, and in turn trying to give him advice. This is the best
place in my opinion, to read about Newton the man, as here he emerges as a
whole, rather than having just one aspect of his work and nature investigated
by a biographer, who invariably present a narrow view, depending on their own
interests and expertise. Newton was really the equivalent of a number of people
: he is remembered mostly as a mathematician and natural philosopher of extraordinary
abilities ; but there were other aspects to his being – his work in chemistry,
his experimental work, his investigations into the accuracy of the books of the
Bible, his later life at the Mint, etc. One should note however, that only the
first three volumes were edited by a mathematician (Turnbull), while the last
three, depending on your point of view, are rather disappointing, as there are
hardly any mathematical notes, and goodness knows, there could have been many,
while Cotes and later Pemberton took on Newton to try to get explanations of
some of his more obscure proofs from him; as it was, the editors of the Letters
contented themselves with the old nit-picking letters of Johan Bernoulli &amp;

<p style='tab-stops:14.2pt'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span></i></b>A series of propositions leads
Newton to a geometrical construction for the centripetal force acting on a body
in orbit about some immoveable center of force ; this derivation considers two
nearby points on the orbit, and a tangent is drawn from the first; from the
similar triangles drawn it is shown that the versed sine of the arc subtended
and vanishing is proportional to the deviation of the body from rectilinear
motion along the tangent, and the area under the arc is proportional to the
time taken to travel between the two points; this area is found as that of a
triangle, which on squaring and dividing provides the centripetal
acceleration.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A note inserted by the
translator shows how this procedure is related to the modern formula for
centripetal acceleration. Newton justifies his formula by examining several
examples, ending with motion in an ellipse about the centre, for which the
force is proportional to the distance. Some additions to the notes have been
made.</p>

<p style='tab-stops:14.2pt'><i><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span></i>The
serious business of applying dynamics to bodies orbiting on conic sections gets
under way in this section. A number of results concerning conic sections are
referred to without proof, which I have tried to remedy; for example, the
Rectangle Theorem is of great assistance. Motion in elliptical, hyperbolic, and
parabolic orbits are attended to here. Notes are added to the main theorems by
this translator, but much is left for the reader to explore. Some additions to
the notes have been made.</p>

conic sections for which the focus is unknown; clearly of great use in the
determination of the orbits of planets. As is customary with Newton's work, the
establishment of the Lemmas and Propositions is often sketched, leaving much
for the readers to uncover for themselves. A knowledge of the <i

Kepler's problem. Thus a mechanical method and iterative schemes are

a great deal of material in this chapter, which sets out to prove what is now
the most trivial of tasks, the acceleration of a body under the inverse square
law in a straight line. Newton, however, tackles the problem as the limiting
case of an orbit, and so brings to bear a number of results from previous
chapters ; essentially he solves the Kepler problem in a straight line. The
last proposition shows the grasp Newton had about these matters, and uses the
calculus to solve in principle the general case.</p>

force is found to include a term in proportion to the cube of the distance from
the focus ; this rotating ellipse is compared with a similar stationary ellipse

to the fall of spheres with resistance proportional to the velocity squared,
discussed in Section 7. Newton did not consider what would have been the main

he found the kind of resistance necessary for the body to traverse several
well-known curves, and employed himself fitting hyperbolas to various

increase of the area of a circular sector or rectangular hyperbolic sector with
time to the length of the side of a triangle representing the velocity and the square
of the velocity, the first of which is multiplied by a constant, and by this
geometric means, for various relative sized of the acceleration of gravity to
the resistive forces, the underlying differential equation for the time in
terms of the velocity can be solved, which is not of course presented in any
shape or form; the further differential equation relating the forces to the

customary rectangular hyperbola to get an arithmetic progression for uniform
increases in the distance. Newton presents some calculus in arriving at this
final result. I have not included the material of Leseur &amp; Jacquier in this

he is most willing to give you the results, but he is not going to tell you
exactly how he worked out all the mathematics. The work ends with the Grand
Scholium, rather religious in parts, but interesting. Finally, Newton points to
the future of electro-magnetism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

they have not come across the famous formula &quot; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

present there, at least not in this form. The first historical appearance of a
similar formula is due to Jacob Hermann in his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p style='tab-stops:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>It comes from p.50

Every solicitation [i.e. force or agent] acting uniformly is equivalent to the
motion generated, applicable to the time [i.e. in proportion to], in which the
same motion is produced. <br>
<br>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The mass of the body to be moved may
be called M, the speed to be acquired V, and the motion to be generated M.V,
the time in which it must be produced shall be T ; the force to generate the
motion shall be G acting uniformly in this time, and it is required to show
that G = M.V:T. Since the force (§9), in as much as no motion may produced from
a dead force [1], unless it were continued for a certain time in the body, or
repeated, now may be considered to be acting uniformly, thus so that in equal
times equal quantities of motion may be produced in the body, and thus the motions
produced shall be as the times in which they are generated, that which will
produce a motion M.V in the time T shall be equivalent to the force G, from
which since G = M.V:T multiplied by T will produce M.V, it follows that G =
M.V:T. <br>

1. A reference to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vis viva</i> (§8.)
or living force notion of the time, said to be the kind of force required for
motion to be increased ; other forces which do not result in a change in
motion, or state of rest, thus could be called dead forces, or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vis</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mortua</i>
(§9), such as action reaction pairs.<br>

              in the world are composed of different combinations of about 100 
              different elements. An element is a substance that cannot be broken 
              down into simpler substances through ordinary chemistry--it is not 
              destroyed by acids, for example, nor changed by electricity, light, 
              or heat. Although philosophers in the ancient world had a rudimentary 
              concept of elements, they were incorrect in identifying water, for 
              example, as one. Today it is common knowledge that water is a compound, 
              whose smallest unit is a molecule. Passing electricity through a 
              molecule of water can separate it into two atoms of hydrogen and 
              one atom of oxygen, each a separate element. </font></p>

              of elements jibed with today's in noting that elements had characteristic

              but also interact differently with others, so elements have both 
              physical and chemical properties. Some elements form shiny solids, 
              for example, that react readily and sometimes violently with oxygen 
              and water. The atoms of other elements form gases that scarcely 
              interact with other elements. </font></p>

              particular chemical and physical properties was slow in coming. 
              Between 1868 and 1870, in the process of writing his book, <i>The 
              Principles of Chemistry,</i> Mendeleev created a table or chart 
              that listed the known elements according to increasing order of 
              atomic weights. When he organized the table into horizontal rows, 
              a pattern became apparent--but only if he left blanks in the table. 
              If he did so, elements with similar chemical properties appeared 
              at regular intervals--periodically--in vertical columns on the table. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Mendeleev was bold 
              enough to suggest that new elements not yet discovered would be 
              found to fill the blank places. He even went so far as to predict 
              the properties of the missing elements. Although many scientists 
              greeted Mendeleev's first table with skepticism, its predictive 
              value soon became clear. The discovery of gallium in 1875, of scandium 
              in 1879, and of germanium in 1886 supported the idea underlying 
              Mendeleev's table. Each of the new elements displayed properties 
              that accorded with those Mendeleev had predicted, based on his realization 
              that elements in the same column have similar chemical properties. 
              The three new elements were respectively discovered by a French, 
              a Scandinavian, and a German scientist, each of whom named the element 
              in honor of his country or region. (Gallia is Latin for France.) 
              Discovery of a new element had become a matter of national pride--the 
              rare kind of science that people could read about in newspapers, 
              and that even politicians would mention.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif">Claiming a new element 
              now meant not only identifying its unique chemical properties, but 
              finding the atom's atomic weight so the element could be fitted 
              into the right slot in the periodic table. For radioactive atoms 
              that was a tough challenge. At first these atoms were isolated only 
              in microscopic quantities. The straightforward way to identify them 
              was not by their chemical properties at all, but by their radiations. 
              Until the radioactive atoms could be sorted out with traditional 
              chemistry, some scientists were reluctant to call them new elements.</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman"><img src="images/Wbrown.gif" width="39" height="29" align="LEFT" alt="W">HAT 
              MADE THE TABLE PERIODIC?</font></b><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, serif"><b> 
              </b>The value of the table gradually became clear, but not its meaning. 
              Scientists soon recognized that the table's arrangement of elements 
              in order of atomic weight was problematic. The atomic weight of 
              the gas argon, which does not react readily with other elements, 
              would place it in the same group as the chemically very active solids 
              lithium and sodium. In 1913 British physicist Henry Moseley confirmed 
              earlier suggestions that an element's chemical properties are only 
              roughly related to its atomic weight (now known to be roughly equal 
              to the number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus). What really 
              matters is the element's atomic number&mdash;the number of protons 
              its atom carries, which Moseley could determine with X-rays. Ever 
              since, elements have been arranged on the periodic table according 
              to their atomic numbers. The structure of the table reflects the 
              particular arrangement of the electrons in each type of atom. Only 
              with the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s did scientists 
              work out how the electrons arrange themselves to give the element 
              its properties.</font></p>

<p class="one">American historians remember cartoonist Thomas Nast (1841-1907) for several 
creations that continue to entertain and enlighten:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) he devised the animal icons of the country's chief political rivals, the 
Republican Party's elephant and the Democratic Party's donkey.</li>

<li>(2) he invented the Tammany Tiger as the iconic vehicle for his editorial cartoons in 
the anti-corruption crusade in his <span class="book">Harpers' Weekly</span> series that 
brought down the New York City political cabal of Boss W. M. Tweed and Tammany Hall.</li>

<li>(3) he also created (something few may remember) the modern image of the American 
Santa Claus, as distinct from Britain's Father Christmas. In addition, literary 
historians still associate his illustrations with the novels of Mark Twain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon his death on 7 December 1902, Nast's obituary in <span class="book">Harper's 
Weekly</span> stated, "He has been called, perhaps not with accuracy, but with 
substantial justice, the Father of American Caricature."</p>

<p>Thomas Nast was not a native-born but a naturalized American, born in Landau, Germany, 
on 27 September 1840, son of a military bandsman who later emigrated to the United 
States. Having studied art in New York City, at the age of just 15 Nast had joined the 
artistic staff of <span class="book">Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</span>; several 
years later, he shifted to the more prestigious 
<a href="../../../periodicals/harpers/index.html"><span class="book">Harper's Weekly: A 
Journal of Civilization</span></a>, becoming a staff artist in 1862, after his Italian 
adventure.</p>

<p>Thomas Nast mainly drew satirical commentaries for <span class="book">Harper's
Weekly</span> from 1859 to 1860 and from 1862 until 1886. During his brief hiatus from 
working in the highly politicized environment of New York City, in February 1860, he 
travelled to Great Britain to cover a major sporting event for the <span class="book">New 
York Illustrated News</span>, the prize fight staged by George Wilkes (publisher of the 
periodical <span class="lqbook">Spirit of the Times</span>) between an American boxer, 
John C. Heenan, and his British opponent, 
<a href="../../../sculpture/funerary/222.html">Thomas Sayers</a>. Seizing the opportunity 
to provide more serious newspaper coverage, as an artist for 
<a href="../../../periodicals/iln/index.html"><span class="book">The Illustrated London 
News</span></a>, the twenty-year-old journalist took ship for Italy to cover Garibaldi's 
military campaign to liberate the peninsula from Austria. Nast's cartoons and reportage 
about Garibaldi's attempt to <a href="../../../history/risorgimento/1.html">unify 
Italy</a> by force of arms captured the popular American imagination. In his most 
celebrated political cartoon from that period, <span class="illustration">Peace</span> 
(1862), Nast attacked those lukewarm supporters of the Union who wanted a speedy end to 
the American Civil War, even at the expense of the principles for which so many had 
already died in the Abolitionist cause.</p>

<p>In 1873, at the invitation of Samuel Langhorn Clemens ("Mark Twain"), Nast accompanied 
the rising American author and platform speaker to England to illustrate a new book. Nast 
famously lampooned Twain's travelling to Canada to assert his copyright on <span 
class="book">The Prince and The Pauper</span> in a January 1882 editorial cartoon in 
<span class="book">Harpers' Weekly</span>. — <a href="../../../misc/pvabio.html">Philip V. Allingham</a></p>

Coughlin (1891-1971)</FONT></B></P>

<P>Father Coughlin, &#147;the Father of Hate Radio,&#148; was
born in Hamilton, Ontario. This rabidly right-wing, Catholic priest
started with a weekly broadcast on WJR, Detroit&#146;s &#147;Good
Will&#148; station. CBS broadcast it nationwide in 1930 and 1931.
He started his own radio network that grew to 30 stations. <A
HREF="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/spivak.html">John
Spivak</A>, estimated that Coughlin&#146;s broadcasts reached
40 million, said: &#147;Only the President&#133;had a bigger audience&#133;
The President spoke only on special occasions, the priest every
Sunday&#133;. To me, he was the most dangerous divisive influence
in the country&#148; (<I>A Man in His Time</I>, 1967).</P>

<P>Coughlin originally supported FDR, but turned against him in
1934 and created a political party, the National Union of Social
Justice. Former Louisiana Governor, Huey Long was supposed to
be their candidate, but he was assassinated in 1935. Journalist
<A HREF="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/seldes.html">George
Seldes</A> said Long was America&#146;s &#147;first notable Fascist
leader,...a very smart demagogue, [who] once said, &#145;Sure
we&#146;ll have Fascism here, but it will come as an anti-Fascism
movement.&#146;&#148; In the late 1930s, Coughlin called for FDR&#146;s
impeachment because he was &#147;leaning toward international
socialism or sovietism.&#148;</P>

<P>Coughlin&#146;s radio sermons praised Adolf Hitler and Benito
Mussolini. The Nazi press praised Coughlin as &#147;America&#146;s
most powerful radio commentator.&#148; He ranted against Jews,
the &#147;Christ-killers and Christ-rejecters.&#148; When a <I>Boston
Globe</I> reporter asked him for proof that communists were influencing
FDR, Father Coughlin belted the journalist in the face. </P>

<P>Coughlin's weekly paper, <I>Social Justice</I>, reached one
million. It was sold in 2,000 churches. In 1938, it reprinted
the anti-Semitic forgery &#147;Protocols of the Elders of Zion.&#148;</P>

<P>In his book <I>Maverick Marine, </I>1987, Hans Schmidt notes
that <A HREF="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/butler.html">General
Smedley Butler</A> accused Coughlin of plotting to invade Mexico!
Schmidt writes:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>While visiting the [FBI] in 1936, Butler told Hoover about
  a plot by Father Charles Coughlin to invade Mexico to protect
  the Catholic Church from harassment. Smedley said that Coughlin,
  the famous &quot;radio priest&quot; whose voice he recognized,
  had approached him by telephone and that the call was traced
  back to Coughlin afterward. It seems that Butler was being hoaxed.
  In any case, he was clearly wary of becoming involved in another
  publicized plot expos&eacute;. Butler mentioned the Coughlin
  plot again to an FBI agent in 1940 in connection with what he
  termed dozens of &quot;screwball&quot; organizations that had
  invited him to appear as a speaker.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Whether it really was Coughlin who phoned Butler about this
bizarre plot to invade Mexico is unknown. However, we do know
that Coughlin really was allied with the openly-Nazi German-American
Bund. By 1939, Coughlin had inspired and was directing a nation-wide,
fascist network, the Christian Front, which John Spivak described
as &#147;street-fighting toughs.&#148; Roy Carlson, who infiltrated
and exposed U.S. fascist groups said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;Like Hitler&#146;s Brownshirts, the Christian Front
  was ostensibly organized to combat the &#145;rising tide of Communism.&#146;
  All Jews,... liberals, New Dealers and labor organizations were
  called Communist; and since the Communist Revolution in America
  was scheduled to take place &#145;any day now,&#146; the Christian
  Front&#150;always under Coughlin&#146;s inspiration and guidance&#151;shouted
  that a private army was the only means to &#145;save America.&#146;
  Coughlin filled the pages of Social Justice with Hitler&#146;s
  sewer-spawned lies. He made direct use of Goebbels&#146; speeches,
  quoting the Nazi almost word-for-word.... He denounced the &#145;poppycock
  of Democracy&#146; and branded Democracy as a version of Communism&#148;
  (<I>Under Cover</I>, 1943).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In <I>Shrine of the Silver Dollar</I> (1940), Spivak said Coughlin
&#147;cynically used the prestige of a priest and the heart-tug
of Christian charity as a cloak for a fast deal.&#148; Spivak
showed that Coughlin was playing the stock market while denouncing
this on air as &#147;shooting craps with other people&#146;s money.&#148;
Coughlin, secretly one of the America&#146;s largest silver owners,
urged his followers to lobby for silver as the money standard.
Coughlin&#146;s &#147;monetary forms&#133;are of great help to
the <A HREF="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/rockefeller.html">Rockefeller</A>
interests, [Henry] Ford and <A HREF="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/hearst.html">[William
Randolph] Hearst</A>&#148; (Spivak, <I><A HREF="http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/newmasses.html">New
Masses</A></I>, Feb.5, 1935).</P>

<P>Not long after Spivak&#146;s expos&eacute; in 1940, Coughlin
went off the air and his paper was denied use of the mails. That
year, when an FBI raid found weapons in a Christian Front office,
J. Edgar Hoover said the Front was planning to murder Jews, communists
and &#147;a dozen Congressmen.&#148;</P>

<P>Although Coughlin was criticised by some high-ranking Catholics,
he was never defrocked for hate-mongering, political campaigning
or deceptive fundraising. Neither was he prosecuted. He continued
to churn out virulent anti-communist pamphlets until his death
in 1979.</P>

Hedid that in the press (in 1880 the <I>Eco d'Italia</I> of New Yorkdid not hesitate to proclaim him "the real inventor of thetelephone")<SUP>2</SUP>; he did that in his letters to friends, andeven in a letter to Bell himself; he asserted it in court, in thepresence of the Bell counsel. Meucci's charge that the telephoneinvention had been stolen from him was hinted at in a circular putout by the Globe Telephone Company on September 12, 1885, in which wefind the following words: "Is it not reasonable to at least infer,that by some means the ideas of Antonio Meucci may have been<I>telephoned</I> to others and <I>their</I> ideas have been mouldedinto form that he set out, and he thereby been deprived of the rightsjustly due him?"</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The charge takes a more precise form in areport by Assistant Secretary of the Interior, G. A. Jenks, to theSecretary of the Interior, dated December 22, 1885, in which it isstated:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">"He (Meucci) claims that in 1872 he went to Mr.Grant, vice-president of the New York District Telegraph company,explained his invention and tried repeatedly to have it tried on thewires of the company. This, it is claimed, was used by the telegraphcompany, and was the basis of the contract between the Western UnionTelegraph Company and the Bell Telephone Company, dated November10th, 1879."<SUP>3</SUP> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">How that happened we really do not know. All wecan do is to put two and two together and reach certain amazingconclusions. Let us see first, therefore, what was the 1879 contractmentioned above.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>BELL-WESTERN UNION AGREEMENT OF1879</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As related by Mr. Thomas A. Watson, Bell'sassistant, in the fall of 1876 the Western Union refused to buyBell's patents for the paltry sum of $100,000 because it consideredthe telephone nothing more than an electric toy. Both Mr. Prescottand Mr. Pope, let us bear in mind, were at that time the electriciansof the Western Union.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whether Mr. Orton, the president of WesternUnion, really believed that the telephone had no practical value, orwhether he had a card up his sleeve (Meucci's invention and Gray'scaveat), we do not know. The fact is that in December 1877 theWestern Union organized the American Speaking Telephone Company andentered the telephone business. The Bell Telephone Company didnothing about it for a year, until September 12, 1878, when itbrought suit against Peter A. Dowd, an agent of the Western Union.Another year went by, during which Mr. George Gifford, the WesternUnion counsel, became convinced, so the story goes, that the Bellpatents were valid and advised a settlement. A final agreement wasreached on November 10, 1879, whereby the Western Union recognizedBell as the inventor of the telephone and agreed to retire from thetelephone business. The Bell company, on the other hand, agreed topay the Western Union, for a period of seventeen years, twenty percent of all rentals or royalties on all telephones used in the UnitedStates, amounting to more than one million dollars.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">This agreement, it has been stated, "was amaster-stroke of diplomacy on the part of the BellCompany."<SUP>4</SUP> Most likely it was, if one considers that in1879 the Bell Company was in rather precarious financialcircumstances, whereas the Western Union was possibly the mostpowerful corporation in America.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">One fails to understand, however, why the BellCompany should have agreed to pay over one million dollars to itsrival, and to buy a considerable amount of equipment which it couldnot use,<SUP>5</SUP> if it did not fear losing the case. In otherwords, if the Bell Company was so sure that Alexander Graham Bell wasthe first and original inventor of the telephone and that his 1876patent was obtained in a perfectly legal manner, why did it have tocompromise? "I did not like some hints let fall by Mr. Forbes as tothe advisability of compromising with Western Union," wrote AlexanderGraham Bell to Mrs. Bell on February 21, 1879, eight months beforethe agreement was reached.<SUP>6</SUP></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">To the argument that it was the Bell Companyand not the Western Union that surrendered, Mr. Dickerson, the Bellcounsel, replied that "the record contains the whole story, told byMr. Gifford, and no man contradicts it."<SUP>7</SUP> What aridiculous argument!</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">"If the Gray pretensions had been wellfounded," continued Mr. Dickerson, "the Western Union would have hada patent for the whole speaking telephone, and Bell would havenothing." That is exactly our contention, inverting of course theparties, so as to read "if the Bell pretensions had been wellfounded, the Western Union would have nothing." However, as we shallpresently see, the Gray pretensions were an excuse, not the basis forthe litigation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It has been said that the 20% paid by the BellCompany to the Western Union, amounting to $1,164,563, representedthe value of some patents the Western Union turned over to the BellCompany, but nobody has yet explained satisfactorily which of thosepatents the Bell Company used. We have searched all the books on thesubject we could lay our hands on, but we have not found anyinformation whatsoever. From Mr. Pier's biography of Mr. Forbes wehave learned, however, that the Bell instruments cost $2.50 each andthose of the Western Union $10 or $11 each. The Bell sets were somuch better than those of the Western Union, that Mr. Forbes couldnot use the latter and wished to dump them all abroad.<SUP>8</SUP>Anyway, no patent or number of patents for telephone improvementsbefore 1880 were worth 20% of all the royalties earned by the Bellpatents of 1876 and 1877.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>MORE PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Two explanations have been offered which to usseem more logical and closer to the truth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The first is that Mr. Gifford and the Bellcounsel made a collusive fight in order to rig up the market--as itreally happened. As a matter of fact, between November 10, 1879, thedate of the settlement, and November 27, 1879, the stock of theNational Bell Telephone Company went up 700 per cent.<SUP>9</SUP> Asstated by Bell's biographer and secretary, Miss Mackenzie,"immediately the stock of the Bell Company shot up in value. InDecember 1879, it sold at $995 a share, although the company neverpaid a dividend."<SUP>10</SUP> A few months before it had sold at$110 a share. No wonder that the Bell lawyers who negotiated thesettlement, Mr. Chauncey Smith and Mr. Storrow, presented a bill for$50,000.<SUP>11</SUP> The fee seemed a little exorbitant to the BellCompany, as its president, Mr. Forbes, complained in a letter to Mr.Storrow in which, while recognizing the fine services of the twolawyers, he felt necessary to add "but also cannot but feel thatcauses outside the strength of our patents operated in ourfavor."<SUP>12</SUP> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The second explanation seems even moreplausible. Namely, as stated by a defendant in another Bell lawsuit,"that it was not to the interest of either party to expose or toprove any prior inventions by other parties, or any printed patentsor publications which tended to invalidate the claims of either&#133;and the case was carefully managed in order to avoid revealing theweakness of either in this respect."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>MR. POPE "SPILLS THE BEANS"</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The argument that Mr. Gifford became convincedthat the Bell patents were valid and that, therefore, he had no case,has no leg to stand on. In the first place, a company like theWestern Union would have not entered the telephone field if it hadnot been sure that eventually it could have forced the Bell Companyto a compromise. In 1879 it had in use 56,000 telephones in 55cities, which the Bell Company was obliged to buy as the result ofthe settlement. In the second place, if the Western Union wascompelled to admit that the Bell patents were valid, why did the BellCompany agree to pay over one million dollars in royalties? It doesnot make sense.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to Mr. Casson, Mr. Frank L. Pope, theWestern Union electrician, after making a thorough study of thequestion, handed in a report to his company, in which he announcedthat there was "no way to make a telephone except Bell's way, andadvised the purchase of the Bell patents. ... But the officials ofthe great corporation refused to take this report seriously. Theythrew it aside and employed Edison, Gray, and Dolbear to devise atelephone that could be put into competition withBell's."<SUP>13</SUP> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Casson and other writers after him,apparently, did not read Mr. Pope's deposition in the Drawbaugh casecarefully (6,000 printed pages), because, although in 1883 Mr. Popestated, as quoted by Mr. Casson, "I was entirely unable to discoverany apparatus or method anticipating the invention of Bell as awhole, and therefore concluded that the patent was valid and soadvised my employers,"<SUP>14</SUP> four years before, in 1879, hehad told a different story. In 1883, of course, Mr. Pope was in theservice of the Bell Telephone Company, but in 1879 he was working forthe Western Union.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The facts, as related by Mr. Pope, are asfollows: In August 1877, Mr. Pope was asked by Mr. Orton, the WesternUnion president, to make a thorough investigation of the wholetelephone subject.<SUP>15</SUP> Whereupon, "every possible facilitywas placed at my disposal in the prosecution of theinvestigation"<SUP>16</SUP> with the vast literature collected allover the world. As stated by him in 1883, "I presume that at the endof the year 1878 (he meant 1877) I was more fully acquainted with thestate of the art with relation to this subject than any otherperson."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, on May 9, 1879 (before the WesternUnion-Bell settlement) he declared on the stand, under oath that "Istated that, in my opinion, based upon all the facts which I had beenable to get hold of, the method was first invented by Elisha Gray,and that therefore I regarded it as most important to obtain controlof his invention and patents."<SUP>17</SUP> Later he added that hehad read Gray's caveat, and referred to it in his report to Mr. Orton"as more fully confirming my original opinion in reference to thescope of Mr. Gray's inventions."<SUP>18</SUP> That such was hisopinion in 1877 and 1879 is further proved by a telegram which hesent to Mr. Gray on the occasion of a banquet tendered to Mr. Gray atHighland Park, Ill. on November 15, 1878. The telegram read: "Acceptmy congratulations upon the splendid results of the years of thoughtand labor which have been devoted to your researches in harmonictelegraph, of which that 'triumph of inventive inspiration, thetelephone' is the brilliant and fitting culmination." The text ofthis telegram we found by chance in an obscure pamphlet in the NewYork Public Library entitled <I>Voices of the Past, The Telephone in</I>1878.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the same pamphlet we found another telegramby Mr. Prescott, also to Mr. Gray, reading: "To Elisha Gray, theinventor of the telephone and the solver of the problem of theages."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Both Mr. Prescott and Mr. Pope assistedAlexander Graham Bell during his experiments in the Western Unionlaboratory in March, April and May, 1875, shortly before Mr. Bellmade his famous "discovery" of June 2, 1875."<SUP>19</SUP>Incidentally, Mr. Pope proclaimed Gray as the inventor of thetelephone also in a paper which was read before the AmericanElectrical Society of Chicago on December 12, 1877, and later wasreprinted in the 1878 edition of Mr. Prescott's book on thetelephone. At that time, both Mr. Prescott and Mr. Gray were membersof the Board of Directors of the American Speaking Telephone Company,the company set up by the Western Union, as alreadynoted.<SUP>20</SUP> After the 1879 agreement between the WesternUnion and Bell Company, Mr. Prescott changed his tune and gave Bellfull credit, as one can see in 1890 edition of his book, <I>TheElectric Telephone</I>, and in the 1892 edition of his book,<I>Electricity and the Electric Telegraph</I>.<SUP>21</SUP></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>ELISHA GRAY</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Elisha Gray of Chicago (1835-1901) was one ofthe most successful inventors in American history, so successful thathe made over $5,000,000 by his patents.<SUP>22</SUP> In 1872 Gray andEnos Barton formed the firm of Gray and Barton which later became theWestern Electric Company. He is best remembered, however, for one ofthe most extraordinary coincidences (supposing that it was acoincidence) in the history of invention.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">On February 14, 1876, the United States PatentOffice in Washington, D.C. received within about two hours from eachother two applications, one for a patent and the other for a caveat,covering the same invention.<SUP>23</SUP> The application for thepatent was in the name of Alexander Graham Bell and that for thecaveat in the name of Elisha Gray. That invention turned out to benothing else but the telephone. As Gray wrote to Bell on February 11,1877, and on March 5, 1877, "The description is substantially thesame as yours. I was unfortunate in being an hour or two behind you"and "when, however, you see the specification, you will see that thefundamental principles are contained therein."<SUP>24</SUP> As aFrench writer put it, "La description d'Elisha Gray est si precisequ'elle permet la construction d'un appareil qui constituiraitcertainement un t&eacute;l&eacute;phone transmittant la voixarticul&eacute;e."<SUP>25</SUP> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is beyond the purpose of the present inquiryto delve into the Bell-Gray controversy, about which one can learnthe various arguments, pro and con, in the recent editions of the<I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I>. What really happened is beyond ourknowledge, except that during the spring and summer of 1875 Bell wasvery suspicious of Gray and "believed him capable of spying onme,"<SUP>26</SUP> possibly because during that period both Bell andGray were doing experimental work in the Western Union laboratory inNew York, and both of them were in contact with Mr. Prescott and Mr.Pope, especially with the latter, in whose room some of Gray'sinstruments "for transmitting musical sounds by telegraph" wereplaced.<SUP>27</SUP> Mr. Pope "was most interested in theseexperiments and personally assisted him in many ofthem."<SUP>28</SUP> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Pope's knowledge of the subject in 1876 canbe gauged by his estimate of the Bell apparatus in 1876, as mentionedin the preceding chapter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. Prescott also shared Mr. Pope's ideas.Referring to the experiments made by Bell in the Western Unionlaboratories after 1876, he wrote in his book, <I>The ElectricTelephone</I>, "for a long time the results, while regarded withinterest, were looked upon as possessing little practical value notuntil the summer of 1877....<SUP>29</SUP></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Frankly, we do not know to what extent one cantrust either Mr. Pope or Mr. Prescott. However, if we are to believeThomas Alva Edison (no man in his right mind would question hisword), one thing is certain, namely, that at the very time that Belland Gray were conducting their experiments in the Western Unionlaboratory in New York, the Western Union President, Mr. Orton, wasvery much interested in the electric transmission of the human voice.That may explain why Mr. Hubbard, Bell's financial backer and futurefather-in-law, all of a sudden became interested in the telephone andurged Bell to apply for a patent instead of a caveat, without theleast delay.<SUP>30</SUP> That also could explain many things, suchas Mr. Orton's alleged lack of interest in the Bell patents, etc.etc. We conclude that much from a letter which Edison wrote to Mr.Prescott and which the latter incorporated in his book <I>TheElectric Telephone</I>.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Some time in or about the month of July 1875,"Edison wrote, "I began experimenting with a system of multipletelegraphy which had for its basis the transmission of acousticvibrations. Being furnished, at the same time, by Hon. William Orton,President of the Western Union Telegraph Company, with a translateddescription from a foreign scientific journal of Reiss's telephone, Ibegan a series of experiments, with the view of producing anarticulating telephone."<SUP>31</SUP> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>MEUCCI AND THE BELL-WESTERN UNION SETTLEMENTOF 1879</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now, putting two and two together, we arrive atthe following tentative conclusions:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. In 1872 Meucci took the description of hisinvention and a set of his telephone to Mr. Grant of the AmericanDistrict Telegraph Company to have it tested over the wires of thatcompany.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">2. Mr. Grant, most likely, turned the matterover to the Western Union electricians (Mr. Prescott and Frank L.Pope) as the logical men to pass on it, but neither of themunderstood or realized the practical value of the telephone andignored the whole thing.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">3. In 1875 both Alexander Graham Bell andElisha Gray were making experiments in the laboratory of the WesternUnion in New York, and while there Mr. Prescott or Mr. Pope, or both,may have mentioned Meucci's invention. What was unintelligible toeither Mr. Prescott or Mr. Pope acquired immediate significance inthe eyes of both Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray. At any rate,shortly after Bell made his experiments in the Western Unionlaboratory, between March and the end of May 1875, Bell made hisfamous "discovery" of June 2, 1875. Bell's and Gray's commonknowledge of Meucci's invention would the explain the unusualcoincidence of their applications at the United States Patent Officeon the very same day, February 14, 1876, but only a couple of hoursapart. That may explain also Mr. Grant's words to Mr. Bertolino aboutmaking $100,000, fifty thousand for him and fifty thousand forMeucci.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">4. In 1877, after the Bell Telephone Companywas organized, and its threat to the telegraph business becameapparent, Mr. Frank L. Pope may have asked his brother, Henry W.Pope, superintendent of the American District Telegraph Company, tolook for the instruments Meucci had brought over to the latter'scompany in 1872. The instruments were found and then tested on aprivate telegraph line which the two brothers installed between theirhomes near Elizabeth, N. J., as we have seen in the precedingchapter. Shortly after that the Western Union organized the AmericanSpeaking Telephone Company.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">5. Under those circumstances, in order todamage the Bell case, the Western Union would have been compelled toreveal the Meucci background of the Bell patent and the Gray caveat.But by so doing it would have damaged its own case and both partieswould have lost. The logical thing left to do was to reach acompromise.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus Meucci's charge that the Bell-WesternUnion agreement of 1879 was based on his invention becomes quiteintelligible. What we fail to understand is why the Western Union didnot hold out for a larger share. On this point, however, it has beensaid that even in 1879 the Western Union experts did not foresee thefuture development of the telephone. That makes sense.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>DID MEUCCI FOOL HIMSELF?</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The possibility that Meucci may have fooledhimself regarding the similarity between his instruments and Bell'stelephone must be ruled out in the most absolute manner. As we haveseen in the preceding chapters, Meucci described several electricinstruments so clearly that there is no doubt whatsoever as to hisknowledge of the fundamental principles of the electric telephone.But then we have the Globe circular of September 1885 with twocross-sections of both Meucci's and Bell's instruments, the drawingsin the November 1885 issue of the <I>New York Electrical World</I>,and, above all, the sketches which Meucci made on the stand as wellas those he made at home, which were attached to hisaffidavit.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Last but not least, would Meucci have had theaudacity of writing a personal letter to Bell "alleging his ownpretensions," as Mr. Storrow (Bell's lawyer) put it, if he did notfeel sure that he had been defrauded?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">But, let us suppose, for the sake of argument,that Meucci did fool himself. Did Meucci's financial backers, lawyersand business men thoroughly acquainted with the details of bothMeucci's invention and Bell's telephone, fool themselves too? Thosegentlemen were not interested in Meucci's glory or vindication, orsimilar empty honors. If they staked such large sums of money onMeucci's claims they must have been positive that Meucci's telephonewas electric and similar to Bell's. What is more, they risked sixthousand additional dollars to appeal Judge Wallace's decision to theSupreme Court of the United States, <I>after</I> the Supreme Courthad affirmed six previous decisions of lower courts, all in favor ofBell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">As Elisha Gray wrote on a piece of paper whichwas found among his effects after his death, "The history of thetelephone will never be fully written, it is partly hidden away in 20or 30 thousand pages of testimony and partly lying on the hearts andconsciences of a few whose lips are sealed--some in death, and othersby a golden clasp whose grip is even tighter."<SUP>32</SUP></FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><HR>&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I>NOTES</I></B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><I>General -- </I>All references tothe Bell Telephone Company, the Western Union Telegraph Company, theAmerican District Telegraph Company and other companies mentioned inthis book are, of course, to the companies by those names inexistence in Meucci's day, that is, before 1889.

E., <I>Antonio Meucci Inventor of the Telephone</I>, TheVigo Pess, New York, NY 1958, pp. 5-8&#93;</FONT></P></CENTER><P ALIGN=right><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B><I>FOREWORD</I></B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Should one ask an Italian--hereor in Italy, it matters little-- "Who invented the telephone?," inall probability the reply would be "Antonio Meucci, everybody knowsthat."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">If, however, one were to askthe same Italian what proofs he could show to support his assertion,most likely he would be referred to any Italian encyclopedia, such asthe monumental <I>Enciclopedia Treccani</I>, to mention only the mostimportant reference work in the Italian language.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The Treccani encyclopedia, as amatter of fact, proclaims Meucci as the inventor of the telephone intwo articles, first in Meucci's biography, and then in the article onthe telephone. In the first, we learn that Meucci's "inventionconsists of a vibrating diaphragm and a magnet electrified by a coilaround it. The vibrating diaphragm . . . alters the current of themagnet . . . these alterations of current being transmitted to theother end of the wire produce similar vibrations on the receivingdiaphragm, thus reproducing the word."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Of course, the abovedescription would be a good description of an electric telephone,even if it does not mention what causes the diaphragm to vibrate,but, unfortunately, the author of the article does not substantiatehis assertion with any sources. The article also contains severalmistakes, as for instance, the reference to "Clifter, Long Island"instead of "Clifton, Staten Island," or to Meucci's "patent," when itshould have said "caveat."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In the second article, byanother writer, on page 405 of Vol. 33, we learn that "in October,1888, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that 'the Belltelephone ought to be called Meucci telephone, the Bell TelephoneCompany having acquired its patent fraudulently." It adds that Meuccidiscovered the first principles of the telephone in 1849--a statementeasy to disprove--and shows the section of a Meucci telephone,complete with vibrating diaphragm and electromagnet. Furthermore, itstates that "In Meucci's original patent it is said that theelectromagnet may be set closer to, or farther away from, thevibrating diaphragm made of a substance 'capable of induction,' thusshowing Meucci's knowledge of the subject. It cannot, therefore, bedoubted that the real inventor of the modern telephone was theItalian, Meucci."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In my files I have at least ascore of articles which have appeared in Italian and English in asmany newspapers and magazines, both in Italy and in the UnitedStates, all making the same assertions, as in the Treccani. Oneauthor even gives the volume and page of the U. S. Reports (OctoberTerm, 1888) in which the following words are alleged to be found:"The said invention was known and used by Antonio Meucci at StatenIsland, N. Y. from 1856 to 1870, and by him published in the Ecod'Italia."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Another Italian popular work,the <I>Enciclopedia dei Ragazzi</I>, the Italian edition of the<I>Book of Knowledge</I>, (Vol. IX, p. 3984) states "but the UnitedStates Supreme Court credited the invention to Antonio Meucci, ofLeghorn, who emigrated to America in 1845, and ordered the BellTelephone Company to pay Meucci a pension."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In Italy one will find also atablet and a splendid bas-relief in honor of Meucci. The tablet, inthe Florence Post Office Building, reads:"</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">ANTONIOMEUCCI--INVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE--DIED IN 1889--IN A FOREIGN LAND,POOR--AND DEFRAUDED OF HIS RIGHTS...</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">."The bas-relief, unless my memory fails me, takes up the whole leftwall of the hallway of the Teti Palace (the Telephone Building) onPiazza Colonna, in Rome. It bears the following inscription:"</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">ANTONIO MEUCCI--FLORENTINE PATRIOT--EXILE IN AMERICA-- CONCEIVED AND CONSTRUCTED IN1849--THE FIRST TELEPHONE WHICH HE PERFECTED IN 1854--THIS INVENTIONOF HIS-- AT FIRST NOT RECOGNIZED--AND NOW ADMITTED -- IS VINDICATEDIN HIS HONOR--AND FOR THE HONOR OF ITALIAN GENIUS</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Finally, I might mention anarticle which appeared in an Italian magazine published in New Yorkin 1922, in which it is stated that in 1917 Alexander Graham Belladmitted that he was not the inventor of the telephone. On thispoint, what really happened was that at the unveiling of a bust ofhimself in Brantford, Ontario, Bell said "I cannot claim to be theinventor of the modern telephone. That is the product of many minds.I but initiated the transmission of sound." Anyone slightlyacquainted with the subject would realize at once that what Bellmeant was that he did not invent the complicated instrument of 1917,but only discovered the fundamental principle of the telephone. Forthat matter, Meucci did not invent the modern telephone, either, butonly the principle on which the modern electric telephone isfounded.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">At any rate, the followingfacts should be made clear, once for all:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><OL>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In 1871 Meucci was not      granted a patent, but a caveat, a kind of provisional patent.      Anybody could get a caveat, even if the invention was      worthless.</FONT></LI>            <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Meucci's caveat does not      describe any kind of a diaphragm--none whatever.</FONT></LI>            <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">There is no United      States Supreme Court decision either in favor or against      Meucci, and the reference in the October Term of the 1888 U. S.      Reports (or in any other volume), exists only in the      imagination of some irresponsible people.</FONT></LI>            <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In the thousands of      pages of manuscript and printed records dealing with Meucci      consulted by me, there is no such description of the telephone      as given in the Italian encyclopedia. Least of all, is there      any reference to any substance "capable of inductive action"      precisely defined. We have, of course, documentary evidence      that Meucci constructed an electric telephone with material      capable of inductive action, such as iron, as well as Meucci's      description of the effect of the diaphragm on the magnet, but      Meucci never used the precise scientific definition quoted in      the Treccani article. Least of all in the caveat.</FONT></LI>            <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The various detailed      articles on the Meucci telephone which appeared in the 1880's      in American and British journals, such as the <I>Telegraphic      Journal and Electrical Review </I>of London and the      <I>Electrical World</I> of New York, with accurate drawings of      the various instruments constructed by Meucci, have no legal      value whatsoever.</FONT></LI>            <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The only court decision      about Meucci's telephone in existence was rendered by Judge      Wallace of the U. S. Circuit Court in 1887 in the case of the      Bell Telephone Company against the Globe Telephone Co., Meucci      et Al. That decision was against Meucci.</FONT></LI>   </OL></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">I have mentioned the abovefacts so as to clear the air of all the nonsense that has beenwritten and is still being written about Meucci.

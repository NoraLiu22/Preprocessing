<H2>Resurrection Man (1997)</H2>

<P>D: Marc Evans<BR>
S: Stuart Townsend, James Nesbitt</P>

<P>Chilling adaptation of Eoin MacNamee's novel taking its inspiration from
real events but working them through the filters of gothic horror and narrative
convention. Set in 1970s Northern Ireland, the story is drawn from the real-life
exploits of Lenny Murphy, a Loyalist paramilitary given to brutal torture
which earned his gang the nickname of &quot;The Shankill Butchers&quot;.
In spite of the setting and this basis in fact, the film is a fanciful thematic
exploration of the Irish predisposition to violence not very much different
from the scores of political thrillers which preceded it with Catholic and
Republican terrorists undergoing various forms of sacrificial self-immolation
(<I>The Informer</I>, <A HREF="omo.htm"><I>Odd Man Out</I>,</A> <I>Shake
Hands With the Devil</I>; the list is endless). Religion is a factor at
least insofar as the title reflects the spiritual ironies of the belief
in life after death and in that its central character is from a family of
mixed religion (which partly fuels his insanity). Politics are kept very
much in the background though, with paramilitary up and comer Victor Kelly
(Stuart Townsend) making a name for himself as a hard man in the ranks of
Loyalism, but then quickly becoming a dangerous embarrassment which needs
to be neutralised. Downtrodden reporter James Nesbitt is eventually led
by high-up Sean McGinley to the renegade's lair, and as Nesbitt becomes
complicit in the cycle of violence, he is forced to confront his own personal
demons.</P>

<P><I>Resurrection Man</I> derives most of its power from atmosphere. Welsh
director Marc Evans works with French cinematographer Pierre Aim (<I>La
Haine</I>) to turn various Manchester locations into a gothic Northern Ireland,
a kind of nightmare dreamscape which Victor stalks like an ersatz vampire.
Not far from the surreal-tinged otherworld of <A HREF="omo.htm"><I>Odd Man
Out</I> </A>, <I>Resurrection Man</I>'s Belfast is a symbolically charged
space in which the drama unfolds not on the level of realism or character
drama, but on a plane of metaphor. It is far from the first film to take
this approach, but it is arguably the most forceful since <A HREF="omo.htm"><I>Odd
Man Out</I>.</A> Taking its cue from the serial killer films of the early
nineties, the film concentrates on establishing its villain as a repugnant
but attractive figure with the deadly allure of one of Anne Rice's vampires,
then pits his acts of extreme cruelty against a pervasive sense of social
corruption which hammers home the film's thematic concerns. It is dynamically
shot and fairly tightly wound on a dramatic level, making it an effective
piece of narrative to which people are likely to react based upon their
like or dislike for the genre and for the use of genre in general.</P>

<P>With his contact-lens-darkened eyes and broodings looks, Townsend makes
an imposing villain. Though graphic enough in themselves, many of the scenes
of torture are made all the more terrifying by his expressions of vacant
deliberation as he literally carves up his victims. As in all good horror,
the viewer is as much disgusted by the character as they are afraid of him,
and Townsend proves well able to sustain this kind of revulsion while also
playing a certain variety of cheeky-boy hunk appropriate to the character's
psychology. In the novel Victor's obsession with gangster movies is part
of his skewed perspective on the world. The character's dynamism and charisma
is therefore shown to have shallow and delusional roots, as is his psychosis.
Inevitably, of course, this reading of the sectarian psychopath as apolitical
metaphor leaves a referential hole in the centre of the text (politics becomes
nothing more than another illusory frame of reference with which the unstable
character defines himself), but this is the kind of concern which those
interested in political representation will find more troubling than the
general audience.</P>

<P>An important secondary character is that of Victor's mother, portrayed
by Brenda Fricker. While representing certain clich&eacute;s about the Irish
mother and other clich&eacute;s about  the figurehead behind the psychopath,
Fricker is able to invest a degree of believable grit into what is again
a symbolic role. Most of the supporting cast work along the same lines,
taking events seriously enough to draw the audience in while also playing
their characters broadly enough to avoid a commitment to social or political
realism. </P>

<P><I>Resurrection Man</I> is ultimately an effective genre piece which
sustains an atmosphere of dark horror in spite of the absence of the supernatural.
It is not a white-knuckle thrill-ride, nor is it a shock-filled screamfest,
but it is an absorbing, stylish look at a scary character in a genre setting
whose real-life exploits were arguably even more disturbing. (note: the
character Ginger portrayed by Ian Hart in Thaddeus O'Sullivan's <I>Nothing
Personal</I> was also based on Lenny Murphy.)</P>

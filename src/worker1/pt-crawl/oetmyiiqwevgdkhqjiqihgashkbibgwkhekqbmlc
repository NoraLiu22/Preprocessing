<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Marsala nestles on the headland which continues
to bear the town’s ancient name, <i>Lilybaeum</i> (from Lily meaning water and <i>beum</i>
referring to the Eubei, its pre-Phoenician inhabitants). The settlement is
presumed to have been founded in 397 BC by the Phoenicians who fled from Motya
following their defeat by the Syracusans. Its name in current use probably
derives from the Arabic <i>Marsah el Ali</i>, meaning port of Ali, which would
indicate that it has been a sea town of considerable importance since its early
history. Later, the harbour witnessed one of the most important events in the
history of Sicily: the landing of Garibaldi’s Thousand in Sicily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The ethnic diversity (including a large
Tunisian minority), the harbour and the city’s web of narrow streets combine to
suggest that the visitor has been inadvertently catapulted into some African
town.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Marsala becomes progressively more animated in
the period leading up to Easter: celebrations begin with a Maundy Thursday
procession (the eve of Good Friday) when the <i>Stations of the Cross</i> are
re-enacted in the streets of the town centre by local men and women in the
different roles involved in the <i>Passion</i>. In the evening, the <i>Crucifixion</i>
and <i>Resurrection</i> are also re-enacted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Early May 1860: accompanied by one thousand
volunteers dressed in red shirts, Garibaldi set sail from Quarto (near Genoa)
bound for Sicily. Their mission was to overthrow the Bourbon government and
liberate the Kingdom of the Two SiciIies. On 11 May, the two ships – the
Lombardo and the Piemonte – moored at Marsala. The <i>Mille</i> (one thousand)
made their way inland, winning their first battle at Calatafimi: this opened up
the way to Palermo. As the campaign progressed, the band was swollen by new
volunteers so that by the time they reached the Straits of Messina, their
number exceeded 20000. In less than two months, Sicily had been liberated from
Bourbon government. The expedition continued to sweep through the rest of the
kingdom until, following a plebiscite, the island was admitted on 21 October to
the nucleus of northern states<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>(Piedmont,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB

completed in the 18C and known as the <i>Loggia</i>, are located. The main
thoroughfare leading from the piazza is the Corso Xl Maggio, the old <i>Decumanus
Maximus</i> of the Roman town, lined as ever with splendid buildings.
Perpendicular to the principal axis, Via Garibaldi leads southwards to <i>Porta
Garibaldi</i> on the edge of town, running past the <i>Town Hall</i>, a former
Spanish military barracks, on the way. The area behind is brought noisily to
life each morning by a bustling fish market. The 17C <i>Chiesa del Collegio</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Cattedrale – The cathedral with its tufa front
decked with statues was built during the Norman occupation, but extensively
remodelled in the 18C. Inside, it contains a number of works by the Gaginis:
most notably a fine icon by Antonello Gagini and Berrettaro (north apse), and a
delicate <i>Madonna</i> by Domenico Gagini from 1490 (south transept). Above
this, hangs a good Renaissance painting by Antonello Riggio depicting the <i>Presentation
of the Virgin at the Temple</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Museo degli Arazzi – The entrance to this
museum housed in rooms behind the cathedral is in Via Garraffa. The collection
comprises eight large 16C Flemish tapestries relating scenes from the war waged
by Titus against the Jews. Vivid colours and a strong sense of composition
determine the central panel as well as the borders of flowers, fruit and
allegorical figures. The sixth tapestry, illustrating a violent fight, manages
to convey a great sense of movement and action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Museo Archeologico di Baglio Anselmi – This
archeological museum is accommodated inside a former wine warehouse designed by
Basile. Pride of place is given to the remains of a Punic ship (3C BC)
recovered in 1969 near the island of Motya. This probably consisted of a <i>liburna</i>,
a type of fast warship (35m long) used and lost at the end of the First Punic
War, in the Battle of the Egadi (241 BC). The detailed analysis of these fragments
have provided valuable <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>information
on the ship-building methods practised by the Phoenicians using pre-fabricated
units<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>marked with
letters. Furthermore, the metal-alloy nails used for assembling the hold have
proven to be quite remarkable: after more than 2,000 years under water, they
show no sign whatsoever of deterioration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The museum also displays important artefacts
relating to the historic evolution of Marsala and its surrounding area from
prehistoric times to the Middle Ages. Among the most interesting cases, are
those devoted to Motya and to various examples of finely crafted Hellenistic
jewellery found off Capo Boeo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Insula di Capo Boeo – At the end of Viale
Vittorio Emanuele, right on the tip of the headland, are situated the remains
of three Roman <i>insulae</i>. Almost the whole of one is taken up by a large
villa, built in imperial times (3C BC), complete with its own private set of
baths. Fragments of the mosaics floors are still in evidence, as are a number
of the small pillars (<i>suspensoria</i>) used to support the floor, thereby
enabling hot air to circulate through the cavity. The roads of access to the
area were paved with white stone from Trapani. A little further on stands the <i>Church
of San Giovanni Fuori le Mura</i>, built around the Sibyl of Lilybaeum’s
legendary grotto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nectar of Marsala<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>History – 1770: a violent storm forced a
British ship to take shelter in the harbour of Marsala. A certain merchant by
the name of John Woodhouse disembarked and went into town to sample the Marsala
wine in one of the humble taverns. Although more accustomed to the liqueur
wines of Spain and Portugal, his palate immediately detected their similarity
prompting him to risk dispatching a considerable consignment of wine (blended
wine alcohol so as to better withstand the journey) to his native land to sound
out the market. The response being positive, the merchant set up his own
company in Marsala. A little later, a second English merchant landed in town:
Ben Ingham, a great connoisseur of fortified wines. With his intervention, the
quality of the wine was gradually improved using carefully selected blends of
different, improved, grape varieties. His business passed into the hands of his
nephews the Whitakers. In 1833, the entrepreneur Vincenzo Florio, a Calabrese
by birth and Palermitano by adoption, bought up great swathes of land between
the two largest established Marsala producers and set to making his own vintage
with even more exclusive range of grape. At the end of the 19C, several more
wine growers joined the competition including Pellegrino (1880). After the turn
of the century, Florio bought out Ingham and Woodhouse, and retained the two
labels. Florio in turn succumbed to a take over by a conglomeration of other
producers; again the famous, well-established, labels continued to be made and
marketed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Marsala wine – Marsala is registered as a
D.O.C. wine (a State-designated label of controlled quality); this means that
production is restricted to an exclusive area around Trapani, and a collection
of additional vineyards in the provinces of Agrigento and Palermo. Only grape
varieties with a high natural sugar content are used to make Marsala: these,
once pressed, are left to ferment. and/or caramelise, before being blended with
ethyl alcohol to produce the different types and flavours of Marsala.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Relative to the sugar content, Marsala may be
categorised as dry, semi-dry or sweet. Its main denomination, however, is
relative to the length of time it is left to mature: Marsala <i>Fine</i> (1
year), <i>Superiore</i> (2 years), <i>Superiore Riserva</i> (4 years), <i>Vergine</i>
(5 years) and <i>Vergine Riserva</i> (10 years). Dry Marsala is usually served
as a refreshing aperitif (below 10°C) while the sweeter forms are drunk as a
dessert wine (no more than 18°C).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Florio – A tour of this long-established winery
provides the opportunity of comparing old techniques and installations with the
new. The huge wine-cellars (cantine) themselves are somewhat close and stuffy;
the environment is carefully maintained at a constant temperature of 18°C by
means of tufa walls (insulation), a tiled roof (aeration) and sand on the floor
(temperature control and humidity). Perhaps the most interesting part of the
process, however, is the explanation relating to the <i>Soleras</i> <i>Method</i>
to which the wine is conditioned by the pyramid arrangement of oak barrels.
This practice, imported from Spain, is used to age the wine: the young wine is
added at the top, this is then allowed to percolate gently down through tne
interconnected barrels as the older, matured vintage is drawn off from the
bottom tier of casks. This ensures that the wine is perfectly blended and
remains of a consistent high quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB

producers: besides <i>Marsala</i> they also make <i>Passito</i> and <i>Moscato
di Pantelleria</i>. Five wonderful Sicilian carts decorated in the 19C with
historical scenes are to be admired at the entrance. Another memento of times
past is the grille which once segregated the bottles on which custom duties
were to be levied, subject to inspection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

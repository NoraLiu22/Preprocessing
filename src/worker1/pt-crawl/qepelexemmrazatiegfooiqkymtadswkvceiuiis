But after the death of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#3">Alexander</A> the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonian</A>, when the Athenians were driven out of Samos by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/perdiccas.html#4">Perdiccas</A>, Epicurus went to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/colophon.html#1">Colophon</A> to his father.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="2">[2]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p2"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="green" NAME="e2">{2}</A> And when he had spent some time there, and collected some disciples, he again returned to Athens, in the year of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/anaxicrates.html#1">Anaxicrates</A> <FONT CLASS="green">[307/6 B.C.]</FONT>, and for some time studied philosophy, mingling with the rest of the philosophers; but subsequently, he somehow or other established the school which was called after his name; and he used to say, that he began to study philosophy when he was fourteen years of age; but <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollodorus.html#18">Apollodorus</A> the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurean</A>, in the first book of his account of the life of Epicurus, says, that he came to the study of philosophy, having conceived a great contempt for the grammarians, because they could not explain to him the statements in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hesiodus.html#1">Hesiodus</A> respecting <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos">Chaos</A> [<A CLASS="help" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+116">Theog_116-123</A>].

<P> But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hermippus.html#3">Hermippus</A> tells us, that he himself was a teacher of grammar, and that afterwards, having come across the books of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/democritus.html#1">Democritus</A>, he applied himself with zeal to philosophy, <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3">[3]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p3"> G</A> &nbsp; on which account <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/timon.html#1">Timon</A> says of him:
<BR> &nbsp; The last of all the natural philosophers,
<BR> &nbsp; And the most shameless too, did come from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samos.html#1">Samos</A>,
<BR> &nbsp; A grammar teacher, and the most ill-bred
<BR> &nbsp; And most unmanageable of mankind.

<P> And he had for his companions in his philosophical studies, his three brothers, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/neocles.html#2">Neocles</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/chaeredemus.html#1">Chaeredemus</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristobulus.html#8">Aristobulus</A>, who were excited by his exhortations, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philodemus.html#1">Philodemus</A> the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurean</A> relates in the tenth book of the Classification of Philosophers. He had also a slave, whose name was Mys, as Myronianus tells us in his Similar Historical Chapters.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e3">{3}</A> But <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diotimus_the_Stoic">Diotimus</A> the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoic</A> was very hostile to him, and calumniated him in a most bitter manner, publishing fifty obscene letters, and attributing them to Epicurus, and also giving him the credit of the letters, which generally go under the name of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/chrysippus.html#1">Chrysippus</A>. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="4">[4]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p4"> G</A> &nbsp; And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/poseidonius.html#1">Poseidonius</A> the Stoic, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicolaus.html#2">Nicolaus</A>, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sotion.html#1">Sotion</A>, in the twelfth of these books, which are entitled the Refutations of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/diocles.html#18">Diocles</A>, of which there are (?) altogether twenty-four volumes, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#26">Dionysius</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/halicarnassus.html#1">Halicarnassus</A>, have also attacked him with great severity; for they say that he used to accompany his mother when she went about the small cottages, performing purification, and that he used to read the formula, and that he used also to keep a school with his father at very low terms. Also, that he, as well as one of his brothers, was a most profligate man in his morals, and that he used to live with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leontion.html#1">Leonti&#335;n</A>, the courtesan. Moreover, that he claimed the books of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/democritus.html#1">Democritus</A> on Atoms, and that of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristippus.html#3">Aristippus</A> on Pleasure, as his own; and that he was not a legitimate citizen; and this last fact is asserted also by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/timocrates.html#3">Timocrates</A>, and by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodotus.html#2">Herodotus</A>, in his treatises on the Youth of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A>.

<P> They also say that he used to flatter <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mithras.html#1">Mithras</A>, the steward of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysimachus.html#1">Lysimachus</A>, in a disgraceful manner, calling him in his letters <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/paean.html#1">Paean</A>, and King; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="5">[5]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p5"> G</A> &nbsp; and also that he flattered <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/idomeneus.html#1">Idomeneus</A>, and Herodotus, and Timocrates who had revealed all his secret practices, and that he flattered them on this very account. And in his letter to Leonti&#335;n, he says, &quot;O lord Paean, my dear Leonti&#335;n, what transports of joy did I feel when I read your charming letter.&quot; And to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/themista.html#1">Themista</A>, the wife of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leonteus.html#1">Leonteus</A>, he writes, &quot;I am ready and prepared, if you do not come to me, to roll myself to wherever you and Themista invite me.&quot; And he addresses <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pythocles.html#2">Pythocles</A>, a beautiful youth, thus, &quot;I will sit quiet,&quot; says he, &quot;awaiting your longed-for and god-like approach.&quot; And at another time, writing to Themista, he says, &quot;That he had determined to make his way with her,&quot; as Theodorus tells us in the fourth book of his treatises against Epicurus.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="6">[6]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p6"> G</A> &nbsp; He also wrote to many other courtesans, and especially to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leontion.html#1">Leonti&#335;n</A>, with whom <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/metrodorus.html#2">Metrodorus</A> also was in love. And in his treatise on the Chief Good, he writes thus, &quot;For I do not know what I can consider good, if I put out of sight the pleasures which arise from flavours, and those which are derived from amatory pleasures, and from music and from the contemplation of beauty.&quot; And in his letter to Pythocles, he writes, &quot;Set sail, my dear boy, and avoid all sorts of education.&quot;

<P> Epictetus also attacks him as a most debauched man, and reproaches him most vehemently, and so does <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/timocrates.html#3">Timocrates</A>, the brother of Metrodorus, in his treatise entitled the Merry Guests, and this Timocrates had been a disciple in his school, though he afterwards abandoned it; and he says that he used to vomit twice a day, in consequence of his intemperance; and that he himself had great difficulty in escaping from this nocturnal philosophy, and that mystic kind of association. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7">[7]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p7"> G</A> &nbsp; He also accuses <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A> of shameful ignorance in his reasoning, and still more especially in all matters relating to the conduct of life. And says that he was in a pitiable state of health, so that he could not for many years rise up from his sofa; and that he used to spend a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina_%28unit%29">mina</A> a day on his eating, as he himself states in his letter to Leonti&#335;n, and in that to the philosophers at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mytilene.html#1">Mytilene</A>. He also says that many courtesans used to live with him and Metrodorus; and among them Marmari&#335;n, and Hedeia, and Eroti&#335;n, and Nicidi&#335;n.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e4">{4}</A> And in the thirty-seven books which he wrote about natural philosophy, they say that he says a great many things of the same kind over and over again, and that in them he writes in contradiction of other philosophers, and especially of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nausiphanes.html#1">Nausiphanes</A>, and speaks as follows, word for word: &quot;But let them be gone.  For this man had a continual labour, striving to bring forth the sophistical boastfulness of his mouth, like many other slaves.&quot; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="8">[8]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p8"> G</A> &nbsp; And Epicurus also speaks of Nausiphanes in his letters, in the following terms: &quot;These things led him on to such arrogance of mind, that he abused me and called me a schoolmaster.&quot; He used also to call him Lungs, and Blockhead, and Humbug, and Fornicator. And he used to call <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/plato.html#1">Plato</A>'s followers Flatterers of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#2">Dionysius</A>, but Plato himself he called Golden. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristotle.html#1">Aristotle</A> he called a debauchee and a glutton, saying that he joined the army after he had squandered his patrimony, and sold drugs. He used to call <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/protagoras.html#1">Protagoras</A> a porter, and the secretary of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/democritus.html#1">Democritus</A>, and to say that he taught boys their letters in the streets. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heracleitus.html#1">Heracleitus</A>, he called a disturber; Democritus, he nicknamed Lerocrates; and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antidorus.html#1">Antidorus</A>, Samidorus; the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cynics.html#1">Cynics</A> he called the enemies of Greece; and the Dialecticians he charged with being eaten up with envy. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pyrrhon.html#1">Pyrrhon</A>, he said, was ignorant and unlearned.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="9">[9]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p9"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="green" NAME="e5">{5}</A> But these men who say this are all crazy, for there are plenty of witnesses of the unsurpassable kindness of the man to everybody; both his own country which honoured him with brazen statues, and his friends who are so numerous that they could not be counted in whole cities; and all his acquaintances who were bound to him by nothing but the charms of his doctrine, none of whom ever deserted him, except <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/metrodorus.html#2">Metrodorus</A>, the son of Stratoniceus, who went over to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/carneades.html#1">Carneades</A>, probably because he was not able to bear with equanimity the unapproachable excellence of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A>. Also, the perpetual succession of his school, which, when every other school decayed, continued without any falling off, and produced a countless number of philosophers, succeeding one another without any interruption. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="10">[10]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p10"> G</A> &nbsp; We may also speak here of his gratitude towards his parents, and his kindness to his brothers, and his gentleness to his servants (as is plain from his will, and from the fact too, that they united with him in his philosophical studies, and the most eminent of them was the one whom I have mentioned already, named Mys); and his universal philanthropy towards all men.

<P> His piety towards the gods, and his affection for his country was quite unspeakable; though, from an excess of modesty, he avoided affairs of the state. And though he lived when very difficult times oppressed Greece, he still remained in his own country, only going two or three times across to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/ionia.html#1">Ionia</A> to see his friends, who used to throng to him from all quarters, and to live with him in his garden, as we are told by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollodorus.html#18">Apollodorus</A> (this garden he bought for eighty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina_%28unit%29">minae</A>).

For he said that such a doctrine as that was suited rather for those who distrusted one another; and that those who distrusted one another were not friends. But he himself in his letters, says that he is content with water and plain bread, and adds, &quot;Send me a cup, so that if I wish to have a feast, I may have the means.&quot; This was the real character of the man who laid down the doctrine that pleasure was the chief good; who <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenaeus.html#6">Athenaeus</A> thus mentions in an epigram:
<BR> &nbsp; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="12">[12]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p12"> G</A> &nbsp; O men, you labour for pernicious ends;
<BR> &nbsp; And out of eager avarice, begin
<BR> &nbsp; Quarrels and wars. And yet the wealth of nature
<BR> &nbsp; Fixes a narrow limit for desires,
<BR> &nbsp; Though empty judgment is insatiable.
<BR> &nbsp; This lesson the wise child of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/neocles.html#1">Neocles</A>
<BR> &nbsp; Had learnt by ear, instructed by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/muses.html#1">Muses</A>,
<BR> &nbsp; Or at the sacred shrine of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/delphi.html#1">Delphi</A>'s God.

<BR> And as we advance further, we shall learn this fact from his dogmas, and his maxims.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e7">{7}</A> Of all the ancient philosophers he was, as we are told by Diocles, most attached to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/anaxagoras.html#1">Anaxagoras</A> (although on some points he argued against him); and to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archelaus.html#1">Archelaus</A>, the master of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/socrates.html#1">Socrates</A>.

He also agreed with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hermarchus.html#1">Hermarchus</A> in not admitting that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leucippus.html#2">Leucippus</A> deserved to be called a philosopher; though some authors, among whom is Apollodorus, speak of him as the master of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/democritus.html#1">Democritus</A>. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demetrius.html#21">Demetrius</A> the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/magnesia.html#1">Magnesian</A> says that he was a pupil of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/x/xenocrates.html#1">Xenocrates</A> also.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e8">{8}</A> He uses plain language in his works with respect to anything he is speaking of, for which <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristophanes.html#3">Aristophanes</A>, the grammarian, blames him, on the ground of that style being vulgar. But he was such an admirer of perspicuity, that even in his treatise on Rhetoric, he aims at and recommends nothing but clearness of expression. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="14">[14]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p14"> G</A> &nbsp; And in his letters, instead of the usual civil expressions, &quot;Greeting,&quot; &quot;Farewell,&quot; and so on, he substitutes, &quot;May you act well,&quot; &quot;May you live virtuously,&quot; and expressions of that sort. Some of his biographers assert that it was he who composed the treatise entitled the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/canon.html#1">Canon</A>, in imitation of the Tripod of Nausiphanes, whose pupil they say that he was, and add that he was also a pupil of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pamphilus.html#2">Pamphilus</A>, the Platonist at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samos.html#1">Samos</A>.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e9">{9}</A> They further tell us that he began to study philosophy at twelve years of age, and that he presided over his school thirty-two years.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e18">{18}</A> And I will endeavour to give an abridgment of the doctrines contained in these works, as it may be agreeable, quoting three letters of his, in which is the epitome of all his philosophy. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="29">[29]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p29"> G</A> &nbsp; I will also give his fundamental and peculiar opinions, and any adages which he uttered which appear worthy of being selected, so that you may be thoroughly acquainted with the man, and may also judge that I understand him.

<P> Now the first letter is one that he wrote <A CLASS="help" HREF="diogenes10b.html">to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodotus.html#2">Herodotus</A></A>, on the subject of Natural Philosophy; the second is one that he wrote <A CLASS="help" HREF="diogenes10c.html">to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pythocles.html#2">Pythocles</A></A>, which is about the Heavenly Bodies; the third is addressed <A CLASS="help" HREF="diogenes10c.html#e27">to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menoeceus.html#1">Menoeceus</A></A>, in which there are discussions about how to live.

<P> We must now begin with the first, after having said a little by way of preface concerning the divisions of philosophy which he adopted.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e19">{19}</A> Now he divides philosophy into three parts. The canonical, the physical, and the ethical. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="30">[30]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p30"> G</A> &nbsp; The canonical, which serves as an introduction to knowledge, is contained in the single treatise which is called the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/canon.html#1">Canon</A>. The physical embraces the whole range of speculation on subjects of natural philosophy, and is contained in the thirty-seven books on nature, and in the letters again it is discussed in an elementary manner. The ethical contains the discussions of Choice and Avoidance; and is comprised in the books about lives, and in some of the Letters, and in the treatise of the Chief Good. Accordingly, most people are in the habit of combining the canonical divisions with the physical; and then they designate the whole under the names of the criterion of the truth, and a discussion of principles, and elements. And they say that the physical division is concerned with production, and destruction, and nature; and that the ethical division has reference to the objects of choice and avoidance, and lives, and the chief good of mankind.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e20">{20}</A> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="31">[31]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p31"> G</A> &nbsp; Dialectics they wholly reject as superfluous. For they say that the correspondence of words with things is sufficient for the natural philosopher, so as to enable him to advance with certainty in the study of nature.

<P> Now, in the Canon, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A> says that the criteria of truth are the senses, and their preconceptions, and the passions. But the Epicureans, in general, add also the perceptive impressions of the intellect. And he says the same thing in his Abridgment, which he addresses to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/herodotus.html#2">Herodotus</A>, and also in his Fundamental Principles. For, says he, the senses are devoid of reason, nor are they capable of receiving any impressions of memory. For they are not by themselves the cause of any motion, and when they have received any impression from any external cause, then they can add nothing to it, nor can they subtract anything from it. Moreover, they are out of the reach of any control; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="32">[32]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p32"> G</A> &nbsp; for one sensation cannot judge of another which resembles itself; for they have all an equal value. Nor can one judge of another which is different from itself; since their objects are not identical. In other words, one sensation cannot control another, since the effects of all of them influence us equally. Again, Reason cannot pronounce on the senses; for we have already said that all reasoning has the senses for its foundation. Reality and the evidence of sensation establish the certainty of the senses; for the impressions of sight and hearing are just as real, just as evident, as pain.

<P> It follows from these considerations that we ought to judge of things which are obscure by their analogy to those which we perceive directly. In fact, every notion proceeds from the senses, either directly, or in consequence of some analogy, or proportion, or combination. Reasoning having always a share in these last operations. The visions of insanity and of sleep have a real object for they act upon us; and that which has no reality can produce no action.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="33">[33]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p33"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="green" NAME="e21">{21}</A> By preconception, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicureans</A> meant a sort of comprehension as it were, or right opinion, or notion, or general idea which exists in us; or, in other words, the recollection of an external object often perceived beforehand. Such for instance, is the idea: &quot;Man is being of such and such nature.&quot; At the same moment that we utter the word man, we conceive the figure of a man, in virtue of a preconception which we owe to the preceding operations of the senses. Therefore, the first notion which each word awakens in us is a correct one; in fact, we could not seek for anything if we had not previously some notion of it. To enable us to affirm that what we see at a distance is a horse or an ox, we must have some preconception in our minds which makes us acquainted with the form of a horse and an ox. We could not give names to things, if we had not preliminary notion of what the things were.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e22">{22}</A> These preconceptions then furnish us with certainty. And with respect to judgments, their certainty depends on our referring them to some previous notion, of itself certain, in virtue of which we affirm such and such a judgment; for instance, &quot;How do we know whether this thing is a man?&quot;

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="34">[34]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%99#p34"> G</A> &nbsp; The Epicureans also refer to 'opinion' as supposition. And say that it is at times true, and at times false; for that, if it is supported by testimony, and not contradicted by testimony, then it is true; but if it is not supported by testimony, and is contradicted by testimony, then it is false. On which account they have introduced the expression of &quot;waiting,&quot; as if, before pronouncing that a thing seen is a tower, we must wait till we come near, and learn what it looks like when we are near it.

<P> <A CLASS="green" NAME="e23">{23}</A> They say that there are two passions, pleasure and pain, which affect everything alive. And that the one is natural, and the other foreign to our nature; with reference to which all objects of choice and avoidance are judged of. They say also, that there are two kinds of investigation; the one about facts, the other about mere words. And this is as far as an elementary sketch can go - their doctrine about division, and about the criterion.

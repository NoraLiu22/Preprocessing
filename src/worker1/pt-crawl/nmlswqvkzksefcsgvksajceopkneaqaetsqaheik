<P>D: Kevin Liddy<BR>
S: Dean Prichard, Des Cave</P>

<P>Well directed but overly familiar Irish film dealing with themes of loss,
redemption, and the effect of the (hidden/repressed) past on the present.
Famed short film director Kevin Liddy makes his feature debut as both writer
and director here, and the film does display a degree of technique which
makes it probably the best of its type since <I>December Bride</I>. Yet
audiences will most likely be overcome with a feeling of <I>deja vu</I>
from the opening scenes, because despite some moments which are reminiscent
of <I><A HREF="doh.htm">Days of Heaven</A></I>, this is an old, old story
told more or less in the old old way. The plot concerns the slow decay of
a motherless rural Irish family in the early 1970s which seems to be halted
by the arrival of their estranged aunt. Though her presence momentarily
brings light to the eyes both of the ex-alcoholic father and the younger
son (Dean Prichard), many sub-plots are afoot which threaten to bring the
shadows of the past into sharp focus, not least of all the doomed romance
of the elder son, whose girlfriend comes from a family who has always hated
his.... you know the drill.</P>

<P>To be fair, Liddy's script is quite adult. It is sparing in its use of
dialogue and this gives him greater freedom as a director to use images
to tell the story than is usual in contemporary Irish film. He lets his
camera carry the weight of the drama with careful composition and juxtaposition
which brings out the various conflicts and crises and establishes the links
between them. It doesn't condescend to its audience and is built around
small revealing moments rather than reams of expositional, stage-bound exchanges
between characters. Unfortunately the story is still a familiar one, and
though the photography is sometimes breathtaking, it takes only one long,
slow crane shot of the barley fields to make all the points that can be
made about the relationship between these characters and their land and
one shot of the boy's red kite flying free against the clear blue sky to
clue us in to its symbolism. Similarly the change of lighting and set decoration
in the house to indicate psychological and emotional change is all very
well done, but it doesn't really add much richness on a deeper level because
nothing is being said that was not obvious from the outset. </P>

<P>As the story wends its way towards the inevitable climactic showdown
between groups of secondary characters (including an extended family of
travellers), the predictable descent into misery is not so much tragic as
dull. Despite Niall Byrne's soughing string-based score, there isn't a lot
of emotional heft because it simply cannot grip you unless you've really
never seen anything like it before, and if you're an Irish film viewer,
you have. A slightly tacked-on coda suggests perhaps that this has all been
a learning experience for the youngster, but if so, then his learning experience
has been that life is full of misery and pain and the best you can hope
for is that if you keep yourself to yourself that your pain will only destroy
your own soul. Do we need to hear this again? The final frozen image of
the boy may or may not be a cinematic reference to <I>The 400 Blows</I>,
but this is not a comparable achievement as a portrait of society, youth,
or as a work of cinematic storytelling.</P>

<P>In a world of <I><A HREF="cheat.htm">How to Cheat in the Leaving Certificate</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="flick.htm">Flick</A></I>, <I><A HREF="bb.htm">The Butcher Boy</A></I>,
and <I><A HREF="nora.htm">Nora</A></I>, it may be time to lay this particular
type of story to rest. It is not that the themes are not valid, nor that
it fails to put across a message which is arguably more important than ever
in the era of the Celtic Tiger. It is not that <I>Country</I> is a bad film;
far from it: it is a beautifully crafted movie, it has something to say,
and it says this clearly. But it adds nothing to the viewing menu of contemporary
Irish cinema and is therefore just not of enough interest to be worth recommending
unless you have a particular predisposition to its point of view. As a debut
feature from an Irish director it is worth a look, but it is not likely
to inspire the next generation.</P>

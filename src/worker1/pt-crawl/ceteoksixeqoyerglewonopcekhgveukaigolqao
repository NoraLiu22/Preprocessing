                <p style="text-align: left"><font size="3">I&#39;ll begin by letting 
                the reader know where I stand: after reading <i>Mind of the 
                Market </i>(MOM), I trust Michael Shermer on economics as much 
                as I trust Jenny McCarthy on autism. Certainly, Shermer is more 
                entertaining and erudite than McCarthy, but he&#39;s no more 
                credentialed or convincing in economics than she is in medicine. 
                When he gave his talk on the work that would be MOM<i> </i>at 
                TAM 5, I told him that I looked forward to reading the new book. 
                I wasn&#39;t trying to flatter the master. I know a little about 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_sense_theory">the 
                moral sense school</a> and the relationship between
                <a href="http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/y64l01.html">
                Adam Smith</a> (one of Shermer&#39;s heroes) and
                <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/">David 
                Hume </a>(one of my heroes). The talk indicated that he would 
                explore the history of the philosophy that holds that morals 
                issue from natural sentiments or feelings. I expected a 
                discussion of <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/shaftes.htm">Shaftesbury</a> and
                <a href="http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/hutches.htm">
                Hutcheson</a>, and a detailed account of how these 18th century 
                philosophers are the intellectual forefathers of those 
                evolutionary psychologists who find the roots of moral codes and 
                behavior in our biological nature, which is benevolent 
                (altruistic) as well as selfish. And, of course, I expected him 
                to show the connection between the moral sense philosophers and 
                free market economies. Instead, I got a whirlwind ride through a 
                thicket of evolutionary psychology studies and illogical leap 
                after illogical leap to defend libertarianism.
                <a href="http://skepticblog.org/2008/12/09/regulation-schmegulation/">
                Recent events, namely the worldwide collapse of capitalist 
                economies, have inspired Shermer to dig in deeper.</a></font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Oddly, atheist Shermer begins  his hymn of praise to free 
    market capitalism with a parable from the New Testament. He even refers to 
    Jesus as &quot;the messiah.&quot; Matthew 25:14-29 is the story of a master who gives 
    different amounts of money to several of his servants to hold for him while 
    he goes on a trip. Two of them invest the money and double their funds. The 
    servant given the smallest amount of money buries it. They all give their 
    money back to the master, who then gives the money that was buried to the one 
    he&#39;d given the most money to, saying: &quot;For to everyone who has, more shall 
    be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who does not have, 
    even what he does have shall be taken away.&quot; (Shermer mistakenly says that 
    the messiah utters this piece of gibberish, when it is the master in the 
    parable who says it.)</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Shermer interprets the parable to mean that &quot;properly 
    investing one&#39;s money ... generates even more wealth.&quot; The master says to 
    the one who buried the money: &quot;you should have put my money on deposit with 
    the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with 
    interest.&quot; Personally, I think the story probably has another message, one 
    related to the stories it&#39;s sandwiched between (the parable of the ten 
    virgins and the story of the sheep and the goats). But even if the message 
    is mainly about banking and not about the kingdom of heaven or something 
    along those lines, I find it to be another in a long line of inane Biblical 
    stories. Most servants who invest money given to them by their masters lose 
    their investments. Jesus, were he who Christians think 
    he is, would know this. Workers who invest their own 401k monies do 
    significantly worse than those who have their retirement money invested for 
    them by their masters. We don&#39;t know what the master in Matthew&#39;s parable 
    would have done had the miser put his money in the bank. He wouldn&#39;t have 
    doubled his money by today&#39;s rates, that&#39;s for sure. Would he have been 
    chided for not taking a greater risk instead of being thrown out and called 
    worthless? Why isn&#39;t this master interested in what kind of investment his 
    servants made? Doesn&#39;t he care if they invested ethically? Is the money all 
    he cares about? By today&#39;s standards, the risk takers would have to have 
    lost all the money entrusted to them to deserve their performance and 
    incentive bonuses.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">This parable might be seen as justification for eliminating 
    the capital gains tax and the tax on interest or dividends. Only people who 
    hold on to their money should pay taxes. In fact, they should pay more in 
    tax than they possess, according to the parable. Does that make sense? No, 
    not to me either.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Anyway, Shermer goes on to his own point about the &quot;mind of 
    the market.&quot; The servant who got the money entrusted to the risk-aversive 
    servant got more than he deserved. The master&#39;s reward was irrational. So is 
    the mind of the market. (Or, you could just as easily say, <i>so is the 
    market</i> and skip the pointless mind metaphor.) Two of Shermer&#39;s favorite topics, game theory and 
    evolutionary psychology, will be connected to this parable and to almost 
    everything else he has to say about the market. These connections may 
    be enlightening to some, but they just darken the skies for me. </font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">The parable of the irrational master begins the prologue to 
    the book. Also in the prologue is Shermer&#39;s announcement that he is 
    advocating a kinder, gentler form of social Darwinism than that of Spencer 
    and those who applied what they understood as Darwinism to social theory in 
    order to justify such things as &quot;enforced sterilization of the mentally 
    retarded in America, and to the Nazi eugenics program that gave rise to the 
    Holocaust.&quot; In short, the prologue seems to say that Shermer is going to 
    attempt to defend a form of social Darwinism that sees human beings as 
    primarily irrational animals driven more by emotions that evolved over 
    hundreds of thousands of years  than by reason, which has evolved over 
    a much shorter period. At least he recognizes that he&#39;s a social Darwinist.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">The last third of the prologue is personal history and is for those 
    who might be interested in how Shermer got started as a defender of free 
    market capitalism. His personal history is, of course, irrelevant to 
    supporting the new social Darwinism.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">For those who read Shermer because of his history as the 
    publisher of <i>Skeptic</i> magazine and author of such books as <i>Why 
    People Believe Weird Things</i>, this book on evolutionary economics may 
    prove less than satisfying. This is Shermer the libertarian, not Shermer the 
    skeptic. About the only relic of his skepticism to be found in MOM is the reassurance that we don&#39;t need religion to support our ethics.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">In chapter one, Shermer claims that &quot;free markets are the only 
    way to find out what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing 
    to accept.&quot; Free markets might be the best way or the most moral way to find 
    out what buyers are willing to pay and sellers willing to accept, but they 
    are not the only way. What price people will pay or accept for goods or 
    services depends on the circumstances. No economic exchange occurs in a 
    vacuum, as every funeral director knows. Desperate times, times of war, riot, 
    civil unrest, and the like are another way to find out what people are 
    willing to pay or accept for goods. Shooting and killing a union member in front of mine 
    workers on strike is another way.&nbsp; Shermer writes as if the only alternatives 
    are a free economy or a planned economy (and perhaps a mixed economy). As 
    one reviewer puts it: if the choice is capitalism or the Khmer Rouge, I&#39;ll 
    take capitalism. But 
    this is misleading. I would call the U.S. economy a free economy, but there 
    is no such thing as a totally free economy. We&#39;re not a communist or 
    socialist economy, but government regulates a lot of things regarding the 
    economy. How free the economy is or should be is debatable, but the bottom 
    line is that a totally free economy could only work if people were generally 
    rational, self-interested, extremely knowledgeable as to what is in their 
    own interest, and moral (i.e., didn&#39;t cheat or lie or steal, etc.). People 
    are often irrational, don&#39;t often know what is truly in their own interest 
    (and even when they do, they don&#39;t always act accordingly), and there are too 
    many liars and cheats among us to try to get along solely on the honor system. 
    Smith&#39;s notion, that he shared with other moral sense theorists, that by 
    pursuing selfish ends we unintentionally promote the common good (&quot;as if 
    guided by an invisible hand&quot;), seems to have been falsified many times by 
    history. We need laws and regulations for our free economy. 
    The debate is not whether to have a free economy or not, but where to 
    regulate and how. Some of those laws and regulations are probably driven by 
    our innate sense of fairness, but what is fair in the modern world is 
    something we must use our rational powers to figure out.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Shermer claims that &quot;markets are moral, and modern economies 
    are founded on our virtuous nature.&quot; I would claim that markets are neither 
    moral nor immoral, but regulating them is based on what Shermer calls &quot;our 
    virtuous nature,&quot; i.e., our emotional aversion to unfairness, cheaters, 
    liars, and the like. Despite the rhetoric about moral markets, Shermer 
    admits that &quot;we need checks and balances and a society based on the 
    rule of law within which markets can be both free and fair.&quot; He seems to 
    recognize that, if left to its own devices, markets would be neither free 
    nor fair. The difficult issue is, of course, where do we insert these checks 
    and balances? Shermer doesn&#39;t tell us.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Shermer maintains that there is no rational justification for 
    our disdain of such things as excessive wealth, usury, and the &quot;invisible 
    hand&quot; of the market. In my view, most people don&#39;t disdain excessive 
    wealth, as long as it was derived fairly and honestly, and especially if it 
    is deserved and is not absurdly disproportionate to what one has done to 
    earn it. Resentment at huge bonuses being paid to CEOs who ran companies 
    that failed, causing the loss of many jobs and retirement funds, was not 
    based simply on the excessive amounts of money involved. The bonuses weren&#39;t 
    deserved. They were illogical. If a company fails while you are running the 
    show, our basic sense of fairness tells us that you should not be rewarded. 
    Likewise, our basic sense of fairness tells us when we&#39;re being gouged. It 
    should also tell us when things are too good to be true, but we all know how 
    easy it is to rationalize that our man is a genius when he&#39;s producing 18% 
    profit while everybody else is losing money.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Shermer thinks Darwin&#39;s theory of natural 
    selection is rejected by many people for the same kind of irrational reasons 
    Adam Smith&#39;s theory of <i>laissez-faire</i> economics is rejected. The 
    problem with this comparison is that Darwin&#39;s theory concerns biological 
    development, while Smith&#39;s concerns social development, and hence also moral 
    and political development. When considering Darwin&#39;s theory we do not have 
    to concern ourselves with our personal preferences or value systems. The 
    facts are what they are and our value judgments regarding them are 
    irrelevant to their truth or accuracy. When considering an economic theory, 
    we have to concern ourselves with our personal values and preferences, the 
    nature of the unequal distribution of talents, natural resources, geological 
    and geographical factors, and a thousand other things that impact human 
    decision making and choices. Furthermore, the complexity of the modern world makes  one 
    appear backward when one appeals to Adam 
    Smith&#39;s theory, as brilliant as it may have been for its time, as a 
    basis for today&#39;s economics. When one compares the world Smith lived in to 
    the one we live in today, the idea of an invisible hand guiding us by our 
    innate moral sensibilities is laughable. I don&#39;t deny that we have natural 
    feelings and emotions that help most of us recognize most of the time when 
    somebody&#39;s doing something unfair. But those feelings don&#39;t guide markets to 
    be moral by driving businessmen and corporations to be moral; they drive 
    citizens to devise checks and balances so that the market doesn&#39;t become the 
    playground of the rich and famous who justify exploiting the rest of us by 
    appealing to the general benefit that comes to the greatest number by having 
    no regulations or restrictions on what businesses may do.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">As Shermer points out, often the selfish and greedy figure 
    out that they can gain more wealth by controlling those who make the laws 
    and regulations. (See his brief discussion of government subsidies on page 
    20.) Even so, he still considers it irrational to believe that a healthy 
    economy &quot;must be <i>heavily</i> regulated from the top down.&quot; Everything 
    hinges on this word &#39;heavily.&#39; It is clearly not irrational to believe that 
    a healthy economy in the world we live in today in the U.S.A. must be 
    regulated to some extent from the top down. We can&#39;t just let corporate 
    America have free reign over the economy. No matter how moral Shermer might 
    think the average CEO or corporate manager is, if everything becomes deregulated, the likelihood 
    that we&#39;ll have peace and justice on Earth is nil. In any case, if humans are as 
    inherently moral as Shermer thinks we are, <i>any</i> kind of economy should 
    produce a lot of happiness and well-being. Yes, our economy is the result of 
    an evolved complex system. But the analogy with biological systems breaks 
    down when one considers that some of our economy was designed from the top 
    down when our Constitution was ratified. More top-down design came over the 
    past two hundred years in the form of many laws, regulations, and court 
    decisions. Our market economy is not just the result of the evolution of 
    a complex adaptive system. Unlike ecosystems, which Shermer compares an 
    economy to, economies involve conscious decisions, some rational and some 
    irrational (some socially beneficial, some harmful), which have had consequences not all of which have been 
    beneficial to the majority of our citizens.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Shermer&#39;s last book.<i> The Science of Good and Evil, </i>
    attempted to reduce ethics to a science. His latest book continues in the 
    same vein, except that he applies what he considers to be the insights of 
    evolutionary psychology to the field of economics. The result is a 
    simplistic view of both morality and economics.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">How simplistic? In 
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRFkfHREiw">addressing the Cato Institute</a>, he stated 
    that he didn&#39;t quite get why there was such a fuss about immigration. When 
    he needs workers to clear brush, he drives to the local Home Depot where 
    Mexicans looking for work are standing about. He hires who he needs. If too 
    many people come across the border there won&#39;t be work for them and they&#39;ll 
    stop coming. That&#39;s how a free market works. You don&#39;t need walls or laws. 
    The market will find its own level.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font size="3">Only someone with a fantasy view of the free market and who&#39;s 
    never had to hang out in a parking lot, hoping for a job that will pay a few 
    dollars, could talk so flippantly about human beings. Shermer really 
    believes that we would have paradise on Earth if only we had free trade. 
    Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m all for free trade, but not at any expense. Unlike Shermer and his libertarian friends at the Cato Institute, I understand that 
    not all liberals are socialists. In any case, human beings are not just 
    market agents to be exploited by those who happen to have been born into 
    wealthy, advanced communities and who have opportunities and innate talents. 
    He&#39;s a big fan of Jared Diamond<font face="Arial">â</font>and well he should 
    be<font face="Arial">âso he knows that not all societies are created equal 
    and not all failures to achieve a high standard of living for the majority 
    of its people are due to lack of free trade. Some societies don&#39;t have much 
    to trade. Why is it fair to exploit their cheap labor force so that the 
    members of another society can buy goods cheaply and live a comfortable 
    life?</font></font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Shermer is good at finding examples to 
    illustrate his points, but examples aren&#39;t strong evidence when they are 
    selective and systematically ignore the counterexamples. So there are chimps 
    and monkeys and college students who have an innate sense of when some 
    distribution of goods is unfair. Shermer seems to think that that&#39;s 
    sufficient evidence to build an ethical system around. He also thinks that 
    when societies got too big to allow informal recognition of moral rules and 
    settlement of disputes, religion and government stepped in to formalize 
    matters. I&#39;d like to see the evidence for this. This myth is on par with the 
    myth of the state of nature where those who have nothing agree to respect 
    private property in exchange for equal protection of the law.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Both governments and religions create rules to 
    express and maintain their power, whatever other rationale might exist for 
    those two institutions. Moral rules might be enforced by governments (e.g., 
    our marriage, drug, prostitution, and gambling laws) or by religions, but 
    moral rules are independent of both. How moral rules work in various 
    societies is a scientific question. Whether any moral rule obligates is a 
    philosophical question and can only be resolved by concepts, not empirical 
    investigation. Unfortunately, many people, ignorant of the history of 
    philosophy, find conceptual analysis boring and unenlightening. They not 
    only don&#39;t see its necessity, they consider it superfluous. </font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Ethics isn&#39;t limited to deciding fairness in 
    market decisions and behavior. Furthermore, an ethics based on sentiment 
    might be useful for monkeys or chimps or even college students, but it just 
    won&#39;t do for life in a complex industrial society. To claim that those who don&#39;t 
    share the moral sentiments of your class are sociopaths is 
    intolerable, philosophically speaking. He told the Cato folks that he didn&#39;t 
    believe in that stuff about not being able to derive an ought from an is. He 
    gave no argument because he has no argument. It is not logically possible to 
    validly infer a statement of obligation from statements of fact. There&#39;s a 
    reason chimps did not develop ethical beliefs. It has to do with reason, not 
    emotions or feelings. Only rational creatures can develop morals because 
    morals requires an understanding of concepts like <i>duty, obligation, 
    rights, right, wrong, good, </i>and<i> evil. </i>It seems to be a common 
    misconception of those in the social sciences to characterize ethics as 
    rationalizations dreamed up after feelings drive us to find support for our 
    instincts. Even if Aristotle, Mill, or Kant were motivated to develop their 
    ethical systems because they were unconsciously trying to rationalize their 
    instinctive beliefs, their ethical systems stand or fall by their arguments. 
    Their motives are irrelevant to whether we should accept their ethical 
    systems.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Shermer likes to quote Katherine Hepburn in &quot;The 
    African Queen&quot;: &quot;Nature is what we were put on earth to rise above.&quot; Why 
    should we rise above our nature? Why should we go against our instincts? To 
    say that it is mutually beneficial for us to do so may be a fact, but it 
    doesn&#39;t make it morally obligatory. Why are we morally obligated to act in mutually 
    beneficial ways? No set of facts will ever demonstrate that anyone ought to 
    act in ways that are mutually beneficial. To claim that acting in mutually 
    beneficial ways will lead to the greatest happiness for the greatest number 
    is to beg the question. What moral obligation is there to seek happiness, for 
    oneself or for all mankind? It may 
    be a fact that each of us seeks his or her own happiness, but to say we&#39;re 
    morally obligated to seek our own happiness does not follow from that fact. If you 
    want to claim as an absolute value that we should seek to maximize 
    happiness, then claim it as a principle, but don&#39;t pretend it in any way is 
    derived from primitive instincts or feelings that we may or may not share 
    with baboons and Capuchin monkeys.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">A moral obligation is a <i>duty</i>; it is 
    something one <i>ought</i> to do or forbear. To say you have a moral duty 
    not to steal is to say that you ought not steal. This duty must be based on 
    some principle. To claim that one ought not steal because there is an innate 
    feeling of shame that comes with stealing is a <i>
    <a href="http://skepdic.com/nonsequitur.html">non sequitur</a></i>. 
    There may be such a feeling, but it does not follow logically from that fact 
    that one ought not steal. You might say that if you don&#39;t want 
    to feel shame, don&#39;t steal. But that is not the same as saying you have a 
    moral obligation not to steal. You might say that you must obey God&#39;s will 
    and God&#39;s will is that you not steal. This is called the divine command 
    theory of moral obligation. It is meaningless to those of us who do not 
    believe there is such a being as a god. You might say with John Stuart Mill that you should always 
    do what will bring about the greatest happiness to the greatest number. You 
    might then claim that you have a moral duty not to steal because not 
    stealing leads to the greatest good to the greatest number. But, if you do 
    not accept the greatest happiness principle, then you will not accept that 
    your duty not to steal derives from it. You might believe with Kant that you should do 
    only what you could will anyone in the same situation to also do. You 
    then might conclude that you ought not steal because you could never will 
    that others in your situation steal. But, if you don&#39;t accept the principle 
    that you ought do only what you can will everyone to do in the same 
    situation, then you will not accept that your duty not to steal derives from 
    that principle. In any case, you can never logically derive a <i>duty</i> 
    not to steal from a <i>feeling</i> 
    that you ought not to steal. If that were the case, then anything you feel like 
    doing or not doing would be morally justified, which is absurd. </font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Those innate feelings that lead us to believe 
    that others have acted unfairly have very little to do with what is morally 
    right or wrong. A child who is given a box of candy for her birthday is not 
    obligated to share with her sister any more than a wealthy executive is 
    obligated to share his wealth with the homeless man he meets on the street, even 
    if that person be his own father. The sister might feel outraged at the 
    injustice of the birthday girl hogging all the candy and the father might be 
    outraged at the lack of gratitude or caring in his son, but those feelings 
    have nothing to do with whether there is a moral obligation to share one&#39;s 
    property with others.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">As much as Shermer likes the bottom-up metaphor 
    of evolution, it won&#39;t work for ethics. Does it work for economics? He 
    certainly thinks so and makes a very strong case that an economy that 
    evolves is much better than one that is planned (like communism). But it 
    seems illogical to maintain that since morals evolved along with capitalism, 
    therefore capitalism is essentially moral. The bad guys of capitalism are perverts 
    or sociopaths in his view, and the average capitalist is essentially a moral person with 
    a strong sense of fairness, right, wrong, justice, decency, etc. Shermer must 
    read different newspapers than I do. Bribery, using insider 
    information, cheating whenever possible, underbidding knowing you&#39;ll be able 
    to get whatever you want when the client has sunk enough money into a 
    project, and a host of other unethical behaviors seem to be as much the norm as 
    honest dealing. Granted, most people must be mostly moral most of the time 
    or society would collapse. Still, that leaves an awful lot of room for bad 
    behavior.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Shermer has many examples of swell capitalists 
    doing swell things, but he can&#39;t just call the cheaters sociopaths and think 
    he&#39;s really made his case for capitalism being essentially moral. The simple 
    fact is that just because we evolved with a moral sense it doesn&#39;t follow 
    either that we are obligated or that we will believe we are obligated to 
    behave in ways that don&#39;t harm others. To say that it is to our mutual 
    advantage not to harm each other adds nothing to the issue of morals. The 
    moral issue concerns what obligates, if anything, behavior. It might be 
    prudent to avoid harming others unless harmed, but that doesn&#39;t make it 
    obligatory.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Shermer says his book is &quot;an exercise in 
    consciousness-raising for freedom.&quot; It is, but freedom as a value did not 
    emerge from our evolutionary history as part of our nature. Of course it 
    evolved in the sense that all our values have evolved, but to put forth 
    freedom as obligatory rather than as simply a necessary condition for this 
    or that desired end is not something any science can establish. In any case, 
    the fact is that even where there are free markets there is misery. Free 
    markets can&#39;t solve all our problems, and while once upon a time we might 
    have expected charity and good will to deal with the problems that free 
    markets can&#39;t resolve, that is no longer the case. Charity and good will are 
    not going to treat our mentally ill, our brain-damaged, our physically 
    disabled, our feeble elderly population, our unwanted children, our jobless, 
    or the thousands of maimed and brutalized veterans of our wars. </font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Shermer might as well call his book an exercise 
    in consciousness-raising for <i>luck</i>. Not everyone is born in a war-free 
    society with fine parents 
    who provide comforts and wise counsel for their children. Not everyone&#39;s 
    talents can be utilized and rewarded at every moment in an economy&#39;s 
    history. The thousands who are unemployed or underemployed, and unable to 
    meet their mortgage payments, are losing their homes partly due to bad luck, 
    partly due to ignorance, and partly due to greedy bankers. The bankers and 
    the borrowers had plenty of freedom and acted in a mostly unregulated or unpoliced free market. </font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Shermer has written eloquently about our dual 
    disposition to good and evil, so why does he trumpet only the good of 
    capitalism and write off the evil to sociopathy?  He says that &quot;at our core we are moral beings 
    with a deep and intuitive sense about what is right and wrong, and that most 
    of the time most people in most circumstances choose to do the right thing.&quot; 
    So, he says, we ought to maximize freedom and &quot;back restrictions on freedom 
    only where absolutely necessary and with great reluctance.&quot; It must be nice 
    to have such a positive view of your fellow man, but I can&#39;t help but 
    envision drug addicts and career criminals in Los Angeles, Muslim 
    terrorists, or the ethnic cleansers in Kenya or the Sudan reading such 
    Pollyannaish pipe dreams. Everything Shermer says about the wonderful nature 
    and benefits of capitalism depends on the geological, geographical, and 
    political conditions under which it evolves and is maintained. Yes, people 
    are generally moral when they can afford to be. So? What about all those 
    places where sadistic thugs dominate? Does Shermer really believe that the 
    only thing that distinguishes barbarism from civility is the absence of a 
    free market?</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">In the end, Shermer is a libertarian 
    conservative who sees liberals as tax-and-spend bogeymen and closet socialists. 
    He sees his fellow libertarian conservatives as obliged to help the poor. It is true, apparently, that conservative religious 
    folks give significantly more to charity than liberal non-religious folks as 
    long as you include their contributions to &quot;charities&quot; that do nothing but 
    promote religion and don&#39;t consider the gift non-religious folks give them 
    by granting tax-exempt status. 
    But I wouldn&#39;t want to construct my political philosophy on this &quot;fact&quot; any 
    more than I would want to build it on facts about monkeys or chimps or our 
    pre-human ancestors. It may be cheaper (take fewer of our tax dollars) to 
    give vouchers to parents so they can send their kids to Bible schools, but I 
    think it&#39;s better that the government provide a secular education for its 
    citizens where they can learn proper science and leave the mythology to 
    their parents.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">Shermer writes in detail and favorably about the work of
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Zimbardo">Philip Zimbardo</a>, so he should recognize that character depends on 
    circumstance. A free market will have all these Google-types (whose motto is 
    &quot;do no evil&quot; and is Shermer&#39;s model for 
    good capitalism) under the right circumstances. Put Google in China and what 
    do they do? They cooperate with the government and suddenly privacy is not 
    so inviolable. Anyway, should we think that the folks at 
    Google do no evil just because that&#39;s their motto? Some circumstances we can control and some we can&#39;t.  </font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">I like my capitalism as much as 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_the_Plumber">Joe the Plumber</a> 
    does, 
    but I can&#39;t deceive myself into thinking that he needs only freedom 
    to thrive and that my best chance for having him leave me alone to 
    determine my own life hinges on his living in a society where government 
    doesn&#39;t restrict his economic activity.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">I think in the end Shermer doesn&#39;t really 
    believe what he says about the goodness of human beings and the essentially 
    moral nature of capitalism. It is not difficult to read between the lines 
    that he favors what he calls &quot;paternalistic libertarianism.&quot; He knows there 
    must be restrictions put on human freedom because people are likely to use 
    that freedom to make the wrong choices for themselves, their communities, 
    their nations, and the world. What is needed, he implies, is guidance from libertarians 
    like himself, Penn, and Teller, or a community of libertarian &quot;experts&quot;, to lead us to 
    nirvana. To which I am compelled to say: <i>No thanks</i>.</font></p>
            <p> 
    <font face="Arial" size="3">I used to think Shermer would be the next Carl 
    Sagan, a scientist who would be the foremost public spokesman for 
    rationality and critical thinking in the effort to combat superstition and 
    pseudoscience. His last two books have proved me wrong. He has been blinded 
    by his libertarianism and seduced 
    by the allure of evolutionary psychology to explain everything, including 
    ethics and economics. I think he made a wrong turn and is more likely on the 
    road to perdition than to nirvana. </font></p>

            work for less than subsistence wages, they can&#39;t purchase the goods 
            being sold....The epilogue of Shermer&#39;s book betrays earlier pages 
            showing the effect of environment on an individual&#39;s psychological 
            disposition. Shermer leads us to deduce that the masses will fare 
            terrifically in a totally free market because we are all predisposed 
            to make decisions that benefit each other. However, both wealth and 
            poverty are affected more by luck of birth than by what choices we 
            make. Sure, we choose how to respond to our circumstances, but the 
            choices available to an heiress like Paris Hilton are quite 
            different from the choices available to the homeless man who sells 
            me Street Sense newspaper twice a month.&quot;)</font></p>

            For Sale: Big Ideas About Humanity By Tyler Cowen, professor of 
            economics at George Mason University</a> (&quot;If the options are 
            capitalism and the Khmer Rouge, no doubt capitalism wins hands 
            down...[T]o what extent is it morally permissible to interfere with 
            freedom, or can we even use freedom as a concept in a world where we 
            do social science by hooking people up to brain scanners?... Shermer 
            either needs to dismiss moral philosophy as an illusion and a mere 
            byproduct of human evolution, and thus display skepticism, or he 
            needs to grant it credence and take his own moral stance. 
            Descriptive science doesn&#39;t tell us whether it is fair to allow 
            kidneys to be bought and sold, even if it helps explain why some 
            people find the practice repugnant. Judgments of right and wrong 
            cannot be avoided, and thus we tread away from the realm of familiar 
            natural science. &quot;)</font></p>

            Shermer&#39;s The Mind of The Market by Timothy Sandefur</a> (&quot;I really 
            should have loved Michael Shermerâs <i>The Mind of The Market</i> 
            because I am not only a libertarian but also fascinated by evolution 
            and its scientific, economic, and philosophical implications. 
            Moreover, I believe sociobiology can provide extremely important 
            insights that offer a grounding for political philosophy on a 
            genuine, objective human nature. And yet I found the book 
            disappointing and even unconvincing. It is chock full of the hasty 
            generalizations and oversimplifications that have led so many people 
            to keep sociobiology at armâs length. A good science-based defense 
            of libertarianism will have to be much more rigorous than this.&quot;)</font></p>

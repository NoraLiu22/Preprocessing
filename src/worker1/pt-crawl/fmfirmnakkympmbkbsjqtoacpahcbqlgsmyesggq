<H2> DECREES IN HONOUR OF DAMOPHON OF MESSENE</H2><BR>

<I>Greek text:</I> &nbsp; SEG 41.128 , SEG 49.423 , SEG 51.466 ( <A HREF="http://pom.bbaw.de/ig/IG%20IX%201²,%204,%201475">IG 9.1.4.1475</A> ) , SEG 54.452
<BR><I>Provenance:</I> &nbsp; <A TITLE="Pleiades" HREF="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/570479">Messene</A> , Pelopponnese
<BR><I>Date:</I> &nbsp; first half of 2nd century B.C.
<BR><I>Format:</I> &nbsp; see <A HREF="../../info/translate_key.html">key to translations</A>

<P> <I>These decrees were inscribed on a pillar, set up in front of a <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroon">hero&ouml;n</A> in Messene; see P.Themelis, in &quot;Personal Styles in Greek Sculpture&quot;, pp.154-185 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=7qSsh7agZxEC&pg=PA154">Google Books</A> ). &nbsp; In all, seven decrees have survived; as well as the ones translated here, there were decrees of Kranion in Kephallenia ( SEG 51.467 = <A HREF="http://pom.bbaw.de/ig/IG%20IX%201²,%204,%201583">IG 9.1.4.1583</A> ), Melos ( SEG 67.189 -  <A HREF="https://www.academia.edu/33601342/P.Themelis_2017_%CE%9F_%CE%94%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%86%CF%8E%CE%BD_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7_%CE%9C%CE%AE%CE%BB%CE%BF.pdf">academia.edu</A> ), and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerenia">Gerenia</A> in Messenia ( unpublished ).</I>

<P> <I>The decrees give us an unprecedented insight into the career of a Hellenistic sculptor; for some comments, see M.Melfi, &quot;Damophon of Messene in the Ionian coast of Greece&quot; ( <A HREF="https://www.academia.edu/25362725/Damophon_of_Messene_in_the_Ionian_coast_of_Greece_Making_re-making_and_updating_cult_statues_in_the_second_century_BC_in_Hellenistic_Sanctuaries_OUP2016_">academia.edu</A> ). Despite all the evidence, there is still some disagreement about the dates of Damophon's statues.</I>

<P> <I>The sculptures of Damophon in the temple at Lykosoura ( decree <B>A</B> ) were seen by Pausanias ( <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.37">8.37</A> ), and many parts of them have been discovered by archaeologists ( <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycosura#Cult_sculptural_group">wikipedia</A> ). &nbsp; The phrase 'the great and the many' in the decree of Oiantheia ( <B>D</B> ) seems to be unique amongst all Greek inscriptions, and is assumed to be equivalent to 'the aristocracy and the people'; see P.Themelis, &quot;Damophon in Oiantheia&quot; ( <A HREF="https://www.academia.edu/6690143/P.Themelis_Damophon_in_Oiantheia">academia.edu</A> - in modern Greek ).</I>

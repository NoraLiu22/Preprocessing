<P align=left><BR>Often considered by many historians as England's greatest 
monarch, Queen Elizabeth I ruled during an age that saw the expansion of the 
Britain (England and Wales with parts of Ireland, and united with Scotland upon 
her death) to North America through voyages of discovery by men such as Sir 
Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh. It witnessed the accomplishments of&nbsp; 
playwrights such as William Shakespeare and would change history by defeating&nbsp; 
the Spanish Armada. Although her reign saw many accomplishments that would soon make Great Britain 
one of the leading economic and military powers in the world, it was also 
made up of plots and assassinations that were intended for or falsely accused 
the queen and controversies, such as her claims of being a virgin&nbsp;and the 
amount of influence that her privy council had over 
her.</P>
<P align=left>Elizabeth's birth dramatically altered the course of English
history.&nbsp; Although King Henry VIII of the Tudor dynasty had an illegitimate
son, he needed an heir from a queen to properly continue the dynasty.&nbsp; His
first child to survive was, <a href="marytudor.html">Mary</a>, born to <a href="cathyaragon.html"> Catherine of
Aragon</a>, Henry's first wife. After it was clear that Catherine could give
him no more children, he ended his marriage, which provoked the English
Reformation.&nbsp; Henry married the already pregnant <a href="anneboleyn.html"> Anne
Boleyn</a>, who gave birth to Elizabeth on 
September 7, 1533.&nbsp; At the age of two 
she became motherless as the accusations of adultery, which were drummed up by 
Henry, sent her mother to the guillotine.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had 
a younger brother, Edward by Henry's third wife, Jane 
Seymour, and who would follow his father as king.&nbsp; With two older siblings,
no one at the time expected Elizabeth to matter much.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>Still, being the daughter of a king, Elizabeth had educational opportunities that were 
not available for most women of her age. At the hands of private tutors, she 
learned six languages: French, Spanish, Greek, Italian, Latin and Flemish along 
with her native English, studied theology, astronomy, physics, and other 
subjects in which she performed remarkably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left> After 
the early death of her brother Edward VI, her sister Mary Tudor inherited the throne. 
&quot;<a href="marytudor.html">Bloody&quot; Mary</a>, as she would become known, was a Roman Catholic and her reign saw the 
persecution of many Protestants. In an attempt to dethrone Mary, Protestants led 
by Thomas Wyatt started a rebellion. Mary insisted that her sister was active in 
the uprising and had her imprisoned in the Tower of London. After a few 
treacherous months she was released and sent away to an estate under the 
constant watch of her sister. However, Elizabeth never gave in to her sister's 
demand of converting to Roman Catholicism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left> In 
1558, Mary died and Elizabeth became queen. Faced with a country that was 
reeling from religious differences, Elizabeth once again made the Church of 
England the official religion, although retaining some Roman Catholic traditions 
in the church by issuing the 39 Articles of 1563, which was designed to prevent 
the country from further turmoil. Her tolerance of Roman Catholicism would wane in her 
later years as assassination plots were uncovered that originated in at the 
hands of Roman Catholics that sought to reestablish a Roman Catholic queen. Pope Pius V 
excommunicated her in 1570 in hope of an uprising that would allow a Roman Catholic to 
once again restore the faith to England. During the 1580's her tolerance ran out 
and sent&nbsp; many to their 
death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left> The figure in the 
conspiracies that was to take Elizabeth's position as monarch was <a href="marystuart.html">Mary
Stuart, Queen of Scots</a>. After the suspicious death of her second husband, Lord Darnley, in 1566, 
Mary, along with the Earl of Bothwell whom she had grown very close to had been 
accused of assassinating the King. She was forced to leave Scotland and sought 
the protection of Elizabeth in England. During a nearly twenty-year stay, the 
former Queen of Scots 
was more than once suspected of conspiring to overthrow Elizabeth and become 
Queen of England, but Elizabeth 
long refused to have her executed. Only after her role in the Babington Plot was 
uncovered did Elizabeth allow her execution in 1587.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left> In Parliament, 
Elizabeth ruled through her Privy Council. This included men such as the earl of 
Leicester, Lord Burghley, and later the Earl of Essex. They were her council in 
times of decision and had influence over the queen. Throughout her reign, 
Elizabeth was pressured to marry by Parliament in hope of producing an heir to 
the crown. Although she never married, Elizabeth received proposals from many 
prominent men in Europe. Throughout her life she defended her virginity, but 
rumors circulated that she was in love with Robert Dudley, the Earl of 
Leicester. After the suspicious death of his wife, Amy, Elizabeth was accused of 
plotting to kill her in order to be with her childhood love. The two never 
married, although Leicester would wed her cousin several years after the death 
of his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left> In 1588, Spain 
attempted to invade England, partially prompted by the execution of Mary Stuart. 
During their invasion, the grand armada engaged the Royal Navy. After bad 
weather and a series of defeats, the armada was repulsed and England emerged as 
the prominent naval force in the world. England also expanded its commerce and 
companies like the British East India Company were established to enhance trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P align=left> On March 24, 1603, 
Elizabeth died. Her cousin James VI of Scotland became King James I of England, 
creating the <em>de facto</em> unification of Britain. Her 
era saw the advancement of England as a military might, domination of the 
British Isles, restored the Anglican faith, and ruled her country effectively through council for 45 years in a time 
when women were still being looked upon as being inferior to men. Although 
plots and conspiracies plagued her reign, her unification of the England is the 
reason for the label that is commonly attached to her as England's greatest 
monarch.&nbsp;</P>

great detail about the monarch. It provides an accurate depiction of the queen, 
but more information is needed to have a better picture of what life was like 
during her reign. The article is easy to read and provides some interesting 
information about her life, especially her dealings with Catholics and possible

King Henry VIII, and gives some information about Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's 
mother. It then focuses on her childhood and the fondness showed to her by her 
stepmother's newest husband, Thomas Seymour, brother of Jane. The article ends 
by discussing the assassination plots on her life by Mary, Queen of Scots, her 
treatment of Catholics, the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, and her 
relationship with Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex. The article has a vast 
amount of links at the bottom of the site and arranges the links by its 
appropriate subject, such as Men in Elizabeth's life to the writings of the

years, coronation, marriage proposals, the plots of Mary, Queen of Scots, and 
her final years. The article is well written and is suitable for students from 
the high school level and up. The last section of the site provides valuable 
links to a variety of web sites dealing with major figures and themes that were

29 Sep 2005.</B><BR>Paul Hammer's article looks at the major figures that made 
up Elizabeth's Privy Council and their ability to&nbsp; influence her during her 
reign, especially in the 1590's, due to the close relationships she had wit some 
of the members.. The article examines individuals such as William Cecil (Lord 
Burghley), The Earl of Essex, and the impact of the earl of Leicester's death in 
1588 and the void that it created. The article also examines the power struggles 
that emerged between Essex and Robert Cecil, Burghley's son, for control of the 
Privy Council and favor from Queen Elizabeth. The article is well written and is 
most suitable for a researcher who has prior knowledge of Elizabeth and her 
life. Hammer is an instructor of history at the University of St. Andrews in 
England.<BR><BR><B>Hibbert, Christopher. <U>The Virgin Queen: Elizabeth I, 
Genius of the Golden Age.</U> New York: Addison-Wesley, 
1994.&nbsp;</B><BR>Hibbert's book offers a chronological look at the life of 
Queen Elizabeth in great detail. Throughout the book are colorful illustrations 
of the virgin queen and contains a genealogy of the Tudor Dynasty. I recommend 
the book to an experienced reader since the language used may bring about 
confusion due to its vast array of words that may be uncommon to the average 
reader. The bibliography of the book contains a vast amount of primary and 
secondary sources that may aid further research about Queen 
Elizabeth.&nbsp;<BR><BR><B>Klein, Arthur Jay. <U>Intolerance in the Reign of 
Elizabeth.</U> Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press Inc., 
1968.</B>&nbsp;<BR>Klein's work focuses on the way Elizabeth handled the 
religious differences that England was facing during her reign, as well as her 
handling of Mary Stuart's assassination plot and the defeat of the Spanish 
Armada. Klein uses as sources many acts of Parliament and proclamations to show 
how the Elizabethan government treated Catholics and Protestants in restoring 
the Anglican Church after the reign of her sister, Mary. The book is very 
detailed and should be used by serious scholars attempting to find out more on 
the way Elizabeth handled the religious questions of her day. Klein was a 
professor of history at Wheaton College in Massachusetts and wishes that the 
American student looking to research the religious history of the period use his 
bibliography as a way to guide their research to prevent confusion in the vast 
amount of sources that are available on the subject.<BR><BR><B>Loades, David. 
<U>Elizabeth I.</U> New York: Hambledon and London, 2003.&nbsp;</B><BR>Loades' 
book attempts to describe Elizabeth's role in the events that marked her reign 
with more clarity than previous authors. The book covers Henry's marriages and 
the span of Elizabeth's life chronologically, from her childhood and reign up to 
her death in 1603. Loades arranges the chapters according to certain era's of 
the queen's life, such as the threats she faced, the war with Spain, her 
relations with her sister, Queen 'Bloody Mary,' and other topics that 
characterize her reign. The book contains illustrations of Elizabeth and 
prominent individuals who Elizabeth interacted with throughout her life. The end 
of the book contains several pages of notes to clarify what is being discussed 
as well as a bibliography full of primary and secondary sources he uses that can 
be used as tools for further research. The author admits that his thinking of 
Elizabeth has been influenced by other writers on the subject through 
interactions and conferences. I highly recommend the book for someone doing 
research about the queen due to its scholarly work and recent publication that 
shows current thinking about Elizabeth's reign.<BR><BR><B>O'Malley, John W. 
'Excommunicating Politicians.'<I> America</I> 27 Sep 2004. available from 
Academic Search Premier&nbsp; Accessed 29 Sep 2005.</B><BR>O'Malley's article 
examines the history of the excommunication of leading politicians and leaders 
beginning in the eleventh century with emperor Henry IV by Pope Gregory VII up 
to action by New Orleans Bishop Joseph Rummel against three Catholics who 
protested his plan to end the racial segregation that existed in New Orleans 
schools. The article briefly mentions Elizabeth and describes that the reason 
she was excommunicated was to start a rebellion to overthrow the queen and allow 
a Catholic to become England's monarch. It is a very well written article, but 
the reader will not find much about Elizabeth or Henry's excommunication. 
O'Malley is a professor of church history at the Weston Jesuit School of 
Theology in Cambridge, Mass., and is also an author who released a book in 2004, 
The Four Cultures of the West.<BR><BR><B>Plowden, Allison. <U>Two Queens In One 
Isle: The Deadly Relationship Between Elizabeth I &amp; Mary Queen of Scots.</U> 
Gloucestershire: Sutton Publishing, 1999.</B><BR>Plowden's book examines the 
rise to power of Queen Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots and the relationship 
that they had that ended with Mary losing her head in 1587. Plowden thoroughly 
describes Mary's assassination plots of Elizabeth as well as Mary's suspected 
role of the killing of her second husband, Lord Darnley, with the Earl of 
Bothwell as an accomplice, that ultimately caused a revolt and sent Mary in 
exile to England protected by Elizabeth. She also describes the jealousies that 
the Queens had for one another as well as a glimpse into Elizabeth's personal 
thoughts on the situation, imprisonment, and eventual execution of Mary. Allison 
Plowden is a former script writer and editor for the BBC turned author and has 
several publications on Queen Elizabeth. This book is a very good source on the 
relationship between the two queens.&nbsp;<BR><BR><B>Saunders, Will. 'Faction in

article written by Will Saunders examines the role that factions played in the 
decision-making that occurred under Queen Elizabeth. The article describes what 
a faction is then looks at different interpretations of her reign and how she 
ruled her court by twentieth century writers such as John Neale, Simon Adams, 
Susan Doran, and John Guy and Steven Alford (together). Their descriptions of 
Elizabeth differ dramatically, with Doran defending that Elizabeth was a strong 
monarch that ruled very assertively while Neale argues that she was highly 
influenced and manipulated by her advisors. Saunders is the head of history at

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3.2">[3.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte3.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp; During these transactions in Persia, all Greece, under the leadership of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemonians</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athens.html#1">Athenians</A>, was split into two parties, and turned their arms from foreign wars as it were against their own bowels. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Of one people were formed two distinct bodies; and they who had so recently served in the same camp, were divided into two hostile armies. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> On the one side, the Lacedaemonians drew over to their faction the cities that had before been common auxiliaries to both. On the other side, the Athenians, renowned alike for their antiquity and their exploits, relied on their own strength. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Thus the two most powerful people of Greece, made equal by the institutions of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/solon.html#1">Solon</A> and the laws of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lycurgus.html#2">Lycurgus</A>, rushed into war through envy of each other's power. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> When Lycurgus had succeeded <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/polydectes.html#2">Polydectes</A> his brother, king of the Lacedaemonians, and might have secured the kingdom for himself, he restored it, with the noblest integrity, to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/charilaus.html#1">Charilaus</A>, the posthumous son of Polydectes, as soon as he became of age; <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> that all might see how much more the laws of integrity prevail with good men than all the charms of power. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> In the meantime, while the child was growing up, and he had the guardianship of him, he composed laws for the Spartans, who previously had had none. Nor was he more celebrated for the making of these laws, than for his exemplary conformity to them; <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> for he imposed nothing by law upon others, of the observation of which he did not first give an example in his own conduct. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> He trained the people to be obedient to those in authority, and those in authority to be just in the exercise of their government. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> He enjoined frugality on all, thinking that the toils of war would be made more endurable by a constant observance of it. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> He ordered all purchases to be made, not with money, but by exchange of commodities. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> The use of gold and silver he prohibited, as being the origin of all evils. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3.3">[3.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte3.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp; He divided the administration of the government among the several orders; <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> to the kings he gave the power of making war, to the magistrates the seats of justice in yearly succession; to the senate, the guardianship of the laws; to the people, the power of choosing the senate, or of creating what magistrates they pleased. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> The lands of the whole state he divided equally among all, that equality of possession might leave no one more powerful than another. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> He ordered all to take their meals in public, that no man might secretly indulge in splendour of luxury. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> He would not allow the young people to wear more than one garment in a year, nor anyone to walk abroad in finer garments than another, or to fare more sumptuously, lest imitation of such practices should lead to general luxury. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> He ordered boys to be brought, not into the forum, but into the fields, that they might spend their early years, not in effeminate employments, but in hard labour and exertion; <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> not suffering them to put anything under them to sleep upon, or to live on high seasoned food, and forbidding them to return into the city till they arrived at manhood. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> He caused virgins to be married without dowries, that wives, not money, might be sought; and that husbands might govern their wives more strictly, being influenced by no regard to dowry. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> He ordained that the highest respect should be paid, not to the rich and powerful, but to the old, according to that degrees of seniority; nor had old age, indeed, a more honourable habitation anywhere than at Sparta. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> But seeing that such laws would at first be thought severe, as the state of manners had previously been relaxed, he represented that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollo.html#1">Apollo</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/delphi.html#1">Delphi</A> was the author of them, and that he had brought them from thence at the command of the deity, in order that reverence for religion might overbalance the irksomeness of compliance with them. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> And to secure perpetuity to his laws, he bound the city by an oath "to make no change in them till he should return," pretending that he was going to ask the oracle at Delphi whether anything seemed necessary to be added to his institutions, or changed in them. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> But he went in reality to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crete.html#1">Crete</A>, and continued there in voluntary exile; and, when he was dying, ordered his bones to be thrown into the sea, lest, if they were taken back to Lacedaemon, the Spartans might think themselves absolved from their oath respecting alteration in his laws. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3.4">[3.4]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte3.html#4"> L</A>&nbsp; Under such a state of manners, the city acquired, in a short time, such a degree of strength, that, on going to war with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/messenia.html#1">Messenians</A> for offering violence to some of their maidens at a solemn sacrifice of that people, they bound themselves under a severe oath not to return till they had taken <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/messene.html#1">Messene</A>, promising themselves so much either from their strength or good fortune. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> This occurrence was the commencement of dissension in Greece, and the origin and cause of a civil war. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> But being detained in the siege of this city, contrary to their expectation, for ten years, and called on to return by the complaints of their wives after so long a widowhood, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> and being afraid that by persevering in the war they might hurt themselves more than the Messenians (for, in Messene, whatever men were lost in the war, were replaced by the fruitfulness of their women, while they themselves suffered constant losses in battle, and could have no offspring from their wives in the absence of their husbands), <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> they in consequence selected, out of the soldiers that had come, after the military oath was first taken, as recruits to the army, a number of young men; whom they sent back to Sparta with permission to form promiscuous connections with all the women of the city, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> thinking that conception would be more speedy if each of the females made the experiment with several men. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Those who sprung from these unions were called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/partheniae.html#1">Partheniae</A>, as a reflection on their mothers' violated chastity; <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> and, when they came to thirty years of age, being alarmed with the fear of poverty (for not one of them had a father to whose estate he could hope to succeed,) they chose a captain named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phalantus.html#1">Phalantus</A>, the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aratus.html#99">Aratus</A>, by whose advice the Spartans had sent home the young men to propagate, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> that, as they had formerly had the father for the author of their birth, they might now have the son as the establisher of their hopes and fortunes. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Without taking leave of their mothers, therefore, from whose adultery they thought that they derived dishonour, they set out to seek a place of settlement, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> and being tossed about a long time, and with various mischances, they at last arrived on the coast of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/italy.html#1">Italy</A>, where, after seizing the citadel of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarentum.html#1">Tarentines</A>, and expelling the old inhabitants, they fixed their abode. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> But several years after, their leader Phalantus, being driven into exile by a popular tumult, went to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/brundisium.html#1">Brundisium</A>, whither the former inhabitants of Tarentum had retreated after they were expelled from their city. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> When he was at the point of death, he urged the exiles "to have his bones, and last relics, bruised to dust, and privately sprinkled in the forum of Tarentum; <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> for that Apollo at Delphi had signified that by this means they might recover their city." <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> They, thinking that he had revealed the destiny of his countrymen to avenge himself, complied with his directions; <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> but the intention of the oracle was exactly the reverse; for it promised the Spartans, upon the performance of what he had said, not the loss, but the perpetual possession of the city. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Thus by the subtlety of their exiled captain, and the agency of their enemies, the possession of Tarentum was secured to the Partheniae forever. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3.5">[3.5]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte3.html#5"> L</A>&nbsp; Meantime the Messenians, who could not be conquered by valour, were reduced by stratagem. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> For eighty years they bore the severe afflictions of slaves, as frequent stripes, and chains, and other evils of subjugation; and then, after so long an endurance of suffering, they proceeded to resume hostilities. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> The Lacedaemonians, at the same time, ran to arms with the greater ardour and unanimity, because they seemed to be called upon to fight against their own slaves. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> While ill-treatment, therefore, on the one side, and indignation on the other, exasperated their feelings, the Lacedaemonians consulted the oracle at Delphi concerning the event of the war, and were directed to ask the Athenians for a leader to conduct it. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The Athenians, learning the answer of the oracle, sent, to express their contempt of the Spartans a lame poet, named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyrtaeus.html#1">Tyrtaeus</A>; <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> who, being routed in three battles, reduced the Lacedaemonians to so desperate a condition, that, to recruit their army, they liberated a portion of their slaves, promising that they should marry the widows of those who were slain, <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> and thus fill up, not merely the number of the lost citizens, but their offices. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> The kings of Sparta, however, lest, by contending against fortune, they should bring greater losses on their city, would have drawn off their army, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> had not Tyrtaeus interposed, and recited to the soldiers, in a public assembly, some verses of his own composition, in which he had comprised exhortations to courage, consolations for their losses, and counsels concerning the war. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> By this means he inspired the soldiers with such resolution, that, being no longer concerned for their lives, but merely for the rites of burial, they tied on their right arms tickets, inscribed with their names and those of their fathers, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> that if an unsuccessful battle should cut them off, and their features after a time become indistinct, they might be consigned to burial according to the indication of the inscriptions. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> When the kings saw the army thus animated, they took care that the state of it should be made known to the enemy; <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> the report, however, raised in the Messenians no alarm, but a correspondent ardour. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Both sides accordingly encountered with such fury, that there scarcely ever was a more bloody battle. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> But at last victory fell to the Lacedaemonians.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3.6">[3.6]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte3.html#6"> L</A>&nbsp; Some time after, the Messenians renewed the war a third time, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> when the Lacedaemonians, among their other allies, called also upon the Athenians for assistance; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> but afterwards, conceiving some mistrust of them, they prevented them from joining in the war, pretending that they had no need for their services. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> The Athenians, not liking this proceeding, removed the money, which had been contributed by the whole of Greece to defray the expense of the Persian war, from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/delos.html#1">Delos</A> to Athens, that, if the Lacedaemonians broke their faith as allies, it might not be an object of plunder to them. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, did not rest, for though they were engaged in the war with the Messenians, they set the people of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/peloponnese.html#1">Peloponnesus</A> to make war on the Athenians. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> The forces of the Athenians at home were at that time inconsiderable, as their fleet had been despatched into <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/egypt.html#1">Egypt</A>, so that, engaging in battle by sea, they were quickly worsted. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Soon after, on the return of their fleet, being strengthened both by sea and land, they renewed the war; <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> when the Lacedaemonians, leaving the Messenians at rest, turned their full force against the Athenians. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Victory was long doubtful, and at last both parties gave over with equal loss. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> The Lacedaemonians being then recalled to the war with the Messenians, but not wishing to leave the Athenians in the meantime unmolested, bargained with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thebes.html#1">Thebans</A> to restore them the supremacy of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/boeotia.html#1">Boeotia</A>, which they had lost in the time of the Persian war, if they would but take up arms against the Athenians. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Such was the fury of the Spartans, that, though they were involved in two wars, they did not hesitate to occasion a third, if they might but raise up enemies against their enemies. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> The Athenians, therefore, to meet this storm of war, made choice of two eminent leaders, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pericles.html#1">Pericles</A>, a man of tried courage, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sophocles.html#1">Sophocles</A>, the writer of tragedies; <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> who, dividing their forces, laid waste the lands of the Spartans, and brought many cities of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#1">Asia</A> under the power of the Athenians.
 
<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3.7">[3.7]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte3.html#7"> L</A>&nbsp; The Lacedaemonians, being humbled by these losses, agreed upon a peace for thirty years. But their hostile feelings did not allow of so long a period of repose. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Hence, having broken the treaty before the fifteenth year was ended, they laid waste the territories of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/attica.html#1">Attica</A> in violation of their obligations towards the gods and towards men. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> And lest they should seem to have desired to plunder rather than to fight, they challenged the enemy to the field. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> But the Athenians, by the advice of their leader Pericles, deferred revenge for the spoliation of their lands to a fitter time of exacting it, thinking it needless to hazard a battle, when they could avenge themselves on the enemy without risk. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Some days afterwards, accordingly, they embarked in their fleet, and, while the Lacedaemonians expected nothing of the kind, laid waste all Sparta, carrying off much more than they had lost; <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> so that, in a comparison of their respective sufferings, the retaliation was much greater than the injury at first received. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> This expedition of Pericles was considered as greatly to his honour; but his disregard of his private property was far more honourable. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> The enemy, while they wasted the lands of others, had left his uninjured; hoping, by this means, either to bring danger on him by rendering him unpopular, or dishonour by making him suspected of treachery. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> But Pericles, foreseeing what would happen, had both foretold it to the people, and, to escape the effects of popular odium, had made over his lands to the state as a gift; <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> and thus obtained the greatest honour from that by which his ruin had been intended. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Some days afterwards, an engagement took place by sea; and the Lacedaemonians, being worsted, fled. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Nevertheless they did not cease from fierce attacks on one another, by sea or land, with various success. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> At last, exhausted with disasters on both sides, they made peace for fifty years, which however they maintained only for six; <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> for they broke the treaty which they had concluded on their own account, under pretence of assisting their allies; <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> as if they were less guilty of perjury by aiding their dependants, than by engaging in open hostilities themselves.
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> The war was in consequence transferred into <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sicily.html#1">Sicily</A>; but before I relate its progress, it is proper to give some account of the situation of that island.

<H2> <A NAME="4.1">BOOK 4</A></H2>  
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="ref">[4.1]</FONT> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte4.html#1"> L</A>&nbsp; It is said that Sicily was formerly joined to Italy by a narrow pass, and was torn off, as it were, from the larger body, by the violence of the upper sea, which impels itself in that direction with the whole force of its waters. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> The soil itself, too, is light and frangible, and so perforated with caverns and passages, that it is almost everywhere open to blasts of wind; <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> and the very matter of it is naturally adapted for generating and nourishing fire, as it is said to be impregnated with sulphur and bitumen, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> a circumstance which is the cause that when air contends with fire in the subterraneous parts, the earth frequently, and in several places, sends forth flame, or vapour, or smoke. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> Hence it is that the fire of Mount <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aetna.html#1">Aetna</A> has lasted through so many ages. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> And when a strong wind passes in through the openings of the cavities, heaps of sand are cast up. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> The promontory of Italy on the side nearest to Sicily, is called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhegium.html#1">Rhegium</A>, because "things broken off" are designated by that word in Greek. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Nor is it strange that antiquity should have been full of fables concerning these parts, in which so many extraordinary things are found together. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> The sea, in the first place, is nowhere so impetuous, pouring on with a current not only rapid but furious, not only frightful to those who feel its effects, but to those who view it from a distance. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> So fierce is the conflict of the waves as they meet, that you may see some of them, put to flight as it were, sink down into the depths, and others, as if victorious, rising up to the skies. Sometimes, in one part, you may hear the roaring of the sea as it boils up; and again, in another part, the groaning of it as it sinks into a whirlpool. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Next are to be observed the adjacent and everlasting fires of Mount Aetna and the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aeolian.html#1">Aeolian</A> islands, which burn as if their heat were nourished by the sea  itself; <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> nor indeed could such a quantity of fire have endured in such narrow bounds for so many ages unless it were supported by nourishment from the water. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Hence fables produced <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scylla.html#1">Scylla</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/charybdis.html#1">Charybdis</A>; hence barkings were thought to have been heard; hence the appearances of monsters gained credit, as the sailors, frightened at the vast whirlpools of the subsiding waters, imagined that the waves, which the vortex of the absorbent gulf clashes together, actually barked. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> The same cause makes the fires of Mount Aetna perpetual; <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> for the shock of the waters forces into the depths a portion of air hurried along with it, and then keeps it confined till, being diffused through the pores of the earth, it kindles the matter which nourishes the fire. 
 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> In addition, the proximity of Italy and Sicily is to be noticed, with the heights of their respective promontories, which are so similar, that, whatever wonder they raise in us in the present day, they excited proportionate terror in the ancients, who believed that whole ships were intercepted and destroyed by the promontories closing together and opening. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Nor was this invented by the ancients to gratify the hearer with a fabulous wonder, but occasioned by the terror and consternation of those who passed by those parts; <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> for such is the appearance of the coasts to any one beholding them from a distance, that you would take the passage between them for a bay in the sea, and not a strait; and, as you draw nearer, you would think that the promontories, which were before united, part asunder and separate.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="6.8">[6.8]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte6.html#8"> L</A>&nbsp; A few days after, Epaminondas died, and with him fell the spirit of the Theban state. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> For as, when you break off the point of a dart, you take from the rest of the steel the power of wounding, so when that general of the Thebans (who was, as it were, the point of their weapon) was taken off, the strength of their government was so debilitated, that they seemed not so much to have lost him as to have all died with him. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> They neither carried on any memorable war before he became their leader, nor were they afterwards remarkable for their successes, but for their defeats; so that it is certain that with him the glory of his country both rose and fell. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Whether he was more estimable as a man or a general is undecided; <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> for he never sought power for himself, but for his country, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> and was so far from coveting money, that he did not leave sufficient to pay for his funeral. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Nor was he more desirous of distinction than of wealth; for all the appointments that he held were conferred on him against his will, <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> and he filled his posts in such a manner that he seemed to add lustre to his honours rather than to receive it from them. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> His application to learning, and his knowledge of philosophy, were such, that it seemed wonderful how a man bred up in literature could have so excellent a knowledge of war. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> The manner of his death, too, was not at variance with his course of life; <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> for when he was carried back half dead into the camp, and had recovered his breath and voice, he asked only this question of those that stood about him, "whether the enemy had taken his shield from him when he fell?" <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Hearing that it was saved, he kissed it, when it was brought to him, as the sharer of his toils and glory. He afterwards inquired which side had gained the victory, <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> and hearing that the Thebans had got it, observed, "It is well," and so, as it were congratulating his country, expired.

My Brewery was adjoining the residence of said Meucci, and   my residence was also very near his house. When I first became   acquainted with him, he was in moderate circumstances. He devoted   his time in inventions. Through the years 1868, 1869, 1870, I was   in his house very frequently, and saw him almost daily: During   this period he became quite poor. About the years 1869 and 1870, I   know he had to sell his watch and chain to purchase things for the   house. He was injured in 1871 by the explosion on the ferry-boat   Westfield; he was badly burned, more particularly his face and   hands, and was not able to assist himself in bed. </I></FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>At that time I was a   strong young man, and went in daily as his neighbor, to turn him   in bed, I did not suppose he would recover. I often saw in a room   adjoining his sick room, glass jars, six or eight inches high,   with something green in them, also a good deal of wire laying   around resembling telegraph wire, as well as reels of wire. At   this time he was destitute, not able even to pay drug bill or   Doctor, in fact he had no money at all except what was given him   by his friends. Mrs. Meucci told me their circumstances, and   wanted I should buy of her some old pistols and knives, which I   refused to do, but gave her five dollars. In the years 1872 and   1873, 1874 and 1875, Mr. Meucci was very poor indeed; this I know   from statements from them and from observation.</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>During these years he   often came to me and said he had not money to cross on the ferry   to New York, and I gave it to him. When we were taking in coal for   the Brewery, I would sometimes order a load of coal dumped into   his yard for their use. During these years he was in bad health,   and enfeebled from age and effects of his injury. He had no   business and could not have labored, had he anything to do, and I   believe during all this time lived on the charity of his friends;   I often assisted them during this period.</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>The house he lived in   belonged to Mr. Sammanno who had made an arrangement that they   should have it as long as they lived free of rent. He died,   somewhere about 1876, and after his death, his son wrote on here   to have his house sold. We wanted to extend our Brewery on his   lot; for the purpose of assisting Mr. Meucci we bought the house   and moved it across the street on our own land, at our own   expense, and gave them the privilege to live in it so long as they   lived, free of rent. At this time we gave Mrs. Meucci two hundred   dollars, and she gave it, the largest portion or it, to her hired   girl Matilda, who had lived with them for a long time without much   pay. Mrs. Meucci being so much of an invalid, that she was   compelled to have someone to assist her as she was confined to her   chair or bed - from 1870 to 1876, and much of the time since, he   never was able to raise a dollar in money, except that which was   given to him for the purposes of paying his living   expenses.</I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="immagini/bluehbar.gif" WIDTH=432 HEIGHT=10 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=middle></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B><I>Affidavit of MathiasEgloff, 10 October 1885</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I><BR></I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;National Archivesand Records Administration, College Park, MD - RG60, File 6921-1885,Box 10, Folder 1&#93;</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>&#133; The affiant   further states that since 1871 about the year 1880, Mr. Meucci was   very poor. &#133;</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="immagini/bluehbar.gif" WIDTH=432 HEIGHT=10 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=middle></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B><I>Affidavit of NicolaVanni, 19 September 1885</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I><BR></I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;National Archivesand Records Administration, College Park, MD - RG60, File 6921-1885,Box 10, Folder 3&#93;</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>&#133; I visited   him soon after his injury by the explosion on the Steamer, a ferry   boat Westfield - I knew then that Mr. Meucci was very poor, had no   money or means I was a poor man myself   &#133;&nbsp;&#133;</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="immagini/bluehbar.gif" WIDTH=432 HEIGHT=10 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=middle></FONT></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"><B><I>Affidavit of JosephConti, 22 September 1885</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I><BR></I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;National Archivesand Records Administration, College Park, MD - RG60, File 6921-1885,Box 10, Folder 3&#93;</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>I, Joseph Conti,   Secretary of the Italian Consul, being duly sworn, state: That I   am at present residing at Montclair, New Jersey.

I went to the   house; the girl took me up-stairs and into the basement to show me   the things they had to sell, and I found boxes, reels of copper   wire, and something of the shape of horseshoes; there were several   of these.&#133; As I went up-stairs, and in the basement, I was   shown the things they wanted me to buy, and there was a box about   3 x 3 feet, so heavy I could not move it. &#133;</I></FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0099"><I>After I took the things   home that I had purchased from Mrs. Meucci, a young man came to my   store and wanted to buy some of these things.

<P>Marie Antoinette (b.1755-d.1793) was an Austrian Princess, who, at the age of 
15, married Louis XVI of France&nbsp; in order to strengthen the French 
monarchy's tie to Austria. At the time she was queen, the French people were 
becoming increasingly discontent with the bankrupt government. Being a 
foreigner, she was an easy target for the criticisms of the nobility. Her 
popularity among the commoners was low. It lead to a number of accusations 
including treason, corruption, and illicit sexual behavior. Her ability to 
manipulate her husband's Austrian policy placed a strain on her relationship 
with the French public. Marie-Antoinette's outlandish attire, frivolous manners 
and slowness in producing an heir further contributed to her lack of popularity 
among the commoners. </P>
<P>The queen's lack of popularity was evident from the start, and continued to 
mount, as her life was almost continually embroiled in scandal. The Diamond 
Necklace Affair is a perfect example of how the queen's indiscretions and 
infidelities undercut the authority of the monarch. Cardinal de Rohan bought the 
Queen a large diamond necklace, supposedly in return for sexual favors. Although 
the real events surrounding the diamond necklace are not fully known, the affair 
caused many of the public to dub her the "Austrian Whore." Countless pamphlets 
were published, spreading malicious rumors about the queen. Many pornographic 
drawings depicting the queen with numerous lovers, both male and female were 
circulated. Often, it was jealous courtiers who would instigate the material for 
these publications. </P>
<P>It was during this same time period that the Louis's financial advisors used 
some creative financing in an attempt to secure ongoing investments for the 
crown. The ineffectiveness of this attempt led the monarch to side-step 
Estates-General and create a hand picked assembly. Marie-Antoinette exerted an 
undeniable influence on Revolutionary politics. It was apparent the country 
would not feel safe or confident with the monarch while the "Austrian" was 
queen. On April 20, 1792, France declared war on Austria. The National Assembly 
took exceptional measures, only to have them vetoed by King Louis. These two 
vetoes caused a major uproar and many revolutionaries stormed the palace 
chanting, "The Austrian, where is she?&nbsp; Her head, her head!" The King and 
Queen fled Paris to escape the angry revolutionaries, only to be caught in 
Varennes. They were returned to Paris, where Louis was executed a few months
later. 
</P>
<P>Revolutionaries tended to view Marie-Antoinette as thoroughly deserving the 
treatment that she received. They felt that since she was from Austria, she 
always influenced the King to be lenient in actions towards the enemy. She was 
also the reason the revolution escalated, they believed, for she influenced the 
king to demand the continuation of his absolute power.</P>
<P>When Marie was arrested and brought in front of the Revolutionary Tribunal, 
she knew it would only be a matter of time before she was executed. However, it 
was during this most difficult stage in her life that Marie-Antoinette was able 
to become a positive figure for the first time. The courage and compassion she 
showed on behalf of her children would have made any mother proud.&nbsp; Despite 
this new perception, soon Revolutionaries charged her with high treason and 
illicit sexual activity-- the most heinous of which was that she had sexual 
relations with her ailing son in hopes that the exertion might kill him. Drunken 
soldiers or palace servants who wanted to get even with her gave most of the 
testimony.&nbsp;The jury convened for only an hour before sentencing her to 
death. </P>
<P>On October 16, 1793, Marie-Antoinette was beheaded. It was on this day that 
France lost one of its most controversial figures. She was a key figure in 
turning the anger and frustration of the French people into revolution. Whether 
one despised or respected Queen Marie-Antoinette, her role will be argued about 
for many centuries. </P>

<H2 align=center>Annotated Bibliography</H2>
<P><B>Barker, Nancy. "Let Them Eat Cake: The Mythical Marie Antoinette and the 
French Revolution." <I>Historian</I> (Summer 1993): 709-25.</B><BR>This is a 
very scholarly article examining the development of the myth in 
pre-Revolutionary France of a promiscuous, depraved and ruthless Marie 
Antoinette. Barker outlines several unfortunate facts about Marie Antoinette's 
background, lifestyle and personality which combined to demonize her in the eyes 
of her subjects. Barker demonstrates how an unwitting Marie Antoinette's 
character was distorted so that she became the scapegoat of a populace impatient 
for change. This article is particularly relevant to those researching such 
psychological factors as "mob mentality" in history.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Blanc, Oliver. <I>Last Letters. </I>New York: Michael D.Capua Books, 
1987</B>.<BR>This book is a collection of letters written by actors in&nbsp; the 
French Revolution before their deaths. This book is of specific interest to this 
paper because it includes a letter written by Marie-Antoinette, which explains 
what she was going through at the time of her death. Through the letter the 
reader can also get a strong sense of her concern for her children. This book 
will help anyone looking for some good primary source material on Marie 
Antoinette's final thoughts.</P>
<P><B>Castelot, Andre. <I>Queen of France.</I> New York: Harper and Row 
Publishers, 1957.</B><BR>This book is a biography of Marie-Antoinette. The 
author apparently had a mass of documents at his disposal when he wrote this 
book. He used letters, and court papers all to show the historical background 
for the time in which Marie-Antoinette lived.</P>

(October 20, 2005).<BR></B>A brief biography which contains some more background 
information. This differs from the other two internet biographies in that it 
looks at Marie-Antoinette's life in the context of the time period. It also 
reviews some actions Marie took, which were productive for the French people. 
This is an effective method and worth checking out. The site also contains links 
to other websites about Marie Antoinette as well as other rulers of the time, 
and a short list of suggested books about Marie.</P>
<P><B>Fraser, Antonia. <I>Marie Antoinette: The Journey.</I> New York: 
Doubleday, 2001.</B></P>
<P>This book is a biography of Marie Antoinette. It is very useful for anyone 
studying myths about Marie Antoinette. The Author attempts to find validity in 
or dispel the myths that have become associated with Marie Antoinette. This 
includes the possibility of Marie's lesbian love affairs, the "let them eat 
cake" quote, and others. The author also seeks to illustrate the sharp contrast 
between the nobility and the common people of France at the time.</P>
<P><B>Furneaux, Rupert. <I>The Last Days of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI.</I> 
New York: The John Day Company, 1971.</B></P>
<P>This book examines the events which took place leading up to the death of 
Marie Antoinette. It in an in depth examination of that particular part of the 
revolution and the actions of Louis XVI which ultimately lead to his demise. 
Because the book is focused on the revolution, alot of the information is not 
specifically about Marie Antoinette. There is however a wealth of information on 
her last days.</P>
<P><B>Kaplow, Jeffery. <I>France on the Eve of Revolution. </I>New York: John 
Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1971.</B><BR>This book introduces the reader to some of 
the problems that lead up to the French Revolution. It is a book filled with 
articles containing on the decline of French economy, the ineffectiveness of the 
ruling class, and most notably, overextension of military forces. The book is 
not all about Marie Antoinette.</P>
<P><B>Haslip, Joan. <I>Marie Antoinette.</I> New York: Weidenfeld &amp; 
Nicolson, 1987.&nbsp;<br>
</B>In this book, Joan Haslip presents her study of Marie Antoinette from a 
revisionist standpoint. Her intent was to write a book which studied Marie in a 
different context than many before it had. Rather than focusing on the violent 
times in which Marie died. Instead, Haslip tries to study the person. To do so 
she focuses on Marie prior to the Diamond Necklace affair, since the study of 
Marie after words has been quite in depth. It is a good source on the early life 
of Marie. It also contains a good study of her latter years.</P>

(Oct. 22, 2005).<br>
</B>Elizabeth-Louise Vigee-LeBrum, an accomplished French painter, left France 
during the revolution and traveled around Europe, involving herself with 
academic and artistic circles. She was a friend of Marie Antoinette, and painted 
30 pictures of her. This site contains those contemporary paintings of Marie 
Antoinette. Some of the more notable paintings have a brief historical 
description. </P>

</B><B><I>Secret Memoirs of Princess Lamballe.</I> Ed. by Catherine Hyde. New

</B>This book is the translated memoirs of Marie Therese Louise De Sovoie 
Caringan, a close friend of Marie Antoinette. Catherine Hyde provides 
annotations to the writing. The source provides a close look at the life and 
times of Marie Antoinette because of her closeness to Marie. The journal also 
illustrates what was going on among the nobility prior to the death of Marie 
Antonette. </P>
<P><B>Lucas-Dubreton, J. <I>The Restoration and the July Monarchy.</I> London: 
William Heinemann, Ltd., 1929.<BR></B>This book begins with the Restoration of 
the Bourbons to the throne of France. It also deals with the ill-fated July 
Monarchy. Its 18 year period is chronicled here. This is a very readable book 
and should serve any person well who has interest in this period of French 
History. Although this is after Marie-Antoinette's time, it nonetheless serves a 
crucial role in understanding her. This book provides information about the 
exhumation of her body. This helps a person who is interested in researching 
Marie-Antoinette because it provides some details of the legacy that she left 
behind. This legacy was present in spite of her death and the way many people 
felt about her. Love her or hate her she was immortalized in time, and this time 
period started that process.</P>

<P><B>Merrick. Jeffrey. "The Family Politics of the Marquis deBombelles." 
<I>Journal of Family History</I>. 21 (October 1996): 503-518.<BR></B>This 
journal article is about the diary of Marc-Marie deBombelles, Marie Antoinette's 
son. He provides, through his diary, a sense of his home life. This is of 
specific important to this paper because it talks of Marie-Antoinette as a bad 
mother.</P>
<P><B>Price, Munro. <I>The Road From Versailles: Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, 
and the Fall of the French Monarchy.</I> New York: Saint Martians Press, 
2002.<br>
</B>This book is a study of the policies of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. 
Little is written by Louis XVI so it is hard to tell what he actually wanted to 
accomplish and how he planned on doing it. The author writes about the secret 
diplomacy and secret policy of Marie and Louis based on documents written by 
people all across Europe who interacted with Marie and Louis.&nbsp; It is a 
complex study which goes far beyond biographical information. This book would be 
very useful for a complex study of Marie Antoinette. Its usefulness for basic 
study may be limited.</P>
<P><B>Rouart, Jean-Marie. "A New View of the Frivolous Queen." <I>World Press 
Review</I>. (January 1994, 46.<BR></B>This article demonstrates that it was the 
myths surrounding her, and not her otherwise obscure life, which transformed 
Marie Antoinette in a legendary figure following her death. Rouart states that 
her story (which he summarizes) captures public imagination because the 
circumstances of her time pitted her between two vastly different worlds: the 
idyllic life of Versailles and the bloody anarchy of the Revolution. The article 
analyzes the primacy of legend over actual events.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Saint-Amand, Pierre. "Terrorizing Marie-Antoinette."&nbsp; <I>Critical 
Inquiry</I> 20 (Spring 1994): 379-400.<BR></B>This journal article compares the 
situation of Marie-Antoinette during the French Revolution to that of Hillary 
Clinton today. It is&nbsp; an important article because it compares the politics 
of yesteryear to today.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Schama, Simon. <I>Citizens.</I> New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 
1989.<BR></B>This book was written as an attempt to reappraise the French 
Revolution and to push the argument one step further than ever before. This book 
can be difficult to read in sections, but it does provide a new look at the 
French Revolution. It is applicable to this paper because it provides somewhat 
of a different view of Marie-Antoinette. This book, more than most, focuses only 
on her in relationship to the history of the period.</P>
<P><B>Schneider, Marcel." Lost in Versailles." <I>World Press Review</I>. 
(January 1994): 46.<BR></B>This short article reflects on how Marie Antoinette's 
personality, her manner at court and her incompatible marriage to King Louis all 
conspired to lead to her downfall. Schneider paints a picture of a queen whose 
self-indulgent and carefree nature aggravated the already tense political 
situation in France. He takes a sympathetic view o Marie Antoinette's fate, 
particularly in mentioning that envious courtiers contributed to the scandalous 
rumors that surrounded the queen. This is a good site for people interested in 
the "clashing personalities" aspect of the events.</P>
<P><B>Sole, Jacques. <I>Questions of the French Revolution.</I> New York: 
Pantheon Books; 1989.<BR></B>This is an easy to read book that will provide the 
reader with everything he or she would like to know about the French Revolution. 
Sole also spends time giving important information about Marie-Antoinette. He 
tells of her supposed wild sexual life style and her relationship with the King. 
This author does not seem to think her sexual lifestyle was as wild as many may 
want to think.</P>
<P><B>Stone, Bailey. <I>The Genesis of the French Revolution.</I> New York: 
Cambridge University Press, 1994.<BR></B>This book draws upon the historiography 
of the French Revolution as well as other scholarship, in order to develop an 
interpretation of the French Revolution's genesis that historians would view as 
"global historical". This book focuses more on the state's role in the 
revolution as compared to the societies. This book is suggested for people who 
already have studied the French Revolution, as it may confuse those who have 
not.</P>

web page, provided by the Austrian Mint, provides a biography of Marie

interested in studying women of this time period. It is of specific importance 
to this paper because it includes memoirs of Marie-Antoinette. It provides 
actual primary source documentation written by her, this is extremely valuable

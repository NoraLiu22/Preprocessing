                to a fateful introduction. In the spring of 1894, Marie Sklodowska 
                mentioned her need for a lab to a Polish physicist of her acquaintance. 
                It occurred to him that his colleague <a href="pierre.htm">Pierre 
                Curie</a> might be able to assist her. Curie, who had done pioneering 
                research on magnetism, was laboratory chief at the Municipal School 
                of Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris. Unaware of how inadequate 
                Pierre's own lab facilities were, the professor suggested that 
                perhaps Pierre could find room there for Marie to work. The meeting 
                between Curie and Sklodowska would change not only their individual 
                lives but also the course of science. </font>

                    not only to get her own doctorate but to see to it that Pierre 
                    received one as well. Although Pierre had done important scientific 
                    research in more than one field over the past 15 years, he 
                    had never completed a doctorate (in France the process consumed 
                    even more time than it did in the U.S. or U.K.). Marie insisted 
                    now that he write up his research on magnetism. In March 1895 
                    he was awarded the degree. At the Municipal School Pierre 
                    was promoted to a professorship. The honor and the higher 
                    salary were offset by increased teaching duties without any 
                    improvement in lab space. </font></td>

                Roman Catholic mother died young, and Pierre was the son of non-practicing 
                Protestants. Nor did they exchange rings. Instead of a bridal 
                gown Marie wore a dark blue outfit, which for years after was

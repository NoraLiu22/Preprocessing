<h2>A Mighty Laugh</h2> <p> I'm starting to wonder if
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Guest,+Christopher"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on Christopher Guest"
>Christopher Guest</a>
 can do any wrong. He's now directed three outstanding comedies
using the mockumentary format. The first chronicled a small town's
musical production,
<a href="/movies/W/WaitingforGuffman1996.html" 
title="Scott's thoughts on Waiting for Guffman" class=internal 
><i>Waiting for Guffman</i></a>.
 The second was the canine carnival

><i>Best in Show</i></a>.
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0310281"
 class=imdb title="IMDB information on A Mighty Wind"
><i>A Mighty Wind</i></a>
 is probably the funniest of the three. As a bonus, Wind has more
opportunities for drama than the others, providing nice contrast with
the humor. These moments also highlight the outstanding quality of the
acting. While there are still characters about whom everything is
seriously funny, the tension between long-dissolved folk duo Mitch
&amp; Mickey is unexpectedly rich for this genre. </p> <p> Wind
includes some of the most outlandish characters ever to appear in a
mockumentary.
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Willard,+Fred"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on Fred Willard"
>Fred Willard</a>'s
 character is especially quotable as the forgotten star of a short-
lived sitcom now managing a folk group. At a declaration of "Folk Music
Day", he slams the deputy mayor before launching into some terrible
jokes for the cameras.
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Higgins,+John+Michael"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on John Michael Higgins"

 and

 play a married couple whose brand of spirituality is freaking out the
newest member of the New Main Street Singers.
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Begley+Jr%2E,+Ed"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on Ed Begley Jr."
>Ed Begley Jr.</a>'s
 Lars Olfen is a Swede with an astonishing mastery of Yiddish when
he's around
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Balaban,+Bob"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on Bob Balaban"
>Bob Balaban</a>'s
 obsessive-compulsive Jonathan. Guest himself turns in one of
history's most interesting vocal performances, especially as
evidenced when the Folksmen are singing Old Joe's Place. </p> <p>
At the tamer end, there are wonderful performances from people like
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Levy,+Eugene"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on Eugene Levy"
>Eugene Levy</a>,
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?O%27Hara,+Catherine"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on Catherine O'Hara"
>Catherine O'Hara</a>
 and
 <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?McKean,+Michael"
 class="imdb" title="IMDB information on Michael McKean"
>Michael McKean</a>.
 Levy's idiosyncracies point to a sordid history of mental problems
and chemical abuse. On the bright side, he's fabulously surreal
when it comes to simple conversation. O'Hara gets laughs with
little looks, little hints of a midwest accent, and the fact that she
plays the autoharp. McKean is fun because he's just the tiniest bit
slimy. He was never a lover of folk music, and he always perceives
himself as just slightly above the rest. I could go on and on about the
rest of the cast, but I think you get the idea by now. </p> <p> On the
technical side, Wind's editing is superb.

 lets the shot linger for about a second after several jokes so that we
have a moment to savor them. The extra time gives the impression that
the joke isn't quite over. I can't explain why this would make
them funnier, but I definitely sense that the delay augments the humor.
Leighton also make copious use of reaction shots throughout the film,
and these non-speaking moments show the cast in top form. It's much
easier to emote vocally than visually, but these folks do it, and the
editing allows us to appreciate it. </p> <h2>All About the Music</h2>
<p> I've been spending extensive time with the soundtrack for A
Mighty Wind. It's terrific. The characters have sublimely
appropriate music that is quite credible on its own. I was stunned to
find myself simultaneously crying at the story of Bobby and June while
laughing at how subtly bad it is. That particular song isn't heard
in the movie, but the ones that made it are terrific. There are three
featured groups: The Folksmen, The Main Street Singers, and Mitch and
Mickey. Mitch and Mickey sound quite a bit like Paul and Art, but with
slightly less tact. The Main Street Singers are a relentlessly cheerful
<i>neuftet</i> [sic] singing absurdly lush vocal harmonies. Though
rooted in the Kinston Trio, the Folksmen drift farthest afield in their
style, and the soundtrack includes a must-hear rendition of "Start Me
Up". </p>

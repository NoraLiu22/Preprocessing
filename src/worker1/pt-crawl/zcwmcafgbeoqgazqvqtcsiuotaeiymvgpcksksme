<H1> Callimachus: Epigrams </H1>
<BR>

<P> <I> At the beginning of Callimachus' <A HREF="callimachus.html">Aetia</A>, Apollo advises the poet to &quot;keep the Muse slender&quot, and his slender but carefully composed Epigrams are generally agreed to be amongst the best of his poems.  They have not survived in their original format, but many of them were included in the <A HREF="anthology.html">Greek Anthology</A>, and they have been extracted from there by modern scholars to form this collection.  The English translation is by A.W.Mair (1921).</I>

<P> <I>Click on</I> <FONT CLASS="Latin"> G</FONT> <I>to go to the Greek text of each epigram.  The numbers assigned to the epigrams in the translation are slightly different from the numbers in the Greek text. A <FONT CLASS="ref">?</FONT> before a number indicates that many scholars doubt that the epigram was written by Callimachus.</I>

<P> A stranger from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/atarneus.html#1">Atarneus</A> thus asked <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pittacus.html#1">Pittacus</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mytilene.html#1">Mytilene</A>, the son of Hyrrhas : " Reverend Father, two marriages invite me. One lady is my equal in wealth and blood : the other is above my station. Which is better ? Come advise me whether of those I should lead to the altar." 
 
<P> So he spake : and Pittacus lifted up his staff, the old man's weapon, and said : " Lo ! these yonder shall tell thee all." Now these were boys who at a wide crossing were spinning their swift tops with blows of the lash. " Follow their tracks," saith he. And the stranger stood by them : and they were saying : " Keep your own rank ! " When the stranger heard the words, he laid to heart the saying of the boys and spared to grasp at the greater estate. Now, even as he led home the humble bride, so go thou and keep thine own rank.

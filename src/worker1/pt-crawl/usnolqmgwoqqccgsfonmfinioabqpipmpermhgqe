                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">[And I wanted to refute those who accuse natural science of being unable to be of any benefit to us.] In this way, [citizens], even though I am not engaging in public affairs, I say these things through the inscription just as if I were taking action, and in an endeavour to prove that what benefits our nature, namely freedom from disturbance, is identical for one and all.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">And so, having described the second reason for the inscription, I now go on to mention my mission and to explain its character and nature.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">Having already reached the sunset of my life (being almost on the verge of departure from the world on account of old age), I wanted, before being overtaken by death, to compose a [fine] anthem [to celebrate the] fullness [of pleasure] and so to help now those who are well-constituted. Now, if only one person or two or three or four or five or six or any larger number you choose, sir, provided that it is not very large, were in a bad predicament, I should address them individually and do all in my power to give them the best advice. But, as I have said before, the majority of people suffer from a common disease, as in a plague, with their false notions about things, and their number is increasing (for in mutual emulation they catch the disease from one another, like sheep) moreover, [it is] right to help [also] generations to come (for they too belong to us, though they are still unborn) and, besides, love of humanity prompts us to aid also the foreigners who come here. Now, since the remedies of the inscription reach a larger number of people, I wished to use this stoa to advertise publicly the [medicines] that bring salvation. These medicines we have put [fully] to the test; for we have dispelled the fears [that grip] us without justification, and, as for pains, those that are groundless we have completely excised, while those that are natural we have reduced to an absolute minimum, making their magnitude minute.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>

[observing that most people suffer from false notions about things and do not listen to the body] when it brings important and just [accusations] against the soul, alleging that it is unwarrantably mauled and maltreated by the soul and dragged to things which are not necessary (in fact, the wants of the body are small and easy to obtain — and the soul too can live well by sharing in their enjoyment — while those of the soul are both great and difficult to obtain and, besides being of no benefit to our nature, actually involve dangers). So (to reiterate what I was saying) observing that these people are in this predicament, I bewailed their behaviour and wept over the wasting of their lives, and I considered it the responsibility of a good man to give [benevolent] assistance, to the utmost of one's ability, to those of them who are well-constituted. [This] is the first reason [for the inscription].<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">I declare that the [vain] fear of [death and that] of the [gods grip many] of us, [and that] joy [of real value is generated not by theatres] and [...and] baths [and perfumes] and ointments, [which we] have left to the masses, [but by natural science...]<br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">... [as is supposed by] some of the philosophers and especially the Socratics. They say that pursuing natural science and busying oneself with investigation of [celestial phenomena] is superfluous and unprofitable, and they do [not even] deign [to concern themselves with such matters.]<br /></p>

For, when they assert that things are inapprehensible, what else are they saying than that there is no need for us to pursue natural science? After all, who will choose to seek what he can never find?<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">Now Aristotle and those who hold the same Peripatetic views as Aristotle say that nothing is scientifically knowable, because things are continually in flux and, on account of the rapidity of the flux, evade our apprehension. We on the other hand acknowledge their flux, but not its being so rapid that the nature of each thing [is] at no time apprehensible by sense-perception. And indeed [in no way would the upholders of] the view under discussion have been able to say (and this is just what they do [maintain] that [at one time] this is [white] and this black, while [at another time] neither this is [white nor] that black, [if] they had not had [previous] knowledge of the nature of both white and black.<br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">Well, Heraclitus of Ephesus identified fire as elemental, Thales of Miletus water, Diogenes of Apollonia and Anaximenes air, Empedocles of Acragas fire and air and water and earth, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae the homoeomeries of each thing, and the Stoics matter and God. As for Democritus of Abdera, he did well to identify atoms as elemental, but since his conception of them was in some respects mistaken, he will be considered in the exposition of our theories. <br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">Now we shall bring charges against the said men, not out of contentiousness towards them, but because we wish the truth to be safeguarded; and we shall deal with Heraclitus first, since he has been placed first on our list.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">You are mistaken, Heraclitus, in saying that fire is elemental, for neither is it indestructible, since we observe it being destroyed, nor can it generate things...<br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">Even Democritus erred in a manner unworthy of himself when he said that atoms alone among existing things have true reality, while everything else exists by convention. For, according to your account, Democritus, it will be impossible for us even to live, let alone discover the truth, since we shall be unable to protect ourselves from either fire or slaughter or [any other force].<br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">[Since the first bodies cannot be broken up by anyone,] whether he is god or man, one is left to conclude that these things are [absolutely] indestructible, [beyond the reach of] necessity.

                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">[And] often mirrors too will be my witnesses [that likenesses] and appearances are real [entities.] For what I say will certainly not be denied at all by the image which will give supporting evidence on oath in mirrors. We should not see ourselves in them, nor indeed would [any reflection] be created, [if there were not a continual flow being borne from us to the mirrors and bringing back an image] to us. For this too is convincing proof of the effluence, seeing that each of the parts is carried to the point straight ahead.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">Now the images that flow from objects, by impinging on our eyes, cause us both to see external realities and, [through entering our soul, to think of them. So it is through impingements] that the soul receives in turn the things seen by the eyes; and after the impingements of the first images, our nature is rendered porous in such a manner that, even if the objects which it first saw are no longer present, images similar to the first ones are received by the mind, [creating visions both when we are awake and in sleep.]<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">[And let us not be surprised] that this happens even when we are asleep; for images flow to us in the same way at that time too. How so? When we are asleep, with all the senses as if it were paralysed and extinguished [again in] sleep, the soul, which is [still wide] awake [and yet is unable to recognise] the predicament and condition of the senses at that time, on receiving the images that approach it, conceives an untested and false opinion concerning them, as if it were actually apprehending the solid nature of true realities; for the means of testing the opinion are asleep at that time. These are the senses; for the rule and standard [of truth] with respect to [our dreams] remain [these.]<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">[In opposition to] your [argument, Democritus, we now say this: the nature of dreams is in no way god-sent, as you maintain, or monitory, but rather dreams are produced, I say, by] certain [natural entities, with the result that the fallacious argument is turned aside,] for, [as I have shown, the same images which cause vision cause dreams as well as thought.]<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">... asleep ... So visions are not empty illusions of the mind, as the Stoics hold. For indeed, if on the one hand they call them empty on the ground that, while they have a corporeal nature, it is exceedingly subtle and does not impinge on the senses, they have expressed themselves wrongly, [since it was necessary to call] them corporeal, despite their subtlety. If on the other hand they call them empty on the ground that they have no corporeal nature at all —and it is in fact this rather than the former which they mean—, how can the empty be represented?<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">What then are they? Visions in fact have a composition which is subtle and eludes our sight, [but which is not empty.] For the mind, being superior in subtlety, .... provides ... the starting-point and ... things ... and moves ........... imagining that we shall be struck with a sword or shall fall from a precipice, we spring up in consequence of our fear, even when we are in company. To these examples [I add this further one: since in our dreams,] as also when we are awake, we perform sexual acts, it is no good arguing that the pleasure we derive from them is unreal because we are asleep. So one must not call these visions empty, since they actually possess such great power.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">On the other hand, however, if they are not empty , that does not mean that they are sentient and rational and really chat to us, as Democritus supposes; for films which are so subtle and lack the depth of a solid constitution cannot possibly possess these faculties.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">So these theorists, the Stoics and Democritus, went astray in opposite directions: the Stoics deprive visions of a power which they <span class="style_1">do</span> have, while Democritus endows them with a power which they do <span class="style_1">not </span>have. In fact the nature of [dreams]...<br /></p>

Then the advance of time inspired them or their descendants with the idea of the loom as well.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_2">So no arts, [any more than] these, should be explained by the introduction of Athena or any other deity; for all were the offspring of needs and experiences in conjunction with time.<br /></p>

It is absurd, indeed more absurd than any absurdity, as well as quite impossible, that any one individual should have assembled such vast multitudes (at that time there were as yet no kings, and indeed, in the absence of any vocal sounds, no writing; and with regard to these multitudes [it would have been quite impossible, except by means] of decree, for their assembly to have taken place) and, having assembled them, should [have taken hold of] a rod (?) and proceeded to teach them like an elementary schoolmaster, touching each object and saying «let this be called &quot;stone,&quot; this &quot;wood,&quot; this &quot;human being&quot; or &quot;dog&quot; [or] &quot;ox&quot; or [&quot;ass&quot;] ...»<br /></p>

Yes, and this is a fact of which most people are ignorant: they suppose the sun at any rate to be as low as it appears to be, whereas it is not as low; for if it were so, the earth and everything on it would necessarily be set ablaze.

For if they were [afraid, they] would not [do wrong]. As for [all] the others, [it is my opinion] that the [wise] are not [(reasoning indicates) righteous] on account of the gods, but on account of [thinking] correctly and the [opinions] they hold [regarding] certain things [and especially] pains and death (for indeed invariably and without exception human beings do wrong either on account of fear or on account of pleasures), and that ordinary people on the other hand are righteous, in so far as they are righteous, on account of the laws and the penalties, imposed by the laws, hanging over them. But even if some of their number are conscientious on account of the laws, they are few: only just two or three individuals are to be found among great segments of multitudes, and not even these are steadfast in acting righteously; for they are not soundly persuaded about providence. A clear indication of the complete inability of the gods to prevent wrong-doings is provided by the nations of the Jews and Egyptians, who, as well as being the most superstitious of all peoples, are the vilest of all peoples.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">On account of what kind of gods, then, will human beings be righteous? For they are not righteous on account of the real ones or on account of Plato’s and Socrates’ Judges in Hades. We are left with this conclusion; otherwise, why should not those who disregard the laws scorn fables much more?<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">So, with regard to righteousness, neither does our doctrine do harm [not does] the opposite [doctrine help], while, with regard to the other condition, the opposite doctrine not only does not help, but on the contrary also does harm, whereas our doctrine not only does not harm, but also helps. For the one removes disturbances, while the other adds them, as has already been made clear to you before.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">That not only [is our doctrine] helpful, [but also the opposite doctrine harmful, is clearly shown by] the [Stoics as they go astray. For they say in opposition to us] that the god both is maker of [the] world and takes providential care of it, providing for all things, including human beings. Well, in the first place, we come to this question: was it, may I ask, for his own sake that the god created the world [or for the sake of human beings? For it is obvious that it was from a wish to benefit either himself or human beings that he embarked on this] undertaking. For how could it have been otherwise, if nothing is produced without a cause and these things are produced by a god? Let us then examine this view and what Stoics mean. It was, they say, from a wish to have a city and fellow-citizens, just as if [he were an exile from a city, that] the god [created the world and human beings. However, this supposition, a concoction of empty talking, is] self-evidently a fable, composed to gain the attention of an audience, not a natural philosopher’s argument searching for the truth and inferring from probabilities things not palpable to sense. Yet even if, in the belief that he was doing some good [to himself, the god] really [made the world and human beings], .................<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3">For god [is, I say], a living being, indestructible [and] blessed from [age to] age, having complete [self-sufficiency]. Moreover, what [god, if] he had existed for infinite [time] and enjoyed tranquillity [for thousands of years, would have got] this idea that he needed a city and fellow-citizens? Add to this absurdity that he, being a god, should seek to have beings as fellow-citizens.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 0px; " class="paragraph_style_3"> And there is this further point too: if he had created the world as a habitation and city for himself, I seek to know where he was living before the world was created; I do not find an answer, at any rate not one consistent with the doctrine of these people when they declare that this world is unique. So for that infinite time, apparently, the god of these people was cityless and homeless and, like an unfortunate man — I do not say «god» —, having neither city nor fellow-citizens, he was destitute and roaming about at random. If therefore the divine nature shall be deemed to have created things for its own sake, all this is absurd; and if for the sake of men, there are yet other more absurd consequences.<br /></p>

And this is not the only sign of its supremacy, but it is also the case that amputations of hands and often of whole arms or legs by fire and iron cannot unfasten life.

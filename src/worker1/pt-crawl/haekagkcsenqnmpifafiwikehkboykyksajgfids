clarify its membership requirements — over Sanders allies' vocal objections — by requiring every presidential candidate to sign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201207175811/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5759585-DNC-Loyalty-Pledge.html" target="_blank">the loyalty pledge</a>.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">The party sent all declared candidates the form last Wednesday and Thursday and they have one week to return it signed, according to a DNC spokesperson.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">But even now, the depth and

That's the same affiliation he ran on last year when he won another six-year term representing Vermont.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">When Sanders ran for president in 2016, there was some question about whether he would qualify for the ballot in New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, because state law requires candidates to be a member of the party they're seeking to represent in the general election.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">The chairman of the state Democratic party <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201207175811/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/sanders-files-new-hampshire-state-ballot-without-incident-n458271" target="_blank">personally accompanied</a> Sanders to the secretary of state's office to vouch for him and make sure the candidate would get on the ballot.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"I am the longest-serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. That’s how the people of Vermont sent me to Washington and I'm proud of that," Sanders told reporters after filing for his paperwork in New Hampshire in late 2015. "And I had to make a decision six months ago. Do I run as a Democrat or do I run as an Independent? And I made that decision. I am running as a Democrat, obviously. I am a Democrat now."</p><div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div><p class="endmarkEnabled">A reporter followed up by asking if Sanders would run in all potential future elections as a Democrat and Sanders replied, "Yes."

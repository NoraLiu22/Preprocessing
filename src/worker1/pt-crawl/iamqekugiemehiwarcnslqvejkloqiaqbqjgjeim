<p>Christina of Sweden was born on December
8, 1626 in Stockholm, Sweden.&nbsp;
Christina was the daughter of King Gustav II Adolf and Maria Eleonora of
Brandonburg.&nbsp; Christina's
birth had many implications in that at first the midwives thought she was born a
male.&nbsp; As
the kingdom celebrated the birth of the heir to the throne, they realized that
in fact the baby was a female (Stolpe 37).&nbsp;
As a child, her father had insisted on such a course in order to prepare
her for the throne.&nbsp;
Although Christina devoted much time to studying she also committed equal
time to male-identified activities, such as hunting and sport.&nbsp;
In her own words, Christina claimed to be, &quot;an ineradicable
prejudice against everything that women like to talk about or do.&nbsp;
In women's words and occupations I showed myself to be quite incapable,
and I saw no possibility of improvement in this respect&quot; (Stolpe 40).</p>
<p>
After
the death of her father, Christina became the queen-elect at the age of six.&nbsp;
Five agents headed by the chancellor Axel Oxenstierna governed the
country.&nbsp; When
Christina came of age and was crowned queen in 1644, she opposed Oxenstierna and
there was constant friction between them thereafter, in particular concerning
the Thirty Years War.&nbsp;
Although many significant powers opposed ending the war, Christina found
it was necessary.&nbsp;
She was the prime mover in concluding the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and
ending the war.</p>
<p>Pressured with the notion of naming her successor or marrying, Christina
appointed Charles Gustavus to succeed her.&nbsp;
When the question of her succession had finally been settled, Christina
turned with a clear conscience from politics to literature and science.&nbsp;
Christina called for learned men to form her court of learning.&nbsp;
Christina also sponsored artists and musicians, and financed hundreds of
theatrical and operatic performances.&nbsp;
For several years learned men, specialists in all branches of knowledge
arrived in Stockholm and formed the Court of Learning.&nbsp;
Because of this Sweden became known as &quot;Athens of the North&quot;
(Goldsmith 104).</p>
<p>In
her Court of Learning, Christina had many influential men of the time but the
most popular and Christina’s favorite was Rene Descartes. Christina became
very fond of Descartes and enjoyed their discussions. Descartes presented plans
of the Academy to Christina in 1650.&nbsp;
However, he contracted pneumonia and died only ten days later.&nbsp;
Christina was profoundly depressed by his death.&nbsp;
Descartes death marked the failure of her wild scheme to import learning
into a barbaric country, such as Sweden.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In
1650, Oxenstierna fell ill and Christina was left with plans of her coronation
as well as busying herself with the thought of abdication.&nbsp;
After her coronation, Christina began to worry about the Polish Question,
a problem that had haunted Europe forever.&nbsp;
John Casimir, the new Polish King was furious when Christina proclaimed
Charles Gustavus as her successor.&nbsp;
The Poles threatened war, and it was only by asking France to act as an
intermediary that Christina prevented open hostilities.&nbsp;
At a peace conference in Luebeck in 1651, the Poles refused to refer to
Christina as the &quot;Queen of Sweden.&quot;&nbsp;
Casimir was threatening to occupy Danzing, and Christina was forced to
send troops to Finland and Livonia while the conference was in progress.&nbsp;
The Swedes insisted that the poles finally recognize Christina as the
Queen of Sweden, and turn over Livoniato them.&nbsp;
The Poles refused and the conference did not result in a permanent
agreement.</p>
<p>
In 1651, Christine's vague desire to abdicate had crystallized into a definite
intention, but was discouraged by the council.&nbsp;
Christina suffered a sever breakdown and was confined to her bedroom.&nbsp;
She shocked attendants by asking frequently for Father Antonio Macedo.&nbsp;
They were afraid that, in her state of exhaustion, she would be extremely
influenced by this ardent Catholic.</p>
<p>In
1653, Christina felt that the time had come for her to leave Sweden.&nbsp;
She knew that her abdication would involve weeks, or months, of official
routine.&nbsp; Late
in March she sent for Gustavus and the abdication was complete.&nbsp;
Only days after the abdication, Christina left Stockholm, Christina
traveled to several places, disguised as a knight, before arriving in Rome.&nbsp;
During her travels she explored Catholicism and talked with many clergy
about her new religion.&nbsp;
Her intentions of adopting the Catholic faith were sincere, but the
branch of Catholicism that she chose was that of libertines, the
&quot;free-thinkers&quot; (Stolpe 183).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christina
arrived in Rome on December 19.&nbsp;
However, Christina's inevitable reaction to her new mode of life was not
long delayed.&nbsp; Sensitive
to the act that she was no longer the reigning Queen, she attempted to create
notoriety for herself by contemptuous manners.&nbsp;
Missing the activity of ruling, Christina entered negotiations with the
French chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, and with the Duke di Modena to seize
Naples, intending to become queen of Naples.&nbsp;
She promised to leave the throne to a French prince at her death.&nbsp;
This scheme collapsed in 1657.</p>
<p>Christina
visited Sweden two times since she abdicated her throne.&nbsp;
On the second journey she had Pope Clement IX's support in an attempt to
gain another crown, that of her second cousin John II Casimir Vasa, who had
abdicated the throne of Poland, but her failure seemed to please her since this
meant that she could return to her beloved Rome.&nbsp;
While back in Rome, Christina became friends with Cardinal Decio Azzolino,
who was the leader of a group of Cardinals active in church politics.&nbsp;
She, too, became active in church politics, insisting for years that on
the pursuance of the Christian war against the Turks.&nbsp;
Pope Innocent XI, who pushed this war to its victorious conclusion,
stopped her pension at her own urgent request in order to add it to the war
treasury.&nbsp; In
1681, having secured a trustworthy administrator for her lands in Sweden.&nbsp;
For the rest of her life, Christina lived in Rome as a pensioner of the
Pope.&nbsp; Christina
died on April 19, 1689 in Rome and in buried at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.</p>
<p>Christina continues to be a great historical emblem for women.&nbsp;
She rose above many standards of her time, including refusal to marriage
and converting to Catholicism.&nbsp;
Christina was a great supporter of the arts and sciences and pursued her
wish to create the "Athens of the North."&nbsp;
Christina is also significant for her political power.&nbsp;
She exercised considerable political finesse in both internal and foreign
affairs.&nbsp; Committed to peace, she helped to end the devastating Thirty Years war by negotiating the
Peace at Westphalia.&nbsp;
Christina was described by the director of the National Museum of Fine
Arts in Stockholm as "one of history’s greatest rebels and one of Sweden’s
first modern minds" (Lesbian News 52).&nbsp;

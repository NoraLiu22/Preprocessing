<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">July 1956</FONT> - The deadline passes for the
unifying elections set by the Geneva Conference. Diem, backed by the U.S.,
had refused to participate.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">November 1956</FONT> - Peasant unrest in North
Vietnam resulting from oppressive land reforms is put down by Communist
force with more than 6000 killed or deported. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80" size="+1">1957 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">January 1957</FONT> - The Soviet Union proposes
permanent division of Vietnam into North and South, with the two nations
admitted separately to the United Nations. The U.S. rejects the proposal,
unwilling to recognize Communist North Vietnam.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">May 8-18</FONT> - Diem pays a state visit to Washington
where President Eisenhower labels him the &quot;miracle man&quot; of Asia
and reaffirms U.S. commitment. &quot;The cost of defending freedom, of
defending America, must be paid in many forms and in many places...military
as well as economic help is currently needed in Vietnam,&quot; Eisenhower
states.</P>

<P>Diem's government, however, with its main focus on security, spends
little on schools, medical care or other badly needed social services in
the countryside. Communist guerrillas and propagandists in the countryside
capitalize on this by making simple promises of land reform and a better
standard of living to gain popular support among peasants.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">October 1957</FONT> - Viet Minh guerrillas begin
a widespread campaign of terror in South Vietnam including bombings and
assassinations. By year's end, over 400 South Vietnamese officials are
killed.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80" size="+1">1958 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">June 1958</FONT> - A coordinated command structure
is formed by Communists in the Mekong Delta where 37 armed companies are
being organized.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80" size="+1">1959</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">March 1959</FONT> - The armed revolution begins
as Ho Chi Minh declares a People's War to unite all of Vietnam under his
leadership. His Politburo now orders a changeover to an all-out military
struggle. Thus begins the Second Indochina War.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">May 1959</FONT> - North Vietnamese establish the
Central Office of South Vietnam (COSVN) to oversee the coming war in the
South. Construction of the Ho Chi Minh trail now begins. </P>

<P>The<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> trail will eventually expand into a 1500 mile-long
network of jungle and mountain passes extending from North Vietnam's coast
along Vietnam's western border through Laos, parts of Cambodia, funneling
a constant stream of soldiers and supplies into the highlands of South
Vietnam. In 1959, it takes six months to make the journey, by 1968 it will
take only six weeks due to road improvements by North Vietnamese laborers,
many of whom are women. In the 1970s a parallel fuel pipeline will be added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">July 1959</FONT> - 4000 Viet Minh guerrillas,
originally born in the South, are sent from North Vietnam to infiltrate
South Vietnam. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">July 8, 1959 </FONT>- Two U.S. military advisors,
Maj. Dale Buis and Sgt. Chester Ovnand, are killed by Viet Minh guerrillas
at Bien Hoa, South Vietnam. They are the first American deaths in the Second
Indochina War which Americans will come to know simply as The Vietnam War.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80" size="+1">1960</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">April 1960 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">- Universal
military conscription is imposed in North Vietnam. Tour of duty is indefinite.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">April 1960</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> - Eighteen
distinguished nationalists in South Vietnam send a petition to President
Diem advocating that he reform his rigid, family-run, and increasingly
corrupt, government. Diem ignores their advice and instead closes several
opposition newspapers and arrests journalists and intellectuals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">November 1960</FONT> - A failed coup against President
Diem by disgruntled South Vietnamese Army officers brings a harsh crackdown
against all perceived 'enemies of the state.' Over 50,000 are arrested
by police controlled by Diem's brother Nhu with many innocent civilians
tortured then executed. This results in further erosion of popular support
for Diem.</P>

<P>Thousands who fear arrest flee to North Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh will later
send many back to infiltrate South Vietnam as part of his People's Liberation
Armed Forces. Called Viet Cong by Diem, meaning Communist Vietnamese, Ho's
guerrillas blend into the countryside, indistinguishable from South Vietnamese,
while working to undermine Diem's government. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">December 20, 1960</FONT> - The National Liberation
Front is established by Hanoi as its Communist political organization for

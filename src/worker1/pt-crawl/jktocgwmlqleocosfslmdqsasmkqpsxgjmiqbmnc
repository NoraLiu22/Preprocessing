But it also is the best thing that has happened in several decades to the 1985 Yankees.</p><p>Remember them? Maybe not.</p><p>At the time, there was another baseball team based in New York City that tended to hog the headlines, already by 1985 and even more so the following year.</p><div class=""></div><p>In case you missed all that, ESPN has a <a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mets/30-for-30-86-mets-once-upon-a-time-in-flushing-1.50342624">four-hour documentary</a> on the subject due out next month.</p><p>But those ’85 Yankees deserve the attention they have gotten since the current Yankees won their 11th in a row on Tuesday night in Atlanta, their longest such streak in 36 years.</p><p>As electric as the Mets were that year, both teams suffered the same fate in that pre-wild card era.</p><p>The Mets won 98 games and missed the postseason, finishing three games behind the Cardinals. The Yankees won 97 and finished two games behind the Blue Jays. </p><div class="s2nPlayer-SGb5jQy3" data-type="full"></div><p>Speaking of that Toronto team, it played a central role in the most memorable day of the New York teams’ dual pennant races.</p><p>It was Sept. 12. The Mets were tied for first place and the Cardinals were in Queens for a day game. The home team won, 7-6, on Keith Hernandez’s walk-off single against his former team.</p><p>The Yankees were coming off a loss that followed that now-famous 11-game winning streak and were 2 ½ games behind the Blue Jays, who were in the Bronx for a night game.</p><div class=""></div><p>The home team won, 7-5, behind a three-run home run into the upper deck by catcher Ron Hassey.</p><p>Hassey, in his first season with the Yankees, said afterward, &quot;I’ve never been with a team that was so good that anything I did was this important.&quot;</p><p>(Personal aside: I was then three weeks into my current 36-year run at Newsday and attended both games as a fan, when the subway fare was 90 cents and woolly mammoths still roamed Central Park.)</p><p>Unfortunately for the Yankees, eight consecutive losses followed that big win over the Blue Jays, and they were unable to recover before the season ran out.</p><p>In 1986, the Mets won the World Series, and the Yankees saw their victory total go from 97 to 90.</p><div class=""></div><p>Then it fell to 89 in 1987, 85 in 1988, 74 in 1989 and finally 67 in 1990, when their .414 winning percentage was their worst since 1913.</p><p>But enough negativity. Let’s get back to celebrating the 1985 team. It was a good one!</p><p>Don Mattingly was the American League MVP after hitting 35 home runs, driving in 145 runs and batting .324. Rickey Henderson finished third in the MVP voting after scoring 146 runs and stealing 80 bases.</p><p>Dave Winfield had 26 home runs and 114 RBIs. Don Baylor added 23 and 91. Ron Guidry finished second in the AL Cy Young Award voting with a 22-6 record and a 3.27 ERA. Dave Righetti had 29 saves.</p><p>Phil Niekro earned his 300th career victory on the season’s final day, shutting out the Blue Jays. (Two months earlier, Tom Seaver picked up his 300th win at Yankee Stadium while pitching for the White Sox.)</p><div class=""></div><p>Ken Griffey Sr. was on that Yankees team, four years before his son made his big-league debut.</p><p>Billy Martin was the manager, having succeeded Yogi Berra 16 games into the season. Then the Yankees fired him for the fourth time after the season.</p><p>After the Yankees were eliminated, second baseman Willie Randolph said, &quot;I’m proud of what we did. I’m happy that the young players did so well. It tells you that we’re going to be a solid team for a long time to come.&quot;</p><p>It took the Yankees until 1996, with Randolph as their third base coach, to win another World Series.</p><p>It took until August 2021 for them to win 11 games in a row again.</p><div class=""></div><div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"><span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"><img alt="Neil Best" loading="lazy" width="88" height="104" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANTcxZmY5ZjktN2ZlNi00%3AZWJiZWQw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;w=96&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANTcxZmY5ZjktN2ZlNi00%3AZWJiZWQw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANTcxZmY5ZjktN2ZlNi00%3AZWJiZWQw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;w=256&amp;q=75"/></span><div><strong>By <a href="/people/neil-best">Neil Best</a></strong><div><a href="mailto:neil.best@newsday.com">neil.best@newsday.com</a><a class="tweet-handle Byline_tweet-handle__gK8cP" href="https://twitter.com/sportswatch"><svg class="icon Icon_icon__Haypr" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true"><use href="/img/site-icon-sprites.svg?v=newsday-prod-20240502130056#x-social-logo"></use></svg>@sportswatch</a></div></div><p>

Game 2 surely will have to be Tuesday (since the Knicks play Monday and Wednesday) though the NHL was waiting until after the conclusion of Game 7 between Boston and Toronto Saturday night before announcing the rest of the series schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe series is a battle of heavyweights. The Rangers won a league-high 55 games in the regular season and finished first overall, with 114 points. Carolina chased them all season in the race for the Metropolitan Division and ultimately finished second in the division and third overall.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe teams know each other very well, with both\u0026nbsp;returning most of their rosters from their ’playoff matchup two years ago, and with Rangers center Vincent Trocheck having played for Carolina in that last playoff series. He then\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;signed\u0026nbsp;with the Rangers as a free agent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour played for Rangers coach Peter Laviolette (he was his captain) when Laviolette coached the Hurricanes to the 2006 Stanley Cup.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHere are 5 Keys to the series.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHealth and depth\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRangers defenseman Adam Fox, who took a knee-to-knee hit in Game 4 of the first-round series against Washington, practiced Saturday after not practicing with the team Wednesday and Thursday. He pronounced himself good to go for Game 1. The same can’t be said for Carolina defenseman Brett Pesce, who didn’t make the trip to New York for Games 1 and 2. Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who has filled in for Pesce, got banged up in the Hurricanes’ series against the Islanders, but Brind’Amour said he is good to go. The Rangers’ K’Andre Miller took a puck to the face in practice Saturday, but Laviolette said he is OK.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Familiar foes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;These teams have played each other so much over the last few years —\u0026nbsp;seven regular season games the last two seasons, plus that seven-game classic in the playoffs two years ago —\u0026nbsp;there aren’t any secrets. The Hurricanes like to take a lot of shots, but everybody knows that. The Hurricanes play a man-to-man defensive system in the defensive zone, but everybody knows that, too, and the Rangers were working on attacking that in practice Thursday. And if there’s anything the Rangers don’t know about the ‘Canes, they can ask Trocheck for insight.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eMixing and matching up\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Brind’Amour likes to play the matchup game, and two years ago, he matched his checking line, centered by Jordan Staal, against the Rangers’ top line, centered by Mika Zibanejad, in the games in Carolina, and that proved effective, where the Hurricanes had the last line change. The Rangers have home ice advantage in this series, and so they’ll get the last line change in four of the seven\u0026nbsp;games if the series goes that long. Rangers coach Peter Laviolette likes to use a checking line at times, too, but he’s got four defensively capable centers in Zibanejad, Trocheck, Alex Wennberg and Barclay Goodrow, so he can more easily match any of his lines against any of Brind’Amour’s lines.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Net positive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith Igor Shesterkin as their goaltender, the Rangers are usually going to have the advantage in net against almost any opponent they face, but Frederik Andersen was fabulous down the stretch for Carolina as they chased the Rangers in the battle for the Metropolitan Division title. Andersen was great in the first round against the Islanders, though Shesterkin had slightly better numbers against Washington (a 1.75 goals-against average and .931 save percentage) than did Andersen against the Isles (2.25, .912).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial sauce\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The Hurricanes had the best penalty kill by percentage in the regular season and the second-best power play, while the Rangers’ power play and penalty kill were both third-best overall. “I think we've proven what we can do [on special teams],’’ Laviolette said Saturday. “I think that they've proven what they can do. And here we are.’’ In the playoffs, the Rangers are tied for fourth-best in the power play (37.5%), and Carolina is sixth (33.3%). The Rangers are fourth-best on the penalty kill (88.2%, plus two shorthanded goals) while Carolina is tied for ninth (72.7%).\u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2024-05-04T20:58:59.277Z","updatedDate":null,"url":"https://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/rangers/rangers-hk0gn3ot","headline":"Rangers-Hurricanes: 5 Keys to the Series","teaserTitle":"Rangers-Hurricanes: 5 Keys to the Series","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","gridFilter":[],"htmlBlurb":"","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.d","title":"Sports","path":"/sports","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Hockey.d","title":"Hockey","path":"/sports/hockey","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Hockey.Rangers.d","title":"New York Rangers","path":"/sports/hockey/rangers","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/0da9495c-02fc-413b-ae7c-86c7f489e328","title":"SPRANG240505","path":"/sports/hockey/rangers/rangers-hk0gn3ot","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"headline":"Colin Stephenson","name":"Colin Stephenson","role":"New York Rangers beat reporter","imageUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:NzZhMzNjZGUtMDcwNC00:MDAyNWMx/image.jpg","authorUrl":"/author/colin-stephenson","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tColin Stephenson covers the Rangers for Newsday.

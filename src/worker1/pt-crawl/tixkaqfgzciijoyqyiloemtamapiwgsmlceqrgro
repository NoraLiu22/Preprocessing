            place, from whence the science is derived. The law obtains its name 
            from justice; for (as Celsus elegantly says), law is the art of knowing 
            what is good and just.</strong></font></p>
          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>(1) 
            Anyone may properly call us the priests of this art, for we cultivate 
            justice and profess to know what is good and equitable, dividing right 
            from wrong, and distinguishing what is lawful from what is unlawful; 
            desiring to make men good through fear of punishment, but also by 
            the encouragement of reward; aiming (if I am not mistaken) at a true,

            Of this subject there are two divisions, public and private law. Public 
            law is that which has reference to the administration of the Roman 
            government; private law is that which concerns the interests of individuals; 
            for there are some things which are useful to the public, and others 
            which are of benefit to private persons. Public law has reference 
            to sacred ceremonies, and to the duties of priests and magistrates. 
            Private law is threefold in its nature, for it is derived either from 
            natural precepts, from those of nations, or from those of the Civil 
            Law.</strong></font></p>
          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>(3) 
            Natural law is that which nature teaches to all animals, for this 
            law is not peculiar to the human race, but affects all creatures which 
            deduce their origin from the sea or the land, and it is also common 
            to birds. From it proceeds the union of male and female which we designate 
            as marriage; hence also arises the procreation of children and the 
            bringing up of the same; for we see that all animals, and even wild 
            beasts, appear to be acquainted with this law.</strong></font></p>

            me latter is common to all animals, while the former only concerns 
            men in their relations to one another:</strong></font></p>

            that it is abominable for one man to lie in ambush for another.</strong></font></p>

          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Manumissions 
            also, are part of the Law of Nations, for manumission is dismissal 
            by the hand, that is to say the bestowal of freedom; for as long as 
            anyone is in servitude he is subject to the hand and to authority, 
            but, once manumitted, he is liberated from that authority. This takes 
            its origin from the Law of Nations; since, according to natural law 
            all persons were born free, and manumission was not known, as slavery 
            itself was unknown; but after slavery was admitted by the Law of Nations, 
            the benefit of manumission followed, and while men were designated 
            by one natural name there arose three different kinds under the Law 
            of Nations, that is to say freemen, and, in distinction to them, slaves, 
            and as a third class, freedmen, or those who had ceased to be slaves.</strong></font></p>

            anything is useful to all or to the majority in any state, as for 
            instance the Civil Law. Nor is honorary law less justly so designated 
            in Our State, and the Praetor also is said to administer the law even 
            when he decides unjustly; for the term has reference not to what the 
            Praetor actually does, but to that which it is suitable for him to 
            do. Under another signification, the word indicates the place where 
            justice is administered, the name being shifted from the act itself 
            to the locality where it is performed, and this locality may be determined 
            in the following manner; whenever the Praetor may designate a place 
            for the dispensation of justice, that place is properly called the 
            law, provided the dignity of his office and the customs of our ancestors

            Book I</i>.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>Being about to give an interpretation of ancient 
            laws, I have thought it necessary, in the first place, to go back 
            to the origin of the City, not because I wish to make extensive commentaries, 
            but for the reason that I notice that that is perfect in all things 
            which is finished in all its parts; and indeed the most important 
            part of anything is the beginning. Then, where causes are argued in 
            the forum, if I should say that it is abominable to state the matter 
            to the judge without making any previous remarks, it would be much 
            more improper for those making an explanation to neglect the beginning 
            and avoid reference to the origin of the case; proceeding with unwashed 
            hands, so to speak, without delay to discuss the question which is 
            to be decided. For, unless I am mistaken, these previous explanations 
            render persons more inclined to examine the question at issue, and 
            when we have approached it, make the comprehension of the subject 
            more clear.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>2. <i>Pomponius, Enchiridion</i>.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>It, therefore, seems necessary to explain the 
            origin of the law itself, as well as its subsequent development.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(1) In fact, at the beginning of our State the 
            people undertook to act at first without any certain statutes or positive 
            law, and all government was conducted by the authority of the Kings.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(2) Afterwards, the State being, to some extent 
            enlarged, it is said that Romulus himself divided the people into 
            thirty parts which he called <i>curiae;</i> because he then exercised 
            care over the Republic in accordance with the decisions of the said 
            parts. Thus he proposed to the people certain laws relating to their 
            assemblies, and subsequent kings also made similar proposals, all 
            of which having been committed to writing, are to be found in the 
            book of Sextus Papirius, who lived in the time of Superbus, the son 
            of Demaratus of Corinth, and who was one of the principal men. This 
            book, as We have stated, is called the Papirian Civil Law, not because 
            Papirius added anything of his own to it, but because he compiled 
            in a single treatise laws which had been passed without observing 
            any order.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(3) The kings having afterwards been expelled 
            by a Tribunitian enactment, all these laws became obsolete, and the 
            Roman people again began to be governed by uncertain laws and customs, 
            rather than by statutes regularly passed, and this state of affairs 
            thus endured for almost twenty years.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(4) Afterwards, in order that this condition might 
            not be continued, it was decided that ten men should be appointed 
            by public authority, through whose agency laws should be applied for 
            to the States of Greece, and that the Commonwealth should be founded 
            upon statutory enactments. Those thus obtained were inscribed upon 
            ivory tablets, and placed before the <i>Rostra</i>, so that the laws 
            might be the more clearly understood; and supreme authority in the 
            State was conferred upon said officials for that year, so that they 
            might amend the laws, if it was necessary, and interpret them; and 
            that there should be no appeal from their decisions, as there was 
            from those of other magistrates. They, themselves, observed that something 
            was lacking in these original laws, and therefore during the following 
            year they added two other tablets to them, and for this reason they 
            were called the Laws of the Twelve Tables; and some writers have asserted 
            that a certain Hermodorus, an Ephesian exile in Italy, was responsible 
            for the enactment of the said laws.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(5) These statutes having been passed, it follows 
            as a natural consequence that discussion in the forum became requisite; 
            as a proper interpretation demands the authority of persons learned 
            in the law. This discussion and this law composed by jurists and which 
            was unwritten, was not designated by any particular name, as were 
            the other parts of the law by their specific appellations, but they 
            are called by the common designation the Civil Law.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(6) Afterwards, at about the same time, certain 
            actions based upon these laws were established, by means of which 
            men might argue their cases; and in order to prevent the people from 
            bringing these actions in any way they might desire, the magistrate 
            required that this should be done in a certain and solemn manner; 
            and this part of the law is called that of statutory actions, that 
            is to say, legal actions. And thus about the same time these three 
            divisions of the law originated; that is, the Laws of the Twelve Tables, 
            and from these arose the Civil Law, and from this source likewise 
            were derived the legal actions. But the knowledge of interpreting 
            all these, and the actions themselves, were assigned to the College 
            of Pontiffs; and it was established which one of them should have 
            jurisdiction over private actions during each year. The people made 
            use of this custom for almost a century. </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(7) Afterwards, Appius Claudius arranged these 
            actions and reduced them to a certain form, and Gnaeus Flavius, his 
            secretary, the son of a freedman, gave the book to the people after 
            it had been surreptitiously obtained; and so acceptable was that gift 
            that he was made Tribune of the people, Senator, and Curule Aedile. 
            This work which contains the method of bringing actions is called 
            the Flavian Civil Law; just as the former one is called the Papirian 
            Civil Law; for Gnaeus Flavius did not add anything of his own to the 
            book. As the commonwealth became enlarged, for the reason that certain 
            methods of procedure were lacking, Sextus Aelius not long afterwards 
            framed other forms of action, and gave the book to the people which 
            is called the Aelian Law.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(8) Then, there being in use in the State the 
            Law of the Twelve Tables, the Civil Law, and that of Statutory Actions, 
            the result was that the <i>plebs </i>disagreed with the fathers, and 
            seceded, and enacted laws for itself, which laws are called Plebiscites. 
            Afterwards, when the <i>plebs</i> was recalled because much discord 
            arose on account of these plebiscites, it was established by the <i>Lex 
            Hortensia</i> that they should be observed as laws, and in consequence 
            of this the distinction between the plebiscites and the other laws 
            existed in the manner of their establishment, but their force and 
            effect were the same.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(9) Then, because it was difficult for the <i>plebs</i> 
            any longer to assemble, and much more so for the entire body of the 
            people to be collected in such a crowd of persons; necessity caused 
            the government of the commonwealth to be committed to the Senate. 
            Thus the Senate began to take an active part in legislation, and whatever 
            it decreed was observed, and this law was called a <i>Senatus-Consultum</i>.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(10) At the same time there was also magistrates 
            who dispensed justice, and in order that the citizens might know what 
            law was to be applied in any matter and defend themselves accordingly, 
            they proposed edicts, which Edicts of the Praetors constituted the 
            honorary law. It is styled honorary, because it originated from the 
            office of the Praetor. </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(11) Finally as it became necessary for the commonwealth 
            that the public welfare should be attended to by one person, for the 
            mode of enacting laws seemed to have progressed little by little as 
            occasion demanded; and since the Senate could not properly direct 
            the affairs of all the provinces, a supreme ruler was selected, and 
            he was given authority, so that whatever he decided should be considered 
            valid.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(12) Thus, in Our commonwealth everything depends 
            either upon statute, that is upon legal enactment; or there exists 
            a peculiar Civil Law which is founded without writing upon the sole 
            interpretation of jurists; or there are the statutory actions which 
            contain the method of procedure; or there is a plebiscite passed without 
            the authority of the fathers; or there is the edict of the magistrate, 
            whence is derived the honorary law; or there is the <i>Senatus-Consultum</i>, 
            which is based upon the action of the Senate alone, without any statute; 
            or there is the Imperial Constitution, that is, that whatever the 
            Emperor himself formulates shall be observed as the law.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(13) After the origin of the law and the procedure 
            have been ascertained, it follows that We should be informed concerning 
            the titles of magistrates and their origin; because, as We have stated, 
            it is through those who preside over the administration of justice 
            that matters are rendered effective; for how much law could there 
            be in a State unless there are persons who can administer it? Next 
            in order after this, We shall speak of the succession of authorities; 
            for law cannot exist unless there are individuals learned in the same, 
            by means of whom it can daily be improved.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(14) As to what concerns magistrates, there is 
            no question but that in the beginning of the commonwealth all power 
            was vested in the kings.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(15) There existed at the same time a <i>Tribunus 
            Celerum</i> who commanded the knights, and held the second rank after 
            the king; to which body Junius Brutus, who was responsible for the 
            expulsion of the kings, belonged.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(16) After the kings were expelled two consuls 
            were appointed, and it was established by law that they should be 
            clothed with supreme authority. They were so called from the fact 
            that they specially &quot;consulted&quot; the interests of the republic; 
            but to prevent them from claiming for themselves royal power in all 
            things, it was provided by enactment that an appeal might be taken 
            from their decisions; and that they should not be able, without the 
            order of the people, to punish a Roman citizen with death, and the 
            only thing left to them was the exertion of force and the power of 
            public imprisonment. </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(17) Subsequently, when the census occupied much 
            time, and the consuls were not able to discharge this duty, censors 
            were appointed.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(18) Then, the people having increased in numbers, 
            and frequent wars against neighboring tribes having taken place, it 
            sometimes became necessary for a magistrate of superior authority 
            to be appointed, and hence dictators arose, from whose decisions no 
            right of appeal existed; and who were invested with the power of capital 
            punishment. As this magistrate had supreme authority, he was not allowed 
            to retain it for a longer period than six months.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(19) To these dictators Masters of Cavalry were 
            added, who occupied the same place as the <i>Tribuni Celerum</i> under 
            the King, whose duties were almost the same as those discharged at 
            present by the Praetorian Prefect; and they were also considered lawful 
            magistrates.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(20) At the time when the <i>plebs</i> had seceded 
            from the fathers, about seventeen years after the expulsion of the 
            Kings, they created tribunes for themselves on the Sacred Mount, who 
            were Tribunes of the People; and they were called &quot;tribunes&quot; 
            for the reason that formerly the people were divided into three parts, 
            and one tribune was taken from each one, or because they were created 
            by the votes of the tribes.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(21) Again, that there might be officials who 
            would have charge of the temples in which the people deposited all 
            their statutes, two persons were selected from the <i>plebs</i> who 
            were styled Aediles. </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(22) Next, when the Public Treasury began to increase 
            in importance, Quaestors were appointed to have charge of the same, 
            and to take care of the funds, and they were so called because they 
            were created for the purpose of examining the accounts and preserving 
            the money.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(23) And for the reason (as We have already stated), 
            that the consuls were not permitted by law to inflict capital punishment, 
            without the order of the Roman people; Quaestors were also appointed 
            by the people to preside in capital cases, and these were designated 
            <i>Quaestores parricidii, </i>of whom mention is made in the Laws 
            of the Twelve Tables.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(24) And as it was also determined that laws should 
            be enacted, it was proposed to the people that all magistrates should 
            resign in order that <i>Decemviri</i> might be appointed for one year; 
            but as the latter prolonged their term of office, and acted in an 
            unjust manner, and were not willing afterwards to elect the magistrates 
            who were to succeed them, so that they and their faction might retain 
            the commonwealth constantly under their control; they conducted the 
            public affairs in such an arbitrary and violent manner that the army 
            withdrew from the commonwealth. It is said that the cause of the succession 
            was one Virginius, who when he learned that Appius Claudius, in violation 
            of the provision which he himself had transferred from the ancient 
            law of the Twelve Tables, had refused to give him control of his own 
            daughter, but gave it to a man who, instigated by him, claimed her 
            <i>as</i> a slave, as he, influenced by love for the girl, had confounded 
            right and wrong; and the said Virginius being indignant that the observance 
            of a law of great antiquity had been violated with reference to the 
            person of his daughter, (just as Brutus who, as the first Consul of 
            Rome had granted temporary freedom to Vindex, a slave of the Vitelli, 
            who had revealed by his testimony a treasonable conspiracy) and thinking 
            the chastity of his daughter should be preferred to her life, having 
            seized a knife from the shop of a butcher, killed her, in order that, 
            by the death of the girl, he might protect her from the disgrace of 
            violation; and immediately after the murder, when still wet with the 
            blood of his daughter, he fled to his fellow soldiers, all of whom 
            deserting their leaders at Algidiun (where the legions were at the 
            time for the purpose of waging war) transferred their standards to 
            the Aventine Hill; and soon all the people of the city at once betook 
            themselves to the same place, and by popular consent some of the <i>Decemviri</i> 
            were put to death in prison, and the commonwealth resumed its former 
            condition.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(25) Then, some years after the Twelve Tables 
            had been enacted, a controversy arose between the <i>plebs</i> and 
            the fathers, the former wishing to create consuls from their own body 
            and the fathers refusing to consent to this; it was resolved that 
            military tribunes should be created with consular power, partly from 
            the <i>plebs</i>, and partly from the fathers. The number of these 
            was different at various times, sometimes there were twenty of them, 
            sometimes more than that, and sometimes less.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(26) Subsequently it was decided that consuls 
            could be taken from the <i>plebs</i>, and they began to be appointed 
            from both bodies; but in order that the fathers might have more power, 
            it was determined that two officials should be appointed from the 
            number of the latter, and hence the Curule Aediles originated.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(27) And as the consuls were called away by distant 
            wars, and there was no one who could dispense justice in the State, 
            it happened that a Praetor also was created, who was styled &quot;Urbanus&quot;, 
            because he dispensed justice in the city.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(28) Then, after some years, this Praetor, not 
            being found sufficient because of the great crowd of foreigners who 
            came into the city, another Praetor called &quot;<i>Peregrinus</i>&quot; 
            was appointed, for the reason that he usually dispensed justice among 
            foreigners.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(29) Then, as a magistrate was necessary to preside 
            over public sales, <i>Decemviri</i> were appointed for deciding cases.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(30) At the same time <i>Quatuorviri</i> also 
            were appointed who had supervision of the highways, and <i>Triumviri</i>, 
            who had control of the mint, who melted bronze, silver, and gold, 
            and capital <i>Triumviri</i>, who had charge of the prisons, so that 
            when it was necessary to inflict punishment it might be done by their 
            agency.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(31) And, for the reason that it was inconvenient 
            for magistrates to appear in public during the evening, <i>Quinqueviri</i> 
            were appointed on each side of the Tiber, who could discharge the 
            duties of magistrates.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(32) After Sardinia had been taken, and then Sicily 
            and Spain, and subsequently the Narbonnese province, as many Praetors 
            were created as there were provinces which had come under the Roman 
            rule; part of whom had jurisdiction over matters in cities, and part 
            over provincial affairs. Next Cornelias Sylla established public investigations, 
            as for instance, those concerning forgery, parricide, and assassins, 
            and added four Praetors. Then Gaius Julius Caesar appointed two Praetors 
            and two aediles, who superintended the distribution of grain, and 
            were called <i>Cereales, </i>from Ceres. In this way twelve Praetors 
            and six aediles were created. Then the Divine Augustus appointed sixteen 
            Praetors, and afterwards the Divine Claudius added two more who administered 
            justice in matters of trust; one of whom the Divine Titius dispensed 
            with; and the Divine Nerva added another who expounded the law in 
            questions arising between the Treasury and private individuals. Thus 
            eighteen Praetors administered justice in the Commonwealth.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(33) All these regulations are observed as long 
            as the magistrates are at home, but whenever they travel abroad one 
            is left who expounds the law, and he is styled the Prefect of the 
            City. This Prefect was created in former times; he was afterwards 
            appointed on account of the Latin festivals, and this is done every 
            year; but the Prefect of Subsistence and that of the Night Watch are 
            not magistrates, but are extraordinary officials appointed for the 
            public welfare; and also those whom we have mentioned as being appointed 
            for this side of the Tiber, were afterwards created aediles by a decree 
            of the Senate.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(34) Therefore, from all these things we learn 
            ten Tribunes of the People, two Consuls, eighteen Praetors, and six 
            aediles dispensed justice in the city.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(35) Many distinguished men have been professors 
            of the science of the Civil Law; and of these at present We will mention 
            those who enjoyed the highest esteem among the Roman people; to the 
            end that it may appear from whom these laws have been derived and 
            handed down, and what was their reputation. And, indeed, among all 
            who acquired this knowledge, it is said that no one publicly professed 
            it before Tiberius Coruncanius; others, however, before him attempted 
            to keep the Civil Law secret, and only to give advice to those who 
            consulted them, rather than to instruct such as desired to learn. 
            </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(36) Publius Papirius, who compiled the royal 
            laws in one treatise, was in the first rank of those versed in the 
            Royal Statutes; then came Appius Claudius, one of the <i>Decemviri</i> 
            who took the most prominent part in the compilation of the Twelve 
            Tables. After him, another Appius Claudius was the possessor of great 
            legal learning, and he was called &quot;Hundred Handed&quot;, for 
            he laid out the Appian Way, constructed the Claudian Aqueduct, and 
            gave it as his opinion that Pyrrhus should not be received into the 
            city; it is also said that he drew up forms of action in cases of 
            wrongful occupation of property, which book no longer exists. The 
            same Appius Claudius invented the letter R, from which it resulted 
            that the Valesii became Valerii, and the Fusii became Furii.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(37) After these came Sempronius, a man of preeminent 
            learning, whom the Roman people called sofoV, that is to say, &quot;wise&quot;, 
            nor was anyone either before or after him designated by this title. 
            Next in order was Gaius Scipio Nasica, who was styled by the Senate 
            &quot;The Best&quot;, to whom a house on the <i>Via Sacra</i> was 
            given by the State where he might the more easily be consulted. Then 
            came Quintus Mucius, who was sent as envoy to the Carthaginians, where 
            when two dice were placed before him, one for peace and the other 
            for war, and it was left to his judgment to select whichever he chose 
            and take it to Rome; he took both, and said that the Carthaginians 
            must ask for whichever one they preferred to have. </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(38) After these came Tiberius Coruncanius, who, 
            as I have already stated, was the first of the professors of the law, 
            but no work of his is extant; his opinions, however, were very numerous 
            and remarkable. Next in order Sextus Aelius, his brother Publius Aelius, 
            and Publius Atilius had the greatest success in imparting instruction; 
            so that the two Aelii<i> </i>also became consuls and Atilius was the 
            first person invested by the people with the appellation of &quot;The 
            Learned&quot;. Ennius praises also Sextus Aelius and a book of his 
            entitled <i>Tripertita</i> which still exists and contains, as it 
            were, the cradle of the laws. It is called <i>Tripertita</i> because 
            it includes the Law of the Twelve Tables, to which it added the interpretation 
            of the same, as well as the method of legal procedure. Three other 
            books are also attributed to him of which, however, certain writers 
            deny him the authorship. Cato, to a certain degree, followed these 
            men. Subsequently came Marcus Cato, the head of the Porcian family 
            whose books are extant; but a great many were written by his son, 
            from which still others derive their origin.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(39) After these came Publius Mucius, Brutus, 
            and Manilius, who founded the Civil Law. Among them Publius Mucius 
            left ten works, Brutus seven, and Manilius three; and written volumes 
            of Manilius are also extant. The first two were of consular rank, 
            Brutus was Praetor, and Publius Mucius had been Pontifex Maximus.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(40) After these came Publius Rutilius Rufus, 
            who was Consul at Rome, and Proconsul of Asia, Paulus Virginius, and 
            Quintus Tubero, the Stoic, a pupil of Pansa, who was himself Consul. 
            Sextus Pompeius, the paternal uncle of Gnaeus Pompeius, lived at the 
            same time, and Caelius Antipater, who wrote historical works, but 
            paid more attention to eloquence than to the science of the law. There 
            was also Lucius Crassus, the brother of Publius Mucius, who was called 
            Mucianus, and whom Cicero declared to be the best debater of all the 
            jurists.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(41) After these came Quintus Mucius, the son 
            of Publius, the Pontifex Maximus, who first codified the Civil Law 
            by drawing it up under different heads in eighteen books.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(42) The pupils of Mucius were very numerous, 
            but those of most eminent authority were Aquilius Gallus, Balbus Lucilius, 
            Sextus, Papirius, and Gaius Juventius; of whom Servius declared that 
            Gallus had the greatest authority among the people. All of them, however, 
            are mentioned by Servius Sulpicius, but none of their writings are 
            of such a kind as to be generally sought after; and, in fact, their 
            works are not usually found in men's hands at all, though Servius 
            made use of them in his own books, and on this account it is that 
            the memory of them still survives.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(43) Servius, while he held the first place in 
            arguing cases, or, at all events, held it after Marcus Tullius, is 
            said to have applied to Quintus Mucius for advice concerning a matter 
            in which a friend of his was interested, and as he had a very imperfect 
            comprehension of the answer given him concerning the law, questioned 
            Quintus a second time, and when the latter replied and he still did 
            not understand, he was rebuked by Quintus Mucius, who told him that 
            it was a disgrace for him, a patrician, a noble, and an advocate, 
            to be ignorant of the law which was his profession. Servius was so 
            affected by this reproach that he devoted his attention to the Civil 
            Law, and was especially instructed by those of whom We have spoken; 
            having been taught by Balbus Lucilius, and also having received much 
            information from Gallus Aquilius, who resided at Cercina; and for 
            this reason many of his books which are still extant were written 
            there. When Servius died while absent on an embassy, the Roman people 
            erected a statue to him in front of the <i>Rostra</i>, and it stands 
            there to-day before the <i>Rostra</i> of Augustus. Many volumes of 
            his remain, for he left nearly one hundred and eighty treatises.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(44) After him came many others, among whom nearly 
            all of the following wrote books, namely: Alfenus Varus, Gaius, Aulus 
            Ofilius, Titus Caesius, Aufidius Tucca, Aufidius Namusa, Flavius Priscus, 
            Gaius Ateius, Pacuvius, Labeo, Antistius, the father of Labeo Antistius, 
            Cinna, and Publicus Gellius. Of ten eight wrote treatises, all of 
            which were digested by Aufidius Namusa in a hundred and forty books. 
            Of these pupils Alfenus Varus and Aulus Ofilius possessed the greatest 
            authority; Varus became Consul, but Ofilius remained in the Equestrian 
            rank; the latter was very intimate with the Emperor, and left many 
            works on the Civil Law, which laid the foundation for the greater 
            part of the same, for he first wrote on the laws of the five per cent 
            tax, and on jurisdiction. He was also the first one to carefully systematize 
            the Edict of the Praetor, although before him Servius had left two 
            extremely short books relating to the Edict, which were addressed 
            to Brutus.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(45) Trebatius, a pupil of Cornelius Maximus, 
            also lived at the same time; and Aulus Cascelius, a pupil of Quintus 
            Mucius Volusius, as well, and, indeed, in honor of his teacher he 
            left his property to Publius Mucius, the grandson of the latter. He 
            was also of quaestorian rank but he declined promotion, although Augustus 
            offered him the consulship. Among these, Trebatius is said to have 
            been better informed than Cascellius, but Cascellius is claimed to 
            have been more eloquent than Trebatius, but Ofilius was more learned 
            than either. No works of Cascellius are extant, except one of &quot;Good 
            Sayings&quot;, there are, however, several of Trebatius, but they 
            are very little used.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(46) After this came Tubero, who studied under 
            Ofilius. He was a patrician and abandoned arguing cases for the study 
            of the Civil Law, principally because he had prosecuted Quintus Ligarius 
            before Gaius Caesar, and failed. This is the same Quintus Ligarius 
            that, while he was holding the shore of Africa, refused to allow Tubero, 
            who was ill, to land and obtain water, for which reason he accused 
            him, and Cicero defended him. The oration of the latter, a very elegant 
            one, which is entitled &quot;For Quintus Ligarius&quot;, is still 
            extant. Tubero was considered to be most learned in both public and 
            private law, and left a great many treatises on both subjects. He 
            had the affectation of writing in ancient language and therefore his 
            works are not popular.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(47) After him the following were of the highest 
            authority, namely, Ateius Capito, who followed Ofilius, and Antistius 
            Labeo, who studied under all of them, he was also taught by Trebatius. 
            Of these Ateius was Consul, but Labeo declined to accept the office 
            which would have made him temporary consul when it was offered to 
            him by Augustus; but he gave great attention to legal studies, and 
            divided up the entire year so that he could be at Rome for six months 
            with his pupils, and might be absent for the remaining six months, 
            and employ his time in writing books. By doing this he left four hundred 
            volumes, of which a great many are still in use. These two founded, 
            as it were, two different schools, for Ateius Capito retained the 
            principles which had been taught him; but Labeo, from the nature of 
            his genius and his reliance upon his own learning, and who had given 
            attention to other branches of knowledge, made many innovations. </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(48)&nbsp;Massurius Sabinus succeeded Ateius Capito, 
            and Nerva, Labeo; and these still further increased the aforesaid 
            distinction between the schools. Nerva was also very intimate with 
            the Emperor. Massurius Sabinus was of Equestrian rank, and was the 
            first who wrote with public authority, and after this privilege was 
            conceded, it was also granted to him by Tiberius Caesar.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(49)&nbsp;And We may remark, in passing, that 
            prior to the reign of Augustus, the right of giving opinions publicly 
            was not granted by the chiefs of the State, but anyone who had confidence 
            in his own attainments gave answers to those who consulted him, but 
            they did not impress their seals upon the latter, and very frequently 
            wrote to the judges, or to those who had consulted them, to bear witness 
            to their opinions. The Divine Augustus, in order to enable the authority 
            of the law to have greater weight, first decreed that jurists might 
            answer in his name; and from that time, this began to be claimed as 
            a privilege. The result was that the distinguished Emperor Hadrian, 
            when certain men of praetorian rank asked of him leave to deliver 
            opinions, told them in a rescript, &quot;that this permission was 
            not to be asked, but was granted as a right; and therefore if anyone 
            had confidence in his knowledge, he should be delighted, and he might 
            prepare himself for giving opinions to the people.&quot;</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(50)&nbsp;Therefore, permission was given to Sabinus 
            by Tiberius Caesar to give opinions to the people. He was already 
            advanced in age when he attained to the Equestrian rank, and indeed 
            was fifty years old, nor was he a man of great pecuniary resources, 
            but was, for the most part, supported by his pupils. </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(51)&nbsp;He was succeeded by Gaius Cassius Longinus, 
            the son of a daughter of Tubero, who was the granddaughter of Servius 
            Sulpicius; and for this reason he alluded to Servius Sulpicius as 
            his grandfather. He was Consul with Quartinus during the reign of 
            Tiberius, and enjoyed great authority in the State until the Emperor 
            banished him, and having been exiled to Sardinia by the latter, he 
            was recalled by Vespasian to Rome, where he died.</strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(52)&nbsp;Proculus succeeded Nerva, and there 
            was, at the same time, another Nerva, a son; there was also another 
            Longinus, belonging to the Equestrian order, who afterwards attained 
            to the Praetorship. The authority of Proculus was, however, greater. 
            The adherents of the two schools were designated respectively, Cassiani 
            and Proculeiani, having derived their origin from Capito and Labeo. 
            </strong></p>
          <p class="Ak"><strong>(53)&nbsp;Caelius Sabinus, who had greater influence 
            in the time of Vespasian, succeeded Cassius; Pegasus succeeded Proculus, 
            who was Prefect of the City during the reign of Vespasian; Priscus 
            Javolenus succeeded Caelius Sabinus; Celsus succeeded Pegasus; the 
            son Celsus and Priscus Neratius, both of whom were consuls, succeeded 
            his father; (Celsus, indeed, was Consul a second time), Aburnus Valens 
            succeeded Javolenus Priscus along with Tuscinaus, as well as Salvius

            having been expelled from the city, should bring forth a child, whether 
            that child should be free or a slave? It was very properly established 
            that it was born free; and that it is sufficient for a child who is 
            unborn that its mother should have been free during the intermediate 
            time.</strong></font></p>

            were born while it existed. Moreover, if his wife conceives while 
            he is insane, it must be considered whether the child is born under 
            his control or not; for although an insane person cannot marry, he 
            can still retain his matrimonial condition; and since this is the 
            case he will have his son under his control. In like manner, if his 
            wife becomes insane, a child conceived by her previous to her insanity 
            is born under his control; but if it is conceived while she was insane 
            and her husband was not, it undoubtedly is born under his control, 
            for the reason that the marriage still exists. But if both husband 
            and wife are insane, and she then conceives, the child is born under 
            the control of its father; for it is presumed that insane persons 
            still have some will remaining; and, as the marriage relation continues 
            while one or the other is insane, it also does so when both are in 
            that condition.</strong></font></p>

            are, for example, walls and gates, which, to a certain extent, are 
            under Divine law. For what is subject to Divine law is not the property 
            of anyone, and that indeed which belongs to human law is, for the 
            most part, the property of someone, nevertheless, it may belong to 
            none, for things belonging to an estate until an heir appears, are 
            not the property of anyone. Again, those things that are under human 
            law are either public or private. Those which are public are held 
            to be the property of no one, and are considered to belong to the

            are corporeal which are tangible, as for instance land, slaves, clothing, 
            gold, silver, as well as innumerable other articles. Those are incorporeal 
            which cannot be touched as an usufruct, and obligations, in whatever 
            way contracted. It does not matter if corporeal things are included 
            in an estate, for the crops taken from land are corporeal, and whatever 
            is owing to us through the obligation of another, is for the most 
            part corporeal, as land, slaves, money; still, the right of succession, 
            the right of use and enjoyment, and the right based upon an obligation

            Prefect was derived. It has been asserted by some writers that Praetorian 
            Prefects were formerly created instead of Masters of Cavalry; for, 
            as in the time of the ancients the supreme power was occasionally 
            conferred upon dictators, they were accustomed to choose their Masters 
            of Cavalry, who were associated with them in the discharge of their 
            military duties, and held the next rank after them. The government 
            of the republic having been permanently transferred to the Emperors, 
            Praetorian Prefects were chosen by those princes, just as had been 
            done in the case of the Masters of Cavalry, and upon them was conferred 
            greater power for the purpose of promoting public discipline.</strong></font></p>
          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>(1) 
            The authority of the Prefects having originated in this manner, it 
            was subsequently increased to such an extent that no appeal can be 
            taken from the decision of a Praetorian Prefect; for when formerly 
            a question arose as to whether an appeal could be taken from the decision 
            of a Praetorian Prefect, which, in fact, was allowed by law, and examples 
            of those who did so are extant; afterwards, by an Imperial Decree 
            publicly promulgated, the right of appeal was forbidden. For the Emperor 
            thought that those who were appointed to this high office on account 
            of their eminent industry, after their discernment and integrity had 
            been established, would render judgment not otherwise than he himself 
            would do, the wisdom and enlightenment attaching to their rank being

            do this, unless for specific reasons), but that they may humbly apply 
            to him where their masters treat them with cruelty, harshness, or 
            starve them, or may state to the Prefect of the City that they have 
            been forced to endure indecent attacks. It was also a duty imposed

          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>The 
            origin of Quaestor is very ancient, more so than that of almost any 
            other magistracy. Gracchanus Julius, in the Seventh Book &quot;On 
            Authorities&quot;, relates that Romulus himself, and Numa Pompilius 
            had two Quaestors not appointed by themselves, but by the votes of 
            the people; but even if doubt exists whether there was any Quaestor 
            during the reigns of Romulus and Numa, it is certain that Quaestors 
            existed during that of Tullus Hostilius; and, indeed, it is the prevalent 
            opinion of ancient writers that Tullus Hostilius was the first to 
            introduce Quaestors into the government of the commonwealth.</strong></font></p>
          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>(1) 
            Junius, Trebatius, and Fenestella deduced the origin of the word Quaestor 
            from <i>quaero</i> (to seek).</strong></font></p>
          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>(2) 
            Some of the Quaestors were accustomed to draw lots for the provinces 
            assigned by the decree of the Senate, which was also done under the 
            consulate of Decimus Drusus and Porcina. All the Quaestors, however, 
            did not obtain their provinces by lot, the candidates of the Emperor 
            being excepted, for these were only employed in reading the Imperial 
            Epistles in the Senate.</strong></font></p>
          <p class="Ak"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>(3) 
            At present, Quaestors are taken indiscriminately from patricians and 
            plebeians; for the place is an entrance to, and, so to speak, the 
            beginning of other offices, and confers the right to state one's opinion

            Philippus, a fugitive slave, sought the praetorship of Rome, and was 
            appointed Praetor. Pomponius is of the opinion that his condition 
            as a slave was no obstacle to his holding the office of Praetor. It 
            is true that he performed the duties of that office, still, let us 
            consider the case of a slave having kept his condition secret for 
            a long time, while he discharged his duty as Praetor. Will all that 
            he decided or decreed be of no force or effect? What shall We say? 
            Or will it be valid on account of the welfare of those who instituted 
            proceedings before him either under the law, or by virtue of some 
            other legal right? Indeed, I think that none of these things should 
            be rejected; for this is the more humane view to take, since the Roman 
            people had the power to invest a slave with this authority, and if 
            they had known that he was such they would have granted him his freedom. 
            Much more must this right be considered well founded with respect

            in order that each cohort might protect two quarters of the city; 
            these were commanded by tribunes, and above them was a superior officer

            so savage and notorious, that he is turned over to the Prefect of 
            the City. And as, for the most part, fires are caused by the negligence 
            of the inhabitants, he either has those whipped who have been careless 
            in regard to fire, or he remits the whipping, and gives them a severe

            or a chest, and those who are appointed to guard this property are

            to the preservation and observance of this custom and of privileges 
            of this description. There are some provinces to which the Proconsul 
            goes by sea, as, for instance, Asia; and to such an extent was this 
            carried that our Emperor Antoninus Augustus stated in a Rescript, 
            in reply to a request of the Asiatics, &quot;That the Proconsul was 
            absolutely required to proceed to Asia by sea, and to land at Ephesus,

            does not yet himself possess; for he is not entitled to the same until 
            he enters the province. If, however, he should do this before, and 
            after having entered the province should not change his mind, it would 
            probably be decided that the Deputy has jurisdiction, not from the 
            time when it had been conferred upon him, but from the day when the 
            Proconsul entered the province. </strong></font></p>

            an ancient proverb, viz: 'Not all things should be received, nor at 
            all times, nor from all persons'; for, indeed, it is impolite to accept 
            gifts from no one; but, on the other hand it is most despicable, and 
            most avaricious to accept without distinction everything that is given.&quot; 
            And as to what is contained in the Imperial Mandates, namely: &quot;That 
            the Proconsul himself, or any other person in office shall accept 
            no gift or present, and shall not even purchase anything except for 
            the purpose of daily subsistence&quot;; this has no reference to small 
            gratuities, but to those which exceed the requirements of ordinary 
            support. Nor should such presents be extended to the point of making 
            donations of great value.</strong></font></p>

            evincing any discontent, since the people of the province do this 
            in his honor; and he should also appoint festivals in accordance with

            if he ascertains that parties have trumped up cases, or purchased

            strong argument in favor of this is, that in the <i>Lex Julia de Vi</i>

<p>The historical record provides compelling
evidence that racism underlies gun control laws -- and not in any
subtle way. Throughout much of American history, gun control was
openly stated as a method for keeping blacks and Hispanics
"in their place," and to quiet the racial fears of
whites. This paper is intended to provide a brief summary of this
unholy alliance of gun control and racism, and to suggest that
gun control laws should be regarded as "suspect ideas,"
analogous to the "suspect classifications" theory of
discrimination already part of the American legal system. </font></p>

<p>Racist arms laws predate the establishment of
the United States. Starting in 1751, the French Black Code
required Louisiana colonists to stop any blacks, and if
necessary, beat "any black carrying any potential weapon,
such as a cane." If a black refused to stop on demand, and
was on horseback, the colonist was authorized to "shoot to
kill."<b>[1]</b> Slave possession of firearms was a
necessity at times in a frontier society, yet laws continued to
be passed in an attempt to prohibit slaves or free blacks from
possessing firearms, except under very restrictively controlled
conditions.<b>[2]</b> Similarly, in the sixteenth century the
colony of New Spain, terrified of black slave revolts, prohibited
all blacks, free and slave, from carrying arms.<b>[3]</b> </p>

<p>In the Haitian Revolution of the 1790s, the
slave population successfully threw off their French masters, but
the Revolution degenerated into a race war, aggravating existing
fears in the French Louisiana colony, and among whites in the
slave states of the United States. When the first U. S. official
arrived in New Orleans in 1803 to take charge of this new
American possession, the planters sought to have the existing
free black militia disarmed, and otherwise exclude "free
blacks from positions in which they were required to bear
arms," including such non-military functions as
slave-catching crews. The New Orleans city government also
stopped whites from teaching fencing to free blacks, and then,
when free blacks sought to teach fencing, similarly prohibited
their efforts as well.<b>[4]</b> </p>

<p>It is not surprising that the first North
American English colonies, then the states of the new republic,
remained in dread fear of armed blacks, for slave revolts against
slave owners often degenerated into less selective forms of
racial warfare. The perception that free blacks were sympathetic
to the plight of their enslaved brothers, and the dangerous
example that "a Negro could be free" also caused the
slave states to pass laws designed to disarm all blacks, both
slave and free. Unlike the gun control laws passed after the
Civil War, these antebellum statutes were for blacks alone. In
Maryland, these prohibitions went so far as to prohibit free
blacks from owning dogs without a license, and authorizing any
white to kill an unlicensed dog owned by a free black, for fear
that blacks would use dogs as weapons. Mississippi went further,
and prohibited any ownership of a dog by a black person.<b>[5]</b>
</p>

<p>Understandably, restrictions on slave
possession of arms go back a very long way. While arms
restrictions on <i>free</i> blacks predate it, these restrictions
increased dramatically after Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831, a
revolt that caused the South to become increasingly irrational in
its fears.<b>[6]</b> Virginia's response to Turner's Rebellion
prohibited free blacks "to keep or carry any firelock of any
kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead..." The
existing laws under which free blacks were occasionally licensed
to possess or carry arms was also repealed, making arms
possession completely illegal for free blacks.<b>[7]</b> But even
before this action by the Virginia Legislature, in the aftermath
of Turner's Rebellion, the discovery that a free black family
possessed lead shot for use as scale weights, without powder or
weapon in which to fire it, was considered sufficient reason for
a frenzied mob to discuss summary execution of the owner.<b>[8]</b>
The analogy to the current hysteria where mere possession of
ammunition in some states without a firearms license may lead to
jail time, should be obvious. </p>

<p>One example of the increasing fear of armed
blacks is the 1834 change to the Tennessee Constitution, where
Article XI, 26 of the 1796 Tennessee Constitution was revised
from: "That the freemen of this State have a right to keep
and to bear arms for their common defence,"<b>[9]</b> to:
"That the free <i>white</i> men of this State have a right
to keep and to bear arms for their common defence."<b>[10]</b>
[emphasis added] It is not clear what motivated this change,
other than Turner's bloody insurrection. The year before, the
Tennessee Supreme Court had recognized the right to bear arms as
an individual guarantee, but there is nothing in that decision
that touches on the subject of race.<b>[11]</b> </p>

<p>Other decisions during the antebellum period
were unambiguous about the importance of race. In State v. Huntly
(1843), the North Carolina Supreme Court had recognized that
there was a right to carry arms guaranteed under the North
Carolina Constitution, as long as such arms were carried in a
manner not likely to frighten people.<b>[12]</b> The following
year, the North Carolina Supreme Court made one of those
decisions whose full significance would not appear until after
the Civil War and passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. An 1840
statute provided: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>That if any free negro, mulatto, or free
        person of color, shall wear or carry about his or her
        person, or keep in his or her house, any shot gun,
        musket, rifle, pistol, sword, dagger or bowie-knife,
        unless he or she shall have obtained a licence therefor
        from the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions of his or
        her county, within one year preceding the wearing,
        keeping or carrying therefor, he or she shall be guilty
        of a misdemeanor, and may be indicted therefor.<b>[13]</b>
        </dd>
</dl>

<p>Elijah Newsom, "a free person of
color," was indicted in Cumberland County in June of 1843
for carrying a shotgun without a license -- at the very time the
North Carolina Supreme Court was deciding Huntly. Newsom was
convicted by a jury; but the trial judge directed a not guilty
verdict, and the state appealed to the North Carolina Supreme
Court. Newsom's attorney argued that the statute requiring free
blacks to obtain a license to "keep and bear arms" was
in violation of both the Second Amendment to the U. S.
Constitution, and the North Carolina Constitution's similar
guarantee of a right to keep and bear arms.<b>[14]</b> The North
Carolina Supreme Court refused to accept that the Second
Amendment was a limitation on state laws, but had to deal with
the problem of the state constitutional guarantees, which had
been used in the Huntly decision, the year before. </p>

<p>The 17th article of the 1776 North Carolina
Constitution declared: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>That the people have a right to bear arms,
        for the defence of the State; and, as standing armies, in
        time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not
        to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under
        strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil
        power.<b>[15]</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>The Court asserted that: "We cannot see
that the act of 1840 is in conflict with it... The defendant is
not indicted for carrying arms in defence of the State, nor does
the act of 1840 prohibit him from so doing."<b>[16]</b> But
in Huntly, the Court had acknowledged that the restrictive
language "for the defence of the State" did not
preclude an individual right.<b>[17]</b> The Court then attempted
to justify the necessity of this law: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>Its only object is to preserve the peace
        and safety of the community from being disturbed by an
        indiscriminate use, on ordinary occasions, by free men of
        color, of fire arms or other arms of an offensive
        character. Self preservation is the first law of nations,
        as it is of individuals.<b>[18]</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>The North Carolina Supreme Court also sought to
repudiate the idea that free blacks were protected by the North
Carolina Constitution's Bill of Rights by pointing out that the
Constitution excluded free blacks from voting, and therefore free
blacks were not citizens. Unlike a number of other state
constitutions with right to keep and bear arms provisions that
limited this right only to citizens,<b>[19]</b> Article 17
guaranteed this right to the people -- and try as hard as they
might, it was difficult to argue that a "free person of
color," in the words of the Court, was not one of "the
people." </p>

<p>It is one of the great ironies that, in much
the same way that the North Carolina Supreme Court recognized a
right to bear arms in 1843 -- then a year later declared that
free blacks were not included -- the Georgia Supreme Court did
likewise before the 1840s were out. The Georgia Supreme Court
found in Nunn v. State (1846) that a statute prohibiting the sale
of concealable handguns, sword-canes, and daggers violated the
Second Amendment: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>The right of the whole people, old and
        young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep
        and bear arms of every description, and not such merely
        as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed,
        curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and
        all of this for the important end to be attained: the
        rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so
        vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our
        opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant
        to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this
        right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled
        under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and
        successors, reestablished by the revolution of 1688,
        conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and
        finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna
        Charta! And Lexington, Concord, Camden, River Raisin,
        Sandusky, and the laurel-crowned field of New Orleans,
        plead eloquently for this interpretation!<b>[20]</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>Finally, after this paean to liberty -- in a
state where much of the population remained enslaved, forbidden
by law to possess arms of any sort -- the Court defined the valid
limits of laws restricting the bearing of arms: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>We are of the opinion, then, that so far
        as the act of 1837 seeks to suppress the practice of
        carrying certain weapons secretly, that it is valid,
        inasmuch as it does not deprive the citizen of his
        natural right of self- defence, or of his constitutional
        right to keep and bear arms. But that so much of it, as
        contains a prohibition against bearing arms openly, is in
        conflict with the Constitution, and void...<b>[21]</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>"Citizen"? Within a single page, the
Court had gone from "right of the whole people, old and
young, men, women and boys" to the much more narrowly
restrictive right of a "citizen." The motivation for
this sudden narrowing of the right appeared two years later. </p>

<p>The decision Cooper and Worsham v. Savannah
(1848) was not, principally, a right to keep and bear arms case.
In 1839, the city of Savannah, Georgia, in an admitted effort
"to prevent the increase of free persons of color in our
city," had established a $100 per year tax on free blacks
moving into Savannah from other parts of Georgia. Samuel Cooper
and Hamilton Worsham, two "free persons of color," were
convicted of failing to pay the tax, and were jailed.<b>[22]</b>
On appeal, counsel for Cooper and Worsham argued that the
ordinance establishing the tax was deficient in a number of
technical areas; the assertion of most interest to us is,
"In Georgia, free persons of color have constitutional
rights..." Cooper and Worsham's counsel argued that these
rights included writ of habeas corpus, right to own real estate,
to be "subject to taxation," "[t]hey may sue and
be sued," and cited a number of precedents under Georgia law
in defense of their position.<b>[23]</b> </p>

<p>Justice Warner delivered the Court's opinion,
most of which is irrelevant to the right to keep and bear arms,
but one portion shows the fundamental relationship between
citizenship, arms, and elections, and why gun control laws were
an essential part of defining blacks as "non-citizens":
"Free persons of color have never been recognized here as
citizens; they are not entitled to bear arms, vote for members of
the legislature, or to hold any civil office."<b>[24]</b>
The Georgia Supreme Court did agree that the ordinance jailing
Cooper and Worsham for non-payment was illegal, and ordered their
release, but the comments of the Court made it clear that their
brave words in Nunn v. State (1846) about "the right of the
people," really only meant white people. </p>

<p>While settled parts of the South were in great
fear of armed blacks, on the frontier, the concerns about Indian
attack often forced relaxation of these rules. The 1798 Kentucky
Comprehensive Act allowed slaves and free blacks on frontier
plantations "to keep and use guns, powder, shot, and
weapons, offensive and defensive." Unlike whites, however, a
license was required for free blacks or slaves to carry weapons.<b>[25]</b>
</p>

<p>The need for blacks to carry arms for
self-defense included not only the problem of Indian attack, and
the normal criminal attacks that anyone might worry about, but
the additional hazard that free blacks were in danger of being
kidnapped and sold into slavery.<b>[26]</b> A number of states,
including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin,
passed laws specifically to prohibit kidnapping of free blacks,
out of concern that the federal Fugitive Slave Laws would be used
as cover for re-enslavement.<b>[27]</b> </p>

<p>The end of slavery in 1865 did not eliminate
the problems of racist gun control laws; the various Black Codes
adopted after the Civil War required blacks to obtain a license
before carrying or possessing firearms or Bowie knives; these are
sufficiently well-known that any reasonably complete history of
the Reconstruction period mentions them. These restrictive gun
laws played a part in the efforts of the Republicans to get the
Fourteenth Amendment ratified, because it was difficult for night
riders to generate the correct level of terror in a victim who
was returning fire.<b>[28]</b> It does appear, however, that the
requirement to treat blacks and whites equally before the law led
to the adoption of restrictive firearms laws in the South that
were equal in the letter of the law, but unequally enforced. It
is clear that the vagrancy statutes adopted at roughly the same
time, in 1866, were intended to be used against blacks, even
though the language was race-neutral.<b>[29]</b> </p>

<p>The former states of the Confederacy, many of
which had recognized the right to carry arms openly before the
Civil War, developed a very sudden willingness to qualify that
right. One especially absurd example, and one that includes
strong evidence of the racist intentions behind gun control laws,
is Texas. </p>

<p>In Cockrum v. State (1859), the Texas Supreme
Court had recognized that there was a right to carry defensive
arms, and that this right was protected under both the Second
Amendment, and section 13 of the Texas Bill of Rights. The outer
limit of the state's authority (in this case, attempting to
discourage the carrying of Bowie knives), was that it could
provide an enhanced penalty for manslaughters committed with
Bowie knives.<b>[30]</b> Yet, by 1872, the Texas Supreme Court
denied that there was any right to carry any weapon for
self-defense under either the state or federal constitutions --
and made no attempt to explain or justify why the Cockrum
decision was no longer valid.<b>[31]</b> </p>

<p>What caused the dramatic change? The following
excerpt from that same decision -- so offensive that no one would
dare make such an argument today -- sheds some light on the
racism that apparently caused the sudden perspective change: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>The law under consideration has been
        attacked upon the ground that it was contrary to public
        policy, and deprived the people of the necessary means of
        self- defense; that it was an innovation upon the customs
        and habits of the people, to which they would not
        peaceably submit... We will not say to what extent the
        early customs and habits of the people of this state
        should be respected and accommodated, where they may come
        in conflict with the ideas of intelligent and
        well-meaning legislators. <i>A portion of our system of
        laws, as well as our public morality, is derived from a
        people the most peculiar perhaps of any other in the
        history and derivation of its own system. Spain, at
        different periods of the world, was dominated over by the
        Carthagenians, the Romans, the Vandals, the Snovi, the
        Allani, the Visigoths, and Arabs; and to this day there
        are found in the Spanish codes traces of the laws and
        customs of each of these nations blended together in a
        system by no means to be compared with the sound
        philosophy and pure morality of the common law</i>.<b>[32]</b>
        [emphasis added] </dd>
</dl>

<p>This particular decision is more open than most
as to its motivations, but throughout the South during this
period, the existing precedents that recognized a right to open
carry under state constitutional provisions were being narrowed,
or simply ignored. Nor was the reasoning that led to these
changes lost on judges in the North. In 1920, the Ohio Supreme
Court upheld the conviction of a Mexican for concealed carry of a
handgun--while asleep in his own bed. Justice Wanamaker's
scathing dissent criticized the precedents cited by the majority
in defense of this absurdity: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>I desire to give some special attention to
        some of the authorities cited, supreme court decisions
        from Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Kentucky, and one or two
        inferior court decisions from New York, which are given
        in support of the doctrines upheld by this court. The
        southern states have very largely furnished the
        precedents. It is only necessary to observe that the race
        issue there has extremely intensified a decisive purpose
        to entirely disarm the negro, and this policy is evident
        upon reading the opinions.<b>[33]</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>While not relevant to the issue of racism,
Justice Wanamaker's closing paragraphs capture well the biting
wit and intelligence of this jurist, who was unfortunately,
outnumbered on the bench: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>I hold that the laws of the state of Ohio
        should be so applied and so interpreted as to favor the
        law-abiding rather than the law-violating people. If this
        decision shall stand as the law of Ohio, a very large
        percentage of the good people of Ohio to-day are
        criminals, because they are daily committing criminal
        acts by having these weapons in their own homes for their
        own defense. The only safe course for them to pursue,
        instead of having the weapon concealed on or about their
        person, or under their pillow at night, is to hang the
        revolver on the wall and put below it a large placard
        with these words inscribed: </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
    <dd>"The Ohio supreme court having
        decided that it is a crime to carry a concealed weapon on
        one's person in one's home, even in one's bed or bunk,
        this weapon is hung upon the wall that you may see it,
        and before you commit any burglary or assault, please,
        Mr. Burglar, hand me my gun."<b>[34]</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>There are other examples of remarkable honesty
from the state supreme courts on this subject, of which the
finest is probably Florida Supreme Court Justice Buford's
concurring opinion in Watson v. Stone (1941), in which a
conviction for carrying a handgun without a permit was
overturned, because the handgun was in the glove compartment of a
car: </p>

<dl>
    <dd>I know something of the history of this
        legislation. The original Act of 1893 was passed when
        there was a great influx of negro laborers in this State
        drawn here for the purpose of working in turpentine and
        lumber camps. The same condition existed when the Act was
        amended in 1901 and the Act was passed for the purpose of
        disarming the negro laborers and to thereby reduce the
        unlawful homicides that were prevalent in turpentine and
        saw-mill camps and to give the white citizens in sparsely
        settled areas a better feeling of security. The statute
        was never intended to be applied to the white population
        and in practice has never been so applied.<b>[35]</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>Today is not 1893, and when proponents of
restrictive gun control insist that their motivations are
color-blind, there is a possibility that they are telling the
truth. Nonetheless, there are some rather interesting questions
that should be asked today. The most obvious question is,
"Why should a police chief or sheriff have any discretion in
issuing a concealed handgun permit?" Here in California,
even the state legislature's research arm--hardly a nest of
pro-gunners--has admitted that the vast majority of permits to
carry concealed handguns in California are issued to white males.<b>[36]</b>
Even if overt racism is not an issue, an official may simply have
more empathy with an applicant of a similar cultural background,
and consequently be more able to relate to the applicant's
concerns. As my wife pointedly reminded a police official when we
applied for concealed weapon permits, "If more police chiefs
were women, a lot more women would get permits, and be able to
defend themselves from rapists." </p>

<p>Gun control advocates today are not so foolish
as to openly promote racist laws, and so the question might be
asked what relevance the racist past of gun control laws has. One
concern is that the motivations for disarming blacks in the past
are really not so different from the motivations for disarming
law-abiding citizens today. In the last century, the official
rhetoric in support of such laws was that "they" were
too violent, too untrustworthy, to be allowed weapons. Today, the
same elitist rhetoric regards law-abiding Americans in the same
way, as child-like creatures in need of guidance from the
government. In the last century, while never openly admitted, one
of the goals of disarming blacks was to make them more willing to
accept various forms of economic oppression, including the
sharecropping system, in which free blacks were reduced to an
economic state not dramatically superior to the conditions of
slavery. </p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, the aristocratic
power structure of colonial Virginia found itself confronting a
similar challenge from lower class whites. These poor whites
resented how the men who controlled the government used that
power to concentrate wealth into a small number of hands. These
wealthy feeders at the government trough would have disarmed poor
whites if they could, but the threat of both Indian and pirate
attack made this impractical; for all white men "were armed
and had to be armed..." Instead, blacks, who had occupied a
poorly defined status between indentured servant and slave, were
reduced to hereditary chattel slavery, so that poor whites could
be economically advantaged, without the upper class having to
give up its privileges.<b>[37]</b> </p>

<p>Today, the forces that push for gun control
seem to be heavily (though not exclusively) allied with political
factions that are committed to dramatic increases in taxation on
the middle class. While it would be hyperbole to compare higher
taxes on the middle class to the suffering and deprivation of
sharecropping or slavery, the analogy of disarming those whom you
wish to economically disadvantage, has a certain worrisome
validity to it. </p>

<p>Another point to consider is that in the
American legal system, certain classifications of governmental
discrimination are considered constitutionally suspect, and these
"suspect classifications" (usually considered to be
race and religion) come to a court hearing under a strong
presumption of invalidity. The reason for these "suspect
classifications" is because of the long history of
governmental discrimination based on these classifications, and
because these classifications often impinge on fundamental
rights.<b>[38]</b> </p>

<p>In much the same way, gun control has
historically been a tool of racism, and associated with racist
attitudes about black violence. Similarly, many gun control laws
impinge on that most fundamental of rights: self-defense. Racism
is so intimately tied to the history of gun control in America
that we should regard gun control aimed at law-abiding people as
a "suspect idea," and require that the courts use the
same demanding standards when reviewing the constitutionality of
a gun control law, that they would use with respect to a law that
discriminated based on race. </p>

        inspiring biography of a slave who, through hard work
        moonlighting in the production of saltpeter (a basic
        ingredient of black powder) and land surveying, saved
        enough money to buy his wife, himself, and eventually all
        of his children and grandchildren out of slavery -- while
        fighting against oppressive laws and vigorous racism.
        Most impressive of all, is that he did it without ever
        learning to read or write. </li>

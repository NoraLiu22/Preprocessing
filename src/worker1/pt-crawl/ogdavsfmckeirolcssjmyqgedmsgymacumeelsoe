<Center><H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></Center>
The Dictionary is an extensive on-line reference of film, video and audio terminology as applicable to production and post production.  While we have endeavored to create as complete a resource as possible, the usage of some terms will vary depending on the country and region in which it is used.  Most usages are easily understood, while others tend to be somewhat cryptic.<P>

Whenever there is a term which you can not find here, you might be dealing with new film, video, or audio production slang. For the moment, you should query the Webmaster with any questions about words not appearing herein.  We also welcome the submission of additional terms for inclusion here.<P>

WCCA was founded by arachnologist Emeritus Prof. Fred Coyle back in the 1960s., and taken over by Emeritus Prof. Kefyn Catley, also an arachnologist, in the 1990s. As such, WCCA has a modest, mostly regionally relevant collection of arachnids. The collection is currently curated by Prof. Silveira, who has held the role since 2019. Since then, the collection representation and focus has shifted to insects, especially beetles, with an emphasis on fireflies. More recently, The WCU Culicidae collection, curated by Dr. Byrd, was incorporated into WCCA (although it is housed in a separate building, in the Vector-Borne Infectious Disease Laboratory). This collection is a reference resource containing more than 3,000 pinned adult mosquitoes representing more than 100 species, and primarily maintains species from North

Each specimen serves as a snapshot in a particular place and time in which specific conditions cannot be replicated. This is just another reason why collecting and maintaining collections is important.   The NHMU Vertebrate Zoology collections include four distinct sections:Mammals, Birds ,Reptiles, and Amphibian.

The completion of a Revised Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Bandelier National Monument (Jacobs 2012) represents the first significant update to the flora of the monument in the 20 years since completion of the initial Flora of Bandelier project (Jacobs, 1989). Over 50 additional taxa are documented for the monument, bringing the total from around 746 species in 1989 to 800+ in 2012. The relatively high diversity of vascular plants (800+ taxa documented for 33,000 acre area) reflects the complex topography and wide range of climatic settings available across a nearly 5000-foot elevation range from the Rio Grande at 5300-feet to the summit of Cerro Grande at 10100-feet. However over 15% of the flora is non-native reflecting the legacy of historic landuse and modern disturbances. The monuments herbarium serves the dual purpose of documenting the monuments flora, while also providing a key botanical reference in support of research and monitoring efforts.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"","contact_role":"","contact_email":"","mailing_address":"","mailing_city":"","mailing_state":"","mailing_zip":"","physical_address":"","physical_city":"","physical_state":"","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":35.7651,"lon":-106.3221},{"institution":"Denver Botanic Gardens","collection":"Herbarium - Denver Botanic Gardens","recordsets":"5835f642-2560-4e3e-9c25-741a12cc3fe8","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"5835f642-2560-4e3e-9c25-741a12cc3fe8\"}","institution_code":"KHD, DBG","collection_code":"KHD","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:f06c8109-e7df-49f8-917f-a8a549dca5b0","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15415","collection_url":"https://www.botanicgardens.org/our-collections/kathryn-kalmbach-herbarium-vascular-plants","collection_catalog_url":"http://swbiodiversity.org/portal/index.php","description":"The Kathryn Kalmbach Herbarium (KHD), a collection of over 54,000 vascular plant specimens, is a regional herbarium with a research focus on the species diversity of Colorado and the Southern Rocky Mountain region.

Significant holdings include Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera, but all insect groups are extensively represented. The UAIC user community is diverse, ranging from outstanding undergraduate and graduate students to highly active emeritus insect systematists. Annually, we host thousands of visitors, ranging from resident researchers to individual walk-ins, campus tour groups, and vast numbers of people seeking information on the biology of the Sonoran Desert Region.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":2000000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Significant holdings include Coleoptera (beetles), Hemiptera (true bugs), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), and Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Over 80% of these specimens are identified to the species-level. Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees) are also well represented, but their identification levels vary considerably from family to family. Five hundred thousand specimens of arachnids, crustaceans, termites, ants, and insect larvae are preserved in alcohol. The slide collection includes preparations of over 25,000 mites, 300 thrips, and sizable collections of mosquitos and ant larvae.","geographic_range":"The geographic scope of the collection covers all of the southwestern US with special concentration on the Sonoran Desert Region and adjacent tropical biomes of northwestern Mexico. The footprint of the Sonoran Desert Region circumscribes many non-desert areas with rich geologic histories that provide the physical framework for past vicariance and speciation events for many arthropod lineages. A great variety of natural habitats occur here, including coastal and inland sand dunes, dry deserts, thornscrub, tropical deciduous forest, riparian corridors, and upland habitats that include the southern Colorado Plateau and the Sky Islands, with a vertical succession of biomes from desert scrub to montane forest and subalpine conifer forest.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Wendy Moore","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"wmoore@email.arizona.edu","mailing_address":"Department of Entomology, Forbes 410","mailing_city":"Tucson","mailing_state":"Arizona","mailing_zip":"85721-0036","physical_address":"Department of Entomology, Forbes 410","physical_city":"Tucson","physical_state":"Arizona","physical_zip":"85721-0036","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:123e853b-916b-4f06-b6e3-aae999ff5db4","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":null,"lon":null},{"institution":"Idaho State University","collection":"Vertebrate Paleontology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"IDS","collection_code":"IDS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:84348a09-ffc3-4cc3-827e-e8863f753214","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://imnh.isu.edu/home/index.php/collections-and-research/earth-sciences-division/vertebrate-paleontology/","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Leif Tapanila","contact_role":"Research Curator","contact_email":"tapaleif@isu.edu","mailing_address":"921 S. 8th Ave, Stop 8096","mailing_city":"Pocatello","mailing_state":"Idaho","mailing_zip":"83209-8096","physical_address":"921 S. 8th Ave, Stop 8096","physical_city":"Pocatello","physical_state":"Idaho","physical_zip":"83209-8096","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:745193bd-b8ac-4649-8860-ba94ca126dcf","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":42.860344,"lon":-112.43129},{"institution":"Weber State University","collection":"Herbarium - Weber State University","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"WSCO","collection_code":"WSCO","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:e101675f-b75e-4cf3-8c62-507a40d75dd6","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15448","collection_url":"https://www.weber.edu/botany/Herbarium.html","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":29000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"<Penstemon>, Scrophulariaceae","geographic_range":"Utah;

It is a diverse collection of worldwide specimens, the largest portion being marine shells. It also has specimens of echinoderms, corals, sponges, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. Despite its name, it includes a substantial collection of land and freshwater snail shells. The collection contains nearly 50,000 lots, of which more than half are databased in Arctos with more being added to the database each week.

Approximately 40% of the specimens have frozen tissues associated with them. Collection highlights include: Synoptic series of the Birds of New Mexico for ID reference and teaching; the personal collection of Dale Zimmerman, donated in 2004, which contributed significantly to the taxonomic and geographic scope of the collection; the collection of Amadeo Rea, upon which the book Once a River was based; raptors and game birds of J.M.

It is an amalgamation of private donations, collections originally in other institutions, and material collected by the Museum. The Curator is assisted in collection chores by 1.5 part-time Collection Associates and about seven Curatorial Assistants (volunteers). BMSM consists mostly of Recent mollusks, with a focus on the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean. There are circa 2,500 fluid-preserved lots. Fossils represent only 5.5% of the total number of lots. Digitization of the collection started in 1997, through a MS Access-based platform. By the time of the Museum&rsquo;s first accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) (March 2010), only 27,000 lots (out of an originally estimated 120,000) had been catalogued. On that occasion, one of the &ldquo;Areas of Improvement by Next Review&rdquo; recommended by AAM&rsquo;s Accreditation Commission was that the Museum should take action to &ldquo;... further improve the documentation of collections.&rdquo; This process started in October 2012 with the inception of the first of two &ldquo;Museums for America &ndash; Collections Stewardship&rdquo; grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The catalogue resides in a dedicated server, and is backed-up daily both in-house and through a commercial service (Mozy Pro).  In 2011, BMSM incorporated about 11,000 lots from the local Florida Gulf Coast University. The decision by the FGCU administration to move the collection to the Shell Museum shows the degree of trust placed in the organization. The 10,000-lots Redfern Collection, donated in 2014, includes material illustrated in Colin Redfern&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bahamian Seashells&rdquo; books. The regional relevance of the collection is substantiated by circa 7,500 lots of marine mollusks from Sanibel and Captiva islands and neighboring areas. BMSM includes 18 primary types and 211 secondary types. Collection workers are assisted by a 4,000+ volume specialized library, high-resolution photographic equipment with digital stacking software, and other relevant tools and equipment.  Metadata are available from the Shell Museum web site at http://shellmuseum.emc2webs.com/collection/ (right) and iDigBio/Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, left) at http://ipt.idigbio.org/resource?r=bmnsm-shell. About 9,200 lots are georeferenced . The resource has been registered with GBIF, and is itself registered in GBIF as a data publisher endorsed by U.S. Geological Survey.

Tuomey in the mid 1800s and were used extensively for teaching purposes.  Most of the collection was presumably lost during the Civil War when federal troops destroyed the University of Alabama campus.  Only a few of Tuomey's original cabinet specimens survive in the collections of the Alabama Museum of Natural History and the Geological Survey of Alabama. In the 1870s, as professor and state geologist, Eugene Allen Smith, directed students on field trips throughout the state where they collected many new specimens and met persons who also contributed to the collections.  Dr. Adiel A. Klompmaker, a specialist in Decapods, is the current Curator of Paleontology.  The Invertebrate Paleontology Collection is estimated to contain over 20,000 lots of specimens, although only 4,000 are catalogued. Specimens are mainly from the Oligocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous deposits of Alabama. The Paleogene (Eocene plus Oligocene) deposits in Alabama are considered to be among the best in the world.  The Vertebrate Paleontology Collection consists of over 10,000+ catalogued items, most of which consist of individual specimens. The collection contains items from the Pennsylvanian, Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits of Alabama, but focuses primarily on Cretaceous and Eocene marine formations. The vertebrate collections have strong representation of Cretaceous mosasaurs, Eocene whales, and Pennsylvanian trackways from the Union Chapel Mine trackway site.  The Paleobotany Collection consists of over 700 specimens catalogued, mostly from the Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous of Alabama, as well as petrified wood from Arizona.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Alabama; the Southeastern US; worldwide","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Adiel A.

The collection has significant systematic and taxonomic value in that it contains over 200 holotypes, including 183 bird and 48 mammal taxa.  In addition, the bird collection houses large numbers of specimens from many now-degraded habitats in Mexico and northern Central America, including a significant series by Thomas R. Howell of passerine birds inhabiting the lowland pine savannas of northeastern Nicaragua taken from the 1950s through the 1970s (Ornithological Monograph No. 68).  It also contains a small but important series of an endemic seabird, the Tristramâs Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma tristrami), and endemic land birds from the Hawaiian Islands, including the Laysan Finch (Telespiza cantans), and the Millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris) as well as an important series of the extinct Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) from the late 1870s and several California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) from the very early 1900s.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":70000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Kathy C.

The collection spans 1870 to the present, is worldwide in coverage, and includes specimens from the three major extant mammalian lineages (monotremes, marsupials, and placentals) distributed across 21 orders, 266 genera, and 381 species. The collectionâs primary strength is its focus on the southern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. Approximately 82% of the collection is from the western United States, with specimens from Colorado (73%) representing the largest percentage. Small mammals, such as shrews, rodents, lagomorphs, and bats, constitute the majority (84%) of specimens in the collection. The composition of the collection is primarily study skins and skeletal material, with a growing wet collection.

With the exception of birds, our collections are the largest collections of their kind in Colorado. Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The Mammal collection includes over 16,000 specimens with representation from twenty-five countries, with the majority of specimens from Colorado (nearly 70%) and other western states. Specimens are typically preserved as a set of a study skin and an extracted skull, although large mammals are also prepared as hides, taxidermy, and skeletons. Many people have added to the mammal collection over the years, including the pioneer Colorado naturalist, Edward Royal Warren (3,000&#43; specimens), Donald A. Spencer, Dallas A. Sutton, Leslie Viereck, and emeritus professor and former Museum Director, David M. Armstrong. E.R.

The collection has an emphasis on freshwater fishes of the central United States and also has significant marine and estuarine collections. The fish collection has representation from 3171 taxa (297 families and 1262 genera) and 79 countries including Ecuador, Fiji, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua and various marine localities. The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette &amp; Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region&#39;s fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.\n\nThe Ichthyology collection comprises whole, wet, voucher specimens in 70% ethanol (98%), specimens maintained as dry skeletons (0.3%) and cleared and stained preparations in glycerine (1.7%). Other ancillary collections include a large slide and digital image collection of specimens and locations (some of which are linked to specimen records through the database), a large field note collection and a map collection.\n\nThe wet specimens are housed in a state-of-the-art fluid collection facility, opened in 1996. The facility has 2,400 square feet of collection storage space on four floors and is shared with Herpetology, Mammalogy, Ornithology, Entomology and Invertebrate Zoology. The collection storage environment is maintained at 65Â°F year-round by an HVAC system. Specimens are housed in state of the art glassware and stainless steel tanks and protected by a sprinkler fire suppression system and UV-shielded lighting. The division has both morphological research facilities and a shared molecular systematic laboratory.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"ActinistiaActinopterygiiCephalaspidomorphiElasmobranchiiMyxiniSarcopterygii","geographic_range":"The fish collection has representation from 79 countries including Ecuador, Fiji, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua and various marine localities.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Andrew Bentley","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"abentley@ku.edu","mailing_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","mailing_city":"Lawrence","mailing_state":"KS","mailing_zip":"66045","physical_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","physical_city":"Lawrence","physical_state":"KS","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:356736e8-9e70-4516-bf04-1ad72ca6604f","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":38.9574,"lon":-95.2459},{"institution":"Saint Michael's College","collection":"Herbarium -

The Academy has had several prominent entomologists in its history, primarily between 1930 and 1960. Donald C. Lowrie (1910-2000) studied spiders and their role in local dune ecosystems. Leonora K. Gloyd (b. 1902) conducted fieldwork on Odonata. Orlando Park published on the taxonomy and ecology of Coleoptera, particularly the Pselaphidae, in the 1940s. Stanley Auerbach researched centipedes in the Chicago area during the 1950s. Other major collectors include Andrew Bolter (collected between 1879-1910) and Harry D. Sicher (collected between 1940 and 1970), both of whom collected primarily Lepidoptera. The majority of the non-Lepidopteran specimens were collected in the Midwest and Western Great Lakes regions, with Canada, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. also represented. Lepidoptera primarily include species from the Midwestern U.S. as well as Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Alaska, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. Temporal Coverage of this collection is 1834-Present, with the bulk of the non-Lepidoptera specimens collected between 1872 and 1911, and the bulk of Lepidopteran specimens collected between 1891 and 1964.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"InsectaArachnida","geographic_range":"Primarily United States, especially the Midwest and Southeast.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Dawn Roberts","contact_role":"Director of Collections","contact_email":"droberts@naturemuseum.org","mailing_address":"2430 North Cannon Drive","mailing_city":"Chicago","mailing_state":"Illinois","mailing_zip":"60614","physical_address":"2430 North Cannon Drive","physical_city":"Chicago","physical_state":"Illinois","physical_zip":"60614","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:93877ee6-76bc-4ca0-8ee6-7eae72061ed6","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":41.926835,"lon":-87.635343},{"institution":"Springfield Science Museum","collection":"Entomology/ Arachnology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"SPR, SSM","collection_code":"SSM","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:90bde147-30c9-4013-97ec-1193d679210d","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"Dry mounts","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Dave Stier","contact_role":"","contact_email":"dstier@springfieldmuseums.org","mailing_address":"21 Edwards Street","mailing_city":"Springfield","mailing_state":"Massachusetts","mailing_zip":"01103-0000","physical_address":"21 Edwards Street","physical_city":"Springfield","physical_state":"Massachusetts","physical_zip":"01103-0000","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":42.1044,"lon":-72.5882},{"institution":"Calvin College","collection":"Herbarium - Calvin College","recordsets":"8bcb95b2-ab5c-4368-8ead-14588eeb9c98","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"8bcb95b2-ab5c-4368-8ead-14588eeb9c98\"}","institution_code":"CALVIN","collection_code":"CALVIN","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:d6febb08-ec34-11e4-b70a-002315492bbc","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.calvin.edu/academic/biology/about/facilities/herbarium.html","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":76000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"David P.

We also have strong holdings of freshwater bivalves and gastropods from the Southeastern U.S., Central, and South America. The collection is 57% bivalves, 41% gastropods, 2% other; 67% freshwater; 20% marine or brackish; 13% terrestrial.\nMany of the specimens were collected as a result of various faunal surveys conducted by INHS biologists from the late 1800s until the present. The early collections were made by such naturalists as John Wesley Powell, Robert Kennicott, Frank C. Baker, Richard E. Call, Anson A. Hinkley, Max Matteson, and William Starrett. The largest and best documented collection of land snails at the INHS was compiled by Thural D. Foster and organized by Frank C. Baker as part of his study on the âFieldbook of Illinois Land Snailsâ published in 1939. The Baker snail collection numbers 1632 lots containing 11,970 specimens.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":500000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Alison Stodola","contact_role":"curator","contact_email":"alprice@illinois.edu","mailing_address":"Illinois Natural History Survey, 1816 S Oak Street","mailing_city":"Champaign","mailing_state":"IL","mailing_zip":"61820","physical_address":"1816 S Oak Street","physical_city":"Champaign","physical_state":"","physical_zip":"61820","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:d0689818-af23-4395-8251-82df8f68b028","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":40.092476,"lon":-88.240152},{"institution":"University of West Alabama","collection":"Herbarium - University of West Alabama","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"UWAL","collection_code":"UWAL","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:19e747e2-dafa-4447-a89f-3159e3d58c6d","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":50000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular plants; some bryophytes and lichens","geographic_range":"Alabama and other regions of the SE U.S.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Brian R.

The Herpetology collection spans 77 countries, with its geographic strength in Mexican and the southwestern United States species. It contains over 68,000 specimens, including over 22,000 from Mexico, which have been actively studied and cited in systematic herpetology publications over recent decades. Additionally, the whiptail lizards (genus <i>Aspidoscelis</i>) are particularly well represented, including over 12,000 fluid-preserved specimens and two hundred dry skulls. The world-renowned herpetologists, Hobart M. Smith and T. Paul Maslin, as well as a number of their students and collaborators, were the major architects of our largest vertebrate collection. R.

The majority were collected in Colorado, although there is a worldwide representation of both marine and freshwater species. Many specimens were collected in the early 1900s by Max M. Ellis, including several hundred from Guyana. The collection also includes about 2000 Salmonid specimens donated by Robert J.

Many of these regional specimens are not well represented in other academic or national museum collections. Flora and fauna from the Carboniferous, Permian, and Cretaceous Periods are particularly well represented. The collection also includes more than 50 type specimens of Pennsylvanian and Early Cretaceous mollusks, and Pennsylvanian insects. Preservation of specimens is primarily as body or trace fossils. The petrologic and mineral collections consist of over 20,000 specimens spanning from the Proterozoic to Modern and containing notable specimens from the Southwest region and globally. These collections include unique petrologic collections from the Harding Pegmatite Mine, NM and Chuar Group from the Grand Canyon region. Preservation of specimens is primarily as hand samples, thin sections, and rock/mineral powders.

At the time of the Refuge's establishment in 1936, botanist Neil Hotchkiss and other scientists surveyed the flora on the 2,650 acres which made up the Refuge. Lists of plants found on the Refuge were published in 1940 and 1947. The latter list tabulated 944 plant taxa. Voucher specimens were collected and reposited in the Refuge's herbarium. By 1980, when the refuge expanded to 4,741 acres, a total of 900 plant taxa were listed. In the early 1990's as part of the Base Re-alignment and Closure (BRAC) process, the Department of Defense transferred about 8,100 acres of land from Fort Meade to the Department of Interior, with control of the land given to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The addition of this parcel, now known as the North Tract, brought the total acreage of the Refuge to over 12,800 acres. A floral survey of the North Tract began in 2010 and a re-survey of the older parcel of the Refuge, known as the Central and South Tracts, was initiated in 2013. As of December 2017, the herbarium holds almost 5,000 voucher specimens from over 1,250 taxa found on the Refuge. This includes a number of Maryland rare, threatened, and endangered (RTE) species, as well as at least five species new to Maryland. A number of duplicate and unique voucher specimens are held by other herbaria.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":5330,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular plants,

It currently holds over 100,000 specimens with a worldwide distribution, representing all vertebrate classes from the Silurian to the Pleistocene. This collection was acquired primarily through over a century of field work by section staff and associates as well as acquisitions by the Museum. Fossil collecting began in 1895 with the sponsorship of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who supported the museum&rsquo;s numerous early expeditions to the American West that resulted in one of the best dinosaur collections in the world. Carnegie in his retirement further strengthened the collection with the purchase in 1903 of a large collection of Paleozoic-Cenozoic, European fossils from the Baron de Bayet, a private fossil collector from Brussels, Belgium. Strengths of the collection include Mississippian fishes from Bear Gulch, Montana; Pennsylvanian and Permian fishes, amphibians and reptiles from Pennsylvania, Ohio,  West Virginia and the southwestern United States; Jurassic dinosaurs, especially sauropods, from Utah (Dinosaur National Monument) and Wyoming; Jurassic fishes and reptiles from Germany and France; Eocene fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy; Eocene and Oligocene tetrapods, from Montana, Wyoming and Utah; Miocene mammals from a site now preserved as Agate Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska; and Pleistocene vertebrates from the Appalachian region.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Amy Henrici","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"henricia@carnegiemnh.org","mailing_address":"4400 Forbes Avenue","mailing_city":"Pittsburgh","mailing_state":"Pennsylvania","mailing_zip":"15213","physical_address":"4400 Forbes Avenue","physical_city":"Pittsburgh","physical_state":"Pennsylvania","physical_zip":"15213","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:806b335a-9236-425e-a8be-21eb9772e657","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":40.444012,"lon":-79.950363},{"institution":"Angelo State University","collection":"Angelo State University Herbarium","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"SAT","collection_code":"SAT","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:c79dcc0b-f1a4-4b25-b2e2-30fe7f17e6ad","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:12588","collection_url":"https://www.angelo.edu/departments/biology/angelo-state-natural-history-collection/collections/herbarium/","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"Poaceae, Cyperaceae West Texas","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":79000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular plants","geographic_range":"Western Texas","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Carlos A.

We now have over 100,000 insect and spider compression fossils from Creede, Florissant, Green River, Latah, and Pitch Pinnacle Formations as well as Cockerell&#39;s fossil insect collections from Argentina and Siberia. Cockerell, Lanham, and Rohwer collected much of the fossil insect material in the early 1900s, and new material is now being collected and accessioned into our holdings from the Green River Formation of Colorado.We also possess a large collection of over 3,400 fossil insects and spiders preserved in copal and amber from Madagascar, Colombia, and the Baltics.     \tImportant Marine and Terrestrial Invertebrates  In addition to our focus on terrestrial arthropods, we also have a collection of Mesozoic and Cenozoic invertebrate fossils from the Rocky Mountain Region that is one of the most extensive in the country. In total, we have approximately 280,000 marine invertebrate specimens, including 316 holotypes. Notable marine invertebrate material in our collections includes Dr. Eicher&#39;s foraminifera assemblages from the Cretaceous interior of North America. Not only have important holotypes been identified from this material, these foram assemblages have also been important in reconstructing the flow of water in the interior seaway (Eicher 1977; Hay et al. 1993).

The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette &amp; Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region&#39;s fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.\n\nThe tissue collection comprises tissue samples originally collected in liquid nitrogen, DMSO and ethanol and stored in state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen dewars at -170Â°C.

The most common preparation type is a prepared skin, with the skull cleaned and stored in a separated container (our preparation code is SS).  Second-most common is a skin with the entire skeleton cleaned and stored separately (SB).  Some specimens consist only of a skull (SK) or cranium (CO).  Other specimens may consist of a partial skeleton (PS), an entire skeleton (SN) or only a skin (SO).  Many of our specimens are stored in alcohol (AL), or are in alcohol with the skull removed and cleaned (SA).  Tissues associated with any of these preparation types are noted as a separate field in our database.  Because there are active public education and exhibits programs in the KU Natural History Museum, a few of our specimens are taxidermy mounts (BM) and some are housed permanently on exhibit.  Other preparation types are coded as âotherâ (OT).  Occasionally, specimens are prepared with the baculum or os clitoris and separately stored in preserving fluid.  Non-standard preparation types and additional materials are noted in a comments field in our database.<br /><br />\n\n\nWe have extensive historical collections from Central America, Mexico, and southeast, central, western regions of the United States and Alaska.  We recently added outstanding collections from the Philippines and New Guinea.  We anticipate continuing to maintain our strengths in these geographic regions, emphasizing bats, rodents and insectivoresâcurrent taxonomic strengths.  Most of our collection consists of nicely prepared skins, skulls, and complete skeletons, with most recent specimens accompanied by tissues.<br /><br />\n\nThere are 135 type specimens in our collection at present.  Of these, the largest number (97) are rodents.  There are also 6 insectivore, 25 bat, 5 lagomorph, and 2 carnivore holotypes.  Lists of the Mammalogy&#39;s type specimens have been published by Jones and Genoways (1969) and Jones et al. (1984), although several have been described since.  Types have been described from Barbados, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (14 states), Mozambique, Nicaragua, Philippines, Venezuela, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and from 12 states in the U.S.  All type specimens are kept in the designated &#34;type case&#34; at all times.  Use of type specimens must be arranged with the curators.<br /> <br />\n\nThere is broad taxonomic coverage, including important holdings of Central and South American marsupials, insectivores, bats, rodents; Holarctic shrews, microtines, squirrels and North American bats, insectivores, carnivores, rodents and lagomorphs.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"All orders of mammals are represented.

Between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, the collections were formalized under the name Museum of Arid Land Biology (acronym MALB). In 1976, organizational changes instituted by the university resulted in the renaming of the collections and associated activities as the Laboratory for Environmental Biology (acronym UTEP, though locally called the &quot;LEB&quot;). In July of 1993, the Laboratory became associated with the University of Texas at El Paso&#39;s Centennial Museum through a memorandum of understanding.  Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions. The name was changed to UTEP Biodiversity Collections in August of 2012.  Collections primarily are of modern and fossil vertebrate biology (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and have a regional emphasis, but also contain material from outside the Southwest, particularly from Mexico. The research collections are maintained in the Biology Building.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Teresa Mayfield","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"tmayfield@utep.edu","mailing_address":"500 W.

The museum holds unique specimens representing the early diversification of primates and whales, including numerous steps in the evolutionary transition of whales from terrestrial mammals with hindlimbs to aquatic animals lacking external hindlimbs. Important collections of late Cenozoic fishes demonstrate long records of diversification within major lacustrine systems. Finally, late Cenozoic mammal collections include the best record of human association with extinct Ice Age mastodons found anywhere on the continent.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Global","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Daniel Fisher","contact_role":"Curator & Director","contact_email":"dcfisher@umich.edu","mailing_address":"3600 Varsity Drive","mailing_city":"Ann Arbor","mailing_state":"Michigan","mailing_zip":"48108","physical_address":"3600 Varsity Drive","physical_city":"Ann Arbor","physical_state":"Michigan","physical_zip":"48108","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":null,"lon":null},{"institution":"Southwestern Oklahoma State University","collection":"Entomology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"WOH","collection_code":"WOH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:5c18197c-790d-4c5d-9329-f2655ad663c5","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Rickey Cothran","contact_role":"","contact_email":"rickey.cothran@swosu.edu","mailing_address":"Biology Department","mailing_city":"Weatherford","mailing_state":"Oklahoma","mailing_zip":"73096-3098","physical_address":"","physical_city":"Weatherford","physical_state":"Oklahoma","physical_zip":"73096-3098","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":35.532505,"lon":-98.700569},{"institution":"Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History","collection":"Genomic Resources","recordsets":"6e6e2b47-fa3e-4bd9-8f1c-105b741d31df","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"6e6e2b47-fa3e-4bd9-8f1c-105b741d31df\"}","institution_code":"SNOMNH, OMNO, OMNHN, OMNH","collection_code":"OMNH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:3025d783-0967-4288-9aab-5e52be804125","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.snomnh.ou.edu/collections-research/ocgr.htm","collection_catalog_url":"http://www.snomnh.ou.edu/db2/ocgr/index.php","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Janet K.

The Collection maintains worldwide holdings of deep-sea and pelagic fishes as well as extensive holdings of shore fishes from the entire eastern Pacific. The Collection includes primary types of over 200 species (type catalog), skeletal preparations (both dried and cleared-and-stained) for over 1,000 species (osteology catalog), otoliths from approximately 1,100 species (otolith collection), and tissues for DNA from over 1,200 species.  Collection data for approximately 125,000 lots are available on a searchable database.  The Marine Vertebrate Collection supports scientific research by providing specimens for studies on the taxonomy, evolution, and ecology of fishes. Specimens are available for examination at Scripps and for loan to researchers at recognized institutions (loan policy).  The Marine Vertebrate Collection also plays an integral role in the support of graduate courses and research at Scripps.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":2000000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Fishes","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Ben Frable","contact_role":"Collection Manager of Marine Vertebrates","contact_email":"bfrable@ucsd.edu","mailing_address":"UCSD, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Ben Frable 0244, Vaughan Hall 224, 7835 Trade St., Suite 100","mailing_city":"San Diego","mailing_state":"California","mailing_zip":"92121","physical_address":"University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive","physical_city":"La Jolla","physical_state":"California","physical_zip":"92093-0244","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:bff3e1a1-11b2-4eda-a090-6c053fe290b1","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":32.86624,"lon":-117.251965},{"institution":"John May Museum of Natural History","collection":"Entomology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"MNHM","collection_code":"MNHM","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:9ffd345c-34ff-409c-ba76-3c81a1202e85","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"https://coloradospringsbugmuseum.com","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Charlene Donahue","contact_role":"","contact_email":"charlene.donahue@state.me.us","mailing_address":"710 Rock Creek Canyon Rd","mailing_city":"Colorado Springs","mailing_state":"Colorado","mailing_zip":"80926","physical_address":"","physical_city":"Colorado Springs","physical_state":"Colorado","physical_zip":"80926","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":null,"lon":null},{"institution":"North Carolina A & T State University","collection":"Herbarium -

Nearly 80% of these specimens are in the form of dried skin and/or skull and skeletal material preparations, while the rest are fluid-preserved specimens housed in a separate collection area. The dried skin and skeletal preparations are stored in 732 metal cabinets. These cabinets are specially designed to keep the specimens safe from UV light, dust, occasional insect pests, and other harmful agents. Every specimen is labeled with information concerning its species, sex, collector, preparator, collecting location, and other pieces of collecting data. Each specimen has also been given a catalog number and its data verified and entered into a searchable computer database. All specimens of the same species are stored together, organized by country, state, county, and finally catalog number. Groups of related species are housed in adjacent cases. As with the Genetic Resources Collection, the majority of these specimens in this collection are bar coded and a project is underway to bar code the rest to facilitate the retrieval of associated data and to reduce time and effort spent by the NSRL staff in maintaining an organized collection","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"The mammal collection represents a permanent record of the natural history of the Lubbock area, Texas, and the United States in general.

All pinned or pointed specimens are stored in 21 Cornell or U.S. National Museum (12 drawers each) insect cabinets. Three of these cabinets contains study specimens of all major orders and families of insects and are directly accessible by students for study and reference purposes. In addition, five vial cabinets (10 drawers each) are for storage of specimens preserved in alcohol.. The collection also has approximately 1200 microscope slides that have been purchased commercially, prepared by students or the result of research projects. Total numbers of pinned or pointed specimens for major groups of insects in the collection are: Coleoptera 7025; Lepidoptera 3293; Diptera 2754; Hymenoptera 2533; Hemiptera 2615; Orthoptera 771; and Odonata 394. Some adults of these and other Orders are preserved in alcohol.  There are approximately 10,000 vials with alcohol-preserved adult and immature specimens. Most of these vials have multiple specimens and no attempt has been made to count each specimen. Many of the alcohol-preserved specimens are aquatic immature insects. There are several thousand specimens of Chironomidae larvae resulting from a multiple-year study of chironomid populations in Lake Winnebago and the feeding habits of lake sturgeon. The collection also includes approximately 9,000 Australian specimens most of which are aquatic species, especially Trichoptera larvae (3,922 specimens), all of which are identified to family and many to species. Essentially all specimens have appropriate collection data labels. Many of the specimens were donated by students enrolled in the entomology classes. Most of these are local, regional or state specimens. However, specimens have been collected throughout the U.S. In 2011 the UWOIC became a part of a regional (22 midwestern collections) digitization effort (Invertnet) funded by NSFâs Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections. Currently about 5,000 specimens have been digitized for this on-going project.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":200000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Gene Drecktrah","contact_role":"Curator Emeritus","contact_email":"drecktra@uwosh.edu","mailing_address":"Department of Biology 800 Algoma Blvd.","mailing_city":"Oshkosh","mailing_state":"Wisconsin","mailing_zip":"54901","physical_address":"Halsey 142 921 Elmwood Ave.","physical_city":"Oshkosh","physical_state":"Wisconsin","physical_zip":"54901","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:8c02bca2-8bdc-4cd5-b25f-3938adc9cf17","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":44.017761,"lon":-88.545097},{"institution":"Michigan State University Museum","collection":"Ichthyology Research Collection","recordsets":"2b946e47-7b37-48dd-83bb-fd892c026f9f","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":[\"2b946e47-7b37-48dd-83bb-fd892c026f9f\"],\"collectioncode\":[\"IC\"]}","institution_code":"MSUC, MSUM, MSC, MSU","collection_code":"IC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:c7390797-16c4-4fb0-b290-5e959957ca99","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:34816","collection_url":"http://www.fishnet2.net/basicSearch.aspx","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"The Ichthyology Research Collection includes 7,100 lots containing over 36,100 marine and freshwater specimens.

Notable collections include the Randall Morgan Insect Collection which contains ~70,000 specimens collected systematically at 39 locations from 1989-199 in natural and rare habitats in Santa Cruz County, California. For each specimen, the species of plant it was collected from was also recorded. Morgan collected systematically at each location over an entire year (and in some locations over multiple years) and kept precise records on plant phenology. The collection mainly consists of hymenoptera, diptera, and lepidoptera but also contains good representation of other common orders.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":90000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Chris Lay","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"cml@ucsc.edu","mailing_address":"Department of Environmental Studies, Museum of Natural History, 1156 High St.","mailing_city":"Santa Cruz","mailing_state":"California","mailing_zip":"95064","physical_address":"1156 High Street, Natural Sciences 2 building","physical_city":"Santa Cruz","physical_state":"California","physical_zip":"95064","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:7732a3ac-43ed-4a69-aa0a-d0c99c415e80","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":36.993729,"lon":-122.056969},{"institution":"Northern Kentucky University","collection":"Herbarium - Northern Kentucky University","recordsets":"2941b767-e90b-41b9-9627-6e589e0c0c85","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"2941b767-e90b-41b9-9627-6e589e0c0c85\"}","institution_code":"KNK","collection_code":"KNK","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:a58e0dd1-af01-48a4-80d5-04b88a0481a2","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:12525","collection_url":"http://www.nku.edu/~herbarium/","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":35000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Kentucky;

The collection is used extensively by most of the world's arachnologists. The geographic scope is worldwide, with special strengths in the New World. The AMNH also has the second-largest collection of scorpions, and the largest collection of minor arachnid orders in North America. The myriapod collections are also among the largest in North America. The collections include a worldwide representation of arachnid and myriapod taxa, with a strong emphasis on material from North America and elsewhere in the New World. The majority of specimens are preserved in ethanol, although large collections of slide-mounted Acari and pseudoscorpions are also represented. A small quantity of unsorted dried material, mostly from South America, is being rehydrated and transferred to ethanol. Collections are continually being augmented with new material collected by AMNH staff, or acquired as donations or purchases.In 2002, the arachnid and myriapod collections were transferred to a new storage facility within the AMNH, the Starr Natural Sciences building (NSB). In the NSB, specimens are stored in state-of-the-art cabinetry and a climate-controlled environment to ensure their longevity. A complete overhaul of the collection, whereby all old, unstandardized bottles and vials, many with bake-lite closures or rubber stoppers, are replaced by new glass jars of standardized volumes with polyethylene closures and polypropylene-foam liners, has been underway for several years. The entire collection is also gradually being databased, and archival data labels newly printed for each specimen-lot.Scorpions comprise the second largest component of the AMNH arachnid and myriapod collections, after spiders. Currently comprising over 30,000 specimen-lots, including several hundred type specimens, the AMNH has the fourth-largest scorpion collection in the world, including a vast array of New and Old World taxa. Several thousand specimens from South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, including numerous undescribed species, remain to be sorted and identified, and the collection continues to be increased as a result of active field projects. Particular strengths of the collections are in New World, and especially North American families. The AMNH has one of the two largest collections of vaejovid scorpions in the world (the California Academy of Sciences has the other). It incorporates the Oscar F. Francke collection, rich in vaejovid and iurid material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A., and containing many large series collected with U.V. light detection, but also containing material from elsewhere in the world. It also incorporates the Willis J. Gertsch collection, containing a significant amount of material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. Recent acquisition of the Alexis Harington collection (ca. 10,000 specimens) vastly expanded the holdings of African material. Southern African taxa are particularly well represented in this collection, which comprises a more representative sample than most southern African collections. All families and genera, and most species of southern African scorpions are represented; including many rare or seldom collected species. Most species are represented by series from multiple localities, many representing new records and/or range extensions. In addition, there are reasonable holdings of extralimital African taxa, and taxa from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. As part of Dr Prendini's research on the molecular systematics of scorpions, a synoptic collection of tissues from scorpions is steadily being deposited in the Ambrose Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research of the AMNH. Developed through fieldwork and donations or exchanges with colleagues around the world, this collection is continually augmented and includes sizable holdings of tissue samples from Amblypygi, Schizomida, Solifugae and Thelyphonida and other arachnid and myriapod taxa, in addition to Scorpiones. Samples are housed at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-150Â°C) to maintain the highest quality and maximum stability of biomolecules indefinitely.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"World's largest collection of spiders and second largest collection of scorpions.","geographic_range":"Global, with strengths in the New World, North America and Africa.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Lorenzo Prendini","contact_role":"Curator-in-charge","contact_email":"lorenzo@amnh.org","mailing_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","mailing_city":"New York","mailing_state":"New York","mailing_zip":"10024-5192","physical_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","physical_city":"New York","physical_state":"New York","physical_zip":"10024-5192","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:a312a5eb-8a63-4ef7-b57c-6bbea34f37c3","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":40.786,"lon":-73.9684},{"institution":"Virginia Museum of Natural History","collection":"Entomology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"VMNH","collection_code":"VMNH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:50d316dd-90e0-46a0-a7ed-2c730f4f99aa","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.vmnh.net/","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Kal Ivanov","contact_role":"","contact_email":"kal.ivanov@vmnh.virginia.gov","mailing_address":"21 Starling Avenue","mailing_city":"Martinsville","mailing_state":"Virginia","mailing_zip":"24112","physical_address":"21 Starling Avenue","physical_city":"Martinsville","physical_state":"Virginia","physical_zip":"24112","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:906d26a2-01e3-42a8-a099-614cb2e1ca83","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":36.6866,"lon":-79.8634},{"institution":"Mississippi Museum of Natural Science","collection":"Vertebrate Paleontology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"MMNS","collection_code":"MMNS VP, VP","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:de847e88-df4b-4894-830e-8d9de5bbd934","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.mdwfp.com/museum/seek-study/bio-collections/paleontology/","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"30,000 vertebrate fossils (2-28-2017) covering primarily the Upper Cretaceous marine, Paleogene marine, and Pleistocene terrestrial record of Mississippi and the surrounding Gulf Coastal Plain.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"George E.

A large part of the Illinois Natural History Fish Collection comes from specimens collected from 1880 to 1905 for S.A. Forbes and R.E. Richardson&#39;s &quot;The Fishes of Illinois&quot; published in 1908 and from specimens collected from 1950 to 1978 for P.W. Smith&#39;s &quot;The Fishes of Illinois&quot; published in 1979. Thousands of specimens have been added from other areas of North and South America in the past few decades. The collection contains representatives from 48 of the 50 states and many countries including: Angola, Antigua, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, England, Guyana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Trinidad Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. The geographic scope of the collection is about 58% from Illinois, 28% from elsewhere in North America, 13% from South America, and 1% from the rest of the world, including Antarctica.  \t  \tHoldings. The collection contains nearly 865,000 catalogued specimens and over 100,000 lots, which makes it about the 15th largest collection of preserved fishes, and the 6th largest collection of Neotropical fishes in North America. Represented are about 170 families and over 2,500 species. The value of the collection is greatly enhanced by the large number of old specimens, many of which were collected in the late 1800&#39;s from areas where they no longer occur. The type collection contains 1220 specimens representing 93 nominal species. Name-bearing type material consists of 31 holotypes (37 species), 5 lectotypes, and 7 series of syntypes (39 specimens).

Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The geographic scope of our bird specimens is global, representing 38 countries. As in all of our collections, the emphasis is on Colorado species (over 80% represented) with material dating from the early 1800s to the present. Nearly 6,000 specimens were donated by the Colorado College Museum in Colorado Springs in the 1960s. This material includes the collection of Charles E. Aiken, a pioneer ornithologist in Colorado, and dates back to 1805. The Bird collection is also home to several specimens of iconic extinct species such as Passenger Pigeons and Carolina Parakeets.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":13937,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"7 type specimens (1 holotype & 6 paratypes).

Current holdings of nearly 8 million specimens include a wide range of terrestrial invertebrates, specializing in arthropods (insects, millipedes, centipedes, scorpions, mites, ticks, and spiders), crustaceans (pill and sow bugs, fairy and tadpole shrimp), and tardigrade water bears. The largest collections are of the Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Acarina and Tardigrada. The collections are worldwide in scope, with the Americas, south Asia and Australia particularly well-represented.

Founded in the early 1900s, this collection consists of approximately 89% North Carolina material, although 31 states, 21 countries, and more than 405 genera are represented. The Vertebrate Paleontology Collection contains eight holotypes and twelve paratypes. The type collections include several different fish and sharks and one bird specimen. The most published on specimens in this collection are an Acrocanthosaurus atokensis which has been used in numerous phylogenetic studies of therapods and a Thescelosaurus specimen. Significant holding include Late Triassic collections from North Carolina and Arizona, marine Cenozoic collections from North Carolina, and Cretaceous collections from North Carolina, Montana and Utah.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Christian Kammerer","contact_role":"Curator of Paleontology","contact_email":"christian.kammerer@naturalsciences.org","mailing_address":"11 West Jones Street","mailing_city":"Raleigh","mailing_state":"NC","mailing_zip":"27601","physical_address":"11 West Jones Street","physical_city":"Raleigh","physical_state":"NC","physical_zip":"27511","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:7941acfb-400a-48e9-b2b8-615850ef912f","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":35.7822,"lon":-78.6396},{"institution":"New Mexico State University, Collection of Arthropods","collection":"Arthropods","recordsets":"ff111763-e72d-4f24-8914-b5b2dd94908c","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"ff111763-e72d-4f24-8914-b5b2dd94908c\"}","institution_code":"NMSU","collection_code":"NMSU","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:935593cf-eb3d-4cf2-adc6-7828218f932d","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://arthropods.nmsu.edu/","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Scott Bundy","contact_role":"Director","contact_email":"cbundy@nmsu.edu","mailing_address":"945 College Avenue, Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology, Weed Science","mailing_city":"Las Cruces","mailing_state":"New Mexico","mailing_zip":"88003","physical_address":"945 College Avenue, Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology, Weed Science","physical_city":"Las Cruces","physical_state":"New Mexico","physical_zip":"88003","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:5140fcc8-46aa-4505-b78c-006ed8998433","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":32.7751,"lon":-108.2833},{"institution":"Linfield College","collection":"Herbarium - Linfield College","recordsets":"23b85d9d-4669-40db-901f-aaad686fe0b8","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"23b85d9d-4669-40db-901f-aaad686fe0b8\"}","institution_code":"LINF, LINCO","collection_code":"Vascular, LINCO","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:d96e6e19-935f-423f-a625-e30ca81e8424","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":4552,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Pacific Northwest, with focus on the Willamette Valley, Cascade Mountains and Oregon coast; Malheur County and the Siskiyou Mts. of southwestern Oregon","collectionExtent":"","contact":"John Syirng","contact_role":"Herbarium Director and Curator","contact_email":"jsyring@linfield.edu","mailing_address":"900 SE Baker St.","mailing_city":"McMinnville","mailing_state":"Oregon","mailing_zip":"97128","physical_address":"900 SE Baker St.","physical_city":"McMinnville","physical_state":"Oregon","physical_zip":"97128","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=177283","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":45.201908,"lon":-123.199567},{"institution":"Columbus State University","collection":"Herbarium - Columbus State University","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"COLG","collection_code":"COLG","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:08c0c595-c624-41cf-b7ed-83c3c98a0cef","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:12880","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":10000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"West-central Georgia; eastern Alabama.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Julie A.

Located on the Griffin campus of the University of Georgia, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, the PGRCU is one of four regional plant introduction stations and is also known as Multistate Research Project S-009 and the Southeran Regional Plant Introduction Station. The PGRCU is charged with the responsibility to acquire, characterize, maintain, evaluate, document, and distribute genetic resources of agronomic and horticultural crops. Objectives include conserving genetic resources and associated information for a broad spectrum of crops and related species; developing and applying new or improved evaluation procedures and marker-based approaches to assess diversity of genetic resources in the collections and evaluate materials for useful traits; and transferring technology to researchers and plant breeders in the Southern Region and worldwide in the form of plant genetic resources and associated information.

The collection also includes substantial numbers of specimens from elsewhere in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean region, the Galapagos Islands, and Vietnam. The division maintains representative skeletal material, a small type collection, and a collection of uncatalogued specimens for teaching purposes. Important collections in the division&#39;s holdings are from Big Bend National Park by W.G. Degenhardt and T.L. Brown (all taxa), the Appalachian Plateau by G.B. Wilmott (salamanders), the West Indies by K.L. Jones (leptodactylid frogs), and the Delmarva Peninsula by R. Conant (all taxa). A collection of 5,000 amphibians and reptiles made by William J. Koster formed the basis of the original collection; however,a dramatic increase in holdings occurred with the arrival of William G. Degenhardt in 1960 from Texas A&amp;M University. Through Degenhardt&#39;s own collecting efforts and those of his students, the division grew rapidly in size during the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s. Since the late 1980&#39;s, the division has become the primary repository for specimens collected as part of expanding research on the State&#39;s herpetofauna by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and continues to receive  collections provided by researchers from a variety of state and federal agencies. These extensive collections and the increased knowledge of New Mexico&#39;s herpetofauna has resulted in the publication of Amphibians and Reptiles of New Mexico (1996) by W.G. Degenhardt, C.W. Painter &amp; A.H. Price.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":100000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"The MSB amphibian and reptile collections are taxonomically broad, covering over 60 different families of amphibians and reptiles (representing over 60% of known families), and 1100 genera (representing ~74% of all known genera world-wide).

The collection has particularly strong geographic representation of the Pacific Northwest. More than 2,200 specimens are forest-dwelling amphibians from Western Washington obtained during wildlife studies in the 1980s and early 1990s. About 900 are garter snakes collected during the mid-1900s. In 2010, Dr. Adam Leache joined the Burke Museum as Curator of Genetic Resources and Herpetology. The entire collection was inventoried, catalogued, and georeferenced. This transition made the Burke Herpetology data searchable and mappable to the public for the first time. The geographic scope of the collection has expended greatly since 2010, and new collections from Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Ghana are now available that reflect active research programs by herpetology staff. The collection consists largely of alcohol-reserved specimens with a small number of photographs and skeletons. Genetic resources are available for all specimens collected since 2010.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":8000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Amphibia, Reptilia","geographic_range":"The UW Burke Museum herpetology collection is global, with especially strong holdings from the Pacific Northwest, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Ghana.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Adam Leache","contact_role":"Curator of Genetic Resources and Herpetology","contact_email":"leache@uw.edu","mailing_address":"Box 353010, University of Washington","mailing_city":"Seattle","mailing_state":"Washington","mailing_zip":"98195-3010","physical_address":"17th Avenue NE and NE 45th Street., University of Washington","physical_city":"Seattle","physical_state":"","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:fd2c8337-ad3e-485e-93ba-7b0292dbd2eb","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":47.6546,"lon":-122.304},{"institution":"The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens","collection":"Herbarium - The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"HNT","collection_code":"HNT","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:43225348-0269-424d-bb04-02e6e334b328","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15504","collection_url":"http://swbiodiversity.org/seinet/collections/harvestparams.php","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":15000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Cactaceae; Crassulaceae; Euphorbiaceae; Arecaceae; Araucariaceae; Podocarpaceae; stem succulents; desert plants; collection focus is on vouchering cultivated plants from living collection","geographic_range":"Worldwide; American tropics, especially Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, and Colombia","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Brian Dorsey","contact_role":"Chief Botanist","contact_email":"bdorsey@huntington.org","mailing_address":"1151 Oxford Road","mailing_city":"San Marino","mailing_state":"California","mailing_zip":"91108","physical_address":"","physical_city":"San Marino","physical_state":"California","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=124791","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":34.1296,"lon":-118.114},{"institution":"Central Wyoming College","collection":"Herbarium - Central Wyoming College","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"CWC","collection_code":"CWC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:8d1ed8ce-0fc1-443c-b2ca-2da5da5eb438","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15029","collection_url":"http://fcwp.org/Herbarium_files/Herbarium.htm","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":45000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Alpine vascular plants; weeds of the western U.S.; lichens and mosses","geographic_range":"Western North America, especially Wyoming and Rocky Mountains","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Richard W.

Research topics include the species limits and species diversity, evolution, geography, genetics and genomics, morphology, conservation, ecology, and behavior. This work is greatly enhanced by extensive research collections of world birds, numbering more than 107,000 specimens, many of which are recently collected as part of the group&#39;s global bird sampling program.<br /> <br />\n\n\nOrnithology&#39;s study skin collections total about 60,000 specimens. The historical collections are strongest for the Great Plains of the United States and for Mexico, with additional holdings from Central and South America, Borneo, and Kenya. Recent large-scale collections have built significant recent holdings from Mexico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Panama, Guyana, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mongolia, China, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Palau, and others. Collections of special importance include series of more than 14,000 House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), which formed the basis for landmark scientific research by Richard Johnston and his students; extensive series of several North American species (Red-winged Blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus, meadowlarks Sturnella spp., Horned LarkEremophila alpestris); series documenting many of the Great Plains hybrid zones; and the feathers of an extinct moa (Dinornithidae). Recent additions include extensive series from Guyana, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Paraguay, including many species otherwise poorly represented in scientific collections.<br /> <br />\n\nThe avian osteological collections are extensive, totaling over 32,500 specimens, and ranked third largest in the world (Wood and Schnell 1986). This component of the collection has important strengths from the Great Plains of the United States, Mexico, and northern South America. Important holdings include critical and unique Ecuadorian series, extensive recent Australian material, and a large series of steamer-ducks (Tachyeres sp.). Recent collecting activities have built South American skeletal holdings into an important collection, with material from poorly represented sectors such as the Atlantic Forest, the Yucatan Peninsula, Guyana, and montane Central America.<br /> <br />\nÂ \nAlthough fluid-preserved specimens were not an early focus of Ornithology activities, the collections at KU were ranked seventh in North America at the time of the last summary of anatomical holdings (Wood et al. 1982). More recently, as part of Prum&#39;s research program, these collections have grown significantly, with important holdings of suboscine passeriform birds, among other groups. Now housed with ample space and ideal storage conditions in an NSF- and State of Kansas-funded addition, this collection is seeing increased research applications.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"All birds: Aves, Birds","geographic_range":"The Division has an active, global collections program, which has created recent collections resources from all continents except Antarctica.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"A.

Currently located on the 2nd floor, A-wing, of the Baylor Sciences Building, the herbarium was organized by Dr. Floyd F. Davidson in 1967, then chair of the department, with the first curator Ms. Fannie Mae Hurst-Windham. Much of the herbarium is dedicated to Texas flora, though with specimens included from Oklahoma, Louisiana, Central/South America, and China. The herbarium also houses over 200+ specimens from Lindheimer, specifically those specimens near New Braunfels and Comanche Spring. Dr. Walter Holmes, Professor Emeritus of Biology at Baylor University, is the most recent curator of the herbarium who has specialized in the genus Mikania (Asteraceae) with the herbarium containing several types specimens.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":82000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Texas.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"","contact_role":"","contact_email":"","mailing_address":"101 Bagby Avenue","mailing_city":"Waco","mailing_state":"Texas","mailing_zip":"76798-7388","physical_address":"101 Bagby Avenue","physical_city":"Waco","physical_state":"Texas","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=124021","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":31.5521,"lon":-97.11469},{"institution":"Texas Memorial Museum, Texas Natural History Collection","collection":"Invertebrate Zoology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"TNHC","collection_code":"TNHC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:486a41dd-ae52-4ee4-9dbb-24faa96afce6","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.utexas.edu/tmm/tnhc/invertzoology/index.html","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"James R.

A few lots of marine crustaceans found along the North American coastline are also present in the collection.  We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998.

Richardson and other Field Museum geologists plus numerous donations from other museums, universities, and the general public. In 1965 the Field Museum acquired the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Walker Museum fossil invertebrates, which more than doubled the total number of specimens in the collection. Today there are an estimated 2 million specimens divided into ~320,000 specimen lots. The majority of the collection is arranged systematically divided by geologic periods.

The collection is an idiosyncratic collection of what was left behind, what Iâve collected, and butterflies gifted to the College.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Chris Paradise","contact_role":"","contact_email":"chparadise@davidson.edu","mailing_address":"405 N Main St","mailing_city":"Davidson","mailing_state":"North Carolina","mailing_zip":"28035","physical_address":"405 N Main St","physical_city":"Davidson","physical_state":"North Carolina","physical_zip":"28035","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:84b15f7f-6897-402b-8b9e-18186e54c657","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":35.488697,"lon":-80.830124},{"institution":"Severin-McDaniel Insect Collection","collection":"Entomology","recordsets":"e597a4f6-2be7-4538-8007-dec480dc4d6f","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"e597a4f6-2be7-4538-8007-dec480dc4d6f\"}","institution_code":"SDSU","collection_code":"SMIRC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:fea1c2e0-5fd6-4b92-afd3-f715d3f5009f","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/j1yc-pyd8","collection_url":"https://www.sdstate.edu/agronomy-horticulture-plant-science/severin-mcdaniel-insect-research-collection","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Paul Johnson","contact_role":"","contact_email":"paul.johnson@sdstate.edu","mailing_address":"Department of Agronomy, Horticulture, and Plant Science, Box 2207A","mailing_city":"Brookings","mailing_state":"South Dakota","mailing_zip":"57007","physical_address":"1015 Campanile Ave.","physical_city":"Brookings","physical_state":"South Dakota","physical_zip":"57007","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:d26547cc-d4f8-4617-b8ea-df1cf6b1578a","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":null,"lon":null},{"institution":"University of Texas at Austin","collection":"Lundell Herbarium at the University of Texas at Austin","recordsets":"c5b7dae8-b483-4742-9954-d7f9226daa34","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"c5b7dae8-b483-4742-9954-d7f9226daa34\"}","institution_code":"LL","collection_code":"LL","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:4fb7a019-2f97-4188-bf20-a10dad67487b","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:14627","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular plants; Poaceae, Myrsinaceae, Celastraceae, and Sapotaceae","geographic_range":"Texas, Central America, and Mexico; worldwide","collectionExtent":"","contact":"","contact_role":"","contact_email":"","mailing_address":"","mailing_city":"Austin","mailing_state":"Texas","mailing_zip":"","physical_address":"","physical_city":"Austin","physical_state":"Texas","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:59ac3cdc-5938-49b0-9429-2cb1e80d22b6","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=126842","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":30.28626,"lon":-97.733774},{"institution":"University of Alaska Museum","collection":"UAM Insect Collection (Arctos)","recordsets":"eaa5f19e-ff6f-4d09-8b55-4a6810e77a6c","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"eaa5f19e-ff6f-4d09-8b55-4a6810e77a6c\"}","institution_code":"UAM","collection_code":"Insect specimens, Ento, UAM:Ento","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:db38fdb9-9273-41e3-83b6-194645fb1c45","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/h1ke-esxn","collection_url":"http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/ento/","collection_catalog_url":"http://arctos.database.museum/uam_ento","description":"The UAM Insect collection is the northern-most facility of its kind in the United States. 98.5% of our records are from Alaska. Although a young collection (begun in 2000), we have recently surpassed 200,000 records representing over 1 million specimens (as of June 2014), making this collection the fourth largest in the US in entomology with data served to iDigBio. Over 99% of these records have been georeferenced. Over 75% of the pinned collection has been databased; approximately 10% of the wet collection has been databased. At least one specimen of every lowest identification, in both the pinned and wet collections, has been databased so we have a complete online taxon inventory of the collection. 136,257 specimens have been identified to the species level - these represent 2,869 species (23% are apparent new records for the state). Coleoptera, Odonata, and Hymenoptera are the most well-curated groups. 56,187 of these specimen records have been cited or otherwise used in 38 peer-reviewed publications.

The collection is used extensively by most of the world's arachnologists. The geographic scope is worldwide, with special strengths in the New World. The AMNH also has the second-largest collection of scorpions, and the largest collection of minor arachnid orders in North America. The myriapod collections are also among the largest in North America. The collections include a worldwide representation of arachnid and myriapod taxa, with a strong emphasis on material from North America and elsewhere in the New World. The majority of specimens are preserved in ethanol, although large collections of slide-mounted Acari and pseudoscorpions are also represented. A small quantity of unsorted dried material, mostly from South America, is being rehydrated and transferred to ethanol. Collections are continually being augmented with new material collected by AMNH staff, or acquired as donations or purchases.In 2002, the arachnid and myriapod collections were transferred to a new storage facility within the AMNH, the Starr Natural Sciences building (NSB). In the NSB, specimens are stored in state-of-the-art cabinetry and a climate-controlled environment to ensure their longevity. A complete overhaul of the collection, whereby all old, unstandardized bottles and vials, many with bake-lite closures or rubber stoppers, are replaced by new glass jars of standardized volumes with polyethylene closures and polypropylene-foam liners, has been underway for several years. The entire collection is also gradually being databased, and archival data labels newly printed for each specimen-lot.Scorpions comprise the second largest component of the AMNH arachnid and myriapod collections, after spiders. Currently comprising over 30,000 specimen-lots, including several hundred type specimens, the AMNH has the fourth-largest scorpion collection in the world, including a vast array of New and Old World taxa. Several thousand specimens from South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, including numerous undescribed species, remain to be sorted and identified, and the collection continues to be increased as a result of active field projects. Particular strengths of the collections are in New World, and especially North American families. The AMNH has one of the two largest collections of vaejovid scorpions in the world (the California Academy of Sciences has the other). It incorporates the Oscar F. Francke collection, rich in vaejovid and iurid material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A., and containing many large series collected with U.V. light detection, but also containing material from elsewhere in the world. It also incorporates the Willis J. Gertsch collection, containing a significant amount of material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. Recent acquisition of the Alexis Harington collection (ca. 10,000 specimens) vastly expanded the holdings of African material. Southern African taxa are particularly well represented in this collection, which comprises a more representative sample than most southern African collections. All families and genera, and most species of southern African scorpions are represented; including many rare or seldom collected species. Most species are represented by series from multiple localities, many representing new records and/or range extensions. In addition, there are reasonable holdings of extralimital African taxa, and taxa from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. As part of Dr Prendini's research on the molecular systematics of scorpions, a synoptic collection of tissues from scorpions is steadily being deposited in the Ambrose Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research of the AMNH. Developed through fieldwork and donations or exchanges with colleagues around the world, this collection is continually augmented and includes sizable holdings of tissue samples from Amblypygi, Schizomida, Solifugae and Thelyphonida and other arachnid and myriapod taxa, in addition to Scorpiones. Samples are housed at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-150Â°C) to maintain the highest quality and maximum stability of biomolecules indefinitely.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"World's largest collection of spiders and second largest collection of scorpions.","geographic_range":"Global, with strengths in the New World, North America and Africa.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Lorenzo Prendini","contact_role":"Curator-in-charge","contact_email":"lorenzo@amnh.org","mailing_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","mailing_city":"New York","mailing_state":"New York","mailing_zip":"10024-5192","physical_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","physical_city":"New York","physical_state":"New York","physical_zip":"10024-5192","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:a312a5eb-8a63-4ef7-b57c-6bbea34f37c3","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":40.786,"lon":-73.9684},{"institution":"University of Utah","collection":"University of Utah Invertebrates Collection","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"UT","collection_code":"UUIC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:6b35ada6-c063-49df-8f9f-aa85663ef1e1","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"pinned and wet entomological specimens collected by students at the University of Utah","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"variety of recently collected Wasatch Front/Salt Lake County specimens","geographic_range":"Utah","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Donald H.

It contains more than 65,000 specimens in two sub-collections: paleontology and geology (not databased yet). The paleontology collection houses both vertebrate and invertebrate specimens, ranging from Cambrian archaeocyathids to Quaternary mammals. Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates. The collection is growing through active research projects in different regions of Alaska and collaboration with state and federal agencies.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"The UAM Earth Sciences Collection has especially strong coverage of Late Cretaceous Dinosauria and Quaternary Mammalia.

The KU collections include the worldâs largest collection of neotropical amphibian and reptile specimens (200,000&#43;) as well as substantial numbers of Nearctic (80,000&#43;) and Asian (20,000&#43;) specimens. KU holdings are particularly strong for the U.S., Ecuador, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Costa, Rica, Haiti, the Philippines, Peru and Panama. The collection from Kansas is the stateâs largest (20,000&#43;). The type collection includes nearly 400 primary types, mostly amphibians. KU Herpetology also maintains 5000 cleared-and-stained osteological preparations, nearly 5000 dried skeletons, and one of the worldâs largest collections of amphibian larvae (6000&#43; lots).

In all, MNA houses more than 300,000 invertebrate specimens. A total of 79,253 specimens have been databased, including 4,899 species in 1,655 genera among 409 families in 67 orders or higher taxa. The collection features extensive or complete collections of the spiders, butterflies, dragonflies, grasshoppers, and aculeate Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps) of the southern Colorado Plateau. In many cases the MNA holdings are the only complete collections of those taxa from the region. For example, the MNA collection contains 30 tiger beetle taxa from the southern Colorado Plateau, of which nearly one quarter are endemic (unique) to the region.  Also, of the nearly 150 butterfly taxa represented from the southern Plateau in the MNA collections, at least 7 (5%) are endemic. More than 20 (10.5%) of the 191 robber fly species in the MNA database may be new to science.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Colorado Plateau","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Janet Whitmore Gillette","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"jgillette@musnaz.org","mailing_address":"3101 North Fort Valley Road","mailing_city":"Flagstaff","mailing_state":"Arizona","mailing_zip":"86001","physical_address":"Fort Valley Road, U.S. Highway 180.","physical_city":"Flagstaff","physical_state":"Arizona","physical_zip":"86001","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":35.234001,"lon":-111.66378},{"institution":"Tall Timbers Research Station","collection":"Herbarium - Tall Timbers Research Station","recordsets":"06c35934-1b75-4196-838d-29d509951bf9","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"06c35934-1b75-4196-838d-29d509951bf9\"}","institution_code":"TTRS","collection_code":"TTRS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:2f9ce42c-24db-4590-8b12-cd2f01ad1c60","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.ttrs.org/museum.html","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":10025,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Southeastern U.S.A., with emphasis on the Red Hills region of northern Florida and southern Georgia","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Thomas E.

The bird collection houses over 64,000 ornithological specimens. It is the largest Mexican bird collection in the world. The vast majority of the specimens are study skins (60,677), but the MLZ also contains 1,364 skeletons and 536 sets of nests and eggs. Robert T. Moore and his wife Margaret founded the MLZ in 1950, moving Mooreâs personal collection from his Pasadena home to the building at Occidental College. Prominent collectors aside from Moore include Chester C.

Specimens date back to the 1880&#39;s with the majority documenting the rapid environmental change that has occurred since the 1950&#39;s.   The collections are taxonomically broad, representing 25 orders, 106 families, 543 genera, ~1,750 species.  The majority from the Orders Rodentia (249,000), Chiroptera (27,000), Carnivora (20,000), Eulipotyphla (16,000) and Artiodactyla (7,800).  The collections are world-wide in scope (78 countries and all 50 US states) with particularly strong holdings from Western North America (225,000 specimens), Beringia and high latitudes (39,000 from Alaska, Russia and Canada), Mongolia (6,500 specimens and parasites), and Latin America (10,200 specimens from Bolivia, 10,000 from Panama, 7,000 from Chile, and 5,400 from Argentina).  The collection contains 89 holotypes or paratypes, 185 parasite symbiotypes and 22 virus symbiotypes.   Important collections integrated into the MSB include the USGS Biological Surveys collection (30,000), the UIMNH (Hoffmeister) Collection (33,000), and the Rausch Collection (4,000 specimens and parasites).  Specimens range from traditional skin/skull and fluid vouchers to &#34;holistic vouchers&#34; containing skin, skull, post-cranial skeleton, up to seven tissue types (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, muscle, blood), cell suspensions, and ecto and endo parasites.    Additionally, frozen tissue samples are available for about 200,000 individual mammals and date back to the late 1970&#39;s.    37,000 specimens have serology data associated with hantavirus surveillance programs in the Americas.   The MSB houses an extensive archive of field journals and catalogues that date to the 1900&#39;s and are associated with specimens held in the collection.     The collections are growing rapidly through the active research programs of curators, staff and students and ongoing collaborations with other institutions and governmental agencies.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":327000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"The MSB mammal collections are taxonomically broad, representing 27 orders, 103 families, 513 genera, and approximately 1,400 species.

The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).    Holdings. The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study &quot;The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,&quot; published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963).    Frozen Tissues. We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998. This collection may be searched by choosing the appropriate link from the Data tab, above.

This diversity is most notable among the freshwater and terrestrial Mollusca. Approximately 200 of the 300 known species of North American freshwater mussels have been reported from the waters of Alabama, and these systems once supported nearly 250 species of aquatic snails. Additionally, there are 85 species of crayfish in Alabama, the highest of any state in the US. Unfortunately, this spectacular biodiversity has been severely compromised by human activities. Modification of large river systems has resulted in substantial habitat loss, and many aquatic species now have highly fragmented distributions.In 1999 we began to accumulate material from Alabamaâs populations of mollusks and other aquatic invertebrates.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Jack W.

With early acquisitions from the Brimley brothers in the late 1800&rsquo;s, the collection consists of 42% North Carolina, 81% Southeastern United States, 96% United States material, with the remainder having North American or other international origin. It encompasses the taxonomic units of 20 orders, 73 families, 237 genera, and over 500 unique Genus-species combinations. Holdings are especially strong in Rodentia, Soricimorpha, Chiroptera, Carnivora, Cetacea and Sirenia. Important recent acquisitions include University of Kentucky, George Mason University, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and personal collections. The collection includes study skins, tanned hides, skulls, complete skeletons, fluid-preserved material, tissues for molecular analyses, and other materials.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Mammalia","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Michael Cove","contact_role":"Research Curator, Mammalogy","contact_email":"michael.cove@naturalsciences.org","mailing_address":"11 West Jones Street","mailing_city":"Raleigh","mailing_state":"NC","mailing_zip":"27601","physical_address":"1213 Fairlane Road","physical_city":"Cary","physical_state":"NC","physical_zip":"27511","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:7941acfb-400a-48e9-b2b8-615850ef912f","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":35.7822,"lon":-78.6396},{"institution":"University of North Carolina at Asheville","collection":"Herbarium - University of North Carolina at Asheville","recordsets":"312cf3f1-2913-4c63-9ba8-0b870cd3c120, de67ccab-7d04-43b9-8083-81e45f628505","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":[\"de67ccab-7d04-43b9-8083-81e45f628505\",\"312cf3f1-2913-4c63-9ba8-0b870cd3c120\"]}","institution_code":"UNCA","collection_code":"UNCA","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:86cc64f7-7479-4ddb-bb02-b336111d94d6","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":5000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Western North Carolina, especially Polk County","collectionExtent":"","contact":"H.

In 1981 the HWML was designated as one of three National Resource Centers for Parasitology and many students associated with the lab have been trained in systematics as well as other aspects of parasitology. Three Henry Baldwin Ward Medalists (the highest annual award that is given by the American Society of Parasitologists) were students in Parasitology and in the lab while Professor Mary Hanson Pritchard directed the laboratory (Professor Pritchard is now Curator Emeritus). In the past 5 years, more than 150 publications have resulted from research both in the HWML and from specimens loaned from, or deposited into, the HWML as types or vouchers.

The collection consists primarily of insects, arachnids, and crustaceans. The pinned collection contains over 3,200 genera and 7,500 identified species. These counts are underestimated because they were made over a decade ago and the majority of the collection holdings have not been identified nor cataloged. The estimated minimal numbers are: Pinned Insects about 1 million individuals, Med/Vet Zoology about 75,000, Arachnids under 50,000, Miscellaneous groups under 1,000. At least 3 million specimens are retained as sealed, bulk specimens. These samples are mostly cataloged and are being split and labeled as time permits (motivated by researchers' needs). There are currently slightly more than 800 type specimens (mostly paratypes) in the collection.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Jennifer GirÃ³n","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"jennifer.giron@ttu.edu","mailing_address":"3301 4th St, PO Box 43191","mailing_city":"Lubbock","mailing_state":"Texas","mailing_zip":"79409","physical_address":"3301 4th St, PO Box 43191","physical_city":"Lubbock","physical_state":"Texas","physical_zip":"79409","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:acf2c3d2-5011-4bc6-ad0e-8fee7547a0f4","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":33.590161,"lon":-101.88581},{"institution":"University of Tulsa","collection":"Herbarium - University of Tulsa","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"TULS","collection_code":"TULS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:07ed6190-a075-4059-9d52-a28d056f972a","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:14653","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":11500,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Oklahoma.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"","contact_role":"","contact_email":"","mailing_address":"","mailing_city":"Tulsa","mailing_state":"Oklahoma","mailing_zip":"74104-3189","physical_address":"600 South College Avenue.","physical_city":"Tulsa","physical_state":"Oklahoma","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=126875","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":36.14687,"lon":-95.945366},{"institution":"Chicago Academy of Sciences","collection":"Earth Sciences, Paleontology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"CASM, CHAS, CA","collection_code":"CHAS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:49e72e88-f27e-4511-a7ec-71cdec3d8acc","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.naturemuseum.org/the-museum/collections/Earth-Science","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":23200,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Invertebrates and plants.","geographic_range":"North America, particularly the Midwest / Great Lakes region of the United States.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Dawn Roberts","contact_role":"Director of Collections","contact_email":"droberts@naturemuseum.org","mailing_address":"2430 North Cannon Drive","mailing_city":"Chicago","mailing_state":"Illinois","mailing_zip":"60614","physical_address":"2430 North Cannon Drive","physical_city":"Chicago","physical_state":"Illinois","physical_zip":"60614","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:93877ee6-76bc-4ca0-8ee6-7eae72061ed6","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":41.926835,"lon":-87.635343},{"institution":"Haleakala National Park","collection":"Herbarium - Haleakala National Park","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"HALE, HNPH","collection_code":"HALE","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:2b42337c-2e18-448f-bac7-bca69fe0b1a6","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.pacificherbaria.org/cph/HALE","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":2537,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Elizabeth A.

The collection includes over 300,000 species representing approximately 60% of known insect families. With specimens from locations worldwide, the collections are second to none in coverage for the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. Specimens from the Old World are also well represented, especially from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. Particular strengths include mosquitoes, wasps, beetles, butterflies and moths, and flies. Although the bulk of the collection is kept dry, various groups&mdash;such as spiders&mdash;are stored in alcohol.   The collections are typically arranged by taxon; lower categories (genus, species) are arranged alphabetically, and for select taxa, they are further organized by country of origin within each species.   While the majority of the collection is housed at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, some groups are held at other research facilities in nearby Maryland, including the USDA Agricutural Research Center&#39;s Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland and the Smithsonian Institution&#39;s Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"M.

The primary UK collection had its beginning in 1889 under the newly formed Entomology Departmentâs chair, Harrison H Garman. Charles Covelle of the University of Louisville facilitated donating their collection to UK; the transfer was completed in 2003. In 2010, the combined collection was moved into its current location in the Dimock building on the UK main campus. The collection is housed in compactors and consists of somewhere between Â½ and 1 million pinned specimens in 1,868 drawers. Major strengths include leafhoppers (>250 drawers) and Lepidoptera (730 drawers) where taxonomists Paul Freytag (UK, leafhoppers) and Charles Covelle, Jr. (U of L, Lepidoptera) spent their careers studying these groups. The collection is Kentucky-centric, but has specimens from all over the US, and more exotic locations in Central and South America (Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela), Asia (Japan, Phillipines, Thailand) and the Middle East (Saudi Arabia). There is also a more modest collection of ethanol-preserved specimens.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":4000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"Insecta","geographic_range":"US, Central and South America (Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela), Asia (Japan, Phillipines, Thailand) and the Middle East (Saudi Arabia)","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Julian Dupuis","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"julian.dupuis@uky.edu","mailing_address":"S123 Ag Science â North","mailing_city":"Lexington","mailing_state":"Kentucky","mailing_zip":"40546-0091","physical_address":"","physical_city":"Lexington","physical_state":"Kentucky","physical_zip":"40546-0091","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:6eebc307-c784-4339-86c7-88d5e918ba78","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":38.031394,"lon":-84.505212},{"institution":"University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras","collection":"Zoology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"UPRRP","collection_code":"UPRRP","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:4d1be742-ff19-11e4-9eb2-002315492bbc","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/pk4h-w16e","collection_url":"http://mzoologia.uprrp.edu/index.php?page=collection","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"amphibians and reptiles of Puerto Rico, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, and arachnids","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":60000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"amphibians and reptiles of Puerto Rico, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, and arachnids","collectionExtent":"","contact":"James D.

It includes one of the largest collections of freshwater crayfish in, and of the southeastern USA, a substantial and internationally significant myriapod collection, and one of the largest and most historically important collections of marine invertebrates in the Mid-Atlantic region.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Bronwyn Williams","contact_role":"Research Curator, Non-molluscan Invertebrates","contact_email":"bronwyn.williams@naturalsciences.org","mailing_address":"11 West Jones Street","mailing_city":"Raleigh","mailing_state":"NC","mailing_zip":"27601","physical_address":"11 West Jones Street","physical_city":"Raleigh","physical_state":"NC","physical_zip":"27601","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:7941acfb-400a-48e9-b2b8-615850ef912f","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":35.7822,"lon":-78.6396},{"institution":"Salem International University","collection":"Herbarium - Salem International University","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"SAWV","collection_code":"SAWV","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:c7df0a42-418c-448c-909e-d13d9ed9f4f2","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:13975","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":3600,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"West Virginia.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Suzanne Rogers","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"","mailing_address":"","mailing_city":"Salem","mailing_state":"West Virginia","mailing_zip":"","physical_address":"","physical_city":"Salem","physical_state":"West Virginia","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=125854","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":39.284748,"lon":-80.561966},{"institution":"New York State Museum","collection":"Malacology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"NYSM, NYS","collection_code":"NYSM","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:41e6fbe6-0ae2-42e5-a117-8e88b7548622","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/research_collections/collections/biology/malacology.html","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"John P.

The dry collection is housed in modern metal cabinets, in Cornell-style drawers, and is mostly sorted to the family level. The collection holds about 20 primary types, described as a result of California beetle surveys, housed separately from the remainder of the collection.

It is a prominent regional research collection that is available to botanists around the world and is also a valuable teaching facility for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in various botanical disciplines or in wildlife biology. The first significant collections are those made by O.E. Sperry in 1935-1946. The physical herbarium was probably started by L.C. Hinkley but B.H. Warnock was responsible for the largest early collection of plants and major development of the herbarium as a research facility. Another major contributor was M.C Johnston. More recently, the herbarium has grown through the efforts of A.M. Powell, in whose honor the university renamed the herbarium in 2003.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":100000,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Trans-Pecos Texas; northern Chihuahuan Desert.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"A.

The European portion of the collection is small, but significant, and includes fossil plants from Armissan, France, the only collection known outside of Paris; Gelinden, Belgium, the only collection residing in North America; and Monte Bolca, Italy, for which CM has the largest holding in the USA. Additionally, there are collections made by CM vertebrate paleontologists (e.g. Earl Douglass and J. LeRoy Kay) in conjunction with their collection of vertebrate fossils from western USA. Highlights are numerous fossils from various localities in the Paleogene Green River Formation of western USA and two moderate collections from MontanaâWillow Creek, Fergus County (Late Cretaceous) and Bear Creek, Madison County (Cretaceous/Paleocene). The most recent addition to the collection is fossil plants from Antarctica. One caution in using this database is that many of the taxonomic identifications are old and may need to be verified before use.","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, Antarctica","collectionExtent":"","contact":"","contact_role":"","contact_email":"","mailing_address":"4400 Forbes Avenue","mailing_city":"Pittsburgh","mailing_state":"Pennsylvania","mailing_zip":"15213","physical_address":"4400 Forbes Avenue","physical_city":"Pittsburgh","physical_state":"PA","physical_zip":"15213","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:806b335a-9236-425e-a8be-21eb9772e657","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":40.444012,"lon":-79.950363},{"institution":"University of Texas Rio Grande Valley","collection":"Herbarium - University of Texas Rio Grande Valley","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"RUNYON","collection_code":"RUNYON","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:7e88af4c-f2cf-4bb8-9e3a-1ec85f8c8239","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15056","collection_url":"","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":200,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas, and adjacent Mexico.","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Alejandro Fierro Cabo","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"alejandro.fierrocabo@utrgv.edu","mailing_address":"80 Fort Brown","mailing_city":"Brownsville","mailing_state":"Texas","mailing_zip":"78520","physical_address":"","physical_city":"Brownsville","physical_state":"Texas","physical_zip":"","UniqueNameUUID":"","attributionLogoURL":"","providerManagedID":"","derivedFrom":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=125790","flags":"","portalDisplay":"","lat":25.900684,"lon":-97.49231},{"institution":"Georgia Museum of Natural History","collection":"Ornithology","recordsets":"","recordsetQuery":"","institution_code":"GMNH, UGCA","collection_code":"GMNH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:fece0396-afcb-424c-b1ce-7302aaa11a52","collection_lsid":"","collection_url":"http://museum.nhm.uga.edu/index.php?page=content/researchcollections/collections#ornithology","collection_catalog_url":"","description":"","descriptionForSpecialists":"","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"knownToContainTypes":null,"taxonCoverage":"","geographic_range":"","collectionExtent":"","contact":"Steven B.

It is also the largest insect collection in the state, with approximately 280,000 pinned specimens, and 20,000 DNA-grade specimens preserved in ethanol. The species represented in the collection represent the diversity of insectâs populations in Vermont, though the range of the specimens is worldwide. The collection consists of approximately 40% Coleoptera, 10% Hemiptera, 10% Diptera, 10% Lepidoptera, 5% Hymenoptera and 5% Odonata, and a selection of various other orders of insects; as well as 60,000 Arachnids. The collection is now the only large arthropod collection in the state, since the ruin of the State Invertebrate Collection by flooding from Tropical Storm Irene. The Thompson collection has repeatedly and regularly been accessed by scientists studying taxonomy, nomenclature, phylogenetics, population ecology, and biodiversity of species living in Vermont, as well as being regularly used for biological class instruction, and by non-biologists, including artists and photographers.

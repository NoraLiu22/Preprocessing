      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Istanbul is widely recognized 
        as the name of Turkey's most well known city, but it was not always this 
        way, and even today some confusion over its proper name still exists. 
        The confusion is rooted in the various names the city assumed under the 
        Ottomans in the centuries after their conquest of the city in 1453. Although 
        the Ottomans did not purposely change the city's name, they opted to make 
        &quot;Constantinople&quot; into a more Turkish style name &quot;Konstantiniye&quot; 
        (which loosely translates as "of Constantine"), however variations on 
        Konstantiniye soon cropped up. </font></p>

    <div align="left"> 
      <div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Stanbulin," 
        (Greek for "to the city") once commonly found on road signs directing 
        travelers to the capital, was punned by devout Turks into Islambol, where 
        "Islam abounds." The names Islambol and Konstantiniye were used interchangeably 
        in Ottoman documents up until the empire's demise in 1923. Westerners 
        continued to refer to the city as Constantinople well into the 20th century. 
        In the 19th century, however, the city's large foreign expatriate community 
        took to calling the old city Stamboul. Western accounts of the old city 
        during this period make regular references to the name. </font></div>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many times the Germans 
        refer to Istanbul as 'Konstantinopel', the French and the British as 'Constantinople' 
        and the Italians as 'Constantinopoli'. Although the official name of the 
        city has, ever since the establishment of the Republic, been 'Istanbul' 
        and great sensitivity shown on this subject, Europe resists the adoption 
        of the name 'Istanbul'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">According to a popular 
        story that has existed for many years, the Byzantines did not refer to 
        the city by its actual name, but, because of it size, simply as 'Polis' 
        (the City), and when they wanted to say 'to the City', they said 'eist 
        enpolin' (is-tin-polin), which was the (possible) origin of the name 'Istanbul'. 
        Recent research has shown that the name 'Istanbul' was used if not during 
        the Byzantine period, at least during the 11th century and that the Turks 
        knew the city by this name. Istanbul has had other names at various times 
        but none of them was used widely or for any great length of time. During 
        the Turkish period the names 'Dersaadet' and 'Deraliye' were used. Some 
        official correspondence and coins had the transcription of 'Konstantinoupolis'or 
        'Konstantiniye', although the use of the name 'Konstantiniye' was prohibited 
        at one time during the Ottoman period by Sultan Mustafa III, its use continued, 
        to be abandoned during the republican period. </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left">The name controversy was assumed to be settled when Atatürk 
      officially renamed the city Istanbul in the 1920s. It took Westerners a 
      few decades to accept the name, as Constantinople continued to appear on 
      maps well into the 1960s, when it began to appear in parentheses next to 
      Istanbul. The Greeks still do not use the Turkish name, and Konstantinopolis 
      continues to be used on maps and road signs in Greece today. </div>

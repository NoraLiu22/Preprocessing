<h3 class="hangindent"><span>Program of </span><span>Study</span></h3>




<p>The Department of Music aims to broaden the exposure to and enrich the understanding of the various Western, non-Western, and vernacular musical traditions of the world. Courses develop students’ ability to analyze works and their structures; to understand music within historical lineages and socio-cultural practices; and to engage in the creative practice of music via composition and performance. The BA program in music provides a critical foundation for graduate work in music studies, careers in media production, education, or research, and provides an artistic, humanistic complement to study in other fields. The department also sponsors a music minor as well as a number of courses, performance organizations, and concert experiences available to the non-major.</p>

<h3>Courses for Non-Majors</h3>




<h4>General Education</h4>




<p>General education courses listed here, which do not count toward the music major or minor, are open to all students, regardless of previous musical background; in most cases reading music notation is not required. </p>

<h4>Other Courses for Non-Majors</h4>




<p>For additional electives, non-majors may wish to consider courses in such interdisciplinary programs as Signature Courses in the College (SIGN) or Big Problems (BPRO), and other MUSI electives that do not require score reading. Performance ensembles are also open to all students regardless of major by audition.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="baprogramrequirements"></a>
<h3>BA Program Requirements</h3>




<p>The program for the bachelor's degree in music offers a balance of academic and practice-based approaches to music study. Majors are required to earn at least 1100 units of music course work divided between analytical, historical, cultural, and creative practices. Students have considerable agency to design a major that accords with their own interests, with an additional option to write a BA thesis or composition eligible for special honors. Students plan and formalize their major program of study in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies (see <a href="#Advising">Advising</a>).</p>




<a name="summaryofrequirementsbainmusic"></a>
<h3>Summary of Requirements: BA in Music</h3>




<p>The music major requires 1100 units of study. Six &quot;foundation&quot; courses are chosen from the following areas: Analysis and Techniques, Histories and Cultures, and Creative Practices. Five additional elective courses are also required, which should be chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. </p>

<p>It is advisable for students to begin Analysis and Techniques courses as soon as possible, since these are often prerequisites for electives. A placement exam given on the first day of MUSI 15100 advises students on where to enter the music theory and analysis sequence. Majors should enroll in MUSI 15100, take the placement exam, and be advised on whether to take MUSI 14300, to stay in MUSI 15100, or to begin with MUSI 15200. The Director of Undergraduate Studies can provide additional guidance. </p>

<h3>Electives</h3>




<p>Electives should be chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies according to individual goals and may include:</p>




<ul>
	<li><strong>Academic Courses </strong>(additional foundations-level courses count as electives).</li>
	<li><strong>Performance Ensembles, </strong>up to 100 additional units (a maximum of 200 units of performance ensembles in total may count toward the minor).</li>
</ul>




<a name="performanceprogram"></a>
<h3><a id="Performance Program" name="Performance Program"></a>Performance Program</h3>




<p>Ensembles are open to all qualified students from all areas of the University through competitive auditions held at the beginning of Autumn Quarter. Participation in consecutive quarters (Autumn, Winter, Spring) is expected, unless there are extenuating circumstances (in which case, students may speak with the ensemble director and the Director of Undergraduate Studies). Beginners are welcome in non-Western ensembles, where previous experience is not assumed or required. Most organizations rehearse weekly. Ensemble directors establish their own standards of attendance, participation, repertoire amounts, and performances, within ranges approved by the Music Department faculty, in their individual syllabi. </p>




<p>Music majors and minors who complete a year of performance work in an ensemble with a passing grade will receive 100 units of credit upon completion, by request with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Music. A maximum of three years (300 units) is allowed toward the major, and two years (200 units) toward the minor. Students who are participating in an ensemble enroll on a Pass/Fail basis. There is no option to take an ensemble for a quality grade. Majors and minors who have completed their desired or allowed for-credit units are encouraged to continue participating in an ensemble without requesting additional units of credit. Non-majors and non-minors cannot request credit.</p>

The course itself will be organized around chronological, thematic, and regional lines of investigation ranging from Merovingian France to Early Modern Scotland. Guiding this class will be a broader methodological discussion on the relative merits and demerits of different approaches to studying violence's role in pre-modern societies and politics and how they continue to influence contemporary perceptions of violence, past and present.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Interactive lectures (Mondays and Wednesdays) and discussion sections (Fridays) will engage both scientific and humanistic literature. Among the topics the class will engage are the origins and functions of music, absolute pitch, music and memory, how music shapes emotional responses, movement and music, connections between music and images, and the relationship between music and language.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This course aims to introduce students to various musical and performance traditions in South Asia and their evolution within regimes of institutional, legal and media censorship. The course aims to understand how media environments and cultures of censorship are in some ways fundamental to shaping performance cultures in South Asia in the twentieth century. How do traditions of musical performance entrenched in the politics of caste, communalism, religion, sexuality and gender interact with regimes of censorship and new media? How do the latter remake and unmake said traditions? Be it the mid-century ban on film music by All India Radio to reflect the aspirations of a newly-emerging nation or the appropriation and urbanization of 'folk' musical practices within the recording studios in Nepal by upper-caste, upper-class male performers- censorship and media infrastructures have been integral to the current ontologies of diverse musical genres in South Asia. Through the analysis of a variety of primary and secondary texts on performance and musical aesthetics, media and music ethnographies, reception and production histories as well as critical listening/viewing exercises, this course seeks to complicate mainstream Euro-American narratives that tend to posit media-modernities as global and uniform. We will seek to understand how South Asian musical cultures and sound practices enter into a creative interplay with musical discourses and media-materialities emerging in the West.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

In a present where humanity faces planetary challenges with an unprecedented urgency, the human form - what Marx calls our &quot;genus-being&quot; (Gattungswesen) - has become a focus for artistic production of all sorts. The thesis of the class is this: Contemporary art is an actualization of the human form that doesn't presuppose the form, doesn't take it for granted, but instead troubles the form and poses it as a question. The class considers presentations of the form in performance art (Tino Sehgal, Anne Imhof, Wu Tsang), sculpture (Kara Walker, Cai Guo-Qiang, Cecilia Vicuña), writing (Friederike Mayröcker, Layli Long Soldier, Tracie Morris), sound (Maria Chavez, Christina Kubisch, Samson Young), and painting (Michael Armitage, Tammy Nguyen, Mark Bradford).

Historically one of the most complex and contested regions in the world, Israel/Palestine has a music culture that bears witness to processes of connection and separation. The politics of music in Israel/Palestine grow from conflicted beliefs about authenticity and ownership, the sounds of difference and sameness. The sacred and the secular intersect, and boundaries of practice and genre both divide and unite. Local practices have never been independent of global movement, be it in diaspora, pilgrimage, or the distant residence of refugees. The musical landscape of the region, therefore, has shifted throughout history, accessible primarily through the archaeology of music scholarship. In this proseminar we shall look at specific moments when the musics of Israel/Palestine converged, responding to and shaping historical change and conflict.

Each May since 1956 popular musicians and fans from Europe gather in a European metropolis to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), a competitive spectacle in which musicians from one nation compete against one another. Organized, funded, and broadcast by the European Broadcasting Union, the largest conglomerate of national radio and television networks in the world, the ESC is extensively participatory, creating its own communities of fans, musicians, musical producers, and ordinary citizens, who join together at all levels of society to interact with the politics and historical narratives of Europe. From the moment of heightened Cold War conflict at the birth of ESC to the refugee crisis and the rise of right-wing nationalism in the present, ESC has generated public discourse that not only reflects European and global politics, but provides a conduit for local and national citizenries to respond and shape such public discourse about gender and sexuality. The weekly work for the course draws students from across the College into the counterpoint of history and politics with aesthetics and popular culture. Each week will be divided into two parts, the first dedicated to reading and discussion of texts about European history and politics from World War II to the present, the second to interaction with music. Students will experience the ESC through close readings of individual songs and growing familiarity with individual nations with a participatory final project.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This class explores the intersections between music, theater, dance, and &quot;the highest court of the land.&quot; We will discuss how the court has defined &quot;performance&quot; in various intellectual property and arts-related opinions. We will analyze recent justices' own performances in the courtroom, at the Washington National Opera, and on the salsa dance floor. And we will watch, listen to, and interpret songs, operas, plays, and films that set the text of Supreme Court opinions. By the end of the quarter, students should understand how performance shapes the making and the memory of American law, and how law shapes the concept and the content of artistic performance. 
Weekly readings and screenings will include excerpts from secondary sources, Supreme Court oral arguments and opinions, and musical and theatrical performances. To gain experience both reading law and presenting in public, students will perform a short spoken, danced, and/or musical setting of a Supreme Court opinion (this can be an existing artistic setting or one of students' own devising), and will write a five-page paper analyzing how their chosen artistic setting inflects the judicial rhetoric of the opinion.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Over the last four centuries, how have the creators and practitioners of Western art music imagined nature as a recurring other-a foil to the art and artifice of our human world? This course is a trans-historical survey of the multifaceted relationships between musical creators, audiences, and the natural world. Over the 10-week course we will explore humankind's evolving relationship with the environment, calling upon a diverse array of composers, performers, and artists. While music offers a space in which to contemplate our relationship with nature, the natural world has long offered an opportunity for artists to expand their horizons, suggesting new sonic resources, new ways of performing, and new understandings of temporality. 
The course is organized in three large modules: listening to the environment, representing the environment, and speaking for the environment. The first introduces a set of listening practices-deep listening and soundwalks-to explore how these listening practices open up a range of possibilities for the interpenetration of natural sounds within musical performances, and musical performances in outdoor spaces. The second module turns our focus toward transliterations of natural phenomena and animal sounds, mediated through instrumental or electronic renderings. The final module examines the ways in which music can engage with, critique, and perform (or fail to perform) environmental activism.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Open to all undergraduates.
Over the course of the last hundred and twenty years, opera and cinema have been sounded and seen together again and again. Where opera is commonly associated with extravagant performance and production, cinema is popularly associated realism. Yet their encounter not only proves these assumptions wrong but produces some extraordinary third kinds-media hybrids. It also produces some extraordinary love affairs. Thomas Edison wanted a film of his to be &quot;a grand opera,&quot; and Federico Fellini and Woody Allen wanted opera to saturate their films. Thinking about these mutual attractions, &quot;Opera across Media&quot; explores different operatic and cinematic repertories as well as other media forms. Among films to be studied are Pabst's Threepenny Opera (1931), Visconti's Senso (1954), Powell and Pressburger's Tales of Hoffmann (1951), Zeffirelli's La traviata (1981), De Mille's Carmen (1915), Losey's Don Giovanni (1979), Bergman's The Magic Flute (1975), and Fellini's E la nave va (1983).

Black artists are often written out of the history of musical experimentalism. John Cage's place in the canon is secure, but what of Cecil Taylor's? Or Anthony Braxton's? Or Matana Roberts's? Labels like &quot;jazz&quot; or &quot;free jazz&quot; segregate these artists from white experimentalists, suggesting that their music is best understood within a narrowly racialized genre category, rather than as part of the experimental mainstream, with its assumed whiteness, institutional support, and inbuilt prestige. This course redresses this imbalance by centering the music of Black radical composers in the latter half of the twentieth century. We will study the music of a wide range of composers, including many associated with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), one of the most venerable musical collectives of the twentieth century, rooted right here in Chicago's South Side.

Music-making involves constraint: the layout of a keyboard or guitar, the poetic systems of an epic storyteller, the practice techniques of a singer who cultivates a certain sound, or even the lines of code that an algorithmic music-maker strings together. New technologies bring new rules, as well as new ways to break the rules: autotuned vocals are no longer derided, and tools like Melodyne are now a standard part of music production. Constraint, then, produces creativity-but how does this look with particular instruments and traditions? How do artists make the most of their tools?
In this hands-on class, we will explore the interface through the concepts of affordance, interval systems, algorithms, and generalizable schemas. You won't just analyze art: you will also produce it and discuss your experiences with each type of interface. Our topics will include electronic music constructed on digital audio workstations and through code, the piano keyboard, the harmonica, Korean p'ansori sung storytelling, streaming platforms and recommendation algorithms, and the Italian solfeggio tradition.

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>MUSI 26725.  Staging Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung in the 21st Century.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
This team-taught course explores the challenges of staging Richard Wagner's sprawling 19th-century tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelung in the 21st century. The course will offer an introduction to The Ring, including its complicated place in history (including its reception and production history), and how it has been thought about in recent musicology and critical theory. But first and foremost, we will be exploring how the piece is being staged today. To that end, we will explore four productions of the tetralogy that are currently being prepared at leading opera houses around the world - in Munich, London, Berlin, and Oslo - speaking, via Zoom, with artistic directors and the production teams about their ideas and ambitions. What are the interpretive challenges and opportunities in staging this mammoth work? How do these productions seek to engage the tetralogy's exceedingly complicated aesthetic ambitions, political baggage, and production history? And how do specific geographical, cultural, and historical conditions affect the artistic project of each production? Our discussions will encompass a range of fields, approaches, and topics. Among the themes we plan to examine are the aspiration to aesthetic totalization, the politics of community, the relationship between canonicity and critique, the notion of distress or emergency (the German term is Not), and some astonishingly lurid fantasies of family life-mostly of family dissolution. Moreover, we will approach the questi</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>MUSI 26780.  Caribbean Music, Performance, and Popular Culture in the Age of Precarity: 1990 to the Present.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
This course explores the concept of precarity and its influence on artistic and cultural expressions within contemporary Caribbean popular culture, primarily from the 1990s to the present day. Precarity is broadly defined as the feeling or experience of instability resulting from various social, economic, political, and environmental factors, including structural adjustments, climate change (such as hurricanes and earthquakes), and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, among others. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of art in shaping popular responses to precarity, including significant events like mass protests, the Black Lives Matter and George Floyd protests, uprisings against the deportation of Haitians in the Dominican Republic, as well as interrelated international movements like #LifeinLeggings and #Metoo. The course delves into how Caribbean performance and popular music have engaged with these issues, with a focus on music genres like dancehall, wylers, soca, reggaetón, and the individual artistic works of Caribbean artists such as  LaVaughn Belle, Helen Ceballos, Joiri Minaya, and others. These artists use their work to explore themes of precarity and to envision potential alternatives to the contemporary challenges of insecurity, touching on issues related to gender, sexuality, and race.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>MUSI 27423.  Divas, Idols, Material Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Music Videos.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
The stark black and white of Madonna's &quot;Vogue&quot; and the pinks and sparkles of &quot;Material Girl.&quot; The explosive surprise releases of Beyoncé's BEYONCÉ and Lemonade visual albums. The lavish cinematic spectacle of Taylor Swift's &quot;Bad Blood&quot; and the fanbait intertextuality of SM Entertainment's Aespa. Since MTV's advent in 1981, hit music videos have made a number of pop songs inextricable from iconic imagery and choreography; ubiquitous digital devices and the rise of platforms like YouTube and TikTok have only increased pop music's audiovisuality.
Looking at and listening to female pop icons raises fraught questions of agency, representation, race, sexuality/sexualization, bodies, commodification, and capital. In this course, students will gain a vocabulary for talking about both the audio and visual parameters of music video, and they will use this vocabulary to engage with critical frameworks for examining meaning, circulation, and reception in contemporary music videos.
Assignments across the course will allow students to experiment with a range of writing and media genres, including critical close readings, micro-reception histories, thinkpieces, podcast episodes, and video essays.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

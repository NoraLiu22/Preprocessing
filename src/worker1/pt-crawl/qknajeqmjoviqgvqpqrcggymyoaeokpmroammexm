      <p class="medium">Note:</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">The grade of General of the Armies of the United States is associated with   two officers in our history, George Washington and John J. Pershing, although   only General Pershing actually held it.</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">After Washington's death, an Act of May 14, 1800, specifically authorized   President Adams to suspend any further appointment to the office of General of   the Armies of the United States, &quot;having reference to economy and the good of   the service.&quot; Although the office was not expressly referred to in any of the   actions taken to reduce or disband forces that had been raised in contemplation   of war with France, it ceased when it was not mentioned in the Act of March 16,   1802, which determined the peacetime military establishment. </p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">Congress enacted legislation authorizing the grade of General of the Army on   July 25, 1866, and on that date the new grade was conferred on <a href="grant.html">Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant</a>. The grade was   recognized and continued in various acts until the Act of July 15, 1870, which   contained the requirement that &quot;the offices of general and lieutenant general   shall continue until a vacancy shall exist in the same, and no longer, and when   such vacancy shall occur in either of said offices shall become inoperative, and   shall, by virtue of this act, from thence forward be held to be repealed.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">William T. Sherman, Grant's successor as Commanding General of the Army, was   appointed as General of the Army on March 4, 1869, and upon his retirement in   February 1884 was placed on the retired list as General of the Army. Under the   provisions of the Act of March 3, 1885, authorizing the appointment of a   &quot;general of the Army on the retired list,&quot; this grade was also conferred on   General Grant shortly before his death on July 23, 1885. The title ceased to   exist as a grade of military rank at Sherman's death on February 14, 1891.</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">Sherman's successor was Lieutenant General Philip H. Sheridan, who could not   be promoted to General of the Army because of the 1870 law. Congress, however,   enacted legislation on June 1, 1888, shortly before Sheridan's death, that   discontinued the grade of lieutenant general and merged it with that of General   of the Army. The grade of General of the Army was conferred on Sheridan and was   discontinued when he died, while still on active duty on August 5, 1888.</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">War Department General Orders No. 75, September 5, 1866, prescribed that the   insignia for the newly authorized General of the Army grade would be four stars.   General Grant wore this insignia, as did General Sherman until War Department   General Orders No. 92, October 26, 1872, changed the insignia to two silver   stars with the arms of the United States in gold between them. General Sherman,   and later General Sheridan, wore the new insignia.</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">Congress revived the grade of General of the Armies of the United States by   Public Law 45, approved September 3, 1919, to honor <a href="pershing.html">General John J. Pershing</a> for his wartime service. He   retired with that rank on September 13, 1924, and held it until his death on   July 15, 1948. No other officer held this specific title until 1976, when   President Ford posthumously appointed George Washington General of the Armies of   the United States and specified that he would rank first among all officers of   the Army, past and present.</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">When General Pershing was appointed General of the Armies, he continued to   wear the four stars that he, as well as Generals Tasker H. Bliss and Peyton C.   March, had adopted under the provisions of then current uniform regulations,   which permitted them to prescribe the insignia denoting their grade. Army   Regulations 600-35, Personnel: The Prescribed Uniform, October 12, 1921, and all   subsequent editions during General Pershing's lifetime, made no mention of   insignia for General of the Armies but prescribed that generals would wear four   stars. General Pershing at no time wore more than four stars.</p>
      <p align="left" class="medium">Following the establishment of the General of the Army grade on December 14,   1944, Army Regulations 600-35 were changed to prescribe that Generals of the   Army would wear five stars. Although General Pershing continued to wear only   four, he remained preeminent among all Army personnel, by virtue of   Congressional action and Army Regulations governing rank and precedence, until   his death on July 15, 1948. </p>

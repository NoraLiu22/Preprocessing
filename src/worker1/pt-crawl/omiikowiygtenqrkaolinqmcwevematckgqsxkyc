	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="1">1</A>
Now that Pharnaces had been overcome and Africa recovered, and those who had made good their escape from these battles with the young Cn. Pompeius&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note1
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">1</A> had . . . and he had gained possession of Further Spain, while Caesar was occupied in Italy exhibiting games, . . . to make it easier to gather together defensive forces for the purposes of resistance, Pompeius proceeded to throw himself upon the protection of each individual state. However in this way mustered a good large force, partly by entreaties, partly by violent measures, he was now playing havoc with the province. In these circumstances some states sent reinforcements of their own accord, while on the other hand some shut their gates against him. And if, whenever he took any of their towns by force, there was any rich citizen of that township who had deserved well of Cn. Pompeius, yet in view of his great wealth some other charge would always be brought against him, in order that he might be done away with and his money used to provide a handsome share‑out for the plunderers. This policy enabled a


<A ID="p313"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p313 </SPAN></A>few men to reap profits on the enemy side, and their resources correspondingly increased; whereas its effect upon the states opposed to Pompeius was to make them send more frequent messages to Italy urgently requesting assistance to be sent to them.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="2">2</A> C. Caesar, who was now in his third <SPAN CLASS="whole">dictator</SPAN>&shy;ship and had been appointed to a fourth, had had much business to complete before he took to the road; but this was now disposed of, and he had come post haste to Spain to finish off the war. Envoys from those in Corduba who had deserted the cause of Cn. Pompeius had met Caesar and now reported that the town of Corduba could be captured by night, because it was by surprise that Pompeius had mastered his rivals in that province, and moreover, Pompeius himself had revealed his own fears of Caesar's arrival by the fact that he had posted couriers at all points to notify him of Caesar's coming. They also advanced many other plausible reasons besides this. Caesar was thereby encouraged and informed Q. Pedius and Q. Fabius Maximus, the two officers he had previously appointed to command his army, that he had arrived, adding instructions that the cavalry which had been raised in the province should support him. But he came up with them more expeditiously than they themselves anticipated, and so did not have the cavalry to support him as he himself had wished.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="3">3</A> At the same time there was the brother, Sextus Pompeius, who was holding Corduba with a garrison force, that town being regarded as the capital of the province; whereas the young Cn. Pompeius himself was attacking the town of Ulia, and had now been engaged there for some months or so. On learning


<A ID="p315"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p315 </SPAN></A>of Caesar's arrival, envoys left this town unbeknown to Cn. Pompeius' outposts, came to Caesar, and proceeded to entreat him to send them help at the earliest opportunity. Caesar, who was aware that the township in question had always deserved well of the Roman people, promptly gave orders that six infantry cohorts and a corresponding number of cavalry should set out at the second watch; and in command of them he put L. Vibius Paciaecus, a well-known member of that province, and one that knew it pretty well.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref2" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note2
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">2</A> Now it so chanced that at the very time he came to Cn. Pompeius's outposts he was beset by bad weather and a violent gale. So severe was the storm and so dark did it make the approaches to the town that they could scarcely recognise their next-door neighbours. To them indeed this drawback proved of the utmost advantage. And so, when they had got thus far, he bade the horsemen go up in file,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref3" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note3
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">3</A> and they pushed rapidly forward to the town straight through their opponent's positions. When they were in the middle of their positions someone asked who they were; and one of our men told the questioner to hold his tongue: 'just at the moment they were trying to come up to the wall so as to capture the town.' It was in fact partly the disconcerting effect of this reply, partly the difficulties of the storm, which prevented the sentries from displaying proper attention to their duties. When they came up to the gate they gave the pass-word and were admitted by the townsfolk: the infantry were deployed in various sectors of the town and


<A ID="p317"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p317 </SPAN></A>stayed inside, while the cavalry raised a shout and sallied forth against the enemy camp. Thus, in the course of this operation, which had taken the enemy unawares, well nigh the majority of the troops in this camp thought they were as good as captured.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="4">4</A> Having despatched this relief force to Ulia, Caesar marched to Corduba with the object of inducing Pompeius to abandon his assault of Ulia; and while on the march he sent on ahead some heavy-armed infantry troops — brave soldiers — accompanied by cavalry. No sooner had they come within sight of the town than they all took to the horses; but this manoeuvre it was quite impossible for the men of Corduba to observe. Now as they were approaching Corduba, a good large force came out of the town and cut the cavalry to pieces, and the heavy-armed infantry we have just mentioned now dismounted. They then fought a great battle, to such effect that out of the countless host but few men retired back into the town. In his alarm at this reverse Sextus Pompeius was constrained to send a despatch to his brother urging him to come promptly to his aid, to prevent Caesar's capturing Corduba before Gnaeus himself could arrive there. Accordingly, though Cn. Pompeius had almost captured Ulia, he was disturbed by his brother's despatch and proceeded to march to Corduba with his forces.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="5">5</A> When Caesar came to the river Baetis he could not cross it owing to the depth of the stream; so he lowered into it wicker baskets filled with stones, laid beams on top of them, and thus made a bridge, by which he brought his forces across to a camp divided into three sections. He was now encamped over against the town in the area of the bridge, and


<A ID="p319"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p319 </SPAN></A>his camp was, as we have just mentioned, divided into three sections. When Pompeius arrived there with his forces he pitched a camp on the same principle on the opposite side. In order to cut him off from the town and the supplies it afforded, Caesar began to carry a line of fortifications to the bridge,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note4
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">4</A> and Pompeius adopted tactics on similar lines. Whereupon a race took place between the two commanders as to which of them should seize the bridge first; and this race gave rise to daily skirmishes on a small scale in which now our troops, now theirs, would come out on top. This situation had now developed into a more intensive struggle, and both sides being more passionately bent on holding their ground had embarked upon hand-to‑hand fighting and formed a solid mass near the bridge; and as they approach the river's banks they were flung headlong into it, packed tightly as they were. At this point the two sides vied with each other not merely in piling one death upon another but in matching mound of dead with mound.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note5
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">5</A> Several days were passed in this fashion, and Caesar was anxious to bring his opponents down to favourable ground, if by any means he could do so, and fight a decisive action at the earliest opportunity.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="6">6</A> Observing that his opponents were by no means willing to do this, Caesar led his forces across the river and ordered large fires to be lit at night, so as


<A ID="p321"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p321 </SPAN></A>to entice them into the plain just as he had drawn them away from Ulia; and in this manner he set out for Ategua, the strongest garrison of Pompeius. When Pompeius got to know of this from deserters, on the first day that afforded him the opportunity he quitted the mountain passes and retired to Corduba with a numerous train of carts and laden mules.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note6
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">6</A> Caesar began to assault Ategua by surrounding it with siege works and fortified lines. Now a message had been brought to him concerning Pompeius to the effect that he was setting out that day; and by way of safeguarding himself against Pompeius' coming Caesar had occupied several forts where in some cases cavalry, in others infantry forces could be posted as outlying pickets and sentries to protect his camp: yet, in these circumstances, it so chanced that when Pompeius did arrive there was a very thick mist in the early morning. And so in the resulting gloom the Pompeians surrounded Caesar's cavalry with a number of infantry cohorts and squadrons of horse, and cut them up so severely that but few men barely managed to escape that massacre.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="7">7</A> The following night Pompeius burned his camp and, passing through the valleys on the far side&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note7
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">7</A> of the river Salsum, established a camp on a hill between the two towns of Ategua and Ucubi. Meanwhile Caesar had completed his emplacements and all his other dispositions which were required for assaulting the town, and proceeded to carry forward a ramp furnished with mantlets. Now this area is mountainous and offers natural obstructions to military operations: it is divided by a plain — the basin of the river


<A ID="p323"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p323 </SPAN></A>Salsum — in such a way, however, that the river is nearest Ategua, the distance being <A CLASS="conversion"
onMouseOver="return Ebox('about 3 km',WIDTH,120)"
onMouseOut="nd();">•</A>about two miles.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note8
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">8</A> It was in this direction, namely that of Ategua, that Pompeius had his camp pitched in the mountains in sight of both towns, without, however, venturing to come to the aid of his comrades. He had the eagles and standards of thirteen legions; but among those which he thought afforded him any solid support two were native legions, having deserted from Trebonius; a third had been raised from the local Roman settlers; a fourth was one which was once commanded by Afranius and which Pompeius had brought with him from Africa;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note9
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">9</A> while the rest were made up of runaways or auxiliaries. As for light-armed units and cavalry, our troops were in fact far superior both in quality and quantity.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="8">8</A> Besides this, there was another factor which prompted Pompeius to protract hostilities&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note10
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">10</A> — the hilly type of country by no means unsuitable for the fortification of camps. In fact, practically the whole region of Further Spain, fertile as it is and correspondingly well watered, makes a siege a fruitless


<A ID="p325"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p325 </SPAN></A>and difficult task. Here too, in view of the constant sallies of the natives, all places which are remote from towns are firmly held by towers and fortifications, as in Africa, roofed over with rough-cast, not tiles. Moreover, they have watch-towers in them, commanding a view far and wide by reason of their altitude. Again, a large proportion of the towns of this private are more or less protected by the mountains and are established in naturally elevated positions, with the result that the approach to them, involving as it does a simultaneous climb, proves a difficult task. Thus it is their natural position that holds them aloof from sieges, and as a result the townships of Spain are no easy prey to an enemy, as proved to be the case in this war. To take the present instance: Pompeius had his camp established between the above-mentioned towns of Ategua and Ucubi, in sight of both of them; and <A CLASS="conversion"
onMouseOver="return Ebox('Roman miles:<BR>some 6 km',WIDTH,120)"
onMouseOut="nd();">•</A>some four miles distant from his camp there lies a hillock — a natural elevation which goes by the name of the Camp of Postumius;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref11" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note11
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">11</A> and there Caesar had established a fort for purposes of defence.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="9">9</A> Now Pompeius observed that this fort was screened by its natural position on the same ridge of hills and was some distance away from Caesar's camp; and he further observed that Caesar, cut off as he was from it by the river Salsum, was not likely to let himself be committed to sending support, considering the very difficult character of the ground. Accordingly, with the courage of his convictions, he set out at the third watch and proceeded to attack the fort. On their approach they suddenly raised a shout and began to launch heavy volleys of missile weapons, with the result that they wounded a large proportion


<A ID="p327"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p327 </SPAN></A>of the defenders. Whereupon the latter began to fight back from the fort; and when the tidings were brought to Caesar in his main camp he set out with three legions to succour our hard-pressed troops. When he reached them the enemy retired in rout and panic,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref12" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note12
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">12</A> with many killed and several captured, including two centurions. Many in addition threw away their arms and fled, and eighty of their shields were brought back by our men.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="10">10</A> On the following day Arguetius arrived with cavalry from Italy. He brought with him five standards belonging to the men of Saguntia,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref13" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note13
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

That night Pompeius burned his camp and proceeded to march towards Corduba.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref14" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="11">11</A> On the next day our cavalry fared somewhat far afield in the direction of Corduba in pursuit of those who were carrying supplies from the town to Pompeius' camp. Fifty of the latter were captured and brought with their pack animals to our camp. That day Q. Marcius, who was one of Pompeius' military tribunes, deserted to us. At the third watch of the night there was very sharp fighting in the area of the


<A ID="p329"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p329 </SPAN></A>town, and many fire-brands were discharged. Just before this time&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref15" HREF="

Caesar's reply to them was that his habit was to impose conditions, not to accept them. On their return to the town with this reply, the inhabitants raised a shout, discharged volleys of missiles of all sorts, and went into action along the entire circuit of the battlements; and this led to a strong conviction among quite a large number of the men in our lines that they would make a sally that day. As a result a cordon of troops was thrown round the town and very violent fighting went on for some time; in the course of which a missile was discharged by our men from apiece of heavy artillery and demolished a tower, knocking out five members of the enemy crew who manned distant, as well as a slave whose regular duty it was to keep watch on that piece of artillery.

But it was a difficult task for anyone to set fire to that tower without risking disaster; thus when any of them came close up to it, his legs were tied with a rope and he was killed by the townsfolk.

<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="20">20</A> When Pompeius got to know from deserters that the surrender of the town had taken place, he moved his camp towards Ucubi, built forts at intervals in that locality, and proceeded to keep within his emplacements. Caesar struck his camp and moved it closer to that of Pompeius. It was at this same time that early in the morning one of the heavy-armed troops from a native legion deserted to us and reported that Pompeius had assembled the inhabitants of the town of Ucubi and given them orders as follows, namely that they were to make careful and searching inquiry who were in favour of a victory for his side, and who on the contrary favoured victory for his enemies. Just before this the slave who, as we have described


<A ID="p347"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p347 </SPAN></A>above, had murdered his master was arrested in a mine in the captured town: he was burned alive. At the same period eight heavy-armed centurions deserted to Caesar from a native legion; our cavalry came into conflict with the enemy cavalry and quite a number of our light-armed troops died of their wounds.

When the party reached Ursao, our men, who comprised Roman knights and senators, did not venture to enter the town, apart from those who were members of that community. An exchange of views then took place between the


<A ID="p349"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p349 </SPAN></A>two sides; whereupon, as the envoys were rejoining our men who were outside the town, the townsmen followed them up from behind with an armed party and then massacred them. There were two survivors, who fled and reported the incident to Caesar . . . and the men of Ursao sent investigators to the town of Ategua. And when they had definitely established that the envoys' account was correct, and that the incidents had occurred just as they had related, a crowd of townsfolk quickly gathered, and they began to stone and shake their fists at the man who had massacred the envoys, shouting that he had been responsible for their own undoing. So when he had barely been rescued from his perilous plight, he besought the townsfolk for leave to go on a mission to Caesar, saying that he would satisfy the latter. Permission being granted, he set out from the town, collected a bodyguard and, when he had made it a good large force, contrived by treachery to be taken back into the town by night. Whereupon he carried out a wholesale massacre, killed the leading men who had been opposed to him, and took the town under his own control. — Just before this deserting slaves reported that the goods of the townsfolk&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref37" HREF="

Consequently, when our men observed that they were giving ground more than their wont, two centurions from the Fifth legion crossed the river and restored the battle line;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref41" HREF="

And so, in their too eager anxiety to carry destruction within the area of the latter's defence positions, they were cut off by enemy squadrons and light-armed troops. Had not their gallantry been of the highest order, they would have been captured alive; for they were, moreover, hemmed in so tightly by the emplacements of the camp as to make it well nigh impossible for a horseman to defend himself in the restricted space.

When accordingly the forces of both sides had launched an attack upon this lofty knoll, our men forestalled the enemy and hurled them back on to the level ground. This led to a successful action by our troops: on all sides their

However, there was no doubt about it, the enemy all lacked the courage to come down into the plain to engage — all except one man, Antistius Turpio; and he, confident in his strength, began to indulge in taunts, claiming that there was nobody a match for him on the opposite side. Hereupon,

All men's minds were now distracted from their work and bent upon this spectacle — such was the effect of the dauntless spirit of Antistius — and the armies were arrayed over against one another; for the chances of victory were nicely balanced between the two warring champions, so that it almost seemed as if their duel meant the final decision and cessation of hostilities. So fanatically eager were they all, each man gripped by the enthusiasm of the champions and supporters of his own side. As for the two champions, what with their dashing courage, now that they had moved into the plain for the encounter, and the inwrought work of their shields — emblems of their fame — flashing in front of them . . . and their duel would almost certainly have put an end to the action, unless, owing to the attack of the enemy cavalry noted above, . . . Caesar posted some light-armed troops not far from the emplacement to give cover. While our cavalry were withdrawing to camp, the enemy pursued them too eagerly, whereupon the light-armed troops one and all raised a shout and charged them.

	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="28">28</A>
On the following day Caesar was minded to take the road with his forces when scouts came back with the news that Pompeius had been in battle formation since the third watch. On receipt of this news Caesar displayed the flag-signal for action. Now the reason why Pompeius had led out his forces was this:


<A ID="p363"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p363 </SPAN></A>he had previously sent a despatch to the citizens of Ursao, who were supporters of his, saying that Caesar was unwilling to come down into the valley because the greater part of his army was inexperienced. This despatch stiffened the morale of the townsfolk considerably. Pompeius therefore, relying on this conviction,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref56" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note56
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">56</A> supposed that he could carry the whole thing off; for where he had established his camp he was protected not only by the natural conformation of the ground but also by the fortifications of the town itself. For, as we have pointed out earlier,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref57" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note57
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">57</A> it is lofty country, bastioned by hills with an occasional intervening plain; and this, it so happened, was the case on the present occasion.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="29">29</A> Between the two camps ran a plain, extending for <A CLASS="conversion"
onMouseOver="return Ebox('some 7.5 km',WIDTH,132)"
onMouseOut="nd();">•</A>some five miles, so that there were two factors which made for the protection of Pompeius' troops — the town, and the lofty nature of the ground. Extending from the town the plain ground nearest to it levelled out, and ran down to where a stream ran in front of it, which made the ground there extremely awkward for Caesar's troops to approach the Pompeians; for the soil to the right of the river's course was marshy and full of bog‑holes. Consequently, when Caesar saw their battle line deployed, he had no doubt that


<A ID="p365"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p365 </SPAN></A>his opponents would advance to the level ground to do battle in the middle of the plain. This area was in full view of all. Moreover, with a level plain like that and a calm, sunny day, it was a tempting situation for cavalry — a wonderful, longed‑for and well-nigh heaven-sent opportunity for engaging battle. Our men were delighted — though some also had misgivings — at the thought that the welfare and fortunes of everyone were being brought to the point that no one could tell for certain what would prove to be the luck vouchsafed them an hour later. And so our men advanced to do battle; and we supposed that the enemy would do likewise: but our opponents would not venture to advance far from the defences of the town: on the contrary, they were establishing themselves in the town close to the wall. And so our men advanced. From time to time the favourable nature of the ground would sorely tempt the enemy to press on to victory under such conditions; but, none the less, they would not depart from their accustomed tactics so as to forsake either the high ground or the town. And when our men, advancing at a moderate pace, came up closer to the stream, their opponents remained consistently on the defensive on the steep ground.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="30">30</A> Their battle line was composed of thirteen legions, and was screened on the flanks by cavalry as well as six thousand light-armed troops, while in addition there were nearly as many again auxiliary troops besides: our forces comprised eighty cohorts&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref58" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note58
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">58</A> and eight thousand cavalry. So when our men, as they approached, reached the unfavourable ground at the farthest limit of the plain, the enemy were ready on higher ground, making it extremely dangerous for our


<A ID="p367"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p367 </SPAN></A>men to pursue their passage to the higher level. When Caesar observed this, to avoid any blunder being perpetrated owing to rashness or faulty judgment, he began to restrict the operational area.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref59" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note59
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">59</A> But when it came to the ears of the men that he was doing so, they were bitterly disgusted, as they took it to mean that their chance of deciding the conflict was being hampered. This delay made the enemy keener: it was fear, they thought, that was preventing Caesar's forces from joining battle: and although by displaying themselves they gave our men the opportunity of engaging them on steep ground, yet it was only at great risk that one could approach them. On our side the men of the Tenth legion held their proper post — the right wing; while the men of the Third and Fifth legions together with all the rest of our forces — the auxiliary troops and the cavalry — held the left wing. The shout was raised and the battle joined.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="31">31</A> Hereupon, although our men were superior in point of valour, their opponents offered a very spirited resistance from their higher position; and so furious proved the shouting on both sides, so furious the charging with its attendant volley of missiles, that our men well nigh lost their confidence in victory. In fact, as regards attacking and shouting — the two chief methods of demoralising an enemy — both sides stood on equal terms of comparison. But, though they accordingly brought to the contest an equal fighting capacity in both these departments of battle, yet the enemy masses were pinned down by our volleys of heavy javelins, and fell in heaps. Our right wing,


<A ID="p369"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p369 </SPAN></A>as we have explained, was held by the men of the Tenth legion; and despite their small numbers, their gallantry none the less enabled them by their exertions to inspire no little panic among their opponents. They proceeded, in fact, to exert strong pressure on the enemy, driving him back from his positions, with the result that he began to transfer a legion from his right, to give support and to prevent our men from outflanking him. As soon as this legion had been set in motion Caesar's cavalry began to exert pressure on the enemy left wing,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref60" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

And so, as the motley din — shouts, groans, the clash of swords — assailed their ears, it <SPAN CLASS="whole">shackled</SPAN> the minds of the inexperienced with fear. Hereupon, as Ennius puts it, "foot forces against foot and weapons grind 'gainst weapons"; and in the teeth of very strong opposition our men began to drive the enemy back. The town, however, stood them in good stead. And so they were routed and put to flight on the very day of the Liberalia;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref61" HREF="

In this battle there fell some thirty thousand men — if anything, more — as well as Labienus and Attius Varus, both of whom were buried where they fell, and about three thousand Roman knights besides, some from Rome, some from the province. Our losses amounted to about a thousand men, partly cavalry, partly infantry; while our wounded totalled about five hundred. Thirteen legionary eagles belonging to the enemy were captured; and in addition he had the following standards and rods of office . . .

His partisans forgathered at the house to which he had been brought — each supposing his visit to have been a private one — to make enquiry

After himself, in due course he fell to upon the banquet, and ever and anon anointed himself with resin and nard. Accordingly, at the latest possible moment, he bade a slave and a freedman — the latter was his concubine — the one to cut his throat, the other to light the pyre.

<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="34">34</A> Now as soon as Caesar pitched his camp over against the town its occupants proceeded to quarrel; so much so that the sound of the shouting and brawling between the supporters of Caesar on the one hand, and Pompeius on the other, reached our camp. There were two legions in this town which had been raised partly from deserters, while others were slaves of the townsmen who had been set free by Sextus Pompeius; and now in view of Caesar's approach they began to desert. The Thirteenth legion proceeded to defend the town, whereas the men of the Ninth, as soon as they became involved in the fray, seized some of the towers and battlements. Once again&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref65" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

Thus did Caesar gain possession of the town. While he was occupied here, the survivors of the battle who had been shut up (in Munda), as we described above,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref67" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note67
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="35">35</A> On Caesar's marching to Hispalis envoys came to him to entreat his pardon. So when he reached the town, he sent in Caninius as his deputy, accompanied by a garrison force, while he himself pitched camp near the town. Now inside the town there was a


<A ID="p377"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p377 </SPAN></A>good large group of supporters of Pompeius, who thought it scandalous that a garrison should have been admitted unbeknown to a certain Philo — the man who had been the most ardent champion of the Pompeian faction, and was a very well-known figure throughout Lusitania. This man now set out for Lusitania without the knowledge of our garrison troops, and at Lennium met Caecilius Niger, a foreigner, who had a good large force of Lusitanians. Returning to Hispalis, he penetrated the fortifications by night and thus gained re‑admission to the town; whereupon they massacred the garrison and sentries, barred the gates, and renewed hostilities.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="36">36</A> In the course of these proceedings envoys from Carteia duly reported that they had Pompeius in their hands. They thought they stood to gain by this good deed, which might offset their previous offence in having barred their gates to Caesar. At Hispalis the Lusitanians kept up the fight without a moment's pause; and when Caesar observed their stubbornness he was afraid that, if he made strenuous efforts to capture the town, these desperadoes might fire the town and destroy the walls. So after holding consultations he allowed the Lusitanians to make a sally by night — a course which the latter never supposed was deliberate policy. Accordingly, they made a sally, and in the process fired some ships which were alongside the river Baetis. While our men were occupied with the fire, the Lusitanians took to flight and were cut down by our cavalry. This led to the recovery of the town; whereupon Caesar proceeded to march to Asta, from which township envoys came to him to surrender it. As for the survivors of the battle who had taken refuge in the


<A ID="p379"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p379 </SPAN></A>town of Munda, a somewhat protracted siege led a good large number to surrender; and on being drafted to form a legion they swore a mutual oath that during the night at a given signal their comrades in the town should make a sally, while they carried out a massacre in the camp. But this plot was discovered; and when at the third watch on the following night the pass-word was given, they were all cut down outside the rampart.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref68" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="37">37</A> While Caesar was on the move and attacking the remaining towns, the men of Carteia began to fall out on the question of Pompeius. There was the party which had sent envoys to Caesar: there was another party which espoused the cause of Pompeius. Civil discord being thus stirred up, they seized the gates: much blood was shed: Pompeius, who was wounded,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref69" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#note69
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">69</A> seized twenty warships, and took to flight. As soon as the news of his escape reached Didius, who was at Gades in command of a squadron, he forthwith began to give chase; and from Carteia too the hunt was likewise taken up forthwith by infantry and cavalry marching in swift pursuit. On the fourth day of their voyage Pompeius' party put in to land, since they had been ill provided and without water when they sailed from Carteia. While they were getting water Didius hastened up with his fleet, captured some of their ships, and burned the rest.

	<P CLASS="justify" ID="p381"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p381 </SPAN>
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="38">38</A> Pompeius took to flight with a few companions and occupied a certain spot which possessed natural defences. When the cavalry and infantry cohorts which had been despatched in his pursuit learned of this from scouts they had sent on ahead, they pushed on day and night. Now Pompeius was seriously wounded in the shoulder and left leg; added to which he had also sprained his ankle, which hampered him very much. So a litter was employed to carry him off to this redoubt and, once arrived there, he continued to be carried about in it. One of the Lusitanians who had been despatched from his escort on reconnaissance in accordance with normal military routine was now spotted by the Caesarian force, and Pompeius was promptly surrounded by the cavalry and cohorts. It was a difficult place to approach: that in fact was the very reason why Pompeius had chosen himself a naturally fortified position, so that, no matter how great a force was brought up to it, a handful of men might be able to defend it from higher ground. On their arrival our men came up close to it only to be driven back with javelins. As they gave ground the enemy pressed upon them the more eagerly and called an immediate halt to their advance. When this manoeuvre had been repeated several times it became obvious that it was a very risky business for our men. The enemy&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref70" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"

<A ID="p383"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p383 </SPAN></A>encounter their opponents on an equal footing. When the latter observed this move they took refuge in flight.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="39">39</A> Pompeius, as we have pointed out above, was wounded and had sprained his ankle, and this handicapped him in flight; moreover, the difficult nature of the ground made it impossible for him to have recourse to riding horseback or driving to assist his escape to safety. On all sides our troops were carrying on the work of slaughter. Cut off from his entrenchment and having lost his supporters, Pompeius now resorted to a ravine, to a spot where the ground was eaten away; and there in a cave he proceeded to hide himself, so that, short of his being given away by a prisoner, it was no easy matter for our men to find him. By such means in fact he was discovered there and put to death. When Caesar was at Gades, the head of Pompeius was brought to Hispalis on April 12th, and there publicly exhibited.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="40">40</A> Filled with delight at the death of young Pompeius, Didius, whom we mentioned above, withdrew to a nearby stronghold, beached some of his ships for a refit, and . . . Those Lusitanians who survived the battle rallied to their standard and, when a good large force had been mustered, duly proceeded against Didius. Although he displayed no lack of care in guarding his ships, yet their constant sallies enticed him on occasions to leave his stronghold, with the result that in the course of almost daily battles they laid a trap for him, dividing up their forces into three groups. There were some who were detailed to burn the ships; some to repel an enemy relief force, when the ships had once been


<A ID="p385"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p385 </SPAN></A>fired: these parties were posted in such a way as to be entirely hidden from view, whereas the remainder marched into battle in full view of all. Accordingly, when Didius advanced with his forces from his stronghold to drive them back, the signal was displayed by the Lusitanians, the ships were set on fire, and simultaneously those who had advanced to battle from the stronghold — they were now pursuing the same retreating bandits, who had turned tail on that same signal — were surprised by the ambushing party, which raised a shout and surrounded them from the rear.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref71" HREF="

The Lusitanians gained possession of the booty. Caesar left Gades and hastened back to Hispalis.

Now that they were cut off the enemy fell to fighting amongst themselves; and after a welter of bloodshed they made a sally. Our troops did not fail to take this opportunity of recovering the town and captured the remaining men alive, to the number of fourteen thousand. Our men now set out for Ursao, a town which was buttressed by massive fortifications, to such an extent that in itself the place seemed adapted to

Or possibly — 'bade the infantry mount pillion'. The subsequent rapid advance, as well as the mention of the cavalry's being numerically equal to the infantry, tends, I rather think, to support this interpretation. It would, however, fit much better in the next chapter, where the infantry undoubtedly took to the horses for a time. Perhaps


<A ID="p315x"></A>the author was confused about the details of the two sorties, and attributed somewhat allusively to both the tactics which properly belonged only to one.

The exact import of this colourful expression is not easy to


<A ID="p319x"></A>decide. As it seems likely that the purpose of the whole sentence is merely to emphasize the extent of the carnage, the <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">tumuli</SPAN> are probably the burial mounds, or possibly the piles of corpses.

it is clear that Cassius, whom Trebonius succeeded as governor of Further Spain, had five legions: the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Twenty-first</SPAN> and the Thirtieth (raised in Italy); the Second (long quartered in Spain); the 'native legion' (always thus named); and the Fifth (newly raised in Spain by Cassius himself). Of these the Second, Fifth and the native legion joined the mutiny against Cassius, and shewed Pompeian


<A ID="p323x"></A>sympathies; for which reason it would not seem surprising if they were opposing Caesar now. Holmes was satisfied that the other of the two native legions here mentioned was the Fifth; but he assumed, without accounting for the reference in ch. 13, that the Second had now joined Caesar. Klotz, on the other hand, asserting that there was never more than one native legion in Spain, adopts Mommsen's emendation and reads <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">vernacula e<SPAN CLASS="emend">&#60;t secunda&#62;</SPAN></SPAN>. This drastic course seems indeed the only method of including the Second; and the Fifth might well be the one described as 'raised from the local Roman settlers'. But the whole problem is obscure.

The reader may well be puzzled by the respective casualties resulting, apparently, from the outpost skirmish described in ch. 14 above. It would seem that the figures are grossly

Klotz too assumes that Cato is the subject. He remarks that such abrupt changes of subject are not uncommon in the lively, colloquial style, and quotes parallel examples from Cicero, Livy and Seneca.

I have followed Klotz in assuming two gaps in this extraordinary narrative. For no likely explanation occurs to me why the slave should have sent such a message to Caesar from Pompey's camp. Whether it was his master or his mistress he killed (in ch. 20 most <SPAN CLASS="small">MSS.</SPAN> read <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">dominam</SPAN>), and whether he was loyal to Caesar or to Pompey, it seems impossible to account consistently for his actions and subsequent fate.

Klotz believes that these despatches notified the commandant of Ategua that Pompey was withdrawing. This seems probable, and would explain why Caesar passed them on so promptly.

This is the traditional interpretation, but the sense is far from satisfactory.

It would seem that Caesar's main camp was still N of the river Salsum, whereas Pompeius was S of it. But Caesar may well have had detachments holding strong points across the river (<I>e.g.</I> <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">Castra Postumiana</SPAN>,

So Holmes: Caesar's, according to Klotz. But the author normally uses <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">noster</SPAN> to denote the Caesarians; and the phrase <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">pari consuetudine</SPAN> seems to me to refer rather to the

Pompeius is almost certainly subject of <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">iussit</SPAN>, and the camp is presumably his; and so one expects — in default of any indication to the contrary — Pompeius to be subject in the following sentence too.

Carruca is not otherwise known: its general position can thus be inferred only from this context — somewhere between Ventipo (close to the modern <SPAN LANG="es" CLASS="Spanish">Casariche</SPAN>) and Munda. Klotz,

Klotz takes this to mean the more confident attitude of the men of Ursao. But would their increased confidence by itself lead Pompey to think he could carry the whole thing off? It seems to me more likely that what the author really meant was this: "The reason why Pompey had led his forces out was that Caesar — so he had told the men of


<A ID="p363x"></A>Ursao in a despatch, which considerably encouraged them — was unwilling to come down to engage. Pompey accordingly, relying on this conviction (<I>viz.</I> that Caesar would decline battle), supposed he could carry the whole thing off."

This seems to be the normal interpretation, though the jeering remark seems rather pointless as addressed to Caesar.

If, however, the alternative interpretation given in the note above is accepted, the meaning might well be: 'And so they (<I>sc.</I> the refugees, who had seized the bridge, and the Caesarian partisans in the town) fell to fighting for control of the bridge.'

Scapula and Aponius had been elected as leaders by the legions who had previously mutinied against Q. Cassius Longinus and later expelled his successor, Trebonius.

The state of the text makes the sketchy narrative still harder to follow. It looks rather as if the Thirteenth and the


<A ID="p375x"></A>'refugees' (survivors from Munda mentioned above in <A HREF="

This rendering assumes that <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">tessera</SPAN> refers to <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">signo</SPAN>; that the plot was allowed to take place by night, as originally planned; but that the authorities, warned in advance, intervened and cut down all the insurgents (<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">omnes</SPAN> = both groups?) outside the rampart. Klotz, however, holds the view that the conspirators were arrested as soon as the plot was discovered, and then, very early next morning, led outside the rampart and there executed. The fact that, as he observes,


<A ID="p379x"></A>such executions commonly took place around dawn and outside the rampart (<I>cf.</I> <I>Bell. Afr.</I> ch. 46<!-- </A> -->) favours this view; against it may perhaps be argued that the verb <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">concidere</SPAN> is more appropriate to a surprise attack.

Klotz's punctuation (as followed here) whereby <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">eodem signo</SPAN> is taken with <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">fugientis</SPAN> — the latter word apparently


<A ID="p385x"></A>implying both the initial act of turning about and the subsequent retreat — seems to yield the most satisfactory sense.

Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius had, together with Cn. Pompeius Magnus, crushed the rebellion of Sertorius in Spain 80‑72. The imposts mentioned here were probably punitory.

In two passages in this short despatch the interpretation given by Klotz in his commentary is as follows:—

<DIV CLASS="m1">
	<P CLASS="justify">
(i) Reading '<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">nostrisque adhuc <I>freti</I> praesidiis</SPAN>', he renders 'relying on the strong places until now belonging to us', explaining that the allusion is in particular to the provisions Caesar had captured at Ategua.

	<P CLASS="justify">
(ii) Reading '<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">profecto nostro commeatu privati necessario ad dimicandum descendent</SPAN>' he apparently renders 'assuredly, when they are deprived of the provisions we have collected (<I>sc.</I> and have fallen into their hands), they will of necessity come down to fight'.
</DIV>

	<P CLASS="justify">
This interpretation does, I admit, considerably improve the general sense; but whether the Latin text can in either case be fairly thus interpreted seems open to doubt.

            She sent Ir&egrave;ne next door to spend a few days with the neighbors, telegrammed 
            the news to her family in Poland, and arranged to have the body brought 
            to the house. Only after Pierre's older brother, Jacques, arrived 
            the next day from Montpellier did she break down briefly. The news 
            of Pierre Curie's death was carried in newspapers around the world,

              returned to her work. Also, Jacques informed Marie that the French 
              government proposed to support her and the children with a state 
              pension. Marie</font> was adamant in her refusal, insisting that

              how to respond to an unexpected offer from the Sorbonne. On May 
              13, 1906, the university invited her to take up Pierre's academic 
              post. By doing so, she hoped, she could one day establish, as a 
              tribute to Pierre's memory, a state-of-the-art lab such as he had 
              never had. It was not enough to be a teacher and researcher. She

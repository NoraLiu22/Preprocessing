<H2>Sweety Barrett (1998)</H2>

<P>D: Stephen Bradley<BR>
S: Brendan Gleeson, Liam Cunningham</P>

<P>Strange but not uninteresting Irish-Icelandic co-production written and
directed by Stephen Bradley which is often reminiscent of some of the odd
short films which rejuvenated the Irish film industry in the 1970s. The
story centres on a simpleton circus performer played by Brendan Gleeson
(<A HREF="gen.htm"><I>The General</I>,</A> <I><A HREF="iwd.htm">I Went Down</A></I>)
who is cast adrift by his employer as the film begins and wanders into a
small fishing community. He manages to integrate himself with the locals
and befriends a young boy with whom he shares a mental age. Meanwhile corrupt
cop Liam Cunningham has the village under his thumb and runs a clandestine
Poit&iacute;n smuggling operation in which Gleeson unwittingly assists.
His reign of terror will inevitably come to an end through the intervention
of the child-like man, though it takes some time before we get to see how.</P>

<P>There are some lyrical moments in Bradley's film, which is nicely photographed
by Thomas Mauch. Stephen McKeown's score is uncharacteristically lush for
an Irish film (as was his score for <I><A HREF="bm.htm">The Boy From Mercury</A></I>),
and tends to work in conjunction with the images and some quietly reflective
scenes to sustain the film's mood. However, there is a fine line between
Felliniesque lyricism and sentimental pap. <I>Sweety Barrett</I> does not
always manage to stay on the right side of that line. It is frequently obvious
and many of its secondary characters are from the growing stock of contemporary
stereotypes which have replaced the older, less politically acceptable ones
(though films like<A HREF="wn.htm"><I>Waking Ned</I> </A>keep those alive
too). Dramatically, the film wavers after a lengthy set up; bringing Sweety
into conflict with his spiritual opposite through a series of sub-plots
and contrivances. The problem is that Sweety is a passive protagonist. Lacking
a particular goal or plan, he simply hangs around getting to know people
until galvanised into action in the film's final scenes. He becomes something
of a holy avenger, saving the town not because he chooses to do so, but
because he has responded to an external stimulus. He does this throughout
the story, as if driven by fate and the hand of God rather than the world
of man. There is no strong narrative thread to hold the audience, though
they may enjoy the tone. They may not of course, and if they don't there
is nothing else for them to wait around for.</P>

<P>The film therefore depends to much too large an extent on just how much
you enjoy Gleeson's performance. He is by now Ireland's most prolific and
exciting actor, and after a plethora of unsavoury characters, he obviously
warmed to the opportunity to play the good-hearted giant. He is generally
good in the role, and it is not necessarily his fault that the character
occasionally becomes wearing. There are many good moments for him though,
and he sustains a tone of a mixture of determination and innocence which
makes him convincing. But there is a limit to just how much of Sweety you
can take, and after so many repetitions of the basic relationship between
him and the world as he encounters each new character, you begin to wish
it would end. There are some colourful set pieces: some business with Mikel
Murfi and Raymond Keane of the Barabbas theatre company as gormless police
officers and a revolting return to <I>Cool Hand Luke</I> where Gleeson demonstrates
his character's talent for 'swallowing things' by drinking eggs, cooking
fat and worms. The supporting performances are okay, though Cunningham is
laughably excessive in a role seemed destined for Sean McGinley. Every element
of the film ultimately turns on Gleeson, and it is with him that its success
or failure for you as a viewer lies. This is not a good position to place
the audience in, and <I>Sweety Barrett</I> will probably continue to walk
a tightrope between dismissal and admiration for some time. It is worth
seeing only if you have an interest in slightly offbeat Irish films. Casual
viewers should probably avoid it.</P>

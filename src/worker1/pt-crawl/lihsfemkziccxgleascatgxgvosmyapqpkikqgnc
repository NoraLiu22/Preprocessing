<p class="comment">Meg strained her eyes upon her work until it was too dark to see the

<h3>Remainder of Passage Illustrated: Richard Returns</h3>

<p class="one">looking down upon her; loving her — how dearly loving her! — and talking 
to her in a tender voice about the old times, and the Bells. Though he knew, poor Trotty, 
though he knew she could not hear him.</p>

<p>A great part of the evening had worn away, when a knock came at her door. She opened 
it.  A man was on the threshold. A slouching, moody, drunken sloven, wasted by 
intemperance and vice, and with his matted hair and unshorn beard in wild disorder; but, 
with some traces on him, too, of having been a man of good proportion and good features 
in his youth.</p>

<p>He stopped until he had her leave to enter; and she, retiring a pace or two from the 
open door, silently and sorrowfully looked upon him. Trotty had his wish. He saw 
Richard.</p>

<p>"May I come in, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Come in. Come in!"</p>

<p>It was well that Trotty knew him before he spoke; for with any doubt remaining on his 
mind, the harsh discordant voice would have persuaded him that it was not Richard but 
some other man. ["The Third Quarter," 126]</p>

<h3>Commentary: Plate dropped into the Text. . .</h3>

<p>In an innovative strategy to fuse text and illustration, the artist here has us "read" 
the plate and text simultaneously. We readily detect an air of utter hopelessness about 
the scruffy-looking Richard in his posture, neglected beard, and careless hair style. 
Leech depicts Meg as middle-aged, careworn, and engaged in sheer drudgery, sewing by the 
light of a single candle in a scantily furnished garret, the ragged curtain (right) 
suggesting the seamstress's meagre income.</p>

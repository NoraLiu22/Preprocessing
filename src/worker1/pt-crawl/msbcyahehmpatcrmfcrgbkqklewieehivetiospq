<H2>Mapmaker (2002)</H2>

<P>D: Johnny Gogan<BR>
S: Brian F. O'Byrne, Susan Lynch</P>

<P>Well-intentioned but heavy-handed low-budget political thriller set in
the border counties of Northern Ireland. Cartographer Brian F. O'Byrne finds
himself in the midst of all manner of troubles when he accepts a contract
to draw up a new map for the district committee of a border town. As he
researches the places and placenames which make up the potted and divided
history of the area, he uncovers literal skeletons in the proverbial closet
and invokes the ire of local paramilitaries. His only ally seems to be local
boy Ois&iacute;n Kearney, who first observes him and then becomes involved
in his search for hidden truths. Generically inevitable romantic complications
also eventually arise with Susan Lynch (<I><A HREF="nora.htm">Nora</A></I>),
whose husband, Brendan Coyle, may be involved in shady doings himself.</P>

<P>There is much talk of boundaries and borders in director Johnny Gogan's
script, most of it delivered with a completely straight face. Treading boldly
into thematic material treated so memorably on stage by Brian Friel's <I>Translations</I>,
the film explores the schisms between geographical and human boundaries.
It tries to come to terms with ideas of how the physical landscape is imbued
with meaning by the perceptions of those who live on it, and how the history
of the land is made in the process of human habitation. The audience is
reminded constantly that the hills, streams, and fields existed long before
we did, but that human beings will nonetheless fight for every inch of it
to the point of killing one another if they attach particular significance
to their right to live there and to name it according to their social, cultural,
and political preference.</P>

<P>This ambitious thematic nexus underlies a fairly banal plot. It all starts
harmlessly enough with some sectarian joking and wry smiles in local bars.
The film makes some attempt to pretend that it is not going to turn into
a thriller, nonchalantly strolling through <I>The Man who Went Up a Hill
but Came Down a Mountain</I> territory and whistling tunelessly to itself
about bogstandard concerns with the relationship between man and landscape
which offers the pleasures of another familiar Irish-set type of film. It
doesn't take very long for the portents to start though, and when the gun-toting
fanatics begin jumping out from behind the bushes, we are neither surprised
nor particularly interested. </P>

<P>The film tries hard to get us on its central character's side, but starting
with an intrusive voice-over in which he reflects on his life with all the
delicacy of an adolescent short story was probably no the way to go. O'Byrne,
star of Gogan's previous feature <I><A HREF="lbh.htm">The Last Bus Home</A></I>,
makes a sincere attempt for our sympathies with a determined but composed
face and a slow, measured tone of voice which singles him out as everyman,
but he comes off as rather dull. The script seems eager to address this
problem by giving him plenty of backstory. First of all it makes him a Quaker
(which seems such a painfully transparent bit of political allegorising
that it hardly bears talking about), then, somewhat improbably, throws in
the suggestion that he has taken this rather hazardous assignment as part
of a quest to shake off a failed romance. Whoever told this man that the
border counties were a place to get away from it all really should not be
trusted for any further advice. </P>

<P>With this level of subtextual weight attached to the central character,
one might have expected the screenplay to go down some unapproved roads
(an early shot of a Fermanagh signpost bearing those very words produces
some expectation of this direction). But, having set all of the backstory
up in a couple of minutes of voice-over, the film stops developing the character
and he ends up becoming the standard innocent in the midst of chaos as sectarian
tensions mount. The failed romance thing becomes a set up for the romantic
sub-plot and the Quaker thing is used to justify the character's frequent
solemn moralising. Nothing that O'Byrne does can distract the audience from
the impression that the character is nothing more than a cypher though,
and Gogan has nothing surprising to say at any time in spite of the obvious
sincerity.</P>

<P>There is some that is of interest in Owen McPolin's cinematography (<I><A HREF="h3.htm">H3</A></I>, <I><A HREF="crud.htm">Drinking Crude</A></I>).
Though it is not startling or dramatic, the film's visual texture is certainly
part of its meaning. The mixture of grainy stocks with more conventional
views of trees, shrubs and skeletons reinforces the symbolic preoccupation
with landscape at the centre of the plot. Blurred, filtered, and otherwise
affected visions of the countryside framed by memory, perspective, and the
recording technology by which man seeks to order and record it are all suggested
through a combination of photographic techniques marshalled by McPolin.
The cinematographer manages to give the landscape enough character to sustain
the director's assessment of the issues involved with it, but, in truth,
we have seen or heard all of this before.</P>

<P><I>Mapmaker</I> is an earnest and sombre film which is not dramatically
engaging enough to make it worth a look on its own terms, nor it is sufficiently
at variance with the bulk of Irish films on this loose configuration of
topics to distinguish it from the herd. Casual viewers will be pretty bored
by most of it, and though there is more in there for students of Irish cinema
than for the average punter, they too will find themselves sighing and yawning
too often for them to make it all the way through unless they have to. It
is not easy to make a feature film in modern Ireland, Lord knows, but this
doesn't mean that a half-baked collection of ideas should go into production
just because it his a number of thematic triggers, and because it probably,
with all due irony given the subject of the film, looked good on paper.
<I>Mapmaker</I> is a disappointing follow up to <I><A HREF="lbh.htm">The
Last Bus Home</A></I>, though perhaps its production will mean a continued
career for Gogan in a film industry which relies too heavily on one-offs.
Let's just hope that the next one retains some of the edgy energy of his
first film and leaves behind the anaemic solemnity of this one.</P>

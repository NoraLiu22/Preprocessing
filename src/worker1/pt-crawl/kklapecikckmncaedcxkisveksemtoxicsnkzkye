        Welcome to the websites operated by the Lucille Lortel Theatre Foundation (“we,” “our,” “us”),
        which include www.lortel.org, www.iobdb.com, www.liveatthelortel.com, and www.lortelawards.org
        (collectively, “Site”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement,
        which is part of our <a href="/TermsOfUse">Terms of Use</a>, describes the information 
        we collect through our Site, how we use and share it, and how you can make choices about our 
        use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            By using our Site, you consent to our collection, use, and sharing of information as described

        Privacy Statement.
    </p>
    <p class="head1">
        Information We Collect
    </p>
    <p class="head2">
        Information You Provide to Us
    </p>
    <p>
        You may browse our Site without submitting any personally-identifiable information (“Personal

        We do not use information automatically collected by our Site to identify visitors individually 
        except in circumstances where we may deem it necessary in connection with legal process or to 
        protect our rights or the rights of a third party as further described below.
    </p>
    <p class="head2">
        Cookies
    </p>
    <p>
        We may collect information through cookies or similar technologies that are small data files 
        placed on your computer. For example, we may use cookies to enable services you request and 
        to collect anonymous information for analytics to improve our Site. You are not required to 
        accept cookies from our Site. Your web browser allows you to disable the cookies function or 
        delete existing cookies. However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to participate 
        in certain features on our Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service supplied by Google Inc.
        Google Analytics provides aggregate information to allow us to analyze how our Site is used.
        You can learn more about Google’s privacy practices at:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>

        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.
        We also use MailChimp to manage our newsletter and other email lists. MailChimp’s analytics
        may use web beacons to aggregate how many subscribers open a message or click the links inside.

    </p>
    <p class="head1">
        How We Use Your Information
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use your Personal Information: to respond to inquiries; to send newsletters and other 
        information; to administer our programs; to promote our services; and to acknowledge a donation.
        You may opt out of receiving communications from us through an “unsubscribe” link in our emails 
        or by sending an email to: <a href="mailto:info@lortel.org">info@lortel.org</a>.

        How We Share Your Information
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates and with our third-party service 
        providers (“Service Providers”) that help us operate and provide services in connection with 
        our Site, such as to send emails. We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to any 
        third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may also choose to provide your Personal Information directly to our Service Providers. 
        When you click on a link to participate in certain activities, such as to enter our Youth 
        Playwriting Fellowship (“Fellowship”) or to make a donation, you will be taken to a web site 
        operated by one of our Service Providers, which will collect your Personal Information for the 
        particular activity. In some circumstances, such as the Fellowship, the Service Provider will 
        share your Personal Information and related materials with us so that we may administer the 
        Fellowship. In other circumstances, such as making a donation, the Service Provider will process 
        the donation and share some of your Personal Information (e.g., your name, address, and amount 
        donated) so that we may acknowledge your donation, but the Service Provider will not share your 
        payment card information.You should carefully review the privacy policy and terms of use that 
        govern the Service Provider’s web site if you decide to provide your Personal Information to the 
        Service Provider. We will use the Personal Information our Service Providers share with us in 
        accordance with this Privacy Statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to disclose and use Personal Information and other information in special 
        circumstances, including to enforce this Privacy Statement or any other part of our Terms, to 
        comply with legal process or law enforcement, to address actual or suspected illegal activity, 
        to protect our property or rights, to protect the rights and safety of others, or for other reasons 
        we determine in good faith are necessary, appropriate or required by law. If we ever merge with, 
        are acquired by, or otherwise consolidate with another organization, Personal Information may be 
        transferred along with our other assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please remember that if you share your Personal Information when you post User Content, such as in 
        a comment, you will be making your Personal Information publicly visible to others. You are responsible 
        for the Personal Information you share in this manner.
    </p>

        on behalf of any other organization. As noted above, online donations to us are processed by our 
        Service Provider and are subject to the Service Provider’s privacy policy and terms of use. We maintain

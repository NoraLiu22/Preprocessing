 <h3>Victorian Representations of War</h3>

<p class="one">
Throughout the nineteenth century, Nation and State were exalted in Europe. Both notions were at the 
core of Fichte's or Hegel's thought. As a consequence, war was magnified for people imagined it enabled the individual to fulfil 
his human nature. During <a href="../../../history/victoria/index.html">Queen Victoria</a>'s reign, Britain underwent a substantial series of campaigns which allowed its regiments to 
set foot on nearly all the continents. Whether Britain was confronted to European types of war as in <a href="../history/crimea/crimeaov.html">Crimea</a>, to the alliance of Western armies 
against native troops (The Boxer Rebellion), to colonial conflicts (known as Victoria's little wars), to the clashes with fellow colonial nations 
(France at Fashoda) or to the trauma of a rebellions (<a href="../history/empire/1857.html">the Sepoys</a>), seldom had a decade gone by without its share of reports of glorious, or
 not so glorious, deeds being performed somewhere in the world by Victoria's Tommies. British people had access to the representations of
 these conflicts through a variety of sources: the press, juvenile literature, paintings, postcards, posters, illustrated magazines, collectables, the 
cinema, the music hall, toys and of course literature (prose and poetry) etc. Assessing the period as a whole, one cannot but notice that  
increasing emphasis was placed upon the stock of the heroic <a href="../history/army1.html">British soldier</a> (<a href="../authors/kipling/index.html">Kipling</a>'s Absent Minded Beggar). But the staging of war by 
Victorian artists and writers may also be understood as depicting the conflicts which took place on British soil in previous centuries (or were 
to take place in the future), reminding the public of the troublesome years their country had gone through or was about to confront. </p>
 
<p>
Paul Fussel points out that the representations of yet another war in which British troops were involved  reveal more about those 
who describe it than they provide trustworthy accounts of what happened:</p>
 
<p class="lq">Indeed a striking phenomenon of the last twenty-five years is 
the obsession with the images and myths of the Great War among novelists and poets too young to have experienced it directly. They have
 worked it up by purely literary means, means which necessarily transform the war into a "subject" and simplify its motifs into myths and figures
 expressive of the modern existential predicament. These writers provide for the "post-modern" sensibility a telling example of the way the present 
influences the past.  [<span class="book">The Great War in Modern Memory</span>, Oxford University Press, 1975, p. 321)] </p>
 
<p>
Can the same light be shed on Victorian authors? Were all the artists attuned or were there significant divergences? How were all these martial
 events supplemented to the public? What was the aim of the artists and writers when choosing war as the main feature, or as 
the background, to their work? What does it reveal about "the Victorian frame of mind," as Walter E. Houghton once phrased it? 
Can a pattern be drawn within any degree of precision as far as mental representations are concerned? Where does the native hero 
of the "Gunga Din" type stand in the process? What happened between Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" (<a href="../authors/tennyson/charge.html">text</a>, 1854) and 
Kipling's "The Last of the Light Brigade" (1891) in terms of social representations? Was there any evolution in the way these
 conflicts were staged throughout Queen Victoria's reign? Were all <a href="../history/Class.html">classes</a> of British society as well as all parts of Great Britain and the
 Empire equally receptive to these martial images? </p>
 
<p>
The cardinal objective of this issue of the <b>Cahiers Victoriens et Edouardiens</b> is to examine these questions and others; 
it is to go beyond the mere hagiography of Victorian heroes; to delineate the principle characteristics of the production of these 
representations, to analyse the expedients which were employed by artists and authors, and to define the concept(s) of war in Victorian ideology.</p>

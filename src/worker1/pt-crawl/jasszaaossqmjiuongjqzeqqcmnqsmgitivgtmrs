<h3>Program of Study</h3>




<p>The BA program in Jewish Studies provides a context in which College students may examine the texts, cultures, languages, and histories of Jews and Judaism over three millennia. The perspective is contextual, comparative, and interdisciplinary. The long and diverse history of Jews and Judaism affords unique opportunities to study modes of continuity and change, interpretation and innovation, and isolation and integration of a world historical civilization. Students are encouraged to develop appropriate skills (in texts, languages, history, and culture) for independent work.</p>




<p>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Jewish Studies. Information follows the description of the major.</p>




<a name="jewishcivilizationsequence"></a>
<h3><a id="Jewish Civilization Sequence" name="Jewish Civilization Sequence"></a>Jewish Civilization Sequence</h3>




<p class="MsoNormal">A three-course Jewish Civilization sequence is offered in the Autumn, Winter, and Spring Quarters. The first course begins in antiquity and extends through the medieval period (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=JWSC%2012000" title="JWSC 12000" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'JWSC 12000');">JWSC 12000</a> Jewish Civilization I: Ancient Beginnings to Medieval Period</span>). The second course begins in the early modern period and extends to the present (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=JWSC%2012001" title="JWSC 12001" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'JWSC 12001');">JWSC 12001</a> Jewish Civilization II: Early Modern Period to 21st Century</span>). <!--class="Mso"--><!--class="Mso"--><span>In the Spring Quarter, students have the option of taking a third unit of Jewish Civilization, a course whose topics will vary (JWSC 1200X).</span><!--class="Mso"--> Jewish Civilization courses may be used to fulfill the College’s general education requirement in civilization studies. It is recommended, though not required, that students take these courses in sequence. Students who register for the Autumn Quarter course will automatically be preregistered for the Winter Quarter segment. In order for the Spring Quarter course to qualify for the general education requirement in civilization studies, the student must have completed Jewish Civilization I and II. The Spring Quarter course, however, may also be taken as an independent elective.</p>





<p>Students may also fulfill the Jewish civilization requirement by participating in one of two Study Abroad programs. In the “Jerusalem in Middle Eastern Civilizations” Study Abroad program, students can earn credit for three courses in Jewish Civilization and one credit in modern Hebrew. In the &quot;Vienna: Jewish Civilization&quot; Study Abroad program (offered bienially), students can earn credit for three courses in Jewish Civilization and one credit in German. For more information about these programs, please see the <a href="/thecollege/offcampusstudyprograms">Study Abroad</a> page of this catalog.</p>




<a name="programrequirements"></a>
<h3>Program Requirements</h3>




<h4>Advising</h4>




<p style="margin-left:.5pt">Students who have not completed the College’s general education requirements before starting the major should do so during their first year as Jewish Studies majors. Students are required to meet with the director of undergraduate studies before declaring a major in Jewish Studies. Each student in the major will have as an adviser a faculty member who is affiliated with the Greenberg Center for Jewish Studies.</p>




<a name="majorinjewishstudies"></a>
<h3>Major in Jewish Studies</h3>




<p>The major requires twelve courses distributed according to the guidelines that follow. A full, constantly updated list of courses approved for the major and minor is available on the <a href="https://ccjs.uchicago.edu">Greenberg Center for Jewish Studies website</a>.</p>




<h4>Language</h4>




<p>Students must take three quarters of Hebrew (classical or modern) or Yiddish. If the student's research project requires knowledge of a different language, the student may petition the committee to substitute that language in the place of Hebrew or Yiddish.</p>




<h4>Jewish Civilization and Electives</h4>




<p><span>Students in the major must take nine additional courses in Jewish Studies, for a total of twelve courses. </span></p>




<p style="margin-left:30.0pt"><strong>Jewish Civilization</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Students in the major must complete either the first two quarters of the Jewish Civilization sequence, or the &quot;Jerusalem in Middle Eastern Civilizations&quot; or &quot;Vienna: Jewish Civilization&quot; Study Abroad program.</span></p>




<p style="margin-left:30.0pt"><span>If students take one of these sequences to satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies, one elective in the major must come from another civilization studies sequence pertinent to the area and period of the student’s primary interest in Jewish Studies.</span></p>




<p style="margin-left:30.0pt">For students who take a sequence outside Jewish Studies to satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies, the two- or three-course Jewish Civilization sequence (or three-course sequences offered in Jerusalem and Vienna) will count among the JWSC electives required for the major.</p>




<p style="margin-left:30.0pt"><strong>Other Electives:</strong> The remaining courses must come from JWSC course offerings. These elective courses should normally focus in a specific area of concentration within Jewish Studies and should be chosen in consultation with the student's Jewish Studies advisor. Students who complete the optional BA thesis (as described under <a href="#Optional BA Paper">Optional BA Paper</a>) may count <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=JWSC%2029900" title="JWSC 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'JWSC 29900');">JWSC 29900</a> BA Preparation Course</span> among these courses.</p>





<p>Beyond the requirements for the major, students are encouraged to take at least one course in method or theory pertaining to their area of concentration in Jewish Studies, whether it is a JWSC course that can count in the major or simply a general elective credit.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="Optional BA Paper" name="Optional BA Paper"></a></strong>Optional BA Paper</h4>




<p>Students who choose this option are to meet with their advisers by May 15 of their third year to determine the focus of the research project, and they are expected to begin reading and research for the BA paper during the summer before their fourth year. After further consultation, students are to continue guided readings and participate in a (formal or informal) tutorial during Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. Credit toward the major is received only for the Winter Quarter tutorial (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=JWSC%2029900" title="JWSC 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'JWSC 29900');">JWSC 29900</a> BA Preparation Course</span>), during which the BA paper is finally written and revised. The BA tutorial may count toward one of the courses related to Jewish Studies. The BA paper must be received by the primary reader by the end of fifth week of Spring Quarter. A BA paper is a requirement for consideration for honors.</p>





<p>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program chair. Approval from both program chairs is required. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, if neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available <a href="https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/college-prod/s3fs-public/documents/BA_Double_Major_0.pdf">online</a> or from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation.</p>




<a name="honors"></a>
<h3>Honors</h3>




<p>Honors are awarded to students who demonstrate excellence in their course work, as well as on the BA paper. Students must maintain an overall GPA of 3.25 or higher and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major, and the BA paper must be judged to be at least of A- quality.</p>




<a name="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>




<p>Students take all courses required for the major for quality grades.</p>




<a name="minorinjewishstudies"></a>
<h3>Minor in Jewish Studies</h3>




<p>The minor in Jewish Studies provides a basic introduction to the texts, cultures, languages, and history of the Jews and Judaism. Six courses are required for the minor, two of which are <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=JWSC%2012000" title="JWSC 12000" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'JWSC 12000');">JWSC 12000</a> Jewish Civilization I: Ancient Beginnings to Medieval Period</span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=JWSC%2012001" title="JWSC 12001" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'JWSC 12001');">JWSC 12001</a> Jewish Civilization II: Early Modern Period to 21st Century</span>. The other courses may be in any area of Jewish Studies, including languages such as Hebrew and Yiddish; such courses can be identified by their JWSC prefix. Students can earn credit for three courses in Jewish Civilization and one credit in modern Hebrew by participating in the “Jerusalem in Middle Eastern Civilizations” Study Abroad program; they can earn credit for three courses in Jewish Civilization and one credit in German by participating in the &quot;Vienna: Jewish Civilization&quot; Study Abroad program. For more information about these programs, please see the <a href="/thecollege/offcampusstudyprograms">Study Abroad</a> page of this catalog.</p>





<p>Students who wish to do a minor in Jewish Studies must meet with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of the Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. The director’s approval for the minor program must then be communicated to the student’s College adviser on the <a href="https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/college-prod/s3fs-public/documents/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf">Consent to Complete a Minor Program</a> form.</p>




<p>Courses taken to fulfill the requirements for the minor in Jewish Studies may not be double-counted with courses taken for the student’s major(s) or courses taken for other minors. Courses taken for the minor in Jewish Studies must be taken for quality grades.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>JWSC 12009.  Jewish Civilization III - Philosophical Responses to the Holocaust.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines a range of philosophical responses to the problem of living and acting in the wake of the Holocaust, which called into question every philosophical, theological, and cultural piety of Western civilization: the existence and goodness of God; the actuality of historical progress; the ability of the modern nation-state and its laws to secure freedom and equality for individuals among religious and cultural differences; the capacity of art, culture, and education to make people good and ethical; the power of human reason to decipher good from evil and to guide human action accordingly. We will explore these questions together with a set of methodological concerns around how to study, represent, and memorialize the Holocaust and other historical atrocities, asking: is the Holocaust best approached as a unique historical event or should it be studied together with the histories of enslavement, imperialism, and colonialism? Is there something about the very nature of modernity that generates fascism? What stories can be told, how should they be told, and who has the right to tell them? What forms of knowledge, institution-building, and culture-making might be called upon to honor the victims of past atrocities and generate resources for resisting present and future ones? Course materials may include film, photography, and texts by Adorno, Levinas, Arendt, Levi, Césaire, Fanon, Kofman and others.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

What is a &quot;just&quot; society? And how do we know if justice has been achieved? This course is both an overview of the concept of a &quot;just society&quot; and a thematic survey of the narratives of the Hebrew Bible (the Jewish Tanak, the Christian Old Testament) through the lens of social justice. In this course we will examine several perspectives within the Hebrew Bible on what makes a just society, with particular emphasis on the narratives and legal corpora of the Pentateuch, the historical narratives of the former prophets, and the sayings and exhortations of the &quot;writing&quot; prophets. We will aim to understand more clearly what the ancient Israelites would have likely understood by the notion of a &quot;just society,&quot; and how those understandings may differ from our own. Through our discussions, students will develop their skills in close-reading of texts and literary analysis of biblical narratives. In this course we will study several social issues and their reflections in biblical texts. Among the possibilities are: slavery, the treatment of the poor, the rights of the community vs. the individual, the treatment of the disabled, homicide, war, revenge, animal rights and environmentalism, inheritance, and immigration.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>JWSC 20923.  Magic, Miracles, and Medicine: Healthcare in the Bible and the Ancient World.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
This course examines the complex issues surrounding the body, disability, and medical care in antiquity. It will be guided by a variety of questions, such as what was the root cause of bodily infirmity and disease in antiquity? How did cultural views of sex, gender, and race influence perceptions of the body and what it meant to be able bodied? Such questions are significant when considering what kind of access to healthcare marginalized groups had. In order to explore these questions, we will examine ancient Mediterranean views of medical care through material remains (e.g., magical amulets and healing shrines) and textual evidence (e.g., Galen and Hippocrates). After considering this wider cultural context, we will examine treatments in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and early Christianity. We will also explore how Christian concepts of medical care evolved in light of accounts of Jesus as a divine healer. In addition to this ancient evidence, we will engage with modern disability studies and sociological analyses to better orient our readings. At the end of the course, students will be better acquainted with the complex relationship between religion and medicine and how that affects modern healthcare decisions.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

While the collection of ancient texts found in modern Bibles appears fixed and is read by many people as a source of edification or theological insight, it has not always been this way. Though absent from most Bibles, there is an entire body of literature commonly known as &quot;rewritten bible&quot;: early translations, retellings, or entirely new stories with familiar names and faces that update, retcon, or subvert their &quot;biblical&quot; sources. How might we understand these ancient forms of fan fiction? The class will introduce this corpus (including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls) and its sources, production, and historical contexts. We will confront significant problems in understanding religious texts: how is it that some texts become authoritative while other very similar texts do not? Who gets to retell foundational religious narratives, and within what social or political constraints? What does it mean to relate to sacred texts as artistic prompts or imperfect points of departure? Can a biblical text be rewritten for an entirely different religious tradition? We will consider similar questions for contemporary religious practice, asking: how did rewriting the Bible get started, and has it stopped?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

This will include comparing different English translations of Yiddish literary texts, as well as examining Yiddish translations of English texts, to discuss how translators make decisions and the impact these decisions have on the resulting text; reading (in English) and discussing (in Yiddish) major theoretical texts about translation studies; and examining Yiddish language texts about translation.  All of this study will inform our own translations.

A seminar for reading the Book of Ezekiel (in English; optional reading group for those who read biblical Hebrew), the Bible's most bizarre and challenging Prophetic work. It features Ezekiel's close encounters with a brutal divine, instantaneous transportation to future spaces and faraway places, dream-scenes that become real, mortifying dramatizations, and surreal sensory overload. Ezekiel says he played the role of a crude mime, a confounding cryptic, and an erotic singer. This charged and disturbing work generated a variety of literary and speculative Jewish and Christian traditions, like the Apocalyptic and the Mystical. Modern Bible critics discount its retrospective frame, consider it a repository of historical materials, and probe Ezekiel for personality disorders.

From the horrors of the Shoah to violence suffered by individuals, the question of the origin, meaning, and reality of evil done by humans has vexed thinkers throughout the ages. This seminar is an inquiry into the problem of evil on three registers of reflection: myth, symbol, and reality. We will be exploring important philosophical, Jewish, and Christian texts. These include Martin Buber, Good and Evil, Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem, Immanuel Kant, Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone, Paul Ricoeur, The Symbolism of Evil, Edward Farley, Good and Evil, Hans Jonas, Mortality and Morality and Claudia Card, The Atrocity Paradigm. There will also be a viewing of the movie Seven (1995) directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Accordingly, the seminar probes the reality of evil and the symbolic and mythic resources of religious traditions to articulate the meaning and origin of human evil. The question of &quot;theodicy&quot; is then not the primary focus given the seminar's inquiry into the fact and reality of human evil.

The beginner's course is the first of three sequential courses offered to students at the university. The course aims to introduce students to reading, writing and speaking Modern Hebrew. Toward that end all four-language skills are emphasized: comprehension of written and oral materials; reading of non-diacritical text; writing of directed sentences, paragraphs, and compositions; speaking. You will learn the Hebrew root pattern system, and by the end of the year you will have mastered the five (active) basic verb conjugations in both the past and present tenses (as well as simple future). This grammatical knowledge is complemented by an 800+ word vocabulary, which is presented with an eye toward the major syntactic structures, including the proper use of prepositions.

For centuries the &quot;Jewish doctor&quot; has existed as an archetype, but is there such a thing as Jewish medicine? Does Judaism teach a distinct approach to the body, illness, and healing? And more significantly, why should religion have anything to do with one's health today? In this course we will grapple with our assumptions regarding modern Western medicine by discussing topics in Jewish medical thought and ethics. We will study how Judaism - its texts, history, laws, and traditions - intersect with issues of science, medicine, and the body. In particular we will think about how a Jewish approach to medicine, and more broadly a religious approach, might complicate contemporary assumptions about the body and healing. We will also consider how Jewish bodies have been imagined and stereotyped, and think about how that might affect Jewish approaches to disease and medical ethics. This course will thus offer students a way to think about alternatives to assumptions about medicine, the body, and ethics in the secular West, which will be explored both in class materials and in personal projects. No prior work in Jewish studies, medical ethics, or religious studies necessary.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The concept of tradition often takes a back seat to modernity but what does it mean to be part of a tradition in the modern world? How does tradition challenge received views and stimulate creativity, against the modern view of tradition as the &quot;dead hand of the past&quot;? How have the concept; ideology; and cultural role of tradition changed in Jewish culture since the Enlightenment? This course explores those questions in three bodies of work: (1) late 18th- to mid-20th-century German-Jewish historians, critics, &amp; theologians; (2) modern Hebrew &amp; Yiddish writers; and (3) their shared biblical, rabbinic, and mystical inspirations. Through close readings of these writers' reflections on their own literary traditions, tradition emerges as both a resource and a problem for Jewish cultural creativity; one that calls for its own theoretical vocabulary and can be set in dialogue with the modern evolution of other traditional cultures.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Defining ethnography broadly as curiosity about human difference, this course engages close readings in a vast gallery of ethnographic portraits both of and by Jews, from the Bible to the early modern period. Together, we will construct a history of this tradition by tracing patterns in how Jews are represented and how they represent themselves, as well as their own Others, in dialogue with those cultures. While anthropologists and literary theorists will help us to appreciate the diversity and fluidity of Jewish (auto-)ethnography, these thinkers will also turn our critical gaze on Greek, Roman, and European Christian images of Jews and Judaism. This history is not simply a case-study in an overlooked ethnographic tradition but an archive where influential and often oppressive &quot;Western&quot; ways of thinking about human difference have been spawned, cross-fertilized, resisted, and transformed.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The rise of nuclear weapons, the global warming crisis, and the Covid-19 pandemic have reignited debates about the fate and meaning of human history. If it is the end of the world as we know it, how should we act, and what-if anything-comes next? For centuries, the Bible has been a source for people thinking about end of time. In this course, we examine how the Bible and other ancient texts portray human catastrophe and the possibility of new beginnings. From national upheavals and the dawn of a final political order, down to the fate of the individual and the destiny of the cosmos at large, this course exposes students to the multiplicity of ways that the End is envisioned throughout the Bible and later interpretation. How do biblical authors interpret the meaning of existence in light of the End? What stands out about ancient literature when we understand it as anticipating the End, and how can these texts help us understand contemporary fears about the End? No background knowledge about the Bible or the ancient world is required for the course.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Like many at the time, the Oppemanns think that the regime will be short-lived, but Feuchtwanger's prescient novel anticipates the entrenchment of Nazi power and the creeping curtailment of Jewish life in Germany with uncanny accuracy-from the thugs attacking individuals to the Ministry of Propaganda's demonization of Jewish Germans in mass media, via the enforced &quot;Aryanization&quot; of businesses required to employ non-Jewish managers. Discussion will focus on Feuchtwanger's nuanced portrayal of the distinct ways in which family members react to these assaults, supplemented by historical texts, including the analysis of Nazi language (1946) by Victor Klemperer, a Jewish-German survivor, and documents in the Weimar Republic Sourcebook.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The modern era has been punctuated by episodes, some lasting centuries, of exploitation, expropriation, and genocide. This course will address how people and institutions have sought to grapple with the legacies of the extreme violence that polities, societies, and individuals have inflicted on each other through the collection and display of the material, documentary, and testimonial fragments left behind. Focusing on the archives and museums dedicated to the genocide of Indigenous peoples, slavery, and the Holocaust, we will discuss the following questions: What is an object of trauma? What makes its way to a depository of traumatic events, what does not, and why? What do archivists and curators hope to accomplish?  What stories can be told, given that so many of the voices of victims are irretrievable? What happens to a remnant of trauma once it is in the custody of a museum or an archive? What is the relationship between archives of trauma and their exhibition? We will consider the traumatic remains that have been deposited both in specialized and in general archives and museums. This seminar-style class will involve intensive discussion of primary sources and interdisciplinary scholarship.  We will also be going on study trips to archives and museums around Chicago, such as the Illinois Holocaust Museum &amp; Education Center, the DuSable Black History Museum &amp; Education Center, and The Mitchell Museum of the American Indian.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

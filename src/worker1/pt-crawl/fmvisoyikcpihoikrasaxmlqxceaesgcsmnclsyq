Those in Jerusalem and those in Judaea and the senate and Judas,  
<BR> <FONT CLASS="indent">To Aristobulus, who is of the family of the anointed priests, teacher of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#6">Ptolemy</A> the king, and to the Jews in Egypt,</FONT>  
<BR> <FONT CLASS="indent">Greeting, and good health. </FONT>
<BR><FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Having been saved by God out of grave dangers we thank him greatly for taking our side against the king. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> For he drove out those who fought against the holy city. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> For when the leader reached <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persia.html#1">Persia</A> with a force that seemed irresistible, they were cut to pieces in the temple of Nanaea by a deception employed by the priests of Nanaea. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> For under pretext of intending to marry her, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A> came to the place together with his friends, to secure most of its treasures as a dowry. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> When the priests of the temple of Nanaea had set out the treasures and Antiochus had come with a few men inside the wall of the sacred precinct, they closed the temple as soon as he entered it. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Opening the secret door in the ceiling, they threw stones and struck down the leader and his men, and dismembered them and cut off their heads and threw them to the people outside. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Blessed in every way be our God, who has brought judgment upon those who have behaved impiously.  
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> Since on the twenty-fifth day of Kislev we shall celebrate the purification of the temple, we thought it necessary to notify you, in order that you also may celebrate the feast of booths and the feast of the fire given when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nehemiah.html#1">Nehemiah</A>, who built the temple and the altar, offered sacrifices.   
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> For when our fathers were being led captive to Persia, the pious priests of that time took some of the fire of the altar and secretly hid it in the hollow of a dry cistern, where they took such precautions that the place was unknown to anyone.  <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> But after many years had passed, when it pleased God, Nehemiah, having been commissioned by the king of Persia, sent the descendants of the priests who had hidden the fire to get it. And when they reported to us that they had not found fire but thick liquid, he ordered them to dip it out and bring it. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> And when the materials for the sacrifices were presented, Nehemiah ordered the priests to sprinkle the liquid on the wood and what was laid upon it. <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> When this was done and some time had passed and the sun, which had been clouded over, shone out, a great fire blazed up, so that all marvelled. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> And while the sacrifice was being consumed, the priests offered prayer - the priests and every one. Jonathan led, and the rest responded, as did Nehemiah. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> The prayer was to this effect: 
<P>"O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art awe-inspiring and strong and just and merciful, who alone art King and art kind,  <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> who alone art bountiful, who alone art just and almighty and eternal, who dost rescue <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/israel.html#1">Israel</A> from every evil, who didst choose the fathers and consecrate them, <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> accept this sacrifice on behalf of all thy people Israel and preserve thy portion and make it holy. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> Gather together our scattered people, set free those who are slaves among the Gentiles, look upon those who are rejected and despised, and let the Gentiles know that thou art our God. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> Afflict those who oppress and are insolent with pride. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> Plant thy people in thy holy place, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moses.html#1">Moses</A> said." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> Then the priests sang the hymns.  <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> And when the materials of the sacrifice were consumed, Nehemiah ordered that the liquid that was left should be poured upon large stones. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> When this was done, a flame blazed up; but when the light from the altar shone back, it went out. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> When this matter became known, and it was reported to the king of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persia.html#1">Persians</A> that, in the place where the exiled priests had hidden the fire, the liquid had appeared with which Nehemiah and his associates had burned the materials of the sacrifice, <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> the king investigated the matter, and enclosed the place and made it sacred. <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> And with those persons whom the king favoured he exchanged many excellent gifts. <FONT CLASS="verse">36</FONT> Nehemiah and his associates called this "nephthar," which means purification, but by most people it is called naphtha.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">1</FONT> One finds in the records that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jeremiah.html#1">Jeremiah</A> the prophet ordered those who were being deported to take some of the fire, as has been told, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> and that the prophet after giving them the law instructed those who were being deported not to forget the commandments of the Lord, nor to be led astray in their thoughts upon seeing the gold and silver statues and their adornment. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> And with other similar words he exhorted them that the law should not depart from their hearts.  
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> It was also in the writing that the prophet, having received an oracle, ordered that the tent and the ark should follow with him, and that he went out to the mountain where <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moses.html#1">Moses</A> had gone up and had seen the inheritance of God.  <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> And Jeremiah came and found a cave, and he brought there the tent and the ark and the altar of incense, and he sealed up the entrance. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Some of those who followed him came up to mark the way, but could not find it. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> When Jeremiah learned of it, he rebuked them and declared: "The place shall be unknown until God gathers his people together again and shows his mercy. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> And then the Lord will disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord and the cloud will appear, as they were shown in the case of Moses, and as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/solomon.html#1">Solomon</A> asked that the place should be specially consecrated."  
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> It was also made clear that being possessed of wisdom Solomon offered sacrifice for the dedication and completion of the temple.  <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Just as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven and devoured the sacrifices, so also Solomon prayed, and the fire came down and consumed the whole burnt offerings. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> And Moses said, "They were consumed because the sin offering had not been eaten." <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Likewise Solomon also kept the eight days. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> The same things are reported in the records and in the memoirs of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nehemiah.html#1">Nehemiah</A>, and also that he founded a library and collected the books about the kings and prophets, and the writings of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/david.html#1">David</A>, and letters of kings about votive offerings.  <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> In the same way <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judas.html#1">Judas</A> also collected all the books that had been lost on account of the war which had come upon us, and they are in our possession. <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> So if you have need of them, send people to get them for you.  
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Since, therefore, we are about to celebrate the purification, we write to you. Will you therefore please keep the days?  <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> It is God who has saved all his people, and has returned the inheritance to all, and the kingship and priesthood and consecration, <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> as he promised through the law. For we have hope in God that he will soon have mercy upon us and will gather us from everywhere under heaven into his holy place, for he has rescued us from great evils and has purified the place. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> The story of Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar,  <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> and further the wars against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A> Epiphanes and his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#5">Eupator</A>, <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> and the appearances which came from heaven to those who strove zealously on behalf of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Judaism</A>, so that though few in number they seized the whole land and pursued the barbarian hordes, <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> and recovered the temple famous throughout the world and freed the city and restored the laws that were about to be abolished, while the Lord with great kindness became gracious to them - <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> all this, which has been set forth by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jason.html#14">Jason</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cyrene.html#1">Cyrene</A> in five volumes, we shall attempt to condense into a single book. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> For considering the flood of numbers involved and the difficulty there is for those who wish to enter upon the narratives of history because of the mass of material, <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> we have aimed to please those who wish to read, to make it easy for those who are inclined to memorise, and to profit all readers. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> For us who have undertaken the toil of abbreviating, it is no light matter but calls for sweat and loss of sleep, <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> just as it is not easy for one who prepares a banquet and seeks the benefit of others. However, to secure the gratitude of many we will gladly endure the uncomfortable toil, <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> leaving the responsibility for exact details to the compiler, while devoting our effort to arriving at the outlines of the condensation. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> For as the master builder of a new house must be concerned with the whole construction, while the one who undertakes its painting and decoration has to consider only what is suitable for its adornment, such in my judgment is the case with us. <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> It is the duty of the original historian to occupy the ground and to discuss matters from every side and to take trouble with details, <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> but the one who recasts the narrative should be allowed to strive for brevity of expression and to forego exhaustive treatment. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> At this point therefore let us begin our narrative, adding only so much to what has already been said; for it is foolish to lengthen the preface while cutting short the history itself.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">1</FONT> While the holy city was inhabited in unbroken peace and the laws were very well observed because of the piety of the high priest <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/onias.html#3">Onias</A> and his hatred of wickedness,  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> it came about that the kings themselves honoured the place and glorified the temple with the finest presents, <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> so that even <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#4">Seleucus</A>, the king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#2">Asia</A>, defrayed from his own revenues all the expenses connected with the service of the sacrifices. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> But a man named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/simon.html#4">Simon</A>, of the tribe of Benjamin, who had been made captain of the temple, had a disagreement with the high priest about the administration of the city market; <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> and when he could not prevail over Onias he went to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollonius.html#28">Apollonius</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarsus.html#1">Tarsus</A>, who at that time was governor of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/coele.html#1">Coele Syria</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phoenicia.html#1">Phoenicia</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> He reported to him that the treasury in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem</A> was full of untold sums of money, so that the amount of the funds could not be reckoned, and that they did not belong to the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible for them to fall under the control of the king. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> When Apollonius met the king, he told him of the money about which he had been informed. The king chose <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heliodorus.html#3">Heliodorus</A>, who was in charge of his affairs, and sent him with commands to effect the removal of the aforesaid money. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Heliodorus at once set out on his journey, ostensibly to make a tour of inspection of the cities of Coele Syria and Phoenicia, but in fact to carry out the king's purpose. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> When he had arrived at Jerusalem and had been kindly welcomed by the high priest of the city, he told about the disclosure that had been made and stated why he had come, and he inquired whether this really was the situation.  <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> The high priest explained that there were some deposits belonging to widows and orphans, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> and also some money of Hyrcanus, son of Tobias, a man of very prominent position, and that it totalled in all four hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A> of silver and two hundred of gold. To such an extent the impious Simon had misrepresented the facts. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> And he said that it was utterly impossible that wrong should be done to those people who had trusted in the holiness of the place and in the sanctity and inviolability of the temple which is honoured throughout the whole world. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> But Heliodorus, because of the king's commands which he had, said that this money must in any case be confiscated for the king's treasury. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> So he set a day and went in to direct the inspection of these funds. 
<P>There was no little distress throughout the whole city.  <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> The priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their priestly garments and called toward heaven upon him who had given the law about deposits, that he should keep them safe for those who had deposited them. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> To see the appearance of the high priest was to be wounded at heart, for his face and the change in his colour disclosed the anguish of his soul. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> For terror and bodily trembling had come over the man, which plainly showed to those who looked at him the pain lodged in his heart. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> People also hurried out of their houses in crowds to make a general supplication because the holy place was about to be brought into contempt. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the streets. Some of the maidens who were kept indoors ran together to the gates, and some to the walls, while others peered out of the windows. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> And holding up their hands to heaven, they all made entreaty. <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> There was something pitiable in the prostration of the whole populace and the anxiety of the high priest in his great anguish. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> While they were calling upon the Almighty Lord that he would keep what had been entrusted safe and secure for those who had entrusted it,  <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> Heliodorus went on with what had been decided. <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> But when he arrived at the treasury with his bodyguard, then and there the Sovereign of spirits and of all authority caused so great a manifestation that all who had been so bold as to accompany him were astounded by the power of God, and became faint with terror. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> For there appeared to them a magnificently caparisoned horse, with a rider of frightening mien, and it rushed furiously at Heliodorus and struck at him with its front hoofs. Its rider was seen to have armour and weapons of gold. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> Two young men also appeared to him, remarkably strong, gloriously beautiful and splendidly dressed, who stood on each side of him and scourged him continuously, inflicting many blows on him. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> When he suddenly fell to the ground and deep darkness came over him, his men took him up and put him on a stretcher <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> and carried him away, this man who had just entered the aforesaid treasury with a great retinue and all his bodyguard but was now unable to help himself; and they recognised clearly the sovereign power of God. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> While he lay prostrate, speechless because of the divine intervention and deprived of any hope of recovery, <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> they praised the Lord who had acted marvellously for his own place. And the temple, which a little while before was full of fear and disturbance, was filled with joy and gladness, now that the Almighty Lord had appeared. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> Quickly some of Heliodorus' friends asked Onias to call upon the Most High and to grant life to one who was lying quite at his last breath.  <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> And the high priest, fearing that the king might get the notion that some foul play had been perpetrated by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jews</A> with regard to Heliodorus, offered sacrifice for the man's recovery. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> While the high priest was making the offering of atonement, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorus dressed in the same clothing, and they stood and said, "Be very grateful to Onias the high priest, since for his sake the Lord has granted you your life. <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> And see that you, who have been scourged by heaven, report to all men the majestic power of God." Having said this they vanished. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> Then Heliodorus offered sacrifice to the Lord and made very great vows to the Saviour of his life, and having bidden Onias farewell, he marched off with his forces to the king.  <FONT CLASS="verse">36</FONT> And he bore testimony to all men of the deeds of the supreme God, which he had seen with his own eyes. <FONT CLASS="verse">37</FONT> When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of person would be suitable to send on another mission to Jerusalem, he replied, <FONT CLASS="verse">38</FONT> "If you have any enemy or plotter against your government, send him there, for you will get him back thoroughly scourged, if he escapes at all, for there certainly is about the place some power of God. <FONT CLASS="verse">39</FONT> For he who has his dwelling in heaven watches over that place himself and brings it aid, and he strikes and destroys those who come to do it injury." <FONT CLASS="verse">40</FONT> This was the outcome of the episode of Heliodorus and the protection of the treasury.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">1</FONT> The previously mentioned <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/simon.html#4">Simon</A>, who had informed about the money against his own country, slandered <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/onias.html#3">Onias</A>, saying that it was he who had incited <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heliodorus.html#3">Heliodorus</A> and had been the real cause of the misfortune.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> He dared to designate as a plotter against the government the man who was the benefactor of the city, the protector of his fellow countrymen, and a zealot for the laws. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> When his hatred progressed to such a degree that even murders were committed by one of Simon's approved agents, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Onias recognized that the rivalry was serious and that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollonius.html#28">Apollonius</A>, the son of Menestheus and governor of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/coele.html#1">Coele Syria</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phoenicia.html#1">Phoenicia</A>, was intensifying the malice of Simon. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> So he betook himself to the king, not accusing his fellow citizens but having in view the welfare, both public and private, of all the people. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> For he saw that without the king's attention public affairs could not again reach a peaceful settlement, and that Simon would not stop his folly. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> When <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#4">Seleucus</A> died and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A> who was called Epiphanes succeeded to the kingdom, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jason.html#3">Jason</A> the brother of Onias obtained the high priesthood by corruption,  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> promising the king at an interview three hundred and sixty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A> of silver and, from another source of revenue, eighty talents. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> In addition to this he promised to pay one hundred and fifty more if permission were given to establish by his authority a gymnasium and a body of youth for it, and to enrol the men of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem</A> as citizens of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antioch.html#1">Antioch</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> When the king assented and Jason came to office, he at once shifted his countrymen over to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/greece.html#1">Greek</A> way of life. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> He set aside the existing royal concessions to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jews</A>, secured through <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/john.html#3">John</A> the father of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eupolemus.html#5">Eupolemus</A>, who went on the mission to establish friendship and alliance with the Romans; and he destroyed the lawful ways of living and introduced new customs contrary to the law. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> For with alacrity he founded a gymnasium right under the citadel, and he induced the noblest of the young men to wear the Greek hat. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> There was such an extreme of Hellenisation and increase in the adoption of foreign ways because of the surpassing wickedness of Jason, who was ungodly and no high priest, <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> that the priests were no longer intent upon their service at the altar. Despising the sanctuary and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened to take part in the unlawful proceedings in the wrestling arena after the call to the discus, <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> disdaining the honours prized by their fathers and putting the highest value upon Greek forms of prestige. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> For this reason heavy disaster overtook them, and those whose ways of living they admired and wished to imitate completely became their enemies and punished them. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> For it is no light thing to show irreverence to the divine laws - a fact which later events will make clear. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> When the quadrennial games were being held at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyre.html#1">Tyre</A> and the king was present,  <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> the vile Jason sent envoys, chosen as being <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antioch.html#1">Antiochian</A> citizens from Jerusalem, to carry three hundred silver <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma">drachmas</A> for the sacrifice to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heracles.html#1">Hercules</A>. Those who carried the money, however, thought best not to use it for sacrifice, because that was inappropriate, but to expend it for another purpose. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> So this money was intended by the sender for the sacrifice to Hercules, but by the decision of its carriers it was applied to the construction of <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme">triremes</A>. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> When Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/egypt.html#1">Egypt</A> for the coronation of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#6">Philometor</A> as king, Antiochus learned that Philometor had become hostile to his government, and he took measures for his own security. Therefore upon arriving at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/joppa.html#1">Joppa</A> he proceeded to Jerusalem.  <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> He was welcomed magnificently by Jason and the city, and ushered in with a blaze of torches and with shouts. Then he marched into Phoenicia. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> After a period of three years Jason sent <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menelaus.html#4">Menelaus</A>, the brother of the previously mentioned Simon, to carry the money to the king and to complete the records of essential business.  <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> But he, when presented to the king, extolled him with an air of authority, and secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A> of silver. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> After receiving the king's orders he returned, possessing no qualification for the high priesthood, but having the hot temper of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage wild beast. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> So Jason, who after supplanting his own brother was supplanted by another man, was driven as a fugitive into the land of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ammonites.html#1">Ammon</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> And Menelaus held the office, but he did not pay regularly any of the money promised to the king. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> When Sostratus the captain of the citadel kept requesting payment, for the collection of the revenue was his responsibility, the two of them were summoned by the king on account of this issue. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> Menelaus left his own brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysimachus.html#5">Lysimachus</A> as deputy in the high priesthood, while Sostratus left Crates, the commander of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cyprus.html#1">Cyprian</A> troops. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> While such was the state of affairs, it happened that the people of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tarsus.html#1">Tarsus</A> and of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mallus.html#1">Mallus</A> revolted because their cities had been given as a present to Antiochis, the king's concubine.  <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> So the king went hastily to settle the trouble, leaving <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/andronicus.html#6">Andronicus</A>, a man of high rank, to act as his deputy. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> But Menelaus, thinking he had obtained a suitable opportunity, stole some of the gold vessels of the temple and gave them to Andronicus; other vessels, as it happened, he had sold to Tyre and the neighbouring cities. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> When Onias became fully aware of these acts he publicly exposed them, having first withdrawn to a place of sanctuary at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/daphne.html#2">Daphne</A> near Antioch. <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> Therefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus aside, urged him to kill Onias. Andronicus came to Onias, and resorting to treachery offered him sworn pledges and gave him his right hand, and in spite of his suspicion persuaded Onias to come out from the place of sanctuary; then, with no regard for justice, he immediately put him out of the way. <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> For this reason not only Jews, but many also of other nations, were grieved and displeased at the unjust murder of the man. <FONT CLASS="verse">36</FONT> When the king returned from the region of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cilicia.html#1">Cilicia</A>, the Jews in the city appealed to him with regard to the unreasonable murder of Onias, and the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/greece.html#1">Greeks</A> shared their hatred of the crime. <FONT CLASS="verse">37</FONT> Therefore Antiochus was grieved at heart and filled with pity, and wept because of the moderation and good conduct of the deceased; <FONT CLASS="verse">38</FONT> and inflamed with anger, he immediately stripped off the purple robe from Andronicus, tore off his garments, and led him about the whole city to that very place where he had committed the outrage against Onias, and there he dispatched the bloodthirsty fellow. The Lord thus repaid him with the punishment he deserved. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">39</FONT> When many acts of sacrilege had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the connivance of Menelaus, and when report of them had spread abroad, the populace gathered against Lysimachus, because many of the gold vessels had already been stolen.  <FONT CLASS="verse">40</FONT> And since the crowds were becoming aroused and filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men and launched an unjust attack, under the leadership of a certain Auranus, a man advanced in years and no less advanced in folly. <FONT CLASS="verse">41</FONT> But when the Jews became aware of Lysimachus' attack, some picked up stones, some blocks of wood, and others took handfuls of the ashes that were lying about, and threw them in wild confusion at Lysimachus and his men. <FONT CLASS="verse">42</FONT> As a result, they wounded many of them, and killed some, and put them all to flight; and the temple robber himself they killed close by the treasury. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">43</FONT> Charges were brought against Menelaus about this incident.  <FONT CLASS="verse">44</FONT> When the king came to Tyre, three men sent by the senate presented the case before him. <FONT CLASS="verse">45</FONT> But Menelaus, already as good as beaten, promised a substantial bribe to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemaeus.html#27">Ptolemaeus</A> son of Dorymenes to win over the king. <FONT CLASS="verse">46</FONT> Therefore Ptolemaeus, taking the king aside into a colonnade as if for refreshment, induced the king to change his mind. <FONT CLASS="verse">47</FONT> Menelaus, the cause of all the evil, he acquitted of the charges against him, while he sentenced to death those unfortunate men, who would have been freed uncondemned if they had pleaded even before <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythians</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">48</FONT> And so those who had spoken for the city and the villages and the holy vessels quickly suffered the unjust penalty. <FONT CLASS="verse">49</FONT> Therefore even the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyre.html#1">Tyrians</A>, showing their hatred of the crime, provided magnificently for their funeral. <FONT CLASS="verse">50</FONT> But Menelaus, because of the cupidity of those in power, remained in office, growing in wickedness, having become the chief plotter against his fellow citizens.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">1</FONT> About this time <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A> made his second invasion of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/egypt.html#1">Egypt</A>.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> And it happened that over all the city, for almost forty days, there appeared golden-clad horsemen charging through the air, in companies fully armed with lances and drawn swords - <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> troops of horsemen drawn up, attacks and counterattacks made on this side and on that, brandishing of shields, massing of spears, hurling of missiles, the flash of golden trappings, and armour of all sorts. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Therefore all men prayed that the apparition might prove to have been a good omen. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> When a false rumour arose that Antiochus was dead, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jason.html#3">Jason</A> took no less than a thousand men and suddenly made an assault upon the city. When the troops upon the wall had been forced back and at last the city was being taken, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/menelaus.html#4">Menelaus</A> took refuge in the citadel.  <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> But Jason kept relentlessly slaughtering his fellow citizens, not realising that success at the cost of one's kindred is the greatest misfortune, but imagining that he was setting up trophies of victory over enemies and not over fellow countrymen. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> He did not gain control of the government, however; and in the end got only disgrace from his conspiracy, and fled again into the country of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ammonites.html#1">Ammonites</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Finally he met a miserable end. Accused before <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aretas.html#1">Aretas</A> the ruler of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arabia.html#1">Arabs</A>, fleeing from city to city, pursued by all men, hated as a rebel against the laws, and abhorred as the executioner of his country and his fellow citizens, he was cast ashore in Egypt; <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> and he who had driven many from their own country into exile died in exile, having embarked to go to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemonians</A> in hope of finding protection because of their kinship. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> He who had cast out many to lie unburied had no one to mourn for him; he had no funeral of any sort and no place in the tomb of his fathers. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> When news of what had happened reached the king, he took it to mean that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judaea.html#1">Judaea</A> was in revolt. So, raging inwardly, he left Egypt and took the city by storm.  <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> And he commanded his soldiers to cut down relentlessly every one they met and to slay those who went into the houses. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> Then there was killing of young and old, destruction of boys, women, and children, and slaughter of virgins and infants. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Within the total of three days eighty thousand were destroyed, forty thousand in hand-to-hand fighting; and as many were sold into slavery as were slain. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> Not content with this, Antiochus dared to enter the most holy temple in all the world, guided by Menelaus, who had become a traitor both to the laws and to his country.  <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> He took the holy vessels with his polluted hands, and swept away with profane hands the votive offerings which other kings had made to enhance the glory and honour of the place. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Antiochus was elated in spirit, and did not perceive that the Lord was angered for a little while because of the sins of those who dwelt in the city, and that therefore he was disregarding the holy place. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> But if it had not happened that they were involved in many sins, this man would have been scourged and turned back from his rash act as soon as he came forward, just as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heliodorus.html#3">Heliodorus</A> was, whom <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/seleucus.html#4">Seleucus</A> the king sent to inspect the treasury. <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> But the Lord did not choose the nation for the sake of the holy place, but the place for the sake of the nation. <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> Therefore the place itself shared in the misfortunes that befell the nation and afterward participated in its benefits; and what was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty was restored again in all its glory when the great Lord became reconciled. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> So Antiochus carried off eighteen hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A> from the temple, and hurried away to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antioch.html#1">Antioch</A>, thinking in his arrogance that he could sail on the land and walk on the sea, because his mind was elated.  <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> And he left governors to afflict the people: at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem</A>, Philippus, by birth a <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phrygia.html#1">Phrygian</A> and in character more barbarous than the man who appointed him; <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> and at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gerizzim.html#1">Gerizim</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/andronicus.html#6">Andronicus</A>; and besides these Menelaus, who lorded it over his fellow citizens worse than the others did. In his malice toward the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jewish</A> citizens, <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> Antiochus sent Apollonius, the captain of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mysia.html#1">Mysians</A>, with an army of twenty-two thousand, and commanded him to slay all the grown men and to sell the women and boys as slaves. <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> When this man arrived in Jerusalem, he pretended to be peaceably disposed and waited until the holy <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath">sabbath</A> day; then, finding the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jews</A> not at work, he ordered his men to parade under arms. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> He put to the sword all those who came out to see them, then rushed into the city with his armed men and killed great numbers of people. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judas.html#1">Judas</A> Maccabaeus, with about nine others, got away to the wilderness, and kept himself and his companions alive in the mountains as wild animals do; they continued to live on what grew wild, so that they might not share in the defilement.  

<BR><BR><BR><A CLASS="ref" NAME="6">[6]</A> &nbsp; &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://el.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%9C%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%B1%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BD_%CE%92%27_(Rahlfs)#6"> G</A> 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">1</FONT> Not long after this, the king sent an <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athens.html#1">Athenian</A> senator to compel the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jews</A> to forsake the laws of their fathers and cease to live by the laws of God,  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> and also to pollute the temple in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem</A> and call it the temple of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympus.html#1">Olympian</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zeus.html#1">Zeus</A>, and to call the one in Gerizim the temple of Zeus the Friend of Strangers, as did the people who dwelt in that place. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Harsh and utterly grievous was the onslaught of evil.  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> For the temple was filled with debauchery and revelling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots and had intercourse with women within the sacred precincts, and besides brought in things for sacrifice that were unfit. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The altar was covered with abominable offerings which were forbidden by the laws. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> A man could neither keep the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath">sabbath</A>, nor observe the feasts of his fathers, nor so much as confess himself to be a <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jew</A>. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> On the monthly celebration of the king's birthday, the Jews were taken, under bitter constraint, to partake of the sacrifices; and when the feast of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysus.html#1">Dionysus</A> came, they were compelled to walk in the procession in honour of Dionysus, wearing wreaths of ivy.  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> At the suggestion of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemaeus.html#27">Ptolemaeus</A> a decree was issued to the neighbouring <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/greece.html#1">Greek</A> cities, that they should adopt the same policy toward the Jews and make them partake of the sacrifices, <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> and should slay those who did not choose to change over to Greek customs. One could see, therefore, the misery that had come upon them. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. These women they publicly paraded about the city, with their babies hung at their breasts, then hurled them down headlong from the wall. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> Others who had assembled in the caves near by, to observe the seventh day secretly, were betrayed to Philippus and were all burned together, because their piety kept them from defending themselves, in view of their regard for that most holy day. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Now I urge those who read this book not to be depressed by such calamities, but to recognise that these punishments were designed not to destroy but to discipline our people.  <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> In fact, not to let the impious alone for long, but to punish them immediately, is a sign of great kindness. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> For in the case of the other nations the Lord waits patiently to punish them until they have reached the full measure of their sins; but he does not deal in this way with us, <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> in order that he may not take vengeance on us afterward when our sins have reached their height. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> Therefore he never withdraws his mercy from us. Though he disciplines us with calamities, he does not forsake his own people. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Let what we have said serve as a reminder; we must go on briefly with the story. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eleazar.html#2">Eleazar</A>, one of the scribes in high position, a man now advanced in age and of noble presence, was being forced to open his mouth to eat swine's flesh.  <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> But he, welcoming death with honour rather than life with pollution, went up to the rack of his own accord, spitting out the flesh, <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> as men ought to go who have the courage to refuse things that it is not right to taste, even for the natural love of life. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> Those who were in charge of that unlawful sacrifice took the man aside, because of their long acquaintance with him, and privately urged him to bring meat of his own providing, proper for him to use, and pretend that he was eating the flesh of the sacrificial meal which had been commanded by the king,  <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> so that by doing this he might be saved from death, and be treated kindly on account of his old friendship with them. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> But making a high resolve, worthy of his years and the dignity of his old age and the grey hairs which he had reached with distinction and his excellent life even from childhood, and moreover according to the holy God-given law, he declared himself quickly, telling them to send him to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hades.html#1">Hades</A>. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> "Such pretence is not worthy of our time of life," he said, "lest many of the young should suppose that Eleazar in his ninetieth year has gone over to an alien religion,  <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> and through my pretence, for the sake of living a brief moment longer, they should be led astray because of me, while I defile and disgrace my old age. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> For even if for the present I should avoid the punishment of men, yet whether I live or die I shall not escape the hands of the Almighty. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> Therefore, by manfully giving up my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> and leave to the young a noble example of how to die a good death willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws." 
<P>When he had said this, he went at once to the rack.  <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> And those who a little before had acted toward him with good will now changed to ill will, because the words he had uttered were in their opinion sheer madness. <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned aloud and said: "It is clear to the Lord in his holy knowledge that, though I might have been saved from death, I am enduring terrible sufferings in my body under this beating, but in my soul I am glad to suffer these things because I fear him." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> So in this way he died, leaving in his death an example of nobility and a memorial of courage, not only to the young but to the great body of his nation.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">1</FONT> It happened also that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawful swine's flesh.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> One of them, acting as their spokesman, said, "What do you intend to ask and learn from us? For we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our fathers." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> The king fell into a rage, and gave orders that pans and cauldrons be heated.  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> These were heated immediately, and he commanded that the tongue of their spokesman be cut out and that they scalp him and cut off his hands and feet, while the rest of the brothers and the mother looked on. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> When he was utterly helpless, the king ordered them to take him to the fire, still breathing, and to fry him in a pan. The smoke from the pan spread widely, but the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, saying, <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> "The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/moses.html#1">Moses</A> declared in his song which bore witness against the people to their faces, when he said, `And he will have compassion on his servants.'" 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> After the first brother had died in this way, they brought forward the second for their sport. They tore off the skin of his head with the hair, and asked him, "Will you eat rather than have your body punished limb by limb?"  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> He replied in the language of his fathers, and said to them, "No." Therefore he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> And when he was at his last breath, he said, "You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> After him, the third was the victim of their sport. When it was demanded, he quickly put out his tongue and courageously stretched forth his hands, <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> and said nobly, "I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again." <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> As a result the king himself and those with him were astonished at the young man's spirit, for he regarded his sufferings as nothing. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> When he too had died, they maltreated and tortured the fourth in the same way.  <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> And when he was near death, he said, "One cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that God gives of being raised again by him. But for you there will be no resurrection to life!" 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> Next they brought forward the fifth and maltreated him.  <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> But he looked at the king, and said, "Because you have authority among men, mortal though you are, you do what you please. But do not think that God has forsaken our people. <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> Keep on, and see how his mighty power will torture you and your descendants!" 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> After him they brought forward the sixth. And when he was about to die, he said, "Do not deceive yourself in vain. For we are suffering these things on our own account, because of our sins against our own God. Therefore astounding things have happened.  <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> But do not think that you will go unpunished for having tried to fight against God!" 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honourable memory. Though she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it with good courage because of her hope in the Lord.  <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> She encouraged each of them in the language of their fathers. Filled with a noble spirit, she fired her woman's reasoning with a man's courage, and said to them, <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> "I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#4">Antiochus</A> felt that he was being treated with contempt, and he was suspicious of her reproachful tone. The youngest brother being still alive, Antiochus not only appealed to him in words, but promised with oaths that he would make him rich and enviable if he would turn from the ways of his fathers, and that he would take him for his friend and entrust him with public affairs.  <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> Since the young man would not listen to him at all, the king called the mother to him and urged her to advise the youth to save himself. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> After much urging on his part, she undertook to persuade her son. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> But, leaning close to him, she spoke in their native tongue as follows, deriding the cruel tyrant: "My son, have pity on me. I carried you nine months in my womb, and nursed you for three years, and have reared you and brought you up to this point in your life, and have taken care of you. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> I beseech you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God's mercy I may get you back again with your brothers." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> While she was still speaking, the young man said, "What are you waiting for? I will not obey the king's command, but I obey the command of the law that was given to our fathers through Moses.  <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> But you, who have contrived all sorts of evil against the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hebrews.html#1">Hebrews</A>, will certainly not escape the hands of God. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> For we are suffering because of our own sins. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> And if our living Lord is angry for a little while, to rebuke and discipline us, he will again be reconciled with his own servants. <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> But you, unholy wretch, you most defiled of all men, do not be elated in vain and puffed up by uncertain hopes, when you raise your hand against the children of heaven. <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> You have not yet escaped the judgment of the almighty, all-seeing God. <FONT CLASS="verse">36</FONT> For our brothers after enduring a brief suffering have drunk of ever-flowing life under God's covenant; but you, by the judgment of God, will receive just punishment for your arrogance. <FONT CLASS="verse">37</FONT> I, like my brothers, give up body and life for the laws of our fathers, appealing to God to show mercy soon to our nation and by afflictions and plagues to make you confess that he alone is God, <FONT CLASS="verse">38</FONT> and through me and my brothers to bring to an end the wrath of the Almighty which has justly fallen on our whole nation." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">39</FONT> The king fell into a rage, and handled him worse than the others, being exasperated at his scorn.  <FONT CLASS="verse">40</FONT> So he died in his integrity, putting his whole trust in the Lord. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">41</FONT> Last of all, the mother died, after her sons.  
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">42</FONT> Let this be enough, then, about the eating of sacrifices and the extreme tortures.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">1</FONT> But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judas.html#1">Judas</A>, who was also called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judas.html#1">Maccabaeus</A>, and his companions secretly entered the villages and summoned their kinsmen and enlisted those who had continued in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jewish</A> faith, and so they gathered about six thousand men.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> They besought the Lord to look upon the people who were oppressed by all, and to have pity on the temple which had been profaned by ungodly men, <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> and to have mercy on the city which was being destroyed and about to be levelled to the ground, and to hearken to the blood that cried out to him, <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> and to remember also the lawless destruction of the innocent babies and the blasphemies committed against his name, and to show his hatred of evil. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> As soon as Maccabaeus got his army organised, the Gentiles could not withstand him, for the wrath of the Lord had turned to mercy.  <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Coming without warning, he would set fire to towns and villages. He captured strategic positions and put to flight not a few of the enemy. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> He found the nights most advantageous for such attacks. And talk of his valour spread everywhere. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> When Philippus saw that the man was gaining ground little by little, and that he was pushing ahead with more frequent successes, he wrote to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemaeus.html#27">Ptolemaeus</A>, the governor of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/coele.html#1">Coele Syria</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phoenicia.html#1">Phoenicia</A>, for aid to the king's government.  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> And Ptolemaeus promptly appointed <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicanor.html#8">Nicanor</A> the son of Patroclus, one of the king's chief friends, and sent him, in command of no fewer than twenty thousand Gentiles of all nations, to wipe out the whole race of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/judaea.html#1">Judaea</A>. He associated with him <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gorgias.html#5">Gorgias</A>, a general and a man of experience in military service. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Nicanor determined to make up for the king the tribute due to the Romans, two thousand talents, by selling the captured <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jews.html#1">Jews</A> into slavery. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> And he immediately sent to the cities on the seacoast, inviting them to buy Jewish slaves and promising to hand over ninety slaves for a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talent</A>, not expecting the judgment from the Almighty that was about to overtake him. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Word came to Judas concerning Nicanor's invasion; and when he told his companions of the arrival of the army,  <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> those who were cowardly and distrustful of God's justice ran off and got away. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Others sold all their remaining property, and at the same time besought the Lord to rescue those who had been sold by the ungodly Nicanor before he ever met them, <FONT CLASS="verse">15</FONT> if not for their own sake, yet for the sake of the covenants made with their fathers, and because he had called them by his holy and glorious name. <FONT CLASS="verse">16</FONT> But Maccabaeus gathered his men together, to the number six thousand, and exhorted them not to be frightened by the enemy and not to fear the great multitude of Gentiles who were wickedly coming against them, but to fight nobly, <FONT CLASS="verse">17</FONT> keeping before their eyes the lawless outrage which the Gentiles had committed against the holy place, and the torture of the derided city, and besides, the overthrow of their ancestral way of life. <FONT CLASS="verse">18</FONT> "For they trust to arms and acts of daring," he said, "but we trust in the Almighty God, who is able with a single nod to strike down those who are coming against us and even the whole world." 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">19</FONT> Moreover, he told them of the times when help came to their ancestors; both the time of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sennacherib.html#1">Sennacherib</A>, when one hundred and eighty-five thousand perished,  <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> and the time of the battle with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/galatia.html#1">Galatians</A> that took place in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/babylonia.html#1">Babylonia</A>, when eight thousand in all went into the affair, with four thousand <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonians</A>; and when the Macedonians were hard pressed, the eight thousand, by the help that came to them from heaven, destroyed one hundred and twenty thousand and took much booty. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">21</FONT> With these words he filled them with good courage and made them ready to die for their laws and their country; then he divided his army into four parts.  <FONT CLASS="verse">22</FONT> He appointed his brothers also, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/simon.html#3">Simon</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/joseph.html#3">Joseph</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jonathan.html#1">Jonathan</A>, each to command a division, putting fifteen hundred men under each. <FONT CLASS="verse">23</FONT> Besides, he appointed Eleazar to read aloud from the holy book, and gave the watchword, "God's help"; then, leading the first division himself, he joined battle with Nicanor. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">24</FONT> With the Almighty as their ally, they slew more than nine thousand of the enemy, and wounded and disabled most of Nicanor's army, and forced them all to flee.  <FONT CLASS="verse">25</FONT> They captured the money of those who had come to buy them as slaves. After pursuing them for some distance, they were obliged to return because the hour was late. <FONT CLASS="verse">26</FONT> For it was the day before the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath">sabbath</A>, and for that reason they did not continue their pursuit. <FONT CLASS="verse">27</FONT> And when they had collected the arms of the enemy and stripped them of their spoils, they kept the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath">sabbath</A>, giving great praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them for that day and allotted it to them as the beginning of mercy. <FONT CLASS="verse">28</FONT> After the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath">sabbath</A> they gave some of the spoils to those who had been tortured and to the widows and orphans, and distributed the rest among themselves and their children. <FONT CLASS="verse">29</FONT> When they had done this, they made common supplication and besought the merciful Lord to be wholly reconciled with his servants. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> In encounters with the forces of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/timotheus.html#8">Timotheus</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/bacchides.html#1">Bacchides</A> they killed more than twenty thousand of them and got possession of some exceedingly high strongholds, and they divided very much plunder, giving to those who had been tortured and to the orphans and widows, and also to the aged, shares equal to their own.  <FONT CLASS="verse">31</FONT> Collecting the arms of the enemy, they stored them all carefully in strategic places, and carried the rest of the spoils to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jerusalem.html#1">Jerusalem</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">32</FONT> They killed the commander of Timotheus's forces, a most unholy man, and one who had greatly troubled the Jews. <FONT CLASS="verse">33</FONT> While they were celebrating the victory in the city of their fathers, they burned those who had set fire to the sacred gates, Callisthenes and some others, who had fled into one little house; so these received the proper recompense for their impiety. 
<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">34</FONT> The thrice-accursed Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews,  <FONT CLASS="verse">35</FONT> having been humbled with the help of the Lord by opponents whom he regarded as of the least account, took off his splendid uniform and made his way alone like a runaway slave across the country till he reached <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antioch.html#1">Antioch</A>, having succeeded chiefly in the destruction of his own army! <FONT CLASS="verse">36</FONT> Thus he who had undertaken to secure tribute for the Romans by the capture of the people of Jerusalem proclaimed that the Jews had a Defender, and that therefore the Jews were invulnerable, because they followed the laws ordained by him.

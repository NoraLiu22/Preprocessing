                                  <p>The <strong>Axe</strong> appears in many forms in heraldic art, coming from both the martial and the craft traditions, indeed someone today would have a hard time telling their <em>common hatchet</em> from a <em>turner&#8217;s axe</em>, but it is likely that those in the middle ages were more familiar with each. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Axe Obviously the axe from a craft tradition may symbolise the holder being a practitioner of that craft, but the axes from a martial background are suggested by Wade to indicate the <em>&#8220;execution of military duty&#8221;</em>.

                                  <p>Heraldry is a human art, by and for people and it is not surprising that people themselves are frequently depicted in arms Understanding Signs &amp; Symbols &#8211; Heraldry, S. Oliver &amp; G. Croton, Quantum, London, 2013, P174. Often these are images of knights and men-at-arms, or individual limbs, such as the <em>&#8220;three armoured right arms argent&#8221;</em> shown in the arms of Armstrong Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 60. As well as the nobility however, we also see both the mundane, ploughmen, fishermen and reapers; and the exotic in the form of club wielding savages and the Moorish or Saracen gentleman with his decorative wreathed turban A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P168. The <strong>boys head</strong> is a typical example of this use of the human figure.</p>

To distinguish it from similar arms, heraldic artists developed a series of decorative edges (obviously these are applied only to the inner edge). <strong>Invected</strong> is a very pleasing decorative pattern, the exact opposite of the decoration known as <em>engrailed</em>. It consists of a series of small arcs joined side by side, with points inwards, (i.e. a series of outward &#8220;bulges&#8221;). Wade suggests that these closely related decorative edges can be taken to signify <em>&#8220;earth or land&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P40.</p>

A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Gobony is quite unusual in the world of heraldic art. Where most colours, patterns and furs can be applied more or less to any item on the shield, <em>compony</em> is specifically a patterning for the major, so called <em>ordinaries</em> &#8211; the larger charges such as the <em>fess</em>, <em>pale</em> and <em>bordure</em>. The large charge is split into a single series of large, square sections and colour alternately of two tinctures Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 33. There is another variant, with two lines of squares known as <em>counter compony</em> (or sometimes even <em>compony-counter-compony</em>. Wade, the noted heraldic author groups <em>compony</em> with the other &#8220;square&#8221; objects as symbols of <em>&#8220;Constancy&#8221;</em>.</p>

An early author, Guilllim seeks to associate this decoration with fire A Display of Heraldry, J. Guillim, Blome, London, 1679, P39, and one can see the resemblance to flames. The visual effect is quite striking, an good example being the arms of DUNHAM (Lincolnshire), which are <em>Azure, a chief indented or</em>.</p>

Wade suggests that the use of this decoration represents <em>&#8220;difficulties that have been encountered&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W.

One example of this is<strong>Dancettee</strong> (sometimes spelled <em>dancetty</em> or <em>dancy</em>) , a bold, zig-zag pattern, perhaps the most distinctive of these patterned edges. Wade, quoting Guillim suggests that <em>dancettee</em> be attributed to mean water, in the same fashion as <em>undy</em> or <em>wavy</em>, and one can understand this allusion.</p>

An edge which is decorated like the top of a castle wall is said to be <strong>embattled</strong>, or sometimes <strong>crenelle</strong>, from the original French. (In castle building terminology the parts of the wall that stick up are known as <em>merlons</em>, and the resulting gaps as <em>crenels</em>). A whole sub-section of heraldic terminology has sprung up to describe whether these crennellations appear on which edges, whether they line up or alternate, have additional steps or rounded tops. The interested reader is directed to the reference for the full set! A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Embattled For obvious reasons, use of this decoration is to be associated with castles and fortified towns, an early authority, Guillim suggest also some association with fire, but with out clear reason The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41. In all, this is one of the more common, and most effective and appropriate of the decorative edges.</p>

The term <strong>bretesse</strong> refers to an edge drawn as if it were the battlements of a castle. Indeed, it is one of several, very specific terms which describes exactly how the battlements are to be drawn Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 44. Normally, if an <em>ordinary</em>, such as a <em>fesse</em> or <em>bend</em> is drawn embattled then the battlements appear only on the upper edge, however the use her of <em>counter-embattled</em> tells us that the lower edge should be likewise treated. In all cases, the use of this decoration, according to Wade, is clearly to be associated with fortifications such as castles and walled towns. The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W.

Indeed, so important is the bend that it was the subject of one of the earliest cases before the English Court of Chivalry; the famous case of 1390, <em>Scrope vs Grosvenor</em> had to decide which family were the rightful owners of <em>Azure, a bend or</em> (A blue shield, with yellow bend).

Wade, quoting Guillim suggests that <em>dancettee</em> be attributed to mean water, in the same fashion as <em>undy</em> or <em>wavy</em>, and one can understand this allusion.</p>

The <strong>cross voided</strong> actually takes a slightly different approach, in which only the outline of the cross is shown, the background of the shield showing through. Any shape of cross may be <em>voided</em>, to give yet further variation on this popular charge.</p>

Of the decorative edges <strong>raguly</strong> can be at first hard to identify, but once we understand that it arises from an old word <em>raggguled</em> meaning &#8220;chopped off&#8221;. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Raguly we can see that the curious shapes are intended to represent boughs lopped off a tree trunk. (This is also the origin of the term &#8220;ragged staff&#8221; see so frequently with a bear in Heraldry). Wade suggests that the use of this decoration represents <em>&#8220;difficulties that have been encountered&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41, and we can perhaps understand that the &#8220;hacked path&#8221; resulting shows that these difficulties have been overcome.</p>

Mediaeval Europe was a deeply religious and Christian and many of the nobility wanted to show their devotion by adopting the symbol of the cross as part of the arms. Since no two arms could be identical there arose many variants of the cross, typically involving patterning along the edges Understanding Signs &amp; Symbols &#8211; Heraldry, S. Oliver &amp; G. Croton, Quantum, London, 2013, P67, or fanciful, decorative endings to the arms of the cross A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P128. The <strong>cross moline</strong> is typical of these whereby each arm of the cross expands and curves outwards, reminscent of the <em>fer-de-moline</em> from which it gets its name.  These cross variations are probably largely for decorative effect, and to differentiate the arms from similar ones and hence their significance is that of the Christian cross itself.</p>

Mediaeval Europe was a deeply religious and Christian and many of the nobility wanted to show their devotion by adopting the symbol of the cross as part of the arms. Since no two arms could be identical there arose many variants of the cross, the <strong>cross masculy</strong> is a particularly interesting variant. The <em>mascle</em> is a diamond shaped charge, actually a <em>lozenge voided</em> (with the background showing through). Hence the <em>cross masculy</em> is a cross made up of a number of mascles, touching at the outer points. A striking and effective charge in whatever colour is chosen.</p>

Croton, Quantum, London, 2013, P67. The pattern <strong>engrailed</strong> is a series of scalloped indentations with the points facing outwards &#8211; and should not be confused with <strong>invected</strong>, which has the points facing inwards! Wade believes that both of these indented forms represent <em>&#8220;earth or land&#8221;</em>, and one perhaps can indeed see the furrowed earth embodied in them.</p>

An edge which is decorated like the top of a castle wall is said to be <strong>embattled</strong>, or sometimes <strong>crenelle</strong>, from the original French. (In castle building terminology the parts of the wall that stick up are known as <em>merlons</em>, and the resulting gaps as <em>crenels</em>). A whole sub-section of heraldic terminology has sprung up to describe whether these crennellations appear on which edges, whether they line up or alternate, have additional steps or rounded tops. The interested reader is directed to the reference for the full set! A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Embattled For obvious reasons, use of this decoration is to be associated with castles and fortified towns, an early authority, Guillim suggest also some association with fire, but with out clear reason The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41. In all, this is one of the more common, and most effective and appropriate of the decorative edges.</p>

                                  <p>The middle ages was a deeply religious time, and since the bulk of heraldry was developed in countries that were almost entirely Christian it is no surprise that religious and church symbology was widely adopted for use in coats of arms. The <strong>crosier</strong> Is a typical such usage, being a staff carried by a Bishop in ceremony. As well the adoption of religious imagery for the nobility, the Church itself has made extensive use of arms, such Ecclesiastical Heraldry A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P600 is a major subject in its own right, somewhat less &#8220;martial&#8221; than that of the nobility and with its own terms and special meanings.</p>

Many of the orders of nobility across Europe were entitled to wear crowns and coronets, Dukes, Earls, Viscounts and Barons in England each had their own distinctive headwear A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P350. The <strong>civic crown</strong> is an example of this. It may also be the case that a crown is added to an existing coat of arms as an <em>augmentation</em> in recognition of some service to a King Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 187.</p>

The <strong>cinquefoil</strong> is also of this type, being drawn, at least a little, realistically and often to very pleasing effect. It is shown as five-petalled flower, each petal quite rounded but with a distinct tip. It is sometimes <em>pierced</em> with a hole in the centre and usually appears on its own, without any leaves. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Cinquefoil It has no fixed colour but can appear in any of the available heraldic tinctures.</p>

It is normally marked by a straight line of partition, but for artistic effect, and for clarity of difference between coats of arms, heralds have developed a series of decorative patterns to be used along the edge. The pattern <strong>engrailed</strong> is a series of scalloped indentations with the points facing outwards &#8211; and should not be confused with <strong>invected</strong>, which has the points facing inwards! Wade believes that both of these indented forms represent <em>&#8220;earth or land&#8221;</em>, and one perhaps can indeed see the furrowed earth embodied in them.</p>

Purists might argue that the French variant <em>denché</em> Is not the same, being of larger size and with the points being 90º, but there is much variation in actual practice so the difference is perhaps not that meaningful. Wade, quoting Guillim suggests that <em>dancettee</em> be attributed to mean water, in the same fashion as <em>undy</em> or <em>wavy</em>, and one can understand this allusion.</p>

The edge pattern <strong>engrailed</strong> is a series of scalloped indentations with the points facing outwards &#8211; and should not be confused with <strong>invected</strong>, which has the points facing inwards! Wade believes that both of these indented forms represent <em>&#8220;earth or land&#8221;</em>, and one perhaps can indeed see the furrowed earth embodied in them.</p>

Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Chevron. It is a popular feature, visually very striking and hence developed to have various decorative edges applied to distinguish otherwise identical coats of arms. An edge which is decorated like the top of a castle wall is said to be <strong>embattled</strong>, or sometimes <strong>crenelle</strong>, from the original French. (In castle building terminology the parts of the wall that stick up are known as <em>merlons</em>, and the resulting gaps as <em>crenels</em>). A whole sub-section of heraldic terminology has sprung up to describe whether these crennellations appear on which edges, whether they line up or alternate, have additional steps or rounded tops. The interested reader is directed to the reference for the full set! A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Embattled For obvious reasons, use of this decoration is to be associated with castles and fortified towns, an early authority, Guillim suggest also some association with fire, but with out clear reason The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41. In all, this is one of the more common, and most effective and appropriate of the decorative edges.</p>

It is a popular feature, visually very striking and hence developed to have various decorative edges applied to distinguish otherwise identical coats of arms. <strong>Dancettee</strong> (sometimes spelled <em>dancetty</em> or <em>dancy</em>) is a bold, zig-zag pattern, perhaps the most distinctive of the patterned edges. Purists might argue that the French variant <em>denché</em> Is not the same, being of larger size and with the points being 90º, but there is much variation in actual practice so the difference is perhaps not that meaningful. Wade, quoting Guillim suggests that <em>dancettee</em> be attributed to mean water, in the same fashion as <em>undy</em> or <em>wavy</em>, and one can understand this allusion.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Laurel</strong> appears in several forms in heraldry, beginning with the whole bush. through <strong>branches</strong>, <strong>sprigs</strong> and <strong>leaves</strong>. Wade, the noted heraldic author, reckons that the leaves represent <em>&#8220;tokens of peace and quietness&#8221;</em>, whilst branches, especially in pairs are in memory of some great triumph. The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P125. The other major appearance of the laurel is in the form of the <strong>laurel wreath</strong>, also known as a <strong>chaplet</strong>. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Laurel. This was worn as a token of victory by Roman emporers, and Wade futher suggests that a similar purpose is adopted in heraldic art.</p>

An early example is SUTTON,  Bishop of Lincoln in the 13th century,  who bore <em>&#8220;argent a canton sable&#8221;</em>. It occupies less space than a <em>quarter</em> and hence is sometimes added to an existing shield to <em>difference</em> branches of the same family, or, when a charge is added to it, to indicate some honour has been recieved A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Canton. Wade remarks, that, in common with all square features can be associated with the virtue of<em>&#8220;constancy&#8221;</em>.</p>

Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P301. The <strong>caduceus</strong> is a typical example, adopted into the catalogue of heraldry and bringing with it its traditional meaning as the <em>rod of Mercury</em>, it usually is only to be found in the crest and not on the shield.

                                  <p>Europe in the middle ages was still a largely agrarian society, and the wealth of the nobility resided in their estates and land. Since most people still lived and worked on the land they would find farm implements instantly recognisable, (an important feature for a coat of arms), even if they seem obscure to us today, the <em>garb</em> Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 86 might fall into this category. The <strong>dungfork</strong> is a typical example of farming implements and represents that farming heritage.</p>

A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Escutcheon There is no particular significance that can accorded to the escutcheon itself, but attention should be paid to the colour and devices that are borne upon it. The escutcheon may also be added to an existing coat of arms either as recognition of some additional honour (an <em>escutcheon of augmentation&#8221;</em>) or in the case where arms that are already quartered are to be combined an escutcheon with the new arms may be placed overall (an <em>&#8220;escutcheon of pretence&#8221;</em>).

In appearance it resembles the &#8220;boss&#8221; at the centre of a shield and the strengthening rods radiating from it, and this has become its recognised heraldic form. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Escarboucle. Wade refers to its original meaning as a <em>&#8220;symbol of supremacy&#8221;</em>.

                                  <p>The <strong>escallop</strong>occurs often in arms, represented as the outside of the shell, sometimes &#8220;fluted&#8221; of a different colour A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Escallop. It has been part of heraldic tradition almost from the beginning of the art, Henry III of England awarded <em>Gules, 3 escallopes argent</em> to Herbert de CHAMBERLEYNE in the 13th century, and it is present in the heraldry of almost all countries A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P299. It is believed that they were adopted as badges of those going to the Holy Land and can be found in the arms of many a crusading family. Hence Wade&#8217;s suggested association of the scallop with those that <em>&#8220;complete long journeys to far countries&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W.

Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P39. The ermine pattern is white with, typically, a three dots and a dart grouping representing the tail of the furred creature.Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 28. <strong>Ermines</strong> is a variant in which the field is <em>sable</em> (black) and the ermine tails <em>argent</em> (white), the inverse of the normal pattern.</p>

Of the decorative edges <strong>raguly</strong> can be at first hard to identify, but once we understand that it arises from an old word <em>raggguled</em> meaning &#8220;chopped off&#8221;. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Raguly we can see that the curious shapes are intended to represent boughs lopped off a tree trunk. (This is also the origin of the term &#8220;ragged staff&#8221; see so frequently with a bear in Heraldry). Wade suggests that the use of this decoration represents <em>&#8220;difficulties that have been encountered&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41, and we can perhaps understand that the &#8220;hacked path&#8221; resulting shows that these difficulties have been overcome.</p>

A special form, the <strong>fesse lozengy</strong> is made up of single coloured lozenge (diamond) shapes placed vertically, side by side across the field, where the fesse would normally be. Arguably, this should really be described as <em>so-many lozenges conjoined in fess</em>, to avoid confusion with the patterning <em>lozengy</em>, which is a treatment over the whole field of alternating coloured diamond shapes Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 321. Whatever the terminology this is a striking addition to any coat of arms, and the square-like form has encouraged Wade, the noted heraldic author to associate its use with <em>Constancy…verity and probity&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P100.</p>

An early author, Guilllim seeks to associate this decoration with fire A Display of Heraldry, J. Guillim, Blome, London, 1679, P39, and one can see the resemblance to flames. The visual effect is quite striking, an good example being the arms of DUNHAM (Lincolnshire), which are <em>Azure, a chief indented or</em>.</p>

An edge which is decorated like the top of a castle wall is said to be <strong>embattled</strong>, or sometimes <strong>crenelle</strong>, from the original French. (In castle building terminology the parts of the wall that stick up are known as <em>merlons</em>, and the resulting gaps as <em>crenels</em>). A whole sub-section of heraldic terminology has sprung up to describe whether these crennellations appear on which edges, whether they line up or alternate, have additional steps or rounded tops. The interested reader is directed to the reference for the full set! A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Embattled For obvious reasons, use of this decoration is to be associated with castles and fortified towns, an early authority, Guillim suggest also some association with fire, but with out clear reason The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41. In all, this is one of the more common, and most effective and appropriate of the decorative edges.</p>

                                  <p>The <strong>fesse</strong> is a broad horizontal band across the centre of the shield, in very ancient times it was said to occupy one third of the area height of the shield A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P117, however it soon became somewhat narrower. This created an opportunity to add decorative edging to the band, of many forms, and to very pleasing artisitic effect, at least close up &#8211; it must be admitted that at distance some of the forms are hard to distinguish! The term <strong>counter-embattled</strong> refers to an edge drawn as if it were the battlements of a castle. Indeed, it is one of several, very specific terms which describes exactly how the battlements are to be drawn Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 44. Normally, if an <em>ordinary</em>, such as a <em>fesse</em> or <em>bend</em> is drawn embattled then the battlements appear only on the upper edge, however the use her of <em>counter-embattled</em> tells us that the lower edge should be likewise treated. In all cases, the use of this decoration, according to Wade, is clearly to be associated with fortifications such as castles and walled towns. The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41</p>

An edge which is decorated like the top of a castle wall is said to be <strong>embattled</strong>, or sometimes <strong>crenelle</strong>, from the original French. (In castle building terminology the parts of the wall that stick up are known as <em>merlons</em>, and the resulting gaps as <em>crenels</em>). A whole sub-section of heraldic terminology has sprung up to describe whether these crennellations appear on which edges, whether they line up or alternate, have additional steps or rounded tops. The interested reader is directed to the reference for the full set! A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Embattled For obvious reasons, use of this decoration is to be associated with castles and fortified towns, an early authority, Guillim suggest also some association with fire, but with out clear reason The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41. In all, this is one of the more common, and most effective and appropriate of the decorative edges.</p>

                                  <p>The <strong>hunting horn</strong>, or <strong>bugle horn</strong> has a distinctive shape, being curved almost into a semi-circle, it can be decorated with bands of a different colour and typically hangs from a string, also coloured. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:hunting horn. Apart from its obvious reference to the pursuit of hunting, it has also been used in allusion to the name of the holderr (HUNTER of Hunterston) and Woowward suggests it is also associated with those who have rights or obligations to the forest.

It is usually depicted in a lifelike fashion and can be <em>stringed</em> of a different colour for a more pleasing effect. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H.

Originally the Badge of Ulster, the Province of Northern Ireland, it has come to be used as an addition to existing arms, in an escutcheon (small shield) or canton (small square) to indicate that the holder is also a Baronet.Heraldry Historical and Popular, Charles Boutell, 1864 P56</p>

                                  <p>Europe in the middle ages was still a largely agrarian society, and the wealth of the nobility resided in their estates and land. Since most people still lived and worked on the land they would find farm implements instantly recognisable, (an important feature for a coat of arms), even if they seem obscure to us today, the <em>garb</em> Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 86 might fall into this category. The <strong>yoke</strong> is a typical example of farming features that speak of a long heritage in the countryside, being the device used to attach oxen or horses to the plough.</p>

Often these are images of knights and men-at-arms, or individual limbs, such as the <em>&#8220;three armoured right arms argent&#8221;</em> shown in the arms of Armstrong Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P.

Guillim, Blome, London, 1679, P39, and one can see the resemblance to flames. The visual effect is quite striking, an good example being the arms of DUNHAM (Lincolnshire), which are <em>Azure, a chief indented or</em>.</p>

Often these are images of knights and men-at-arms, or individual limbs, such as the <em>&#8220;three armoured right arms argent&#8221;</em> shown in the arms of Armstrong Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 60.

Hence, simple geometric shapes are often used for this purpose A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P146 One of the simplest such shapes is the plain circle, known to heralds as the <em>roundle</em>. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Roundle So popular is this charge that a shorthand has arisen for roundles of a particular colour and <strong>torteau</strong> is a <em>roundle gules</em>, or red. (We must be careful however not to confuse this with the word in French heraldry, in which <em>torteau</em> means <em>roundle</em> and must have the colour specified.) Most authorities agree that the English usage signifies the <em>&#8220;Manchet cake&#8221;</em> or communion wafer and thus is a symbol of religious allegiance. </p>

Mediaeval Europe was a deeply religious and Christian and many of the nobility wanted to show their devotion by adopting the symbol of the cross as part of the arms. Since no two arms could be identical there arose many variants of the cross, the <strong>latin</strong> or <strong>long cross</strong> is an example of this, being named for the extended lower limb of the cross, which is placed clearly separated from the edges of the shield.</p>

Woodward, W &amp; A.K Johnston, Edinburgh &amp; London, 1896, P45 .The great authority on heraldic symbology, Wade, points out the high place that the lion holds in heraldry, <em>&#8220;as the emblem of deathless courage&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P60, a sentiment echoed equally today.The phrase <strong>couchant</strong> indicates a sleeping lion, though no less a fearsome creature for being so!

Parker, Oxford, 1847, P141, it still sometimes appears in a more pictorial form as the &#8220;lily of the garden&#8221;. The <strong>lily</strong> is also of this type, being drawn, at least a little, realistically and often to very pleasing effect.</p>

Oliver &amp; G. Croton, Quantum, London, 2013, P174. Often these are images of knights and men-at-arms, or individual limbs, such as the <em>&#8220;three armoured right arms argent&#8221;</em> shown in the arms of Armstrong Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 60.

As heraldry developed a whole menagerie of imagined creatures Understanding Signs &amp; Symbols &#8211; Heraldry, S. Oliver &amp; G. Croton, Quantum, London, 2013, P164 came into being, and their various representations became more or less standardised in form and appearance.

The <em>saltire</em> is obviously closely related to the Cross, and Wade in his work on Heraldic Symbology suggests additionally that it alludes to <em>&#8220;Resolution&#8221;</em>, whilst Guillim, an even more ancient writer, somewhat fancifully argues that it is awarded to those who have succesfully scaled the walls of towns!

In order to allow for clear differences between similar arms, heralds designed a series of decorative edges, not all of them are appropriate for the saltire (because of the interior angles) but those are suitable can be very effective artistically. The pattern <strong>engrailed</strong> works well here. It is a series of scalloped indentations with the points facing outwards &#8211; and should not be confused with <strong>invected</strong>, which has the points facing inwards! Wade believes that both of these indented forms represent <em>&#8220;earth or land&#8221;</em>, and one perhaps can indeed see the furrowed earth embodied in them.</p>

Of the decorative edges <strong>raguly</strong> can be at first hard to identify, but once we understand that it arises from an old word <em>raggguled</em> meaning &#8220;chopped off&#8221;. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Raguly we can see that the curious shapes are intended to represent boughs lopped off a tree trunk. (This is also the origin of the term &#8220;ragged staff&#8221; see so frequently with a bear in Heraldry). Wade suggests that the use of this decoration represents <em>&#8220;difficulties that have been encountered&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41, and we can perhaps understand that the &#8220;hacked path&#8221; resulting shows that these difficulties have been overcome.</p>

A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H.

Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 89. Indeed, the sheer variety of different <em>swords</em> A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1847, P302 can be bewildering and expaining the difference between a <em>scimitar</em> and a <em>falchion</em> is perhaps best left to the expert! If a charge is described just as a simple <strong>sword</strong> then it will have a straight blade and cross handle, that may be of a different colour, and, unless specified, points upwards. Wade, quoting the earlier writer Guillim, signifies the use of the sword as representing <em>&#8220;Government and Justice&#8221;</em>.</p>

Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Cat It can appear in a variety of poses, similar to those of its larger relative, the <em>lion</em>, although we should be careful of stretching any meanings associated with the king of the beasts to their smaller brethren. Perhaps only an affinity with hills and the mountain country is intended.</p>

We also find individual items of clothing used as <em>charges</em> in a coat of arms, and <strong>maunch</strong> is a good example of this, representing a loose sleeve. Sometimes these items are drawn in a somewhat stylised fashion, not always obvious as to what it represents. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Maunch Wade suggests that its use came from a role in the tournament in which a part of clothing or some other trinked was given as a token to knights in combat by their supporters.

A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Martlet. Over time the image has become quite stylised, without visible legs or distinctive feathers. Wade suggests that this representation arises from <em>&#8220;the appearance of the bird of paradise to ancient travellers&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P79. Other bird species may be named in coats of arms (<em>cornish chough</em> is a frequent example) but in actual execution their appearance is often indistinguishable from the martlet.</p>

                                  <p>The <strong>martlett</strong> is by far the most common bird to appear in British Heraldry, perhaps only equalled by the <em>eagle</em>, however it is not a species ever to be found in an ornithologists handbook! The word itself is though to have come from the French word <em>merlette</em>, the female blackbird and itself a similar type of charge used in French Heraldry. A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Martlet. Over time the image has become quite stylised, without visible legs or distinctive feathers. Wade suggests that this representation arises from <em>&#8220;the appearance of the bird of paradise to ancient travellers&#8221;</em> The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P79. Other bird species may be named in coats of arms (<em>cornish chough</em> is a frequent example) but in actual execution their appearance is often indistinguishable from the martlet.</p>

                                  <p>The middle ages was a deeply religious time, and since the bulk of heraldry was developed in countries that were almost entirely Christian it is no surprise that religious and church symbology was widely adopted for use in coats of arms. The <strong>orb</strong> Is a typical such usage. As well the adoption of religious imagery for the nobility, the Church itself has made extensive use of arms, such Ecclesiastical Heraldry A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P600 is a major subject in its own right, somewhat less &#8220;martial&#8221; than that of the nobility and with its own terms and special meanings.</p>

Often these are images of knights and men-at-arms, or individual limbs, such as the <em>&#8220;three armoured right arms argent&#8221;</em> shown in the arms of Armstrong Boutell&#8217;s Heraldry, J.P. Brooke-Little, Warne, (revised Edition) London 1970, P 60. As well as the nobility however, we also see both the mundane, ploughmen, fishermen and reapers; and the exotic in the form of club wielding savages and the Moorish or Saracen gentleman with his decorative wreathed turban A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A.C. Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P168. The <strong>old mans head</strong> is a typical example of this use of the human figure.</p>

A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Roundle So popular is this charge that a shorthand has arisen for roundles of a particular colour and <strong>pellet</strong> is a <em>roundle sable</em>, or black. It is also known as an <em>ogress</em> or <em>gunstone</em>. Most authorities agree that the English usage signifies the <em>&#8220;Manchet cake&#8221;</em> or communion wafer and thus is a symbol of religious allegiance. </p>

                                  <p>A term probably unfamiliar to many readers, <strong>proboscis</strong> is a term often found in the heraldry of continental Europe and represents the trunk of an elephant. They are exclusively found in pairs, and only in the crest above the shield in a full achievement of arms. The mouth may be a different colour, and in some cases may hold objects such as ostrich feathers. Little is actually known about their origin or meaning, an interesting mystery for future heraldic scholars to address.</p>

There is some argument as to the origin, Wade suggests some similarity with the meaning of &#8220;pile&#8221; in construction (a foundation) and hence that the shape could be adopted by those who have demonstrated some ability in the building trade The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P48. An earlier writer, Guillim, perhaps more plausibly suggested that the shape echoes those of a pennant or triangular flag A Display of Heraldry, J. Guillim, Blome, London, 1679, P52 The shape is quite distinctive however and became popular, leading to many embellishments to distinguish it from its close fellows, with multiple piles meeting at various points, starting from various edges and with additional decoration, leading to potentially quite complex descriptions!</p>

A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Party. An edge which is decorated like the top of a castle wall is said to be <strong>embattled</strong>, or sometimes <strong>crenelle</strong>, from the original French. (In castle building terminology the parts of the wall that stick up are known as <em>merlons</em>, and the resulting gaps as <em>crenels</em>). A whole sub-section of heraldic terminology has sprung up to describe whether these crennellations appear on which edges, whether they line up or alternate, have additional steps or rounded tops. The interested reader is directed to the reference for the full set! A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Embattled For obvious reasons, use of this decoration is to be associated with castles and fortified towns, an early authority, Guillim suggest also some association with fire, but with out clear reason The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W.

A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Party. An edge which is decorated like the top of a castle wall is said to be <strong>embattled</strong>, or sometimes <strong>crenelle</strong>, from the original French. (In castle building terminology the parts of the wall that stick up are known as <em>merlons</em>, and the resulting gaps as <em>crenels</em>). A whole sub-section of heraldic terminology has sprung up to describe whether these crennellations appear on which edges, whether they line up or alternate, have additional steps or rounded tops. The interested reader is directed to the reference for the full set! A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1894, Entry:Embattled For obvious reasons, use of this decoration is to be associated with castles and fortified towns, an early authority, Guillim suggest also some association with fire, but with out clear reason The Symbolisms of Heraldry, W. Cecil Wade, George Redway, London, 1898 P41. In all, this is one of the more common, and most effective and appropriate of the decorative edges.</p>

It is also known as an <em>ogress</em> or <em>gunstone</em>. Most authorities agree that the English usage signifies the <em>&#8220;Manchet cake&#8221;</em> or communion wafer and thus is a symbol of religious allegiance. </p>

Whilst the <em>fleur-de-lys</em>, the French &#8220;Flower of the Lily&#8221; may have become stylised almost beyond recognition A Glossary of Terms used in British Heraldry, J.H. Parker, Oxford, 1847, P141, it still sometimes appears in a more pictorial form as the &#8220;lily of the garden&#8221;. The <strong>pansey</strong> is also of this type, being drawn, at least a little, realistically and often to very pleasing effect.</p>

Fox-Davies, Bonanza (re-print of 1909 Edition), New York, 1978, P191 are perhaps one of the most common sights on coats of arms, especially animals of European origin. The <strong>rat</strong> Is a typical example of these and certainly no negative connotations should be taken from its appearance, it is a cunning and hardy creature!</p>

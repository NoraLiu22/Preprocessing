When Dickens wrote in 1859 "It was the worst of
times, it was the
best of times" (<a href="../../../authors/dickens/2cities/index.html"><span class="book">A Tale of Two Cities</span></a>, Chapter
One, Book One, "The Period"), he could easily have been commenting on the period of the early 1840s, which began &mdash; if one may judge from the illustrations in the Extra Christmas
Supplements of <span class="book">The Illustrated London News</span>
&mdash; with a burst of confidence in the future and nostalgia for the Christmas
traditions of the eighteenth century and quickly deteriorated into the "Hungry Forties" that serve as
the background for the first two <a href="../../../authors/dickens/xmas/index.html">Christmas Books</a>, <a href="../../../authors/dickens/xmas/pva13.html"><span class="book">A Christmas
Carol</span></a> and <a href="../../../authors/dickens/xmas/chimes2.html"><span class="book">The Chimes</span></a>. London, that
metropolis that
<span class="book">The Illustrated London News</span> proclaimed in
its initial Christmas
Supplement "The City of the World," with a supremely comfortable
British lion supine
against the great dome of St. Paul's and the Houses of Parliament on
the Thames, within
a year was having to open gender-segregated shelters for the destitute
as unemployment
soared.</p>

<p>The general jollity of Kenny Meadows' full folio page "A Merry
Christmas and a
Happy New Year" (20 Dec. 1845) and Alfred Crowquill's illustration of
the Spirit of
Old Christmas (1843), anticipating the formulation of Father Christmas
in the coming
decade, is undercut by the stark misery of the London refuges
("wards") for the indigent
and unemployed. "A Christmas 'At Home'" and the Eliza Cook song "An
English Christmas
at Home" (1845) celebrate the reunion of an upper-middle class family
around the dinner
table, but there is not even smoking permitted into the shelters which
divide the men
from their wives and children. In its positive images <span
class="book">The Illustrated
London News</span> celebrates throughout these Christmases of the
Hungry Forties an
uncharacteristic superfluity and conviviality. Even such realistic
pieces as <a href="3.html">"Prize
Meat"</a> showing that some families in the 1840s enjoyed comfortable
affluence while others
huddled under London's bridges and in the wards of the Union poor houses.</p>

<p>Now, observe the starkly contrasting scenes in urban "refuges" for
men and women of the
lower classes. In "Refuge for the Destitute &mdash; Ward for Females,"
no food is evident,
but a more fuel efficient source of heat &mdash; a furnace, rear
centre, fenced off
&mdash; renders the warehouse for the surplus population at least
habitable, its metal
chimney running through the hall to spread the heat further, but
contributing to the
factory-like quality of the cavernous dormitory. Instead of the
elegant taper in the
former illustration, a gas lamp (left rear) provides illumination,
assisted in daylight
hours by the partially boarded up windows to the left. Only two
children (lower left) are
evident in a room with twenty-two adults, six of whom are sleeping in
the narrow
institutional boxes to the right, their shawls hanging above them. The
only decoration
provided the bare wooden beams of the hospice is the prominent sign prohibiting
smoking.</p>

<p>Conditions for indigent males are no better. In "Refuge for the
Destitute &mdash; The
Male Ward," of the thirty-two figures in the shelter perhaps five are
children, but again
none of these is active or even individualised. Aside from the absence
of sleeping boxes,
this cavernous space resembles that for the females: the same gigantic
beams, the same
kind of furnace, the same type of gassolier, the same admonition
against smoking &mdash;
and the same air of lassitude and apathy. The general presence of hay
for bedding,
including large bales stored upstairs, and the greater number of
occupants are the only
distinguishing features as the disastrous year of 1843 closes upon
London's mean streets.</p>

<p class="one">Frederic G. Kitton (1899) has noted that, although limited, Felix Octavius 
Carr Darley's frontispieces for Dickens has made him "Perhaps the best of Dickens's American 
illustrators" (223), rivalling the work of fellow <span class="book">Harper's</span> 
illustrator <a href="../mclenan/index.html">John McLenan</a> and Ticknor Fields house 
artist <a href="../eytinge/index.html">Sol Eytinge, Jr.</a> in the study of Dickens's 
characters. Some ten years younger than the British author whose works he illustrated in 
the fifty-five volume so-called "Household Edition" for New York publisher James G. 
Gregory, Philadelphia-born artist Felix Octavius Carr Darley was recognized in his era as 
one of the chief illustrators of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 
Washington Irving, and Edgar Allen Poe, although he also illustrated such lesser American 
writers as Mary Maples Dodge, George Lippard, Donald Grant Mitchell, Clement Clarke 
Moore, Frances Parkman, and Harriet Beecher Stowe.</p>

<p>The son of an English actor, Darley, a skilled draughtsman, did large-scale genre 
prints such as <span class="illustration">The Wedding Procession</span> and <span 
class="illustration">The Village Blacksmith</span>, as well as historical subjects such 
as <span class="illustration">Washington's Entry into New York</span> (from Washington 
Irving's 1860 five-volume <span class="book">The Life of George Washington</span>, G. P. 
Putnam, 1862). After moving to New York City in 1848, he became a house artist for 
<a href="../../../periodicals/harpers/index.html"><span class="book">Harper's Weekly: A 
Journal of Civilization</span></a> from its founding, supplying wood-engravings for the 
periodical, but lithographs and photogravure prints for such series as the complete works 
of James Fenimore Cooper (1859-1861), for which, prior to undertaking Dickens, Darley had 
executed more than five hundred illustrations. His "Household Edition" Dickens 
illustrations were  subsequently reproduced in Houghton Mifflin's Standard Library 
Edition in thirty-two volumes (Boston, 1894). Darley also provided six plates for <span 
class="book">Children from Dickens's Novels</span> and eight photogravures for the 
Imperial Edition of Dickens's works, issued in considerable numbers by Estes and Lauriat, 
Boston. Leaving New York City in 1859 with his bride, he took up residence at Darley 
House in Clayton, Delaware, where Charles Dickens visited him while on his second reading 
tour of the United States in 1867. Although he died in Clayton on 27 March 1888, Felix 
Octavius Carr Darley is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His 
best-known picture, often reproduced, remains <span class="illustration">A Visit from 
Saint Nicholas</span> for the 1862 Christmas book of the same name by Clement Clarke 
Moore.</p>

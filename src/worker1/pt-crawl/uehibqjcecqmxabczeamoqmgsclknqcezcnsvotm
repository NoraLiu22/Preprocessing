To paraphrase Virgil “the Turk” Sollozzo from <i>The Godfather</i>, the Democrats, with all due respect, had been slipping. Twenty years ago, could any organization as stone-cold crazy as the Tea Party have gotten to them? The staggering defeats that Democrats sustained, at every level of government, in the midterm elections of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/1994-midterm-Elections-616578" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1994</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131039717" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2010</a>, and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/2014-midterm-election-turnout-lowest-in-70-years/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2014</a> have now reduced them to the largely impotent, makeshift, regional party they were from the Civil War all the way to the Great Depression.</span></p><p><span class="s1">That string of unrelenting electoral catastrophes should have tipped us off that there was something deeply, alarmingly wrong at the core of the party. Losses of that magnitude, over that period of time, are like a bright red dashboard light you’ve never noticed before that suddenly starts flashing insistently. Accompanied by a shrill beeping sound. And a voice repeating, “Warning, warning!” And a plume of smoke pouring from under your hood.</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width ad-container"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span class="s1">Yet the party elites drove blithely on, chatting on their cell phones about their demographic advantages and the imminent demise of the Republican Party, until the air bags had deployed, the steering wheel had come off in their hands, and the rims of their tireless wheels were grinding sparks off the curbside. At this point, there’s no retooling this burnt-out Chevy Cruze into a vehicle still capable of going coast-to-coast.</span></p><figure class="article-embed image-embed pull-left" contenteditable="false"><img src="//images.newrepublic.com/aeffbe3cdc2c2b2f40aa484b965f910d968c7a75.png?w=800" data-serialized="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;8200acba-5dd2-4a18-b573-a2f232b92467&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;aeffbe3cdc2c2b2f40aa484b965f910d968c7a75&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1600,&quot;height&quot;:1807,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;PNG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/aeffbe3cdc2c2b2f40aa484b965f910d968c7a75.png&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}" width="800"></figure><p><span class="s1">This letter is not intended as one more <i>postmortem</i> on what went wrong: on how the media should have done a better job, or how Hillary Clinton was a bad, bad, terribly bad candidate, the worstest candidate that ever was. Granted, it was Clintonism as a political philosophy, as practiced not only by both Clintons but also by President Obama and many others, that put the final stake in the heart of the Democratic Party as a national entity. The Clintonist project of taking the oldest and most diverse political coalition on earth—one organized around liberal economic principles that had held it together for generations—and re-centering it around conservative economic ideas and a hodgepodge of <i>social</i> ideas that nobody could agree on, was probably the worst political move since the Republicans tried to pretend in 1932 that the Great Depression was already over. (WASN’T THE DEPRESSION TERRIBLE? read their billboards lining the rail tracks between New York City and Washington, D.C.) It seems clear now that only the personal integrity, wit, eloquence, and thoroughly lovable family of Barack Obama kept the Democratic Party stumbling along, gut-shot, for this long.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Throughout much of the country, particularly anywhere outside a city in your Trump States, the Democratic Party <a href="/article/138897/democrats-biggest-disaster">barely exists</a> anymore—and there’s not a damned thing we can do about it, at least for the moment. It will take decades of patient work and deep investment to rebuild the party and reassert its dominance in state legislatures. Richard Mellon Scaife and the Koch brothers and ALEC and other right-wing pioneers spent years in the conservative wilderness before they were able to cement their control of the nation’s political apparatus. And the demographic shifts that Democrats so patiently—and foolishly—counted on to change everything will now be stalled and undermined at every turn. A few years of Republican border and refugee policies, and we’ll be headed back to the ever-whiter America that preceded Lyndon Johnson’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/replicating-lbjs-immigration-success/483908/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1965 immigration reforms</a>. The federal and state judiciaries—which, thanks to this election, Republicans will now fill with far-right ideologues—will rubber-stamp every one of the voter suppression tactics the GOP currently employs, along with any new devilry that Trump and his insurgents dream up. And once the president delivers on his <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/how-trump-is-trying-to-put-more-money-in-politics/493823/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">campaign promise</a> to Jerry Falwell Jr. and other evangelical leaders by making it legal for churches and other nonprofit organizations to funnel tax-deductible donations directly to political candidates, we can expect a fresh Niagara of cash to pour into our elections, one that will make <i>Citizens United</i> look like a dry crick during climate change.</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width ad-container"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span class="s1">As it stands, your empire of Trump States now extends from Brownsville, Texas, to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; from Coeur d’Alene to Key West.

Most of our country, at least as measured by physical terrain, has adopted your worldview. Your incessant self-pity and sense of injury on behalf of white people, and white people only.

We also don’t want you to bother us about money to repair your Trump State airports since, as you always claim, we will just be flying over them anyway.</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width ad-container"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span class="s1">There are still a few kinks to work out, of course. What to do, for instance, about the likes of Illinois and Minnesota, blue states adrift in a red sea? Or all those individual “blue cities” trapped in red states, like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, or Cleveland and Columbus? We’ll need to reach cooperative agreements with them to exchange goods and services as needed. They will become stops on our new information superhighways, or on our superfast rail networks, or self-driving highways. Our cool new trains and cars will glide past you all the faster, now that we don’t have to stop in between. Be sure to wave!</span></p><p><span class="s1">A much weightier problem will be ridding ourselves of the Trump States within, our own rural counties full of angry right-wing voters, convinced that their money goes to support welfare queens in the cities even as their last, visible means of support crumble away. Considering how susceptible they are to fake news, one strategy might be to recruit those Russian hackers to create shiny new web sites extolling how wonderful things are in, say, West Virginia, or rural Arkansas. Perhaps, in a historic reversal, it’s time for a mass migration from urban North to rural South, of Trump voters flocking to Red America in search of a better life for themselves and their families.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Whether you stay or go, we’ll be reaching out around the globe to recruit the most talented, intelligent, and ambitious individuals we can find to come to <i>our</i> America. Actually, we already do this, thanks to institutions from Silicon Valley to the University of Chicago, MIT to Wall Street, Hollywood to Broadway. Oh, and be forewarned: We will also be coming for your best and brightest in Red America, offering them free rides at many of the finest universities and research centers in the world. But don’t worry: You’ll still dominate college football!</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width ad-container"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><div class="section-break-wrapper"><svg version="1.1" x="0px" class="svg-section-break" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 124.6 24.3" style="enable-background:new 0 0 124.6 24.3;" xml:space="preserve">

Your avowed policies will not only fail to contain global climate change but will accelerate it irrevocably, which will be catastrophic. Under the New Federalism, our blue regions will at least be able to make their own preparations for the deluge. But separating ourselves from the rest of your dealings with the world will be more difficult.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Since you want to quit policing the world and make everyone in Europe go back to defending themselves, we could easily cut the army to, say, the 125,000 soldiers we had just before the start of World War I, along with a much reduced air force and navy. And with a president who doesn’t feel he needs to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-briefings-232479" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">take security briefings</a>, and who genuinely does not seem to know why we don’t just go ahead and <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/03/trump-asks-why-us-cant-use-nukes-msnbcs-joe-scarborough-reports.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">use our nuclear missiles</a>, I think it’s safest to say, Ix-nay on the eapons-way.</span></p><p><span class="s1">But since your Trump administration now boasts more generals than Pinochet’s junta, it’s likely that, isolationist noises aside, the White House will soon be up to its usual shenanigans around the globe. Who can say what these might be, in light of our new president’s one-man alliances with assorted global strongmen, autocrats, and wing nuts? Blue states and cities will do our best to publicly disassociate our America-within-America from whatever new international follies you people may be persuaded to embark upon. And we will continue to take to the streets to defend the rights of immigrants and refugees and anyone else threatened by your saber rattling and isolationism. To quote St. Augustine, “When there is no justice, what is the state but a robber band enlarged?” We respectfully decline to join the Trump-Putin robber band.</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width ad-container"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><figure class="article-embed image-embed pull-right" contenteditable="false"><img src="//images.newrepublic.com/390220bc6e73078c19913847fab1871d0decbff9.jpeg?w=800" data-serialized="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b082dab6-cb93-4d02-8ba8-2348f82edecc&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;390220bc6e73078c19913847fab1871d0decbff9&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1532,&quot;height&quot;:2100,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/390220bc6e73078c19913847fab1871d0decbff9.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}" width="800"></figure><p><span class="s1">I realize that this all sounds like a terribly pessimistic view of the future. It will leave behind millions of our fellow Americans most in need of the kind of assistance that only the federal government can provide—Americans whose only crime was to have the misfortune of resid-ing in a Trump State. I actually love Mississippi, an incredible place that, along with so much else, gave us Medgar Evers, William Faulkner, and Robert Johnson. I would love nothing better than to see Detroit, one of our greatest cities, restored to its former glory. But such hopes and dreams mean little now. The moment requires us to put aside, for now, the liberal ideal, which at its core was always about nurturing new shoots of enlightenment—which are as likely to spring up in a lonely farmhouse, or on a ghetto block, as at some great center of power or finance. The promise of liberalism was that we would never stop reaching out toward one another, always building and connecting, until all of America and the world was covered with diverse, democratic, and yes, brilliant societies, “the broad, sunlit uplands” that <a href="http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/122-their-finest-hour" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Churchill envisioned</a>, or Dr. King’s “<a href="http://www.concordia-ny.edu/news/Change-Agent-and-Diversity-Champion-Dr-Napoleon-Peoples-Kicks-off-Black-History-Month-Celebrations-at-Concordia-College-Jacobson-Global-Lecture-125-7pm.cfm?grp_id=15865" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nation</a> that will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.”</span></p><p><span class="s1">Many of my fellow blue staters, of course, would prefer to persuade you to come around to our way of thinking. That is, after all, what elections are supposed to be about—instead of, say, suborning the head of the FBI, or getting foreigners to commit felonies on your behalf. It’s true that even the most dominant powers can be dissolved by the right idea, carried forward by enough people who believe in it. The national majority that Democrats enjoyed before the Civil War collapsed in the face of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Free-Soil-Party" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">demand</a> for “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Land, and Free Men.” The Republican landslides of the 1920s were reversed nearly overnight when they ran up against the liberal program of the New Deal.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Unfortunately, nothing like that is going to happen now. A political sea change takes place only when you can get people on the other side to come over. But you can only get them to switch if you can get them to listen to what you have to say, and you can only get them to listen if you share something resembling the same idea of objective reality. This is the bleakest new reality of all: That common ground is gone.

If we in the blue states want to make America great again, we must first demonstrate that we can make our own states into models of civic participation and economic equality.</span></p><p><span class="s1">America’s original liberal, Louis Brandeis, famously <a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/laboratories-of-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">advocated</a> for the role of the individual states as “laboratories of democracy.” And so they have proven to be, with nearly all of our great reforms first attempted on the state or local level: the abolition of slavery (Massachusetts, 1783); the right of women to vote (Wyoming Territory, 1869); the regulation of workplace safety (Illinois in the 1890s and New York in the 1910s). A ban on monopolies was written into the constitution of Texas when it was still an independent republic in 1845, and converted into one of the first state antitrust acts in 1889—a statute that checked the power of that rapacious Eastern corporation Standard Oil, and helped set off a Texas oil boom. “The Wisconsin idea,” <a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/8100/9913" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">advocated</a> by Robert La Follette in the first decades of the twentieth century, was that public universities should devote themselves to research improving the lives of the people in the states that sponsor them. New York State’s seminal <a href="http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5226&amp;context=lawreview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ives-Quinn Act</a> of 1945 banned discrimination in employment on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin. And so it goes, all the way down to the health care reform law in Massachusetts in 2006, which was the model for Obamacare whether Mitt Romney wants to admit it or not.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Originally, all of these great steps forward were seen as outliers, as dangerous or risky, as harebrained social experiments. All wound up transforming our nation for the better—and all are models for the hard work we must do, in countless places, and in the face of massive opposition. Every time and place in our nation’s history has known people of noble mind, with advanced ideas and dreams. This is a good thing, but it availed us nothing if they could not bring those ideas and dreams to practical application.</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width ad-container"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span class="s1">Brandeis himself formulated what should become the catchphrase for our own time. Appropriately unimpressed during a <i>previous</i> mania for a certain corrupt eastern empire, he asked: “Why visit Russia when you can go to Denmark?” Brandeis knew something about the challenges of putting liberal ideals into practice. In his time, he faced combinations of the money power and the political machines that were just as puffed up with their own arrogance and ignorance as so many of you are in the Trump States today. They would not hear him then, just as you will not hear us now. What Brandeis devised, along with Florence Kelley, a leader of the National Consumers League, was <a href="https://louisville.edu/law/library/special-collections/the-louis-d.-brandeis-collection/the-brandeis-brief-in-its-entirety" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“the Brandeis Brief,”</a> a revolutionary legal instrument that opened up the courtroom to the real world. It stressed actual social conditions and proven scientific realities over detached and absolute legal theories. Employed first to limit how many hours a day women could be forced to work in a laundry, it would eventually be used as a legal foundation for <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i>, along with countless other groundbreaking cases through the years.

To fall to this place, with this hollow man assuming the leadership of the world’s greatest republic, may be in itself a refutation of the greater liberal hope that sustained human progress is possible and will prevail. But all that remains for us is to regroup, to salvage what we might, and to begin again where we can.</span></p><p><span class="s1">This is why our separation in all but name is necessary. There is only one way that we can counter all of your fantasies about what this man you have elected is, and what he—or the assorted moneyed interests, ideological fanatics, and foreign dictators he so fecklessly shields—will do for you. Since those of you in the Trump States will not listen to us, or to anything that smacks of rationality, we will have to create new facts on the ground—“alternative facts,” as you folks have taken to saying. Since you will not hear our words, we will need to convince you by our actions. We will need to run our states and our cities so well, in such an effective and enlightened manner, that we can make you understand all over again what every page of our history should already tell you. Through our own example, we must win you over, American by American, town by town, state by state, until we are once more in a position to mitigate all of the foolish, cruel, and wasteful things you

We have funded massive infrastructure projects in your rural counties, subsidized your schools and your power plants and your nursing homes, sent you entire industries, and simultaneously absorbed the most destitute, unskilled, and oppressed portions of your populations, white and black alike.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">All of which, it turns out, only left you more bitter, white, and alt-right than ever.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Some folks here in self-supporting America like to believe that there must be a way to bring you back to your senses and to restore rational government, if not liberal ideals, sometime in the foreseeable future. Everyone seems to have an answer for how to do this. Every day another earnest little homily finds its way to me over my internet transom: “Think locally, act globally,” or “Make art and fight the power,” or the old Joe Hill standby—“Don’t mourn. Organize.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">To which I say: Don’t organize. Pack.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Not literally, of course. Not even the good people of Canada should have to stomach a mass migration of moping American liberals mumbling, “Live locally … make art.” What I mean is that it’s time for blue states and cities to effectively abandon the American national enterprise, as it is currently constituted. Call it the New Federalism. Or Virtual Secession. Or Conscious Uncoupling—though that’s already been used. Or maybe Bluexit.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Truth is, you red states just haven’t been pulling your weight. Not for, well, \u003ci>forever\u003c/i>. Red states are \u003ca href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly twice as dependent\u003c/a> on the federal government as blue states. Of the twelve states that \u003ca href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/ https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">received\u003c/a> the \u003ci>least\u003c/i> federal aid in return for each tax dollar they contribute to the U.S. Treasury, ten of them voted for Hillary Clinton—and the other two were Michigan and Wisconsin, your newest recruits.

To paraphrase Virgil “the Turk” Sollozzo from \u003ci>The Godfather\u003c/i>, the Democrats, with all due respect, had been slipping. Twenty years ago, could any organization as stone-cold crazy as the Tea Party have gotten to them?

Losses of that magnitude, over that period of time, are like a bright red dashboard light you’ve never noticed before that suddenly starts flashing insistently. Accompanied by a shrill beeping sound. And a voice repeating, “Warning, warning!” And a plume of smoke pouring from under your hood.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Yet the party elites drove blithely on, chatting on their cell phones about their demographic advantages and the imminent demise of the Republican Party, until the air bags had deployed, the steering wheel had come off in their hands, and the rims of their tireless wheels were grinding sparks off the curbside. At this point, there’s no retooling this burnt-out Chevy Cruze into a vehicle still capable of going coast-to-coast.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cfigure class=\"article-embed image-embed pull-left\" contenteditable=\"false\">\u003cimg src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/aeffbe3cdc2c2b2f40aa484b965f910d968c7a75.png?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;8200acba-5dd2-4a18-b573-a2f232b92467&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;aeffbe3cdc2c2b2f40aa484b965f910d968c7a75&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1600,&quot;height&quot;:1807,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;PNG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/aeffbe3cdc2c2b2f40aa484b965f910d968c7a75.png&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\">\u003c/figure>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">This letter is not intended as one more \u003ci>postmortem\u003c/i> on what went wrong: on how the media should have done a better job, or how Hillary Clinton was a bad, bad, terribly bad candidate, the worstest candidate that ever was. Granted, it was Clintonism as a political philosophy, as practiced not only by both Clintons but also by President Obama and many others, that put the final stake in the heart of the Democratic Party as a national entity. The Clintonist project of taking the oldest and most diverse political coalition on earth—one organized around liberal economic principles that had held it together for generations—and re-centering it around conservative economic ideas and a hodgepodge of \u003ci>social\u003c/i> ideas that nobody could agree on, was probably the worst political move since the Republicans tried to pretend in 1932 that the Great Depression was already over. (WASN’T THE DEPRESSION TERRIBLE? read their billboards lining the rail tracks between New York City and Washington, D.C.) It seems clear now that only the personal integrity, wit, eloquence, and thoroughly lovable family of Barack Obama kept the Democratic Party stumbling along, gut-shot, for this long.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Throughout much of the country, particularly anywhere outside a city in your Trump States, the Democratic Party \u003ca href=\"/article/138897/democrats-biggest-disaster\">barely exists\u003c/a> anymore—and there’s not a damned thing we can do about it, at least for the moment. It will take decades of patient work and deep investment to rebuild the party and reassert its dominance in state legislatures. Richard Mellon Scaife and the Koch brothers and ALEC and other right-wing pioneers spent years in the conservative wilderness before they were able to cement their control of the nation’s political apparatus. And the demographic shifts that Democrats so patiently—and foolishly—counted on to change everything will now be stalled and undermined at every turn. A few years of Republican border and refugee policies, and we’ll be headed back to the ever-whiter America that preceded Lyndon Johnson’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/replicating-lbjs-immigration-success/483908/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1965 immigration reforms\u003c/a>. The federal and state judiciaries—which, thanks to this election, Republicans will now fill with far-right ideologues—will rubber-stamp every one of the voter suppression tactics the GOP currently employs, along with any new devilry that Trump and his insurgents dream up. And once the president delivers on his \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/how-trump-is-trying-to-put-more-money-in-politics/493823/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">campaign promise\u003c/a> to Jerry Falwell Jr. and other evangelical leaders by making it legal for churches and other nonprofit organizations to funnel tax-deductible donations directly to political candidates, we can expect a fresh Niagara of cash to pour into our elections, one that will make \u003ci>Citizens United\u003c/i> look like a dry crick during climate change.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">As it stands, your empire of Trump States now extends from Brownsville, Texas, to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; from Coeur d’Alene to Key West. Future historians, if there are any, will be amazed to learn that just eight years after President Obama’s bailout of the auto industry—against the united and adamant opposition of the Republican Party—saved Michigan, Ohio, and maybe Pennsylvania from being reduced to large, smoking holes in the ground, all three of those once-blue holdouts voted to join Trump territory. Most of our country, at least as measured by physical terrain, has adopted your worldview. Your incessant self-pity and sense of injury on behalf of white people, and white people only. Your insistence that you remain the stronghold of “traditional values,” even as you adopt the most radical of ideas, and elect the most openly irreligious and irreverent president in our history. Your penchant for flushing any and every inconvenient truth down the memory hole of your favorite media complex, run by a gaggle of foreigners and cynics up in your hated New York.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">But let’s be clear: The problem isn’t that your guy won.

We will raise our state and local taxes accordingly to pay for anything we might need or want. We ask nothing more from you and your federal government. Nothing for infrastructure, or housing, or the care of the poor and sick—not that you gave us much, anyway.

Poof—it’s gone! We will never again beg the people you elected to office to help us in the wake of what should have been considered national tragedies, such as September 11 and Hurricane Sandy. Meanwhile, best of luck with all those tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, forest fires, and—all new!—Oklahoma fracking-earthquakes you always \u003ca href=\"https://earthquakes.ok.gov/faqs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">seem to be having\u003c/a>.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">What’s the matter with Kansas?

I’m sure that’ll work out just fine for you.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">With all the extra money we’ll have, we can set up our own Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid systems once Paul Ryan manages to “privatize” them for you Trump Staters.

Disastrous as this allocation is when it comes to winning our country’s fatally antiquated Electoral College (is there another republic in the world, or indeed the history of the world, where a party has won a national election by \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/4608555/hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly three million votes\u003c/a> and still lost everything?), it’s perfect for developing highly efficient, cutting-edge regional networks in everything from transportation to clean energy to health care.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cfigure class=\"article-embed image-embed pull-left\" contenteditable=\"false\">\u003cimg src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/6642eabe54fc096305d9a769a885b0e06c080c44.png?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;bf84824e-8ba1-4db5-8f34-3f15e5bbd9fd&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;6642eabe54fc096305d9a769a885b0e06c080c44&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1600,&quot;height&quot;:1334,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;PNG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/6642eabe54fc096305d9a769a885b0e06c080c44.png&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\">\u003c/figure>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Under the New Federalism, you won’t have to engage in political convolutions to try and reconcile your conservative ideology with your extortionate demands for yet another federal handout.

Then you go right back to fulminating about how much Amtrak costs.

In their place, we will build fantastic, new high-speed rail systems of our own. They’ll run past our state-of-the-art wind farms, fiber-optic networks, and highways that recharge our self-driving cars as we travel. We also don’t want you to bother us about money to repair your Trump State airports since, as you always claim, we will just be flying over them anyway.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">There are still a few kinks to work out, of course. What to do, for instance, about the likes of Illinois and Minnesota, blue states adrift in a red sea? Or all those individual “blue cities” trapped in red states, like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, or Cleveland and Columbus? We’ll need to reach cooperative agreements with them to exchange goods and services as needed. They will become stops on our new information superhighways, or on our superfast rail networks, or self-driving highways. Our cool new trains and cars will glide past you all the faster, now that we don’t have to stop in between. Be sure to wave!\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">A much weightier problem will be ridding ourselves of the Trump States within, our own rural counties full of angry right-wing voters, convinced that their money goes to support welfare queens in the cities even as their last, visible means of support crumble away. Considering how susceptible they are to fake news, one strategy might be to recruit those Russian hackers to create shiny new web sites extolling how wonderful things are in, say, West Virginia, or rural Arkansas. Perhaps, in a historic reversal, it’s time for a mass migration from urban North to rural South, of Trump voters flocking to Red America in search of a better life for themselves and their families.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Whether you stay or go, we’ll be reaching out around the globe to recruit the most talented, intelligent, and ambitious individuals we can find to come to \u003ci>our\u003c/i> America. Actually, we already do this, thanks to institutions from Silicon Valley to the University of Chicago, MIT to Wall Street, Hollywood to Broadway. Oh, and be forewarned: We will also be coming for your best and brightest in Red America, offering them free rides at many of the finest universities and research centers in the world. But don’t worry: You’ll still dominate college football!\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003chr class=\"section-break\">\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Your own Trump State secession from reality is likely to hurt us most in foreign policy, where reality has a way of coming back to bite you in the ass very quickly. Your avowed policies will not only fail to contain global climate change but will accelerate it irrevocably, which will be catastrophic. Under the New Federalism, our blue regions will at least be able to make their own preparations for the deluge. But separating ourselves from the rest of your dealings with the world will be more difficult.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Since you want to quit policing the world and make everyone in Europe go back to defending themselves, we could easily cut the army to, say, the 125,000 soldiers we had just before the start of World War I, along with a much reduced air force and navy. And with a president who doesn’t feel he needs to \u003ca href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-briefings-232479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">take security briefings\u003c/a>, and who genuinely does not seem to know why we don’t just go ahead and \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/03/trump-asks-why-us-cant-use-nukes-msnbcs-joe-scarborough-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">use our nuclear missiles\u003c/a>, I think it’s safest to say, Ix-nay on the eapons-way.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">But since your Trump administration now boasts more generals than Pinochet’s junta, it’s likely that, isolationist noises aside, the White House will soon be up to its usual shenanigans around the globe. Who can say what these might be, in light of our new president’s one-man alliances with assorted global strongmen, autocrats, and wing nuts? Blue states and cities will do our best to publicly disassociate our America-within-America from whatever new international follies you people may be persuaded to embark upon. And we will continue to take to the streets to defend the rights of immigrants and refugees and anyone else threatened by your saber rattling and isolationism.

It will leave behind millions of our fellow Americans most in need of the kind of assistance that only the federal government can provide—Americans whose only crime was to have the misfortune of resid-ing in a Trump State. I actually love Mississippi, an incredible place that, along with so much else, gave us Medgar Evers, William Faulkner, and Robert Johnson. I would love nothing better than to see Detroit, one of our greatest cities, restored to its former glory. But such hopes and dreams mean little now. The moment requires us to put aside, for now, the liberal ideal, which at its core was always about nurturing new shoots of enlightenment—which are as likely to spring up in a lonely farmhouse, or on a ghetto block, as at some great center of power or finance. The promise of liberalism was that we would never stop reaching out toward one another, always building and connecting, until all of America and the world was covered with diverse, democratic, and yes, brilliant societies, “the broad, sunlit uplands” that \u003ca href=\"http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/122-their-finest-hour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Churchill envisioned\u003c/a>, or Dr. King’s “\u003ca href=\"http://www.concordia-ny.edu/news/Change-Agent-and-Diversity-Champion-Dr-Napoleon-Peoples-Kicks-off-Black-History-Month-Celebrations-at-Concordia-College-Jacobson-Global-Lecture-125-7pm.cfm?grp_id=15865\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nation\u003c/a> that will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Many of my fellow blue staters, of course, would prefer to persuade you to come around to our way of thinking. That is, after all, what elections are supposed to be about—instead of, say, suborning the head of the FBI, or getting foreigners to commit felonies on your behalf. It’s true that even the most dominant powers can be dissolved by the right idea, carried forward by enough people who believe in it. The national majority that Democrats enjoyed before the Civil War collapsed in the face of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Free-Soil-Party\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">demand\u003c/a> for “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Land, and Free Men.” The Republican landslides of the 1920s were reversed nearly overnight when they ran up against the liberal program of the New Deal.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, nothing like that is going to happen now. A political sea change takes place only when you can get people on the other side to come over.

It is a time for retrenchment and rebuilding. If we in the blue states want to make America great again, we must first demonstrate that we can make our own states into models of civic participation and economic equality.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">America’s original liberal, Louis Brandeis, famously \u003ca href=\"https://www.aei.org/publication/laboratories-of-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">advocated\u003c/a> for the role of the individual states as “laboratories of democracy.” And so they have proven to be, with nearly all of our great reforms first attempted on the state or local level: the abolition of slavery (Massachusetts, 1783); the right of women to vote (Wyoming Territory, 1869); the regulation of workplace safety (Illinois in the 1890s and New York in the 1910s). A ban on monopolies was written into the constitution of Texas when it was still an independent republic in 1845, and converted into one of the first state antitrust acts in 1889—a statute that checked the power of that rapacious Eastern corporation Standard Oil, and helped set off a Texas oil boom. “The Wisconsin idea,” \u003ca href=\"https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/8100/9913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">advocated\u003c/a> by Robert La Follette in the first decades of the twentieth century, was that public universities should devote themselves to research improving the lives of the people in the states that sponsor them. New York State’s seminal \u003ca href=\"http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5226&amp;context=lawreview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ives-Quinn Act\u003c/a> of 1945 banned discrimination in employment on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin. And so it goes, all the way down to the health care reform law in Massachusetts in 2006, which was the model for Obamacare whether Mitt Romney wants to admit it or not.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Originally, all of these great steps forward were seen as outliers, as dangerous or risky, as harebrained social experiments. All wound up transforming our nation for the better—and all are models for the hard work we must do, in countless places, and in the face of massive opposition. Every time and place in our nation’s history has known people of noble mind, with advanced ideas and dreams. This is a good thing, but it availed us nothing if they could not bring those ideas and dreams to practical application.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Brandeis himself formulated what should become the catchphrase for our own time. Appropriately unimpressed during a \u003ci>previous\u003c/i> mania for a certain corrupt eastern empire, he asked: “Why visit Russia when you can go to Denmark?” Brandeis knew something about the challenges of putting liberal ideals into practice. In his time, he faced combinations of the money power and the political machines that were just as puffed up with their own arrogance and ignorance as so many of you are in the Trump States today. They would not hear him then, just as you will not hear us now. What Brandeis devised, along with Florence Kelley, a leader of the National Consumers League, was \u003ca href=\"https://louisville.edu/law/library/special-collections/the-louis-d.-brandeis-collection/the-brandeis-brief-in-its-entirety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">“the Brandeis Brief,”\u003c/a> a revolutionary legal instrument that opened up the courtroom to the real world. It stressed actual social conditions and proven scientific realities over detached and absolute legal theories. Employed first to limit how many hours a day women could be forced to work in a laundry, it would eventually be used as a legal foundation for \u003ci>Brown\u003c/i> v. \u003ci>Board of Education\u003c/i>, along with countless other groundbreaking cases through the years. But that was the past.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003caside class=\"pullquote pull-left\">\u003cp>It is a tragedy that so much of the work to make this a better country, and a better world, has been thrown away, leaving us all in such needless peril.\u003c/p>\u003c/aside>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">It is a tragedy that so much of the work that so many men and women toiled at for so long to make this a better country, and a better world, has been thrown away, leaving us all in such needless peril. To fall to this place, with this hollow man assuming the leadership of the world’s greatest republic, may be in itself a refutation of the greater liberal hope that sustained human progress is possible and will prevail. But all that remains for us is to regroup, to salvage what we might, and to begin again where we can.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">This is why our separation in all but name is necessary. There is only one way that we can counter all of your fantasies about what this man you have elected is, and what he—or the assorted moneyed interests, ideological fanatics, and foreign dictators he so fecklessly shields—will do for you. Since those of you in the Trump States will not listen to us, or to anything that smacks of rationality, we will have to create new facts on the ground—“alternative facts,” as you folks have taken to saying. Since you will not hear our words, we will need to convince you by our actions. We will need to run our states and our cities so well, in such an effective and enlightened manner, that we can make you understand all over again what every page of our history should already tell you. Through our own example, we must win you over, American by American, town by town, state by state, until we are once more in a position to mitigate all of the foolish, cruel, and wasteful things you are about to inflict on the rest of us, and to move forward once again, as American states united.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Yours,\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cspan

<H1> Asclepiades : Epigrams </H1>
<BR>

<P> <I><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepiades_of_Samos">Asclepiades of Samos</A> wrote his epigrams early in the 3rd century B.C.; he was an accomplished poet, and had a considerable influence on subsequent Hellenistic writers.  About forty of his poems have been preserved in the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Anthology">Greek Anthology</A>, although some of them possibly belong to other authors.  For more information on Asclepiades, see the introduction to &quot;Asclepiades of Samos and Leonidas of Tarentum&quot; by Jerry Clack ( <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=c6L2yOyarKgC&pg=PA1">Google Books</A> ).  </I>

<P> <I>All of his surviving epigrams are shown here, in the order that they appear scattered throughout the Anthology.  The labels in <FONT CLASS="ref">red</FONT> at the start of each epigram are their numbers within the Anthology. The labels in <FONT CLASS="green">green</FONT> are the numbers assigned to the epigrams in the edition by A.S.F.Gow &amp; D.L.Page, &quot;The Greek Anthology: Hellenistic Epigrams&quot;.

<P>  It was night, it was raining, and, love's third burden, I was in wine ; the north wind blew cold and I was alone. But lovely Moschus overpowered all. "Would that you did wander so, and did not rest at one door." So much I exclaimed there, drenched through. "How long <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zeus.html#1">Zeus</A> ? Peace, dear Zeus !

"One of the last survivors of the later Pre-Raphaelites—later, because they had no contact with the original <a href="../prb/1.html">Brotherhood</a>—was Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale (1871-1945). Like <a href="../shaw/index.html">Byam Shaw</a> and <a href="../bell/index.html">Robert Anning Bell</a>, she inherited the Pre-Raphaelite love of moral and symbolic meaning, of allegory and decoration, of glowing colour. As far back as 1901, before she was thirty, Percy Bate said that Miss Fortescue-Brickdale 'should do much in the future to exemplify the still living force of Pre-Raphaelitism as a school. She studied
at the Crystal Palace School of Art and at the Royal Academy Schools, making her first appearance at a summer Academy exhibition in 1897. Concentrating upon water-colour work of a highly wrought character, she was necessarily limited in her output. She was elected associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colours in 1902 and full member in 1919. Essentially an illustrator, she put precise drawing into a jewelled setting of
brilliant colour in such works as <span class ="painting">The Forerunner</span> which depicted Leonardo da Vinci showing his model of a flying machine to the Duke of Milan, and <span class ="book">The First Visit of Simonetta</span>. As
might be expected, she was a successful designer of stained glass windows; there are examples of this side of her art in Bristol Cathedral and at Brixham." [Hardie, 130]</p>

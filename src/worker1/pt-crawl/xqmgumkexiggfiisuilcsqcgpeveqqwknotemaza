	<H1 CLASS="start2">
Quintus Curtius Rufus:
	<BR>
Life of Alexander the Great
	</H1>

	<P CLASS="a0 start justify">
The Life of Alexander is a prime candidate for the Web. Short, written like a novel and in very easy Latin, it tells the fascinating story of a man whose aura remains quite undimmed after more than two millennia, and of exploits that fire the imagination of little boys: it is an ideal text for Latin beginners.

	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
So, as with the other texts on LacusCurtius, I waited and waited for someone else to put it online; grew amazed, then disappointed, that it found no takers; and again, finally did it myself. This time though, there was a twist to it: as I was nearing the end of my inputting, David Camden beat me to it, following what appears to be a very slightly different text. In view of server downtimes and so forth,
	<A HREF="
https://www.forumromanum.org/literature/curtius.html
	"TARGET="offsite"
onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,2,WIDTH,175)"
onMouseOut="nd();">
you may want to bookmark David's version as well</A>.

	<P CLASS="a0 justify">
As almost always, I retyped the text rather than scanning it: not only to minimize errors prior to proofreading, but as an opportunity for me to become intimately familiar with the work, an exercise which I heartily recommend. (<SPAN CLASS="whole">Well-meaning</SPAN> attempts to get me to scan text, if <SPAN CLASS="whole">success</SPAN>&shy;ful, would merely turn me into some kind of machine: gambit declined.)
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
Anyway, the text has been thoroughly proofread, and I believe it to be free of errors
	<A HREF="

Darius sues for peace, sweetening the offer, and is refused.

Bessus, a high-placed Persian, betrays his master Darius in the hope of grabbing power himself, eventually killing him as he fled, then abandoning his body.

He is visited by the Queen of the Amazons and an escort of 300 female warriors: she wants to beget a girl by him, offering him any boy that might be born; he demurs. Alexander requires his own Greeks and Macedonians to perform obeisance to him in the Persian style, by prostrating themselves (<SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">προσκυνησις</SPAN>): this leads to serious unrest among them. Several high-ranking officers of Alexander's plot to kill him, the plot is discovered thru a comic-opera squabble of two homosexual lovers, and the guilty parties commit suicide or are tortured and executed.

Alexander frightens a major enemy into submission by some sleight-of‑hand in which a small commando of Alpine troops scales a peak reputed to be utterly inaccessible; his enemy realizes suddenly that Macedonians can fly, and caves in without fighting. Alexander makes war against King Porus on the Jhelum River: Porus believes his elephants will insure victory, but Alexander's tactics win the day and the elephants are worse than useless, bringing about the rout of their own forces. Porus shows himself a magnanimous leader and a worthy enemy, and Alexander shows himself equally magnanimous in return.

[A large gap in our text, then] Alexander's final illness. When he dies, Sisigambis chooses death as well. In the absence of any succession arrangements, the generals discuss what should be done. Roxane is pregnant, and some feel that the delivery of her child should be awaited and that if it is a boy he should become the new king; but eventually, Perdiccas parcels out the empire among the generals. (Some of them will keep their share and found long-lived dynasties; others will lose in the inevitable fighting.) Ptolemy conveys Alexander's body to Egypt.

Latin text

is that of the Teubner edition of 1880 by Theodor Vogel.

	<P CLASS="justify">
I have no intention of putting online any translations of Curtius. Precisely because he is such an easy author, he is used as homework material around the world: and I will not undercut the work of thousands of Latin teachers by making it easy to cheat.


	<H3>
Chapter and Section Numbering, Passages of Supplied Text
	</H3>
<!-- tutus - invictus] transposui vocabula. <I>Cf.</I> 6.10.14. Voculam rex collocavi post tutus. Alii: intritus, interritus, intactus pro invictus. -->

	<P CLASS="a0 justify">
I followed Teubner's numbering, which appears to have been that used by the Loeb edition as well.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
Since not all of Curtius is extant, scholars have exercised their ingenuity in piecing together some Latin text, drawn from other ancient sources, to bridge the gaps and provide a continuous flow of narrative. Following Teubner, I include these passages of supplied text, <I>in italics.</I>


	<H3>
Apparatus
	</H3>

	<P CLASS="a0 justify">
Vogel provides a simple apparatus criticus. His preface, dealing in part with his choice to stick to a summary apparatus, is
	<A HREF="
L/Roman/Texts/Curtius/Praefatio*.html
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,0,WIDTH,175)"
onMouseOut="nd();">
here</A>; that is also where you will find his list of sigla.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
The entries of this apparatus are usually short enough to be inserted as Javascript prompts, so you'll find them marked by little hollow bullets. Again, float your cursor over them (no need to click on them):
	<A CLASS="comment"
onMouseOver="return Ebox('* * * HERE IS WHERE YOU WILL BE READING THE APPARATUS CRITICUS. * * *',WIDTH,225)"
onMouseOut="nd();">º</A>
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
The apparatus applies to the word(s) preceding the bullet; if just to the one word before it, I do not repeat that word in the prompt.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
Some few entries are longer than the space available in a standard Javascript prompt: in the status bar at the bottom of your screen you'll be directed to click on the bullet, and the entry will be at the bottom of the page.
	<SPAN CLASS="lapis">
In late Aug 01, I moved from the standard status bar scheme to the pop-up boxes and unlimited space is now available for these prompts: eventually I expect to eliminate these hybrid-format notes, further streamlining these pages.

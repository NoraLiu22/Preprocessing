<P>The oracles of Greece and the sibyls of Rome were women chosen by the gods 
through which divine advice would be spoken through them. They were popular 
throughout the great empires and pilgrims would make their way from far off 
places just to ask them a question and receive the answer of a god. Although 
many accounts show that their prophecies were true, this is a bit skewed. They 
were not infallible and many texts refused to mention the errors that the 
oracles and sibyls made. They were not perfect and gave false information on 
occasions, but they were still a central part of the Greek and Roman 
religions.</P>
<P>The most famous of the oracles was the oracle of Apollo, the god of the sun, 
at Delphi. She was named Pythia. Travelers would ask her questions, many quite 
personal, such as those dealing with love and marriage, and she would go into a 
sort of trance and spew out rhymes and riddles for the traveler to ponder. These 
riddles were supposedly the words of Apollo himself. She would also receive 
prophecies from dreams. Science has revealed that a possibility for the trances 
that Pythia would enter was caused by inhalation of large amounts of carbon 
dioxide, which would produce hallucinations. The release of the large amounts of 
carbon dioxide was due to volcanic faults that ran underneath the temple at 
Delphi.</P>
<P>One of the oldest oracles in Greece was the oracle of Zeus in Dodona, which 
was located in northern Greece.&nbsp; Priestesses, called the Peleiades, would 
translate the oracle sent by Zeus. They listened to the sounds of pots hanging 
in the trees, the sounds of the wind, and other sounds of nature. They would 
then translate these noises into a prophecy from Zeus. They believed that Zeus' 
voice could be heard through the wind. Plato mentioned an account that he had 
with the Peleiades in his speech, Phaedrus. Herodotus also has mentioned 
accounts with these priestesses.</P>
<P>Epidaurus was the site of an oracle of Asclepios, the son of Apollo. The 
oracle was a man named Aelius Aristides. Pilgrims would go to him to ask 
questions that dealt with medicine, disease, and healing. He was said to give 
medical advice, and many of the pilgrims hoped to be cured miraculously. Aelius 
also made prophecies based on his dreams, much like Pythia at Delphi. Rituals 
were performed before the travelers received an answer or cure from Asclepios. 
These rituals included some sort of sacrifice, and abstinence and fasting. Those 
awaiting miracles were recorded to have gone into a hallucinogenic trance during 
their slumber. This was supposedly the sign that a miraculous healing was taking 
place.</P>
<P>The oracles were constantly turned to in times of crises. These ranging from 
medical epidemics and plagues, to wars and invasions. The Delphic oracle was 
mostly consulted with such issues as these. She told leaders to invade certain 
areas on many occasions, usually Roman cities or provinces. They did as they 
were told, although she was not correct every time. The army also turned to 
Pythia during the wars with Persia. She had predicted defeat for the Greek army. 
This prophecy was incorrect, because the Greeks defeated the Persians. The 
influence of the oracles began to wane, although not completely obsolete until 
the fourth century AD.</P>
<P>The sibyls were the Roman equivalents of the Greek oracles. The origin is a 
prophetess named Sibyl, who like the oracle at Delphi, spoke the words of Apollo 
by going into a trance. The tradition went on, and women were chosen by the gods 
to become sibyls. The most famous was the sibyl of Cumae, who wrote nine books 
of prophecy called the Oracula Sibyllina. These books ultimately predicted the 
fall of the Roman Empire.</P>
<P>The oracles and the sibyls were very controversial figures in Greek and Roman 
religions, because on many occasions their predictions and prophecies were not 
correct, and they were proven fallible. Even so, they remained to be significant 
in the religions and beliefs of those of some of the greatest civilizations in 
the world. The question of whether their riddles and predictions were of divine 
origin or substance-induced hallucinations will remain a mystery for now.</P>

</B>This was a great website. 
It not only supplied interesting information on the oracles, but on other 
aspects of Greek religion, such as the cosmogony, the gods, rituals, and cults. 
The website also contains information of Greek philosophy, art, sports, history, 
and lifestyle. The website was easy to read and the purpose was to educate. This 
site is highly recommended for research.</P>

The site offered good information. It contained the methods of divination used 
by the priestesses and also some primary sources of prophecies made by them. 
This site was also not difficult understand.</P>

&nbsp;The source did not have much information dealing with the oracles. The only 
information relevant were the basic purposes of the oracles. The book contains 
mostly information on politics and militaristic issues. The book could be used 
for someone on a secondary educational level. Is a good book if looking for 
basic information on the Ancient Greek empire.</P>

The only information about the sibyls in this book was an excerpt from the 
Sibylline Books. The rest of the book was just basic information such as 
political, military, and economic aspects of the Roman empire. Nice resource if 
just doing research on Rome in general.</P>
<P><B>Cartledge, Paul, ed. <I>Cambridge Illustrated History: Ancient Greece</I>.

</B>This was a decent source. It offered some information on the oracles, such as 
the beliefs and fallibility of them. This also offered a lot of general 
information on many facets of Greek society, such as theatre and the arts, 
politics, philosophy, and so on. This is good starting point for research.</P>

There was not much information on the oracles in this book surprisingly. The 
information that was available discussed the involvement of the Pythia in 
military issues such as the Persian War. This is not the best book to use when 
researching the oracles, but good if doing research on mythology or the Greek 
pantheon. Also this book was not easy to read.</P>

This was a great source. It discussed in detail the different oracles of Greece 
and their functions. The book also went into detail on the political and 
philosophical issues facing the oracles and their followers. The book was 
somewhat easy to read, but great for research on this topic.</P>
<P><B>Freeman, Charles. <I>Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient

The source was not very helpful on the topic of oracles and sibyls, but it 
contains a lot of information on political and economic issues of these great 
empires. It also discusses other civilizations such as Assyria, Mesopotamia, and 
the Levant. This book is good when looking for political or economic 
information. This book is not meant for anyone below a college level.</P>

This source dealt with the scientific explanations of the Pythia's trance like 
states. The information was interesting and useful. This is a difficult read for 
those not familiar with scientific terms and principles. Good source for 
research on the Delphic oracle.</P>

The source does not contain much information on the oracles. It discusses more 
political or social issues, and does not focus on too much religion. Good if 
doing research on the politics, or Greece in general. This book was very easy to 
read.</P>

This site offered some decent information on the Greek oracles, mainly 
discussing the different types of oracles and where they were located. This site 
also mentioned the different methods of divination used by the oracles and the 
Greeks in general. This site was easy to read and highly recommended.</P>

<H2>Cycle of Violence (1998)</H2>

<H3>a.k.a. Crossmaheart (1998)</H3>

<P>D: Henry Herbett<BR>
S: Gerald Rooney, Maria Lennon</P>

<P>If the prospect of a Northern Irish film about the troubles seems an
understandably daunting one, discovering the name of Colin Bateman attached
to the project ought to give pause for a second thought. If it doesn't,
you should note that Colin Bateman is Northern Ireland's literary equivalent
to Quentin Tarantino: irreverent yet pointed, familiar with clich&eacute;
and not afraid to employ it yet always capable of putting a new spin on
something old. <I>Cycle of Violence</I> is the first film of one of his
novels to be released (based upon his own screenplay), and will soon be
followed by the eagerly-awaited <I>Divorcing Jack</I>. It is the first feature
film shot entirely on location in Northern Ireland in twenty five years,
and comes at the vanguard of a new wave of Northern Irish films (which started
last year with the astonishing success of the amateur feature <I>The Eliminator</I>).</P>

<P>The film is concerned with the fate of young journalist Gerald Rooney,
who, following an alcoholic bender after the death of his father, is given
a less than choice assignment by his newspaper to work on a regional weekly
in the tiny village of Crossmaheart. There, amid the usual sectarian tensions
and balaclava-wearing bullies, he finds the troubled young Maria Lennon,
who was in love with his predecessor, another young male journalist who
has mysteriously vanished. Romance blossoms slowly, and all the while Rooney
finds himself delving deeper into the mystery of what happened to the other
man. It leads him in unexpected directions.</P>

<P>The great strength of <I>Cycle of Violence</I> is that it uses the Northern
Irish situation as a springboard which takes the viewer into a familiar
world with familiar frames of reference, then pulls the mat from under their
feet by making the sectarian begrudgery a sort of reflective sideline to
what becomes the main plot. Though there is an element of <I>deus ex machina</I>
about the way the last half hour begins to challenge all our assumptions
and some of the minor characters are sadly underdeveloped, the film on the
whole succeeds. It pulls of the immensely difficult trick of making a black
comedy out of material used to much more serious and heavy-handed treatment
in Irish cinema from the North and South (<A HREF="box.htm"><I>The Boxer</I>
</A>leaps to mind instantly). Not that it is frivolous or superficial, but
it tends to shift the focus away from the introspective ramblings and mythic
violence of many of its predecessors with an unexpected wit and a concern
for human rather than political drama.</P>

<P>Admittedly, this disarming off-beatedness is probably likely to earn
the film more praise than it really deserves. But it is an enjoyable and
well handled yarn told with a concern for its audience. It never becomes
truly black nor truly funny, but it has some dark moments and some amusing
scenes. It tries hard for a unique tone not unlike that attempted by <I><A HREF="iwd.htm">I Went Down</A></I>, but it never really gets so different
that it changes the way you look at Irish films (or, indeed, British independent
films). But it does leave you feeling satisfied, despite one or two little
niggles, and it is designed to do so. It is worth seeing and bodes well
for the new voices from Northern Ireland. One hopes that they will not be
silenced.</P>

<P>Note: <I>Cycle of Violence</I> received its world premiere at the 13th
Dublin Film Festival, 6 March, 1998. It was retitled <I>Crossmaheart </I>for
subsequent release.</P>

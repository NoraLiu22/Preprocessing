<p>In a confrontation between constables and unemployed "operatives" or mill-workers, the mob was pushed back from Salford's gates. However, as the rioters were withdrawing, "a private watchman, who had stationed himself at one of the windows inside [the factory], discharged a blunderbuss loaded with no. 4 shot at the legs of the assailants, and five of them, we regret to say, were wounded . . . . Then men were shot from the ground-window of the mill, as seen in the print" (233).</p>

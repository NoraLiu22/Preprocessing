Publius Vergilius Maro, a native of Mantua, had parents of humble origin, especially his father, who according to some was a potter, although the general opinion is that he was at first the hired man of a certain Magus, an attendant on the magistrates, later became his son-in‑law because of his diligence, and greatly increased his little property by buying up woodlands and raising bees. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2">2</A> He was born in the first <SPAN CLASS="whole">consul</SPAN>&shy;ship of Gnaeus Pompeius the Great and Marcus Licinius Crassus, on the Ides of October, in a district called Andes, not far distant from Mantua. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3">3</A> While he was in his mother's womb, she dreamt that she gave birth to a <SPAN CLASS="whole">laurel-branch</SPAN>, which on touching the earth took root and grew at once to the size of a full-grown tree, covered with fruits and flowers of various kinds;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref:prolific_tree" HREF="

It was called from him "Vergil's tree" and was besides worshipped with great veneration by

Vergil spent his early life at Cremona until he assumed the gown of manhood, upon his fifteenth birthday, in the <SPAN CLASS="whole">consul</SPAN>&shy;ship of the same two men who had been consuls the year he was born; and it chanced that the poet Lucretius died that very same day. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7">7</A> Vergil, however, moved from Cremona to Mediolanum, and shortly afterwards from there to Rome. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8">8</A> He was tall and of full habit, with a dark complexion and a rustic appearance. His health was variable; for he very often suffered from stomach and throat troubles, as well as with headache; and he also had frequent haemorrhages. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="9">9</A> He ate and drank but little. He was especially given to passions for boys, and his special favourites were Cebes and Alexander, whom he calls Alexis in the second poem of his "Bucolics." This boy was given him by Asinius Pollio, and both his favourites had some education, while Cebes was even a poet. It is common report that he also had an intrigue with Plotia Hieria. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10">10</A> But Asconius Pedianus declares that she herself used to say afterwards, when she was getting old, that Vergil was invited by Varius to associate with her, but obstinately refused. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11">11</A> Certain it is that for the rest of his life he was so modest in speech and thought, that at Naples he was commonly called "Parthenias,"&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="

<A ID="p469"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p469 </SPAN></A>to accept it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13">13</A> He possessed nearly ten million sesterces from the generous gifts of friends, and he had a house at Rome on the Esquiline, near the gardens of Maecenas, although he usually lived in retirement in Campania and in Sicily.

Then he wrote the "Catalepton," "Priapea," "Epigrams" and the "Dirae," as well as the "Ciris" and the "Culex" when he was sixteen years old. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="18">18</A> The story of the Culex is this.

<A ID="p473"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p473 </SPAN></A>remarking that he fashioned his poem after the manner of a she-bear, and gradually licked it into shape. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="23">23</A> In the case of the "Aeneid," after writing a first draft in prose and dividing it into twelve books, he proceeded to turn into verse one part after another, taking them up just as he fancied, in no particular order. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="24">24</A> And that he might not check the flow of his thought, he left some things unfinished, and, so to speak, bolstered others up with very slight words, which, as he jocosely used to say, were put in like props, to support the structure until the solid columns should arrive.

The "Bucolics" he finished in three years, the "Georgics" in seven, the "Aeneid" in twelve. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="26">26</A> The success of the "Bucolics" on their first appearance was such, that they were even frequently rendered by singers on the stage. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27">27</A> When Augustus was returning after his victory at Actium and lingered at Atella to treat his throat, Vergil read the "Georgics" to him for four days in succession, Maecenas taking his turn at the reading whenever the poet was interrupted by the failure of his voice. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="28">28</A> His own delivery, however, was sweet and <SPAN CLASS="whole">wonder</SPAN>&shy;fully effective. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29">29</A> In fact, Seneca has said that the poet Julius Montanus used to declare that he could also have purloined some of Vergil's work, if he could also have stolen his voice, expression, and dramatic power; for the same verses sounded well when Vergil read them, which on another's lips were flat and toneless. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="30">30</A> Hardly was the "Aeneid" begun, when its repute became so great that Sextus Propertius&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="

Augustus indeed (for it chanced that he was away on his Cantabrian campaign) demanded in entreating and even jocosely threatening letters that Vergil send him "something from the 'Aeneid' "; to use his own words, "either the first draft of the poem or any section of it that he pleased." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32">32</A> But it was not until long afterwards, when the material was at last in shape, that Vergil read to him three books in all, the second, fourth, and sixth. The last of these produced a remarkable effect on Octavia, who was present at the reading; for it is said that when he reached the verses about her son, "Thou shalt be Marcellus,"&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref5" HREF="

For having before him merely the words "<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">Misenum Aeoliden</SPAN>," he added "<SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">quo non praestantior alter</SPAN>,"&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="

In the <SPAN CLASS="whole">fifty-second</SPAN> year of his age, wishing to give the final touch to the "Aeneid," he determined to go away to Greece and Asia, and after devoting three entire years to the sole work of improving the poem, to give up the rest of his life wholly to philosophy. But having begun his journey, and at Athens meeting Augustus, who was on his way back to Rome from the Orient, he resolved not to part


<A ID="p477"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p477 </SPAN></A>from the emperor and even to return with him; but in the course of a visit to the neighbouring town of Megara in a very hot sun, he was taken with a fever, and added to his disorder by continuing his journey; hence on his arrival at Brundisium he was considerably worse, and died there on the eleventh day before the Kalends of October, in the <SPAN CLASS="whole">consul</SPAN>&shy;ship of Gnaeus Sentius and Quintus Lucretius. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="36">36</A> His ashes were taken to Naples and laid to rest on the via Puteolana less than two miles from the city, in a tomb for which he himself composed this couplet:

Vergil never lacked detractors, which is not strange; for neither did Homer. When the "Bucolics" appeared, a certain Numitorius wrote "<SPAN CLASS="whole">Anti-bucolics</SPAN>," consisting of but two poems, which were a very insipid parody. The first began as follows:

Historically, the party not in control of the White House performs stronger in the midterms, and 2018 could continue the trend. Many of the critical battles will be fought in the suburbs, where Democrats hope they can win over affluent and well-educated voters. Advantages in enthusiasm and fundraising have Democrats optimistic about their chances, but Republicans have strong economic conditions and a more reliable voter base for turnout.","senate":"Republicans are on offense in the Senate, where they’re hoping to add to their current two-seat majority. Ten Democratic senators are facing re-election in states President Trump won in 2016, five of which he took by double digits. To have a chance at controlling the Senate at the end of the night, Democrats will have to cut their losses in these 10 states, pick up seats in states like Nevada and Arizona -- two states that have been trending blue in recent years -- and potentially flip a seat in a traditionally red state like Tennessee or Texas. It’s an uphill climb for Democrats, who lost control of the Senate during the 2014 midterms.","governor":"In a year when Republicans must defend 26 governorships, Democrats have pickup opportunities in several traditionally blue states in presidential elections like Maine and New Mexico and swing states like Iowa and Wisconsin. Even some usually less competitive states like Oklahoma, Kansas and Georgia could see tight gubernatorial elections. Republicans are hoping to flip the governorship in Alaska, where independent Gov. Bill Walker dropped his bid for re-election less than three weeks before the election. This year’s gubernatorial elections could be critical for the next decade of national politics, as many of the new governors will have veto power over new redistricting maps after the 2020 census."},"stateSummaries":{"alabama":"Last December, Democrat Doug Jones shocked the political world by winning the Alabama Senate seat formerly held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions (R). Don't expect the same drama in the Yellowhammer State this year. Neither Jones nor his colleague Sen. Richard Shelby (R) is up this year, and none of Alabama's House seats are ranked competitive by CNN. Gov. Kay Ivey (R), who took over the top job after Robert Bentley (R) resigned due to scandal, is expected to win her first full term in the Statehouse. Despite Jones' success in his special election, Alabama is still deep red, with no significant Democratic prospects on the federal level this year. ","alaska":"The nation's only independent governor, Alaska's Bill Walker, dropped his re-election bid less than three weeks before Election Day. He remains on the ballot, but his endorsement of former Sen. Mark Begich (D) could help prevent former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy (R) from flipping this governorship to Republican control. The state's lone congressman and current longest-serving member in the House, Rep. Don Young (R), is facing first-time candidate Alyse Galvin, an independent who won the Democratic primary. Galvin's campaign has focused on education, but defeating Young is an uphill climb.","arizona":"Arizona is one of just a handful of pickup opportunities for Democrats where a win would bolster their chances of taking back the Senate. Two members of Congress are fighting hard for the seat opened up by Republican Jeff Flake's retirement. Reps. Kyrsten Sinema (D) and Martha McSally (R), who made history as the Air Force's first woman to fly in combat, are facing off in one of the most competitive Senate races of the year. President Trump's health care and immigration policies have emboldened both sides to vote in the Grand Canyon State, where he won by only 4 points in 2016. In addition to the Senate race, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) is seeking his second term against university professor David Garcia in a race where education has become a central issue. The unexpectedly tight margin in the 8th House District special election in April — a district Trump won by more than 20 points — has Democrats seeing an opening for the party. Three of the five GOP congressional races are considered competitive, including McSally's Tucson-area district, which Hillary Clinton won by 5 points.","arkansas":"Arkansas has changed a lot in the quarter-century since Bill Clinton ran the state as governor. It's now a Republican stronghold with complete GOP control of the statehouse, governor's mansion and congressional delegation. Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) initially opposed President Trump during the 2016 primaries but now has his endorsement and is expected to win a second term. The most competitive race in the state is expected to be in the 2nd Congressional District, around Little Rock, where moderate Democrat Clarke Tucker is trying to oust second-term Rep. French Hill (R). African-American voters could be key in the race, as they make up about 20% of the district's electorate.","california":"California is one of the most critical states for Democrats if they are going to take control of the House. Seven Republicans represent districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Democrats are hopeful they can unseat at least four of them. The most competitive of those races should come in the 25th, 39th, 45th, 48th and 49th districts. Besides the 25th, which is just north of Los Angeles, these districts all touch parts of Orange County, just south of LA, and are affluent and well-educated -- exactly the type of district Democrats are targeting. At the statewide level, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) is running for her sixth term and will face Democratic state legislator Kevin de Leon due to the California's top-two primary system. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom faces Republican businessman John Cox in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. Both Feinstein and Newsom won their primaries by wide margins and are expected to win in November. ","colorado":"For the fourth consecutive election cycle, Colorado's 6th Congressional District, in the suburbs of Denver, is one of the nation's most high-profile and competitive races. Since his district was redrawn in 2012, Rep. Mike Coffman (R) has moderated his views and even learned Spanish to appeal to a more moderate and Hispanic electorate. It's worked: He's survived even as the district voted for President Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton (who won by 9 points) in 2016. Across the country, Democrats are targeting suburban, well-educated districts like this one, and they think that Army combat veteran Jason Crow will be the candidate who unseats Coffman. At the state level, Rep. Jared Polis (D) is the favorite to succeed term-limited Gov. John Hickenlooper (D). If Polis defeats State Treasurer Walker Stapleton (R), he'll be the first openly gay man elected governor in American history. ","connecticut":"Connecticut's recent history of close gubernatorial races continues in 2018. Gov. Dannel Malloy (D), who never received more than 51% of the vote, is not seeking a third term. The race is a battle of the businessmen: Democrat Ned Lamont, who launched his own cable company, vs. Republican Bob Stefanowski, a former executive at GE and UBS. Stefanowski says his corporate experience will help him solve Connecticut's budget crisis, while the Lamont campaign says Stefanowski outsourced jobs and ran a payday loan company. Increased Democratic enthusiasm makes this a difficult seat to flip, despite Malloy's unpopularity. In Congress, Sen. Chris Murphy (D) is heavily favored to win a second term against Navy veteran and small business owner Matthew Corey, and none of the state's five Democratic-held House seats are expected to be competitive. ","delaware":"The Democratic stronghold in the First State is widely expected to continue in 2018. Sen. Tom Carper (D) has been winning statewide elections in Delaware since 1976 and is heavily favored to beat Republican Rob Arlett, a county councilman who chaired President Trump's Delaware campaign in 2016. The state's lone House member, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D), is also expected to be re-elected.","florida":"Every other November, the nation turns its eyes to Florida, and this year will be no different. The Sunshine State has two of the nation's highest-profile races: a heavyweight Senate election that could be the most expensive in history, and a governor's race featuring candidates on polar opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. Sen. Bill Nelson, one of 10 Democrats running for re-election in states President Trump won in 2016, faces a strong opponent in term-limited Gov. Rick Scott (R), who has poured tens of millions of his own money into his various campaigns. Running to replace Scott are former Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who has been one of Trump's most vocal supporters, and Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, who was endorsed in the primary by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Eight House districts in Florida could be competitive, with the 26th and 27th districts in South Florida -- both currently represented by Republicans -- the most likely to flip parties. ","georgia":"Stacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, is the first black woman in American history to be a major party's nominee for that office. For the former state legislator to make history as the nation's first black female governor, she'll have to beat Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Georgia hasn't elected a Democratic governor in 20 years. It's one of the most competitive races, pitting the Trump-endorsed Republican against a Bernie Sanders-backed Democrat. The suburban Atlanta-area 6th and 7th congressional districts are seen as the state's most competitive House races. Both are currently represented by Republicans, but Hillary Clinton outperformed Barack Obama here in 2016. Despite those Democratic gains, they will be difficult to flip, but a strong night for Democrats could do the trick. ","hawaii":"Hawaii is consistently one of the most Democratic states in the nation — it gave Hillary Clinton her second-widest margin of victory in 2016, after only the District of Columbia. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D) is expected to defeat former computer programmer Ron Curtis (R) to secure her second term. Despite some controversy over his handling of a false missile alarm early this year, Gov. David Ige (D) fended off a tough primary challenge from Rep. Colleen Hanabusa (D-HI). Ige is the favorite to defeat state legislator Andria Tupola (R) and win a second term. ","idaho":"Idaho Democrat Paulette Jordan would be the nation's first Native American governor if she can win in one of the reddest states. Gov. Butch Otter (R), first elected in 2006, decided not to seek a fourth term. Despite the open seat and the historic nature of Jordan's candidacy, Otter's lieutenant governor, Brad Little (R), is the heavy favorite to win in a state that voted for Trump by more than 30 points. Neither of the state's two GOP-held congressional districts is considered competitive. ","illinois":"One of the strongest opportunities for Democrats to flip a governor's seat comes in the Land of Lincoln. Since his 2014 election, Gov. Bruce Rauner (R), who made millions in private-equity and venture capital firms, has been locked in almost constant battle with the Democratic-controlled state Legislature in Springfield. The result: one of the longest and most contentious budget fights in modern American history, and the nation's fifth-largest state going more than two years without a budget (plus Rauner's sinking popularity). Challenging Rauner is Democratic businessman J.B. Pritzker, a member of one of the richest families in the country. Pritzker is favored to unseat Rauner. In the House, at least four of Illinois' Republican members are vulnerable in 2018. The most endangered looks to be Rep. Mike Bost, who represents the 12th District in southern Illinois. Bost faces Democrat Brendan Kelly, a prosecutor and former Navy officer.   ","indiana":"Sen. Joe Donnelly is one of five Democratic senators up for re-election in states that President Trump won by double digits. Donnelly will face businessman Mike Braun, who defeated two members of Congress in the Republican primary. Recognizing he represents a conservative state, Donnelly has worked to align himself with Trump at times. Like many Democrats, though, he's focusing his campaign on health care. Winning re-election as a Democrat in a state that voted for Trump by 19 points won't be easy, but Donnelly won his first term in 2012 despite President Obama losing Indiana (one of the two states that voted for Obama in 2008 but not 2012). Republican Reps. Jackie Walorski, who represents the 2nd District, in the South Bend area, and Trey Hollingsworth, from the 9th District, around Bloomington, both could be vulnerable to Democratic challengers. Republican Greg Pence, the older brother of Vice President Mike Pence, is heavily favored to win in the 6th District. ","iowa":"Iowa voted for President Trump after supporting President Obama twice, but Democrats see opportunities up and down the ballot in 2018, including one of the most endangered Republican congressmen in the nation: Rep. Rod Blum, who represents the 1st District, in the Cedar Rapids and Dubuque area. The district narrowly supported Trump in 2016, but Democrats think state legislator Abby Finkenauer is well-positioned to reclaim this traditionally blue district. Rep. David Young, from the Des Moines-based 3rd District, is also vulnerable. The Hawkeye State also features a competitive gubernatorial race, where Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) is running for her first full term after being elevated to the top job when Gov. Terry Branstad left to join the Trump administration. She faces Democratic businessman Fred Hubbell.","kansas":"Assisted by a last-minute endorsement from President Trump, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach eked out a narrow primary victory over Gov. Jeff Colyer in Kansas' GOP gubernatorial primary. Kansas has struggled with a funding crisis since then-Gov. Sam Brownback enacted massive tax cuts, many of which were later overturned by the GOP-controlled statehouse. Brownback resigned from office earlier this year to join the Trump administration. Between lingering dissatisfaction with the Brownback administration and opposition to Kobach, whose hardline stances on voting rights have drawn national headlines, Democrats are optimistic about this competitive race in a traditionally red state. State Sen. Laura Kelly, the Democratic nominee, is keeping an eye on independent Greg Orman, who received more than 40% of the vote when he ran for Senate in 2014. The 2nd and 3rd congressional districts, featuring popular former state Rep. Paul Davis (D) and former White House fellow Sharice Davids (D), respectively, based in and around Kansas City, are both opportunities for Democrats to flip seats. If Davids succeeds, she could be one of the first Native American women elected to Congress. ","kentucky":"President Trump won Kentucky by almost 30 points, but a competitive House race has emerged in the state's 6th Congressional District. Rep. Andy Barr (R) has represented the Louisville-based district, where he's received at least 60% of the vote in his last two elections, since 2012. But Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, is giving Barr a run for his money. Democrats are focusing on health care in the race, while Republicans are trying to paint McGrath as a liberal who's out of touch with Kentucky. This is one of the most heavily watched races on both sides. ","louisiana":"Louisiana's \"jungle primary\" system is unique in the nation. The state doesn't hold traditional primaries to select party nominees, but rather has open elections with every candidate from any party. If one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, that person is elected. If no candidate reaches that threshold, the top two finishers advance to a runoff on Dec. 8. Whoever earns the most votes in that runoff is declared the winner. In 2016, Louisiana's Senate race and two of its House races went to runoffs, while the other three House races were decided on election night. There are no competitive House seats in the Bayou State this year.","maine":"Maine will make history in 2018, becoming the first state to use a ranked-choice voting system for federal offices in a general election. Voters passed a referendum in 2016 to adopt the system and reaffirmed their support in another vote for it during the June primary. Instead of selecting one candidate, under ranked choice voters have the option to rank the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate gets more than 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least support is eliminated, and those voters’ votes are redistributed to whomever they ranked second. This process continues until two candidates are left and one has the majority of the votes. The system could be important this year because of the competitive House race in the Pine Tree State. State legislator and Marine veteran Jared Golden (D) is trying to unseat Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in Maine's rural and competitive 2nd Congressional District. The governor's race is exempt from ranked-choice voting, but Republicans hope Shawn Moody can to hold on to the seat being vacated by term-limited Gov. Paul LePage (R). Moody faces a tough fight against Democratic state Attorney General Janet Mills.\n\n[Editor's note: In the results below, Maine's 2nd Congressional District reflects the outcome of ranked-choice voting tabulation. The town-level results for the 2nd Congressional District reflect voters' first choice on November 6.]","maryland":"Maryland, powered by liberals in Baltimore and suburban DC, consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections. However, the state has been led for four years by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, a popular moderate who is the favorite to be re-elected in November. Former NAACP President Ben Jealous is the Democratic nominee to challenge Hogan. Maryland's senior senator, Ben Cardin (D), is also up for re-election this year, but his race is not expected to be competitive. None of the state's eight House districts are seen as competitive. ","massachusetts":"Massachusetts voters are likely to re-elect both a liberal Democrat and a moderate Republican to statewide offices this year. Potential 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) is widely expected to defeat Geoff Diehl, a state legislator who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts. Gov. Charlie Baker (R) fits into the history of deep-blue Massachusetts electing moderate GOP governors (see: Mitt Romney). Baker has worked to distance himself from President Trump, who is very unpopular in Massachusetts. He's heavily favored in his race against Democrat Jay Gonzalez, a former health care executive and state official under then-Gov. Deval Patrick. The state's nine Democratic-held congressional seats are considered safe for the party, featuring Boston City Councilwoman Ayanna Pressley, who delivered a stunning defeat to 10-term Rep. Mike Capuano in the September primary to become the 7th District nominee.","michigan":"Michigan was part of the infamous \"blue wall\" for Hillary Clinton that crumbled in 2016 to hand President Trump the White House. The state had voted for Democrats in six consecutive presidential elections and supported President Obama in 2012 by 9 points before going for Trump by just over 10,000 votes. Trying to piggyback off that success, Republicans are targeting Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D) with Army combat veteran John James. While Democrats are more confident now about Stabenow's chances than they were a year ago, they know they can't take anything for granted. Democrats are increasingly optimistic they can flip Michigan's governorship, currently held by term-limited Gov. Rick Snyder (R). Former Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer faces Republican state Attorney General Bill Schuette for the top job. Several Republican House seats could also be in play, especially the 11th District, in the Detroit suburbs, and the 8th, in the Lansing area.","minnesota":"Minnesota is a critical battleground for control of the House (and a great barometer for the 2018 elections as a whole). Democrats are on offense in the affluent and well-educated 2nd and 3rd districts, which are fertile territory for Democrats to flip some seats in their quest for the majority. But President Trump carried both Minnesota's 1st District, in the rural southern part of the state, and 8th District, in the northern Iron Range region, by double digits in 2016 -- they are the GOP's best shots to pick up seats currently held by Democrats. Sen. Al Franken's resignation last year after allegations of sexual misconduct means that Minnesota will hold two Senate elections in 2018. Democrats are confident that Sen. Amy Klobuchar is widely expected to win her third term, but the special election to serve the rest of Franken's term could be a little more competitive. Sen. Tina Smith (D), appointed last December, is running against Republican state Sen. Karin Housley. With all that, plus a competitive gubernatorial race between Rep. Tim Walz (D) and former state lawmaker Jeff Johnson (R), it'll be a busy night in the North Star State. ","mississippi":"When seven-term Sen. Thad Cochran stepped down in March for health reasons, it set up Mississippi to have two Senate elections this year. Sen. Roger Wicker (R) is expected to win his first re-election campaign against state legislator David Baria (D). Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R), who was appointed to replace Cochran, will face two Democrats and one Republican in a \"jungle election\" to serve until the term ends in 2020. Former Rep. and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is the leading Democratic candidate, while conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who almost defeated Cochran in a 2014 GOP primary, is challenging Hyde-Smith from her right. If none of these candidates receives more than 50% of the vote, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff on Nov. 27. None of the candidates' party affiliations will be listed on the ballot. ","missouri":"Missouri is the site of one of the nation's most competitive Senate races. Sen. Claire McCaskill, who represents that state, which voted for Trump by almost 19 points, is one of the most vulnerable Democrats up in 2018. She faces Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley in a race that both sides are focusing on for control of the upper chamber. Democrats have attacked Hawley's record as attorney general and focused on health care, while Republicans have criticized McCaskill for voting against the Republican tax bill and using a private plane to get around the state. McCaskill won re-election in 2012, when Obama lost Missouri by 10 points, but the state has moved to the right since then. Whatever the outcome, this could be one of the closest races in the country, and it could keep results-watchers up late, as heavily Democratic St. Louis County traditionally is late to announce its results. ","montana":"Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat in a state that President Trump won by about 20 points, is vulnerable as he seeks a third term. Tester's opponent is Republican state auditor Matt Rosendale. Democrats have argued Rosendale is a developer from Maryland who dresses up as a Montana rancher. Rosendale's campaign focuses on his close ties to Trump and paints Tester as a liberal who is out of touch with his conservative state. The race for Montana's single House seat could also be competitive. Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte is up for his first full term after winning a highly publicized special election last year to replace Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Gianforte, who assaulted a reporter the night before his election victory, will face former state legislator Kathleen Williams (D). ","nebraska":"The most competitive race in Nebraska this year will be in Omaha's 2nd Congressional District. Rep. Don Bacon (R), a former Air Force general, was the only Republican to defeat an incumbent Democrat in 2016, former Rep. Brad Ashford. Ashford, a moderate, was hoping for a rematch against Bacon, but he lost the Democratic primary to the more progressive Kara Eastman. President Obama won the district in 2008 (and received an electoral vote for it), but it went Republican in 2012 and 2016. Nebraska is also home to both Senate and gubernatorial elections this year, but in a state that Trump won by 25 points in 2016, neither is expected to be competitive.","nevada":"As the only Republican senator up for re-election in a state where Hillary Clinton won in 2016, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller is the most endangered member of his party. First-term Rep. Jacky Rosen (D) is challenging Heller. Nevada has two competitive races for open House seats. In the Las Vegas suburbs, Democrat Susie Lee is taking on perennial candidate Danny Tarkanian (R), the son of hall of fame UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, to replace Rosen. In the 4th District, two former members of Congress, Steven Horsford (D) and Cresent Hardy (R), are trying to replace Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D), who isn't seeking a second term due to sexual harassment allegations. Nevada's gubernatorial race is also expected to be competitive: Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt faces Democrat Steve Sisolak, the chairman of the Clark County Commission. ","new-hampshire":"The race to watch in New Hampshire will be in the 1st Congressional District, in the eastern half of the state. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D) currently holds the seat, which has flipped between parties in five of the last six elections. Her retirement sets up a contest between Democratic state executive council member Chris Pappas and Republican Eddie Edwards, who served as New Hampshire's chief liquor enforcement officer. No matter who wins, Granite State history will be made on election night. Pappas would be the state's first openly gay congressman, while Edwards would be its first African-American representative. Elsewhere on the ballot, Gov. Chris Sununu is up for his second term. Despite being a Republican in a relatively blue state, Sununu is popular, and is favored against former state legislator Molly Kelly (D).","new-jersey":"New Jersey is a critical battleground for control of the House of Representatives. Democrats could pick up as many as four of the five Republican-held seats in the state. Two of the most vulnerable GOP districts are the 2nd and the 11th, where the Republicans who represent them are retiring. The 3rd and 7th districts will also be competitive for the GOP. On the Senate side, Democrat Bob Menendez is facing some competition as he seeks a third full term. New Jersey hasn't elected a Republican senator since 1972, but Menendez's ethical problems -- he was indicted on corruption charges but not convicted -- have made the race more interesting. Businessman Bob Hugin, the Republican nominee, is trying to seize on the charges, but Menendez remains ahead in most polls. ","new-mexico":"New Mexico is primed for Democrats to make some significant gains in the Land of Enchantment. Two members of Congress, Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham and Republican Steve Pearce, are running to replace GOP Gov. Susana Martinez. Martinez has seen her popularity drop in recent years, giving Democrats hope they could take the governor's mansion. Former Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson is trying to get back into the game with a Senate run in his home state. Johnson, who served two terms as New Mexico's governor, won just over 9% in his home state in the 2016 presidential election. Despite Johnson's history in the state, he and Republican Mick Rich are both underdogs against incumbent Sen. Martin Heinrich (D), who is seeking a second term. The state's most competitive House district is expected to be the 2nd, a rural district in the southern part of the state that Pearce currently represents as the only Republican member of the state's congressional delegation.","new-york":"New York is one of the bluest states in the country, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats who might run for president in 2020, are expected to be easily re-elected. There will be more drama at the House level, where as many as six seats in the Empire State could be in play, all of them currently held by Republicans. Watch for tight races in the 19th District, currently held by Rep. John Faso (R), and Rep. Claudia Tenney's (R) 22nd District to see how Democrats are faring in their quest for the majority. Faso is facing former Rhodes Scholar Antonio Delgado (D) and Tenney is up against state legislator Anthony Brindisi (D). ","north-carolina":"There are no significant statewide races in North Carolina this year, but Democrats think they have a chance to flip three of the state's House seats. The most competitive will be the 9th District, in the Charlotte suburbs. Rep. Robert Pittenger lost the GOP primary to conservative pastor Mark Harris, who will face Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine veteran who started a solar power company. In the traditionally Republican district, McCready's centrist campaign has drawn comparisons to Rep. Conor Lamb (D), who won a March special election in a red district in Pennsylvania. The 2nd and 13th districts could also be in play for possible Democratic pickups. ","north-dakota":"North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp might be the most endangered Democratic senator in the nation this fall. President Trump won North Dakota by more than 35 points, and Heitkamp's opponent, Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, has already been elected statewide as North Dakota's sole representative. Republicans have played up the economy and have tried to paint Heitkamp as too liberal for North Dakota, while Democrats have attacked Cramer on tariffs and health care. ","ohio":"After voting for President Obama twice, Ohio flipped and supported President Trump in 2016. With GOP Gov. John Kasich term-limited, the contest to replace him is one of the races to watch in the Buckeye State. State Attorney General Mike DeWine will look to keep control in GOP hands against Democrat Richard Cordray, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ohio also features a Senate seat that Republicans have been aiming for since Trump won the state in 2016. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D), who was mentioned as a potential VP candidate for Hillary Clinton, is up for re-election against Rep. Jim Renacci (R). Brown, well-known by voters across the state for his populist tendencies, is performing well in the polls and in a strong position to win re-election. At least three House Republicans are also in competitive races this fall, headlined by Rep. Steve Chabot in the 1st District, who faces Hamilton County official Aftab Pureval (D). ","oklahoma":"Oklahoma gave President Trump his third-largest margin of victory in 2016, but outgoing GOP Gov. Mary Fallin has been tarnished by budget problems and a nine-day teachers' strike. That's made what should be an easy gubernatorial election for Republicans a bit more complicated. The GOP primary for the top spot went to a runoff, with businessman Kevin Stitt ultimately winning the nod. He'll face former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson. If Democrats have a strong performance in November, keep on the lookout in the Sooner State for a possible Edmondson insurgency. ","oregon":"The gubernatorial race in Oregon could be surprisingly competitive on election night. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown, who was elevated to the top job in 2015 after John Kitzhaber resigned amid scandal, is up for re-election. Brown was elected in 2016 to finish out the term and must win in November to serve until 2022. Oregon is a blue state, but Brown hasn't been able to fully capitalize on that built-in advantage, leading some polls within or slightly above the margin of error. Republicans are excited about their candidate, state legislator Knute Buehler, but recognize a strong Democratic performance nationwide could help Brown keep the governor's mansion. The last time a Republican won a gubernatorial election here was in 1982. ","pennsylvania":"Pennsylvania voters will go to the polls under a new congressional map this fall after the state Supreme Court ruled the old Republican-drawn map unconstitutional due to gerrymandering. The shuffle could help Democrats gain as many as six seats in the delegation with the new 5th, 6th, 7th and 17th districts the most likely to flip. Notably, of those districts, only the 17th has a current Republican representative on defense: Rep. Keith Rothfus (R), who will face Rep. Conor Lamb (D) in a battle of incumbents. Lamb won a stunning special election in February that helped energize Democrats around the country and is in good shape to take the seat of this new district. It won't be all wins for Democrats, though. Democrats are almost guaranteed to lose one seat in Pennsylvania, as Lamb's current district was drawn into stronger Republican territory under the new map. Pennsylvania Democrats Gov. Tom Wolf and Sen. Bob Casey are also both up for re-election this year and widely expected to win. ","rhode-island":"There could be some drama in traditionally blue Rhode Island this fall as Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) seeks re-election against Allan Fung, the Republican mayor of Cranston. Raimondo defeated Fung four years ago with only 41% of the vote in a three-way race to win her first term. This year's race could be similarly tight, though Raimondo's support started to firm up after the state's late primary in September. She goes into election night with the advantage over Fung. Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who used his position on the Senate Judiciary Committee to argue against the nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is also up this year. He's the favorite to win re-election against former professional baseball player and Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Bob Flanders (R). ","south-carolina":"South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) took over the top job after Nikki Haley became the Trump administration's UN ambassador in 2017. Now he's up for his first full term against Democratic combat veteran and state Rep. James Smith. McMaster is the favorite to win re-election in this deep red state. The state's most competitive House race is expected to be in the 1st District, where Rep. Mark Sanford (R) lost his primary to state legislator Katie Arrington. Arrington is the favorite against Democratic attorney Joe Cunningham in the Charleston-based district, but a strong performance by Democrats could challenge that. ","south-dakota":"The race to replace term-limited South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R) could get interesting. GOP Rep. Kristi Noem and Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Billie Sutton are fighting for the state's top spot. Sutton, a moderate Democrat with deep ties to the state who was paralyzed in a rodeo accident, could make strong inroads, but Noem may have an advantage in this deep red state. Neither of South Dakota's senators faces the voters this year, and Republican Dusty Johnson is expected to win election to the state's lone House seat. ","tennessee":"A highly competitive Senate race has emerged in Tennessee — a state President Trump won by 26 points in 2016. Sen. Bob Corker (R), whose occasionally pointed language about the President has drawn headlines, is retiring. Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn is running for the seat, but she's drawn a formidable challenger in former Gov. Phil Bredesen — the last Democrat elected statewide in Tennessee. Bredesen talks up his independence on the trail and has built-in popularity from his two terms as governor. Republicans have focused on Blackburn's connection to Trump and tried to paint a vote for Bredesen as a vote for Democratic leadership. This could be one of the closest Senate races in November that decide which party takes the majority. Gov. Bill Haslam (R) is term-limited, but the race to replace him is not expected to be as competitive as the Senate contest. The Republican, businessman Bill Lee, is favored to win against former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean (D). ","texas":"Turning Texas blue is the white whale of Democratic political ambition. El Paso Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D) has garnered national headlines, enthusiasm and millions of dollars from Democrats around the country who want to see him unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. While O'Rourke has far outraised Cruz, it's yet to be seen whether that national excitement will turn into votes in Texas. Despite Texas' changing demographics, which could benefit Democrats, Trump won the state by 9 points, a larger margin than in Ohio, Arizona or Georgia. Democrats could still make gains at the House level in the 7th, 23rd, 32nd and potentially the 21st and 31st districts. Of those, the 7th, in the Houston suburbs, is expected to be the tightest. Rep. John Culberson (R) is facing Democratic lawyer Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in a tight race. Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is also up for re-election but he's expected to defeat former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez (D).","utah":"Mitt Romney is back. The former governor of Massachusetts and 2012 GOP presidential nominee is running to succeed Sen. Orrin Hatch (R), who is retiring after almost 40 years in the Senate. Romney is a heavy favorite in this red state that voted for Trump by 18 points. Utah Democrats nominated Jenny Wilson, a city council member from Salt Lake City. The state's most competitive House race is expected be in the 4th District, which spans the Salt Lake City suburbs, where Rep. Mia Love (R) is facing Ben McAdams, the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake County. It's more competitive than years past, but Love has the advantage going into November.  ","vermont":"Phil Scott is one of several GOP governors in generally blue New England states, and as they do with Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, Republicans feel confident about his chances. Even if Scott wins, his Democratic opponent, Christine Hallquist, has already made history as the first transgender woman to win a major party's nomination for governor. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who runs as an independent but caucuses with Democrats, is up for his third term in the Senate and is widely expected to defeat Republican businessman Lawrence Zupan (before considering a second presidential run in 2020). ","virginia":"After years as a critical swing state, Virginia has settled into the blue column in statewide races. Last year's win for Gov. Ralph Northam was one of the first major races to portend Democratic strength in the Trump era. Sen. Tim Kaine (D), up for a second term, is expected to defeat Corey Stewart, a Republican who has focused on cultural issues like preserving Confederate statues. On the House side, as many as four GOP-held seats could be in play, and one of the most high-profile races will be in the 10th District, in DC's outer suburbs. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) will try to hold the seat, while Democrat Jennifer Wexton hopes she can flip a district that supported Hillary Clinton by 10 points in 2016. Virginia has one of the first poll closing times on the East Coast, and those competitive seats could be an early indicator of how the vote may pan out for both parties. ","washington":"As many as three Republican House seats could be in play in Washington state this year. The most competitive district should be the 8th, in the eastern Seattle suburbs, where Rep. Dave Reichert (R) announced his retirement last year. The announcement opened the door for Democrats in a district that Hillary Clinton won by 3 points in 2016. Democrat Kim Schrier, a pediatrician, will face Republican Dino Rossi, a former state legislator, who is making his fourth run for federal or statewide office in the Evergreen State. Elsewhere on the ballot, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) is seeking her fourth term. She is heavily favored against Republican Susan Hutchison, a former journalist and state party official. ","west-virginia":"President Trump won West Virginia by more than 42 points -- a victory margin second only to Wyoming -- but Democrats still have some chances in the Mountain State. Sen. Joe Manchin (D), who served as West Virginia's governor before joining the Senate, is facing Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Morrisey won a highly contested primary in which he beat then-Rep. Evan Jenkins (R), who resigned in September to take a state court appointment. Trump's win margin in Jenkins' former district was greater than in the state as a whole, but the emergence of Democrat Richard Ojeda, a former Army paratrooper, has changed the dynamics of this House race. Ojeda, who openly talks about regretting his vote for Trump in 2016, is a populist state legislator who supports marijuana legalization and helped lead a statewide teachers' strike. He faces Republican state legislator Carol Miller. Both sides are strongly competing for this open seat.  ","wisconsin":"Scott Walker (R), the only governor in US history to survive a recall election, is seeking a third term in a race that's expected to be the tightest he's ever faced. Wisconsin went Republican in the 2016 presidential election for the first time since 1984, but it was the third-closest state in the nation. Democrats hope state schools chief Tony Evers is the nominee who will be able to knock Walker off his perch. The state's competitive House races include the 1st District, home of retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan (R), and Rep. Sean Duffy's (R) 6th District, north of Milwaukee. Despite Trump's victory in the Badger State, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) is favored in her re-election race against Republican state legislator Leah Vukmir.","wyoming":"There is a gubernatorial contest and a Senate race in Wyoming this year, but in a state that Trump won by more than 46 points, neither is expected to be competitive.

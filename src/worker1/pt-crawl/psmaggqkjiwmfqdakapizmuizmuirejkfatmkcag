He first made his mark in commercial art as the designer of tobacco labels. His artistic preparation was extensive: New York City, Paris before 1860, and London and Paris after the American Civil War (1877-1878). When the Civil War broke out he was at twenty-seven a dedicated supporter of the South; he joined the Richmond Howitzers in the Army of Northern Virginia, and eventually reached an officer’s rank in the engineering corps. During the four years of war service he spent most of his spare time drawing and painting his fellow soldiers. He thus provided valuable visual records of the American Civil War from the perspective of a Southerner.</p><p>After the armistice of 1865, the former Lieutenant pursued a career in painting and book illustration, and even earned commissions as a sculptor. His most significant periodical illustration is a humorous childhood piece, <span class="illustratrion">Caught in the Act</span>, in <span class="book">Harper's Bazar</span> (Vol. VIII): 22 May 1875. His most significant commission as a monumental sculptor was <span class="sculpture">The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument</span>, in Richmond, Virginia. Among the magazines for which he worked are <a href="../../../periodicals/harpers/index.html"><span class="book">Harper's Weekly</span></a>  and <span class="book">Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</span>. His style and taste were well suited to his best known book illustrations, those which he completed for Henry Watterson's <span class="book">Oddities in Southern Life and Character</span>. He was just one of five prominent illustrators whom Harper & Co. commissioned to work on the seven New York volumes of the <a href="../barnard/householdedition.html">Household Edition</a> of the 1870s, Some of his work is still accessible, including the painting <span class="painting">Boys Catching Rabbits</span> and <span class="illustration">Caught in the Act</span> from <span class="book">Harper's Bazaar</span> (Vol. VIII: 22 May 22 1875).</p><a href="2.html"><img src="2.jpg" height="135" border="0" class="floatright"/></a><a href="2.html"><img src="2b.jpg" height="135" border="0" class="floatright"/></a><a href = "9.html"><img src="9b.jpg" height="135" border="0" class="floatright"/></a><p>The Harper and Brothers' version of the <a href="../barnard/household.html">Household Edition</a> was just sixteen volumes (instead of the twenty-two-volume set issued in London by Chapman and Hall), and came out between 1872 and 1877.

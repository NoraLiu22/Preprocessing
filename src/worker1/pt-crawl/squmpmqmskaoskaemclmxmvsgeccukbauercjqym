<h3>Context of the Illustration: Another Gothic Fireside Scene</h3>

<p class="one">As he fell a musing in his chair alone, the healthy holly withered on the 
wall, and dropped — dead branches.</p>

<p>As the gloom and shadow thickened behind him, in that place where it had been 
gathering so darkly, it took, by slow degrees,— or out of it there came, by some unreal, 
unsubstantial process — not to be traced by any human sense,—an awful likeness of 
himself!</p>

<p>Ghastly and cold, colourless in its leaden face and hands, but with his features, and 
his bright eyes, and his grizzled hair, and dressed in the gloomy shadow of his dress, it 
came into his terrible appearance of existence, motionless, without a sound. As he 
leaned his arm upon the elbow of his chair, ruminating before the fire, <em>it</em> 
leaned upon the chair-back, close above him, with its appalling copy of his face looking 
where his face looked, and bearing the expression his face bore.</p>

<p>This, then, was the Something that had passed and gone already. This was the dread 
companion of the haunted man!</p>

<p>It took, for some moments, no more apparent heed of him, than he of it. The Christmas 
Waits were playing somewhere in the distance, and, through his thoughtfulness, he seemed 
to listen to the music. It seemed to listen too.</p>

<p>At length he spoke; without moving or lifting up his face.</p>

<p>“Here again!” he said.</p>

<p>“Here again,” replied the Phantom. [Chapter I, "The Gift Bestowed," 33-34]</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
 
<p class="one">John Leech's first plate for the program, a nearly full-page vignette that 
treats the <em>Doppelganger</em> scene, compels the reader to return to Tenniel's earlier 
treatments of the same theme. This time, we have dialogue and explication on the previous 
page running over to the top of the illustration. How convenient that the sentence "This 
was the dread companion of the haunted man!" sits immediately above the figures. Leech's 
chair is less fanciful and his version of the spirit more substantial than their 
counterparts in the <span class="illustration">Frontispiece</span> (<a href="#gc1">see 
below</a>). Leech has made Redlaw's study lighter, permitting us to see far more detail 
in the bookcase at the back. We can see "his drugs and instruments and books" (3), but 
not "the shadow of his shaded lamp . . . , motionless among a crowd of spectral shapes" 
(3). Thus, not only Tenniel's opening plates, but also a textual passage many pages 
earlier have prepared us for this scene, the second visitation of the Ghost. The moment 
captured is that before Redlaw notices and addresses the Phantom. While Redlaw gazes into 
the fire, the Phantom's thoughtful gaze is bent on the Chemist, and not on the fire, too, 
as in the text: "It took, for some moments, no more apparent heed of him, than 
he of it" (35). Leech seems to have made this alteration in order to make his rendering 
of the two parallel Tenniel's.</p>

<p>Gone are the good angels and demons, replaced by commonplace objects, which 
nevertheless appear ominous in the half-light: is that a skull on the top shelf and a 
demon's mask above, or are these only ocular delusions? Redlaw's chair in Leech's plate 
is more prosaic (no carved gargoyle supports the arm of this chair). The spectre does 
not whisper at Redlaw's ear like Satan at the ear of Eve in <span class="book">Paradise 
Lost</span>; rather, Leech brings out the physical likeness in their features as Redlaw, 
seeing past wrongs re-enacted in the flames, is sardonically scrutinized by his double, 
whose body fades into the back of the chair and the curtain, right. Redlaw's hair is 
less full in Leech's version; his hairline recedes, giving him a more middle-aged and 
careworn aspect. His demeanour is not fearful, as in Tenniel, but bemused. In addition 
to the small library seen also in Tenniel's plate, the bookcase behind the figures 
contains glass jars, indicative of Redlaw's scientific vocation. Leech has captured the 
moment on the preceding page when "As he leaned his arm upon the elbow of his chair, 
ruminating before the fire, it leaned upon the chair-back close above him" (33). One 
reads page 33 with anticipation, glancing back to examine the  textual details more 
carefully once one turned the page, then moves back to that central moment hinted at in 
Dickens's title (top, 34). The curtain to the right appears again, but at the left, in 
the seventh plate, thereby connecting the two in the pictorial narrative sequence.</p>

<H2>The Book That Wrote Itself (1999)</H2>

<P>D: Liam &Oacute; M&oacute;chain<BR>
S: Liam &Oacute; M&oacute;chain, Antoinette Guiney</P>

<P>No budget feature from debuting writer, director, producer and star Liam
&Oacute; M&oacute;chain which blurs the boundaries between vanity production
and authorial <I>tour-de-force</I>. The story revolves around &Oacute; M&oacute;chain
himself, who has just written what he thinks should be the great Irish novel,
a mythological story encompassing all of the great hallmarks of classic
narrative. When he is literally laughed at by publishers, he sets out to
prove the relevance of the story to today by finding modern Irish equivalents
to the quests and trials undergone by his characters. To this end he enlists
the help of a would-be filmmaker, Antoinette Guiney, who is to chronicle
his adventures. She is more interested in shooting a documentary profile
of this extraordinary character, so as she participates in his various hare-brained
schemes to steal precious objects and overcome self-made obstacles on the
roads of Ireland, she records the story outside the story as well as the
story itself. It is all terribly self-reflexive, obviously, but not entirely
without internal consistency. </P>

<P><I>The Book That Wrote Itself</I> evidently flies by the seat of its
proverbial pants, with &Oacute; M&oacute;chain's not unlikable persona as
the centre of most of what makes it work. His gentle self-mockery allows
the film to critique the spirit of entrepreneurial abandon which it also
celebrates, and though he is no actor, he does exactly what he needs to
to hold the film together. The climax comes when, having been convinced
by conversations in the festival bar at the Galway Film Fleadh that his
story is best told as cinema, &Oacute; M&oacute;chain the character travels
to the Cannes Film Festival. Under the guise of a reporter working for Irish
television and taking advantage of the legislation covering the right to
use interview material intended for publicity purposes, &Oacute; M&oacute;chain
the director manages to get cameo appearances from George Clooney, Kenneth
Brannagh, Melanie Griffith, Bryan Singer, and Chazz Palminteri, among others.
Though the footage is fairly clumsily integrated into the story, the scene
is quite funny in context, and it epitomises the 'everything including the
kitchen sink' attitude of the movie.</P>

<P>Best understood as part of a tradition of low budget Irish cinema of
the 1990s including the likes of <I><A HREF="cheat.htm">How to Cheat in
the Leaving Certificate</A></I>, <I>November Afternoon</I>, and <A HREF="ldid.htm"><I>Last Days in Dublin</I>,</A> <I>The Book That Wrote Itself</I>
is not going to impress anyone on the grounds of technical quality. It is
done well given the resources at its disposal, but there is an inevitable
mental adjustment required to accommodate the low resolution imagery, limited
depth of field, dodgy lighting, variable sound quality, and amateur acting.
No one watching the film would expect fireworks, so it gets by on the level
at which it is pitched. That said, the editing is solid enough to keep it
lively. Editor Ray Fallon and supervising editor Coil&iacute;n &Oacute;
Scola&iacute; ensure that the performances are never given enough time to
become annoying and that the audience is not distracted by the blurry hand-held
home-movie nature of the images. This is a clever use of resources which,
along with &Oacute; M&oacute;chain's evident personality, it is the film's
strongest card.</P>

<P>Though it runs out of steam before its 71 minutes are up, this is just
because the gag winds down before the script does. A romantic sub-plot exploring
tensions between &Oacute; M&oacute;chain and Guiney peters away in the face
of the lack of actual acting ability, but the film does rally for a final
narrative twist which fits the story well. The running motif of the schism
between fiction and documentary works well enough as far as it goes, but
there is no attempt to broaden it out into full-blown mockumentary. It remains
basically an amateur feature, and it is neither the first nor the last of
its kind (<A HREF="ldid.htm"><I>Last Days in Dublin</I> </A>actually came
after).</P>

<P>It is worth noting for the record that the entire production of this
film proves the fact that life imitates art imitating life. With a real
life doggedness reflected in his on screen characterisation, &Oacute; M&oacute;chain
has been tireless in self promotion of this movie, touring to virtually
every film festival which would let him enter it with his film cans in tow.
It has managed to pick up some awards and has been shown perhaps as widely
as any Irish feature, at least geographically speaking.</P>

<p class="one">While Dickens's original <span class="book">Christmas
Carol</span> illustrator, <a href="../leech/index.html">John Leech</a>, never
attempted the challenging and contradictory figure of "The First of the Three
Spirits," the child/old man with white hair and skin of "the tenderest bloom,"
Eytinge realizes this strange figure effectively in three separate, full-page
plates — the frontispiece, "Scrooge's Christmas Visitors,"  "The
Spirit of
Christmas Past" (p. 36), and "A Retrospect" (p. 50), as well as in the vignette
at the head of Stave 2, "The Vision of Ali Baba" (p. 34), in which, in
anticipation of Bob Cratchit's carrying Tiny Tim in the vignette "Tiny Tim's
Ride" (p. 56) — incidentally the first artistic rendering of
that scene in
the streets of Camden Town — Scrooge is actually holding the diminutive
spirit in his left arm. Eytinge has realized the problematic figure by making
the head of a lesser rather than greater scale than an adult's relative to the
body, but otherwise, as the text stipulates, retaining  "a child's proportions,"
the spirit's long arms, "dress trimmed with summer flowers," and the jet of
light springing from its head. The only property of the spirit that Leech
realized in <a href="../carol/4.html">"Scrooge extinguishes the First of
the Three Spirits"</a>, "a great extinguisher for a cap," Eytinge employs in
three of the four representations to maintain narrative-pictorial
continuity.</p>

<p>The first of these occurs in the frontispiece, the only Eytinge illustration
that is a type of postmodernist synthesis rather than a realisation of
an actual
moment in the text. Scrooge looks up in wonder untainted by fear at the "Jolly
Giant" of Christmas Present, apparently ignoring the ominous
implications of the
spectre clad in a black shroud. In fact, none of them appears to Scrooge when
he is in bed, but all three, Past, Present, and Future, do indeed "contend"
within him after their monitory visitations, and just as the Spirits "can do
anything they like" (Stave 5), including defying temporal boundaries, so the
visual artist (implies Eytinge) can disregard the limitations imposed by the
author. The plate prepares the reader for those key moments of confrontation in
the text, but undoubtedly even in 1868 rehearsed for many American
readers their
experience with that culturally iconic text over the past two decades, a
foreshadowing then that is also a flashback, a recollection and reification of
readings and Christmases past.</p>

 <LI> The search looks across all English translations of Greek and Latin writers, which are either stored on <A HREF="related.html">related sites</A> or mentioned in the <A HREF="sources.html">list of sources and translations</A>.
  
 <LI> As usual with Google, the search is extremely thorough, but can be confused by keywords that produce a large number of results; you are <B>strongly recommended</B> to refine the search by using multiple keywords - see <A HREF="http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=134479">Google basic search help</A>.

 <LI> However, if searching for proper names, the search will be unable to distinguish between different people or places with the same name; and the results will not be returned in any particular order.

 <LI> You should also remember that some of the pages that are being searched are quite long, and the keyword(s) may occur several times in them; only the first occurrence will be reported. 

 <LI> The spelling of Greek proper names may be inconsistent across different sites - see <A HREF="spelling.html">Spelling of Greek names</A> for some details.

 <LI> For these reasons, if you are searching for a proper name, it may be better to use the <A HREF="../names/index.html">index of names</A>, although this is restricted to names that appear on the <I>attalus</I> website.  

 <LI> The search is still being developed and extended, but any <A HREF="comments.html">comments or suggestions</A> would be very welcome.

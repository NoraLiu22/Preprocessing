<h3>Formation of the Moon</h3>
</b>
<ul>
	<li>According to the most widely accepted theory of the formation of the Moon, 
the Moon formed when a Mars-sized object collided with the Earth about 4.5 
billion years ago ('Giant Impact Theory').</li>
	<li>Consistent with the collision theory:<ul>
		<li>The <a href="media/mooncore.gif">composition 
of the Moon</a> is very similar to the Earth's mantle. The Moon has very little 
iron in its core.</li>
		<li>Computer simulations confirm the impact hypothesis.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibV4MdN5wo0&amp;feature=related">
	video</a> goes over some of the history of this theory and has some nice 
	animations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Failed theories on the origin of the Moon</h3>
</b>
<ul>
	<li>Fission theory--A molten Earth budded off the Moon. This theory failed 
	because it would imply:<ul>
		<li>a ring of smaller moons rather than one big one</li>
		<li>the moons would fly off and then fall back to Earth (i.e., stable 
		orbit is unlikely)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Co-accretion theory--The Moon formed at the same time as the Earth from 
	the same material. This theory failed because it would imply:<ul>
		<li>Moon should have an iron-rich core like the Earth, bit it does not.</li>
		<li>The Moon is moving away from the Earth and, on &quot;playback&quot; appears to 
		have been born from the Earth.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Capture theory--The Moon was captured by the Earth like many of the 
	moons of Jupiter. This theory failed because:<ul>
		<li>A captured moon would follow an elliptical orbit. However, the Moon 
		follows an almost circular orbit.</li>
		<li>The Moon is too big to be captured. A collision with Earth would be 
		more likely.<br>

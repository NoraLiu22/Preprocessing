          by historians. Many of these accounts have been compiled long after 
          the events happened and in many cases diaries were confiscated, lost 
          or deliberately destroyed by either their German or Soviet captors.

        </ul>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of these stories 
          have not given graphic detail in the over-coming of the horror, suffering 
          and often appalling or dangerous conditions that had to be overcome 
          in order to survive. Events surrounding the repatriation of those captured 
          by the Soviets are far from satisfactory and remain sinister. The genocide 
          committed by the Soviets remains both unacceptable and inexplicable 
          despite various attempts both during and after the 'Cold War' where 
          pressure to even concede acknowledgement of the horror has failed. These 
          Poles were treated as political prisoners and not servicemen and in 
          the eyes of the Soviets, not covered by the Geneva Convention. The regime 
          within the gulags and other camps in prohibited areas meant certain 
          death. Indeed, the British Government in the year 2000 still has not 
          officially apologised for its part in the 'official' denial of Stalin's 
          role in the cover-up of the murders. The horror of the Katyn Massacre 
          and the deliberate inhumane conditions in the gulags should never be 
          forgotten. In the case of the Katyn massacre only 4,421 are known to 
          have died. Another 4,000 are believed to lie still largely hidden in 
          the forest with another 13,000 or more not accounted for. Recently released 
          archive material indicates Krushchev knew of 10,000 Polish officers 
          being shot in 1940 by the NKVD in two other locations near Russian cities. 
          Anders (1949) estimated that between 1.5m - 1.6m Poles ranging from 
          military personnel to priests and other professional people (including 
          Ukrainians, White Russians, and Jews) were captured and deported from 
          Eastern Poland. Those numbers trickling out of the gulags were substantially 
          less. The Soviets massaged 'records' only showed 475,000 Poles captured. 
          Of the 15,000 prisoners which entered the notorious camps at Kozielsk, 
          Starobielsk and Ostashkov, only a few hundred emerged (Anders, 1949; 
          Lisiewicz, 1949) to re-enlist. Lisiewicz (1949) indicates that of 20,000 
          Poles sent to the lead mines in Kolyma a few hundred left the camp, 
          but only 20 made it to the recruiting station. Out of 3,000 Poles sent 
          to the lead mines in North Kamchatka in August 1940 only 300 survived 
          and were in the final agonising stages of death from lead poisoning. 
          Requests for further information on missing personnel largely went unanswered. 
          The Eastern Archives, based in Warsaw have evidence from former NKVD 
          files than another 500,000 needs to be added to earlier estimates to 
          attain a truer figure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of these stories 
          include patriotism; physical and mental hardship mixed with a sense 
          of duty rather than adventure. In many cases an urgent desire to survive 
          in order to fight for the re-establishment of Poland and bring about 
          justice was a driving force. All these stories are unique and need to 
          be told. For younger generations or those unfamiliar with Eastern and 
          Central Europe, follow the stories with the aide of a map to reveal 
          the fantastic geographical dimension to the stories.</font></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Evacuation Routes 1939 
          -1940</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision to 
          evacuate was based on the notion that after the fall of Poland, its 
          navy, soldiers and airmen would be needed in the defence of France an 
          Britain. Internment was expected in neutral countries like Romania (who 
          had signed an alliance with Poland before the war) Hungary, Latvia and 
          Lithuania. The evacuation was meticulously planned in terms of logistics 
          in civilian clothing, visas and passports despite growing pressure by 
          Germany upon the Romanians and Hungarians to keep the Poles caged up 
          in 'camps' (Lisiewicz, 1949).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almost all those 
          interned in transit camps in Hungary and Rumania escaped between the 
          autumn of 1939 and the summer of 1940 and amounted to 15,978 officers 
          and other ranks to Britain with another 1,378 from other countries. 
          Under pressure, the Hungarian and Romanian governments became anti-Polish 
          while the people remained largely supportive and assisted in escapes. 
          Conditions in the camps were very poor and medical support at best totally 
          inadequate. Shortages of quinine meant many interned in camps in the 
          Danube basin in the region of Tulcea suffered from malaria. <a href="stefan.html">More</a></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the outbreak 
          of war, British, Polish and French delegates met at the French Air Ministry, 
          Paris (25.10.39) to discuss how to utilize the Polish armed services 
          personnel now available. General Sikorski had become the new commander 
          in chief and was highly respected by the PAF. The Poles wanted to re-establish 
          their airforce in Britain due to the RAF having superior equipment than 
          the French and they had also been given some training on British made 
          equipment. It was the French who suggested the service personnel should 
          be divided equally for incorporation into their armed services for a 
          speedier reinforcement (Lisiewicz, 1949). Britain agreed to take 300 
          pilots and 2,000 technical support staff while the residue would be 
          eventually moved to front-line units in France. Group Captain A.P. Davidson 
          who had acted as the Air AttachÃ© in Warsaw had a high regard for the 
          quality and training of the PAF and saw an opportunity to borrow navigators 
          to make up a shortfall in the RAF. The British and French legations 
          in Bucharest were contacted to help General Zajac, the commander of 
          the PAF to help set up a clandestine network for the evacuation of over 
          90,000 personnel from the Rumanian camps. This was done under the noses 
          of Gestapo agents who now riddled the country, watching all movement 
          and traffic (Zamoyski, 1995).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most escapees were 
          directed to Constanza, Balic or Efori on the Black Sea then via Syria 
          or Malta and then onto France. Another major route directed escapees 
          to Split in Yugoslavia and then by ship to France. Some were directed 
          to Piraeus in Greece (Lisiewicz, 1949; Zamoyski, 1995). Some solo escapees 
          went by foot through Yugoslavia through northern Italy and into France. 
          The programme of evacuation was reasonably orderly despite the frustrations 
          of the internees and anger at the collapse of Poland. The Yugoslavs, 
          Greek and Italians in particular assisted in the evacuation and the 
          crossing of borders.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Life in the camps 
          was not easy. Initially someone had to be blamed and so anger was vented 
          on the ineffectiveness of the generals, the Polish Government and factions 
          within the armed services. Added to their problems, the Rumanians and 
          Hungarians were under increasing pressure to detain and keep the internees 
          in camps. Pro-German supporters, particularly in Rumania were openly 
          anti-Polish where personal security was repeatedly threatened. Reneging 
          on agreements and betrayal were common and required corruption of local 
          officials to 'look the other way'. German intelligence and the Gestapo 
          had extensive networks of spies monitoring the internees. Germany protested 
          repeatedly at the lax security in the camps in order to deny the British 
          and French additional trained personnel. After November 1939 camp security 
          was tightened up and officers and other ranks dispersed to Southern 
          Romania. In Rumania as the camp head counts diminished, Rumanians officials 
          regularly falsified returns with 'ghost' numbers to avoid the wrath 
          of their German paymasters</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the first 
          groups to escape the Balkans were trans-shipped directly to France or 
          made their way by being re-routed to Palestine then via North Africa 
          in a variety of vessels ranging from cargo ships to former cruise and 
          passenger liners. Not all escapees travelled in luxury. Far from it 
          and for many the final leg of the journey to freedom were as uncomfortable 
          as those in the internment camps. When the war in North Africa threatened 
          these routes, longer journeys via South Africa were introduced.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For those groups 
          of PAF, who fled to Latvia, they had mainly fought for the 5th Airforce 
          regiment and had been based at Lida. Under pressure from the German 
          army in the west and the Soviets in the east, the remnants were evacuated 
          from Porubanek airfield near Wilno. A twelve-hour dash to the border 
          resulted in disarmament by the Latvians citing international law and 
          being marched to a temporary camp at Zemgale. After three days they 
          were transferred to the fortress at Libau. Latvian Poles assisted in 
          some escapes, but officers were moved to Ulbroki near Riga. Very few 
          made it out via Sweden and Norway to France. The Soviet invasion saw 
          all Polish internees moved to the gulags. The Soviets only changed their 
          minds after 'Operation Barbarossa' when Germany invaded Russia. By then, 
          thousands had been systematically killed and few survived. Lisiewicz 
          (1949) records only 200 PAF came to Britain via Archangel who had been 
          interned in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Hungary over 
          1,000 members of the PAF were interned after the fall of Poland (Lisiewicz, 
          1949; Zamoyski, 1995) and were mainly made up of the ground staff of 
          operational units that had flown to Rumania. These units had been cut 
          off by the advancing Soviet army who had deliberately fought hard to 
          take control of the roads and passes to freedom in Hungary and Rumania. 
          By 18th September 1939 the PAF units trapped in the Halicz - Podhajce 
          area had been joined by the 10th Armoured Brigade. The group broke out 
          through the Prut valley on the 20th September and escaped across the 
          Jablonkow Pass in the Carpathian Mountains to Hungary. There were no 
          formal diplomatic ties or agreements with Hungary and so these service 
          personnel expected not only internment, but also harsher treatment than 
          those who had made it successfully to Romania. With uniforms in tatters 
          and worn-out boots, the Poles relinquished their arms and started interment. 
          Through age old ties, the sympathetic Hungarians (Sisa, 1984) began 
          to resettle 100,000 soldiers and the PAF units in camps in the Miskolcs 
          military region in north and north-west Hungary or around the beautiful 
          Lake Balaton. The accommodation ranged from barracks, disused factories 
          or deserted summer resorts. The greatest concentrations of PAF personnel 
          were at Nagy-Kata camp or at Jolsva.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially the regulations 
          in the camps were lax and the whole experience quite genial compared 
          to their compatriots in Rumania. Self-governance was permitted and visiting 
          local towns required little formality. Like Rumania, German protests 
          attempted to cut the number of 'escapes' or absentee personnel. While 
          camp life was monotonous, behind the scenes preparations were being 
          made under the guise of the Committee for Hungarian - Polish Affairs. 
          Various bodies were set up for the care of both military and civilian 
          refugees for medical, cultural and employment activities. In Budapest, 
          the Polish Red Cross and the Polish Catholic Church were allowed to 
          operate quite openly. Hungarian-Polish activities were well organized 
          and an undercover network was formed. Over 30,000 Poles were clandestinely 
          smuggled over the border to Yugoslavia.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the European 
          war escalated, Hungary became politically trapped. The 'Little Entente' 
          which included Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Rumania collapsed and a treaty 
          of 'eternal frienship' with Yugoslavia signed by Premier Count PÃ¡l Teleki 
          at the end of 1940 propelled Hungary to war after a coup in Yugoslavia 
          forced Hitler to invade via Hungary. Count PÃ¡l Teleki committed suicide 
          over Hungary's breach of faith. By February 1940 the movement of Polish 
          personnel had become restricted and passports no longer honoured. Visas 
          were being refused for all those aged under forty-five and by then most 
          internment camps held very few military personnel. Evacuations had continued 
          throughout this period despite some pro-Nazi sympathies in the Hungarian 
          military and government. Msgr. BÃ©la Varga became pro-active in assisting 
          the underground movement to enable the escape of hundreds of trapped 
          Frenchmen as well as the Poles. Under his guidance he set up at BalatonboglÃ¡r 
          a Polish high School and a LycÃ©e to ensure young men and women continued 
          with or completed their education. <a href="zwk.html">More</a>. President 
          Hortha appointed LÃ¡slÃ³ BÃ¡rdossy as premier after the death of Count 
          PÃ¡l Teleki and Hungary became less tolerant of escaping Poles.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The individual escape 
          routes were almost as many as the escapees themselves. Some crossed 
          Germany and into France via the Low Countries while a few made it via 
          the Scandinavian countries. Most crossed the Carpathian Mountains and 
          headed south. At the outbreak of war and the subsequent partitioning 
          of Poland with the Soviets, most passes were strongly guarded. The first 
          winter of the war was harsh. No one has estimated how many either perished 
          in the snow or were hunted down like animals by the Gestapo and NKVD 
          (Lisiewicz, 1949; Pruszynski 1941) and summarily shot. Ownership of 
          skis was punishable by death. The Underground Movement provided guides 
          (Pruszynski 1941; Novak, 1982) for a hazardous journey which lasted 
          about four days for the luckier ones. The mountain ranges were riddled 
          with trails used for smuggling and legends of robbers abound in the 
          folklore of the GoralÃ©. Littered with caves, the area was difficult 
          for the Nazis or NKVD to clear of resistance movements, hence towns 
          like Zakopane in southern Poland became designated 'Sperrgebiet'. Underground 
          movements and Resistance were dealt with harshly by both the Gestapo 
          and the NKVD. <a href="zwk.html">More</a>.</font></p>
          <p>
            When Poland fell in September 1939 to German occupation, many Polish POWs escaped and headed south for Hungary where the government was sympathetic to the Poles.  Large numbers of "breakouts" caused the Nazis to demand greater control and better security at the camps.  Although it was roughly complied with, numerous escapes were known to local officials who acted with little haste.  Officers were breaking out and arriving in Budapest where the exiled government provided the means of escape.   Germany had originally requested Count PÃ¡l Teleki, the Hungarian Premier to allow Hungary to become a springboard for the invasion against Poland which had been turned down.  When Poland had collapsed it is estimated over 100,000 soldiers had crossed the border.  The Hungarians formed a national movement "Hungarians for the Poles" and was supported by all social strata.   The Committee for Hungarian-Polish Refugee Affairs co-ordinated the administration and care of military and civilian refugees which brought together the Hungarian Polish University Alliance, the Hungarian-Polish Scout movement, the Red Cross, and the Catholic Church together with the Hungarian Mickiewicz Society.

            From Budapest, one of the escape routes took the escapees to Osd, Miskoll, Hatuan, Godollo with a final train trip to Kelti.  Here the escapees walked to the Yugoslavian border by means of safe houses and guides till crossing the river Drave where the border meanders like the river.  Not far from Barcs is an island on the Hungarian side of the border which made crossing into Croatia relatively safe.  Then on to Zagreb, Split and a boat to France, usually Marseilles to re-join the Polish Army in France.  It is estimated 30,000 Poles were smuggled clandestinely out across the Yugoslav border with passports by an underground Hungarian-Polish network.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the shortest escape routes was through Croatia.  The border with Croatia was an obstacle to individual escapees.  However, at Barcs, a small market town situated on the river, the border was a weak point for control.  With good access from Budapest, the escape route was secure and hardly watched.  The town had a significant Jewish community making up half the population and hostile to the Hungarians (TNA HS4 â 214).

            The escaped POWs were assisted by:
            <ol>
              <li>Dr. Karoly Berenkay, The District Officer and his wife.</li>
              <li>Josef Legrady a clerk at the district office (who was later dismissed from his post by Nazi supporters)</li>
              <li>Commandant of the Gendarmerie post</li>
              <li>Gendarmerie agents</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Barcs was an ideal location since the local sawmill provided a suitable hiding place and the Hungarian night-watchman was in the former Polish Legions during 1914-1918 war.  Elizabeth Pollitzer assisted crossings through her brother obtaining necessary documents for crossing into Croatia.  The actual crossing was at DarÃ¡ny, a small hamlet 7 Kms from Barcs where the crossing was ideal in a low populated area and little watched (TNA HS4 â 214) with a sympathetic local mayor.  

Two other escape lines existed in the area:
<ul>
<li>The Kadarkut Line run by a Pole named Spasinski</li>
<li>The Rabocse Line: 15 Kms from Barcs and 3 Km from the river Drava where horses and boats would cross the river with the help of Dr. Jeszensky.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  It was a daring and highly successful multi-organisational operation providing experienced servicemen and women for Britainâs war effort.

          Zakopane was a âgatewayâ through the Tatra mountains and Slovakia to Hungary.  Couriers had used centuries old smuggling routes through the mountains often travelling alone or in some cases assisting infiltration of agents or exfiltration of escapees bound for Budapest.  In Budapest the <i>AK</i> had a bureau supported by VI Bureau and had collaborative links to SIS (Section D) to assist in the smuggling of W/T sets, spares, currency, and propaganda.  Small arms were limited due to weight and distance to be carried.

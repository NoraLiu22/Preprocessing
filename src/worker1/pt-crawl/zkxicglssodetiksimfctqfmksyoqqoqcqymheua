[Cicero]  delivered this oration in the year in which Pompeius was 
consul for the third time  [52 B.C.],  on the  7th day before the  Ides of 
April  [April 7] .  While the court was in session,  an army was stationed by 
Cnaeus Pompeius in the Forum and in all the temples which are located 
around the Forum   We know this not just from the oration itself and the 
circumstances of those years, but in particular from the book which was 
published under Cicero's name called  <em>de optimo genere oratorum</em>  [52 
B.C.].<br><br>

<p align="justify">
Titus Annius Milo [Papianus],  Publius Plautius Hypsaeus,  and  Quintus 
Metellus Scipio  sought the consulship  [in 53, for 52]  not only by spreading largesse 
openly but also accompanied by crews of armed men.  There was the greatest possible 
personal hostility between Milo and Clodius, both because Milo was very close to 
Cicero and he had used his weight as tribune of the plebs in bringing Cicero back from 
exile;  and because Publius Clodius was exceedingly hostile to Cicero once he had 
been brought back and was on that account very zealously supporting the candidacies 
of Hypsaeus and Scipio.  Milo and Clodius also often engaged in violence with each 
other with their gangs in Rome.  The chutzpah  was equally outrageous on both sides,  
but Milo generally took the side of the `better interests'.  Besides that, in the same year  
Milo decided to stand for the consulship, and Clodius for the Praetorship (which he 
knew perfectly well would be less influential, if Milo were consul).  In addition,  when 
the electoral assemblies for consul went on for a long time, and were not able to 
produce a winner due to the very same riotous activities of the candidates, [p. 31 C; 27 
KS]  and for that reason  in the month of January there were no consuls and no 
praetors at all, while the assemblies were being drug out just exactly as before--though 
Milo wanted the election to be completed as quickly as possible and was expecting that 
they would be thanks to the efforts of the aristocracy because he was standing in the 
way of Clodius, and also in the way of the populus on account of the  `gifts' which had 
been showered on them and the staggeringly huge costs of the theatrical spectacles 
and gladiatorial fight (on which Cicero remarks he had poured out three patrimonies).	<br><br>
	His competitors  wanted to drag things out,  and so for that reason Pompeius, 
the son-in-law of  [Metellus] Scipio, and  Titus Munatius [Plancus] tribune of the people 
had not allowed the question to be brought before the Senate as to the summoning of 
the Patricians to choose an  Interrex,  although a decree had been passed to name an  
interrex--on  January 18  (the Decree and the oration itself,  which agrees with the 
decree, ought to be followed as to the date,  I think,  rather than Fenestella,  who gives 
January 17);  on that day  Milo made his official departure for Lanuvium, of which town 
he was at the time Dictator  [chief magistrate ],  for the purpose of choosing a flamen on 
the next day.<br>
<br>	Clodius, who was returning from Aricia (he had been addressing the Town 
Council of Aricia),  ran into him around 3 p.m. a little beyond Bovillae, near the place 
where the shrine of the Bona Dea is located.  Clodius was riding a horse.  
Approximately 30 mounted slaves carrying swords were following him, as was the 
custom at the time with people making a trip.  Clodius also had three travelling 
companions with him:  a Roman knight  Caius Causinius Schola  and two well-known 
plebeians  Publius Pomponius and  Caius Clodius.  Milo was being carried in a carriage 
with his wife Fausta, the daughter of Lucius Cornelius Sulla the Dictator, and with his 
close friend Marcus Fufius.  [p. 32 C = 28 KL]  	A large contingent of slaves 
accompanied them, including gladiators; two of them were the famous Eudamus and 
Birria.  These were riding at the end of the column and made a charge on the slaves of 
Clodius.  When Clodius looked back at this disturbance with a threatening aspect, 
Birria wounded his shoulder with a thrust.  Thereupon, when the battle had been 
begun, several of Milo's men rushed up.  The wounded Clodiuswas carried to the 
nearest wineshop, in Bovillae.  When Milo heard that Clodius had been wounded, while 
he realized that things would be even more dangerous for himself if Clodius were to 
survive, but, with him dead, he would have considerable peace of mind, even if he had 
to undergo some sort of punishment, he ordered him to be hustled out of the inn.  
Marcus Saufeius identified [Clodius] in advance to [Milo's] slaves.  And so Clodius, 
though in hiding, was drug out and done away with, with many wounds.  His dead body 
was left at the side of the road, because Clodius' slaves either had already been killed 
or were themselves in hiding with serious wounds.  Sextus Teidius, a Senator, who by 
chance was making his return to the city from the countryside, picked it up and ordered 
it to be carried to Rome in his own sedan.  He himself went back to where he had 
started from.</p>
<p align="justify">

	Clodius' corpse was brought back before 6:00 p.m., and a very large crowd of 
the lowest class of plebs and of slaves, with great lamentation, took up their positions 
around the corpse, when it was placed in the atrium of his house.  Fulvia, the wife of 
Clodius, added to the appalling nature of the deed, however, when she kept pointing 
out his wounds, while pouring out her grief.  Next day, at dawn, an even greater crowd 
of the same composition assembled, and several gentlemen of note were seen.  The 
house of Clodius, on the Palatine, had been bought a few months earlier from Marcus 
Scaurus: there came to this place Titus Munatius Plancus (the brother of the 
speechifier Lucius Plancus) and Quintus Pompeius Rufus (the grandson of Sulla the 
Dictator through his daughter), the tribunes [p. 33 C] of the plebs.  At the urging of 
these men, the common people carried down into the Forum and placed on the Rostra 
Clodius' nude and barefoot body, unprepared for burial, just as it had been put into the 
sedan, so that the wounds could be seen.</p>
<p align="justify">

	<span class="emphasized2">[29 KS]</span>   There, in front of a public meeting, Plancus and Pompeius, who were 
partisans of Milo's electoral opponents, roused hatred against Milo.  Under the direction 
of Sextus Clodius the scriba, the Populus carried the corpse of Publius Clodius into the 
Senate House and cremated it, using the benches and risers and tables and books of 
the stenographers; thanks to this fire the Curia itself also burned down, and also the 
Basilica Porcia, which was attached to it, was fired.  Also that same Clodian multitude 
attacked the residence of Marcus [Aemilius] Lepidus, the interrex, for he had been 
named the curule magistrate, and the absent Milo's too, but they were driven off from 
there by arrows.  Then the crowd brought the fasces which had been snatched from the 
grove of Libitina to the residence of Scipio and of Hypsaeus, and then to the gardens of 
Cnaeus Pompeius, shouting repeatedly that he should be (if he wished) consul, or (if 
he preferred) dictator.</p>
<p align="justify">

	The burning down of the Senate House raised a greater indignation by far in the 
city than the slaughter of Clodius.  And so Milo, whom general opinion believed to have 
gone into exile, encouraged by the hatred toward his adversaries returned to Rome the 
night that the Senate House had burned down.  And not in the least deterred, he began 
to campaign for the consulship.  Quite openly he gave to individuals tribe by tribe 
thousands of asses.  After some days Marcus Caelius, tribune of the plebs, turned over 
a public meeting to him, and Cicero himself also supported his cause to the populus.  
Both of them kept saying that an assassination plot had been laid for Milo by Clodius.
</p>
<p align="justify">

	Meanwhile one interrex succeeded another, because the electoral assemblies 
for consuls  [p. 34 C]  were not able to be held thanks to the same disorders on the part 
of the candidates and the same armed bands.  And so, first of all, a Decree of the 
Senate was passed, ordering the interrex and the tribunes of the plebs and Cnaeus 
Pompeius (who was right outside the City as proconsul)  `to see to it that the Republic 
should suffer no harm', and that Pompeius should hold a military recruitment drive 
throughout the whole of Italy.  When he put together a guard with extreme urgency, the 
two young aristocrats,  [p. 30 KS]  the Appius Claudius brothers, demanded in his 
presence that the slaves belonging to Milo and likewise those belonging to his wife 
Fausta be produced.  These Appii were the sons of Caius Claudius, who had been the 
brother of Clodius, and on this account they were beginning the prosecution for the 
murder of their paternal uncle, in the name of their father, as it were.  The two Valerii, 
Valerius Nepos and Valerius Leo, demanded the same slaves of Fausta and Milo.  
Lucius Herennius Balbus demanded the slaves of Publius Clodius too, and those of his 
travelling companions.  At the same time Caelius demanded the slaves of Hypsaeus 
and of Quintus Pompeius.  Quintus Hortensius, Marcus [Tullius] Cicero, Marcus 
[Claudius] Marcellus, Marcus Calidius, Marcus Cato, and Faustus [Cornelius] Sulla 
supported Milo.  Quintus Hortensius spoke a few words to the effect that those persons 
were free men who were being demanded as though they were slaves. For immediately 
after the slaughter Milo had liberated them, using as his reason that they had saved his 
life.  These affairs took up the intercalary month.
</p>
<p align="justify">

	On approximately the 30th day after Clodius had been killed, Quintus Metellus 
Scipio complained in a meeting of the Senate against Quintus Caepio concerning this 
slaughter of Publius Clodius.  He stated that it was a lie that Milo was defending 
himself, but that Clodius was accompanied by 26 slaves when he had set off to give a 
speech to the Town Council of Aricia.  But suddenly, after  10:00 a.m.,  [p. 35 C]  when 
the Senate meeting ended, Milo rushed off after him with more than 300 armed slaves,  
and attacked him unawares during his journey, beyond Bovillae.  At that point, Publius 
Clodius, having suffered three wounds, was carried to Bovillae.  The tavern in which he 
had taken refuge was attacked by Milo.  Clodius was drug out semiconscious and killed 
on the Appian Way. His ring was pried off his finger as he lay dying.  Then when Milo 
heard that Clodius' little son was in the Alban villa, he came to the villa, and after the 
boy had previously dragged off, he was asked permission by the slave Halicor to hack 
[Clodius] limb from limb; he strangled the steward and two servants besides.  Of the 
slaves of Clodius who were defending their master 11 had been killed, <span class="emphasized2">[p. 31 KS] </span>of 
Milo's only two had been wounded.  On account of this, next day Milo gave freedom to 
12 slaves who had taken the greatest part, and he distributed to the populus, tribe by 
tribe,  1000 sesterces each in order to kill the rumors about himself.  Milo was said to 
have sent people to Pompeius who were particularly friendly to Hypsaeus because 
Hypsaeus had been Pompeius's quaestor to say that Milo would quit his campaign for 
the consulship if Pompeius thought it a good idea.  Pompeius replied that he did not 
authorize anybody either to seek the office or to quit seeking it, and that he had no 
intention of interfering with the power of the Roman Populus either with his advice 
(consilium) or his official opinion (sententia).  Then, through Caius Lucilius, who was 
Milo's friend because of his familiarity with Marcus Cicero, he is said to have ordered 
them as well not to burden him down with hostility by asking his advice about this affair.
</p>
<p align="justify">

	In the midst of all this, as the rumor flew fast and thick that Cnaeus Pompeius 
ought to be created dictator and that the ills of the state could not otherwise be put to 
rest, <span class="emphasized2">[p. 36 C]</span>  it seemed to the optimates that it was safer for him to be named consul 
without colleague.  When the matter had been introduced in the Senate, by an act 
proposed by Marcus Bibulus, Pompeius was named consul by the Interrex Servius 
Sulpicius on the fifth day before the 1st of March in the intercalary month.  He 
immediately entered upon his consulship.  Next, two days later, he introduced the topic 
of making new laws: he promulgated two laws in accordance with senatorial decree, 
one de vi  (`on Violence') in which it remarked using names that a slaughter had taken 
place on the Via Appia, and the Senate House had been burned, and the house of the 
Interrex Marcus Lepidus had been attacked, and the other de ambitu  (`On Electoral 
Corruption'): the penalty was to be heavier and the forms of trial briefer.  For, in both 
cases, the law first ordered that witnesses be heard and then, on one and the same 
day, the summation be made both by the prosecution and the defense in such a way 
that two hours be allotted to the prosecution and three hours to the defense.  Marcus 
Caelius, tribune of the plebs, who was very energetic on Milo's behalf, made an attempt 
to obstruct these laws because (he said) a `personal bill' was being brought against 
Milo and because court judgments were being anticipated.  And when Caelius assailed 
the laws more persistently, Pompeius' annoyance reached the point that  <span class="emphasized2">[p. 32 KS]</span>  he 
said that if he were to be forced into it he would defend the Republic with military force.  
Pompeius, as a matter of fact, either stood in fear of Milo, or was pretending that he 
was afraid.  For the most part he did not stay at his town residence but in his Gardens, 
and he himself slept out of doors, in the most elevated part of the gardens, around 
which he also had a large guard of soldiers.  Pompeius also once suddenly adjourned 
the Senate, because he said he was afraid of the appearance (adventum) of Milo.  
Then at the next meeting Publius Cornificius announced that Milo had a weapon inside 
his tunic strapped to his leg. He demanded that the thigh be bared, and Milo lifted his 
tunic without delay.  At that point Marcus Cicero cried out that all the other charges 
which were being made against Milo were just like that one.</p>
<p align="justify">

<span class="emphasized2">[p. 37C]</span>  Then Titus Munatius Plancus, tribune of the plebs, brought Marcus Aemilius 
Philemon, the freedman of M[arcus Aemilius] Lepidus and a well-known person, 
forward into the meeting.  He began to say that he himself and four free persons who 
were making a trip with him turned up while Clodius was being killed, and on account of 
this, when they had made the facts known, they had been arrested and led off and held 
for two months in a villa belonging to Milo.  That revelation, whether true or false, 
brought great animosity against Milo.  The same Munatius and Pompeius, tribunes of 
the plebs, brought up to the Rostra  a triumvir capitalis, and questioned him as to 
whether they had arrested Galata, the slave of Milo, in the process of committing 
murder.  He replied that Galata, who was sleeping in a tavern, was arrested and 
brought before him.  They demanded of the triumvir not to let the slave go; but on the 
next day Caelius, tribune of the plebs, and Manilius Cumanus his colleague, reported 
to Milo that the slave had been kidnapped from the residence of the triumvir.  Even 
though Cicero makes no mention of these crimes, I thought that these matters ought to 
be laid out nonetheless, because I have run across them.  Quintus Pompeius, Caius 
Sallustius and Titus Munatius, tribunes of the plebs, were in the forefront of holding 
meetings which were quite hostile toward Milo, and even unfriendly toward Cicero, 
because he was defending Milo with such vigor.  The greatest part of the multitude was 
hostile non only toward Milo but also toward Cicero because of his defense [of Milo] 
which they detested.  Later Pompeius and Sallustius were under suspicion of having 
got back into favor with Milo and Cicero;  Plancus however persisted in a most hostile 
state and <span class="emphasized2">[p. 38 C]</span> roused the multitude against Cicero too.  He made Milo an object of 
suspicion to Pompeius, however, alleging that violence was being planned with a view 
toward [Pompeius'] assassination: and Pompeius on account of this rather often 
complained that assassination plots were being laid against himself, and openly at that, 
and he kept fortifying himself with a bigger guard.  Plancus also repeatedly pointed out 
later that the day would be told to Cicero, even before Quintus Pompeius had got the 
same idea.  Cicero's loyalty and reliability was such, however, that he was able to be 
frightened off from defending Milo  neither by his own estrangement from the people, 
nor the suspicions held by Cnaeus Pompeius, nor the danger that would come upon 
him when a trial date was named, nor by  the weapons which had been openly taken up 
against Milo. (He thought that) although he would be able to turn aside every danger to 
himself and offense to the hostile multitude, nonetheless he would be able to win back 
the mind of Cnaeus Pompeius, if he had held back a little in his efforts for the defense.</p>
<p align="justify">

	Once the law proposed by Pompeius had been passed--in which it had also 
been enacted that a Quaesitor should be appointed by vote of the people from among 
those who had held the office of consul--immediately the electoral assembly was held 
and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was named Quaesitor.  Pompeius also proposed a 
list of jurors who would judge the case of such quality as was obvious had never been 
suggested before, either in terms of fame (clariores) or rectitude (sanctiores).  
Immediately after this, under the new law, Milo was indicted by the two young Appii 
Claudii, the same ones by whom his familia had previously been demanded; and 
likewise he was indicted de ambitu by these same Appii, and besides by Caius Ateius 
and Lucius Cornificius; he was also indicted de sodaliciis <span class="emphasized2">[p. 39C]</span>  by Publius Fulvius 
Neratus. He was indicted, however, de sodaliciis and de ambitu with the confident 
expectation that, because it was apparent that the first trial de vi would take place and 
since they believed that he was going to be convicted, he would not offer a defense 
later.</p>
<p align="justify">

	A selection was made between the would-be accusers in the court de ambitu, 
under the presidency of Aulus [Manlius] Torquatus, and both of the quaesitors, 
Torquatus and Domitius, ordered the defendant to be present on the 4th of April.  On 
that day Milo appeared before the bench of Domitius, and sent friends to Torquatus'.  
There, with Marcus [Claudius] Marcellus speaking in his behalf he got a ruling that he 
would not have to take part in a proceeding de ambitu until his case de vi had been 
decided.  At the bench of Domitius, however, Appius the Elder demanded that 54 
slaves be produced by Milo, and when Milo replied that those who had been named 
were not under his potestas,  Domitius ordered, with the advice of his jurors, that the 
prosecutor should bring forth as many of Milo's slaves as he wished.  Witnesses were 
then issued summonses, according to the law which (as we noted above) orders that, 
before the trial is held, witness are to be heard for a three day period, the jurors are to 
hand in their statements under seal, on the fourth day all are ordered to appear, and in 
the presence of prosecutor and defendant lists (pilae) on which the names of the jurors 
have been inscribed are to be evened out (aequararentur);  then again on the next day 
the selection of 81 jurors is to take place.  When this number has been selected by lot, 
they are to take their seats (as jurors) immediately.  Then the prosecutor is to have two 
hours to speak, and the defendant three.  The case is to be decided on that same day.  
Before the votes are cast, however, the prosecutor may exclude five jurors from each of 
the ranks, and the defendant an equal number [ 15 + 15 ], so that the number of 
remaining jurors<span class="emphasized2"> [p. 35 KS]</span> who are to give their verdict is fifty-one [ 81 - 30 = 51 ].</p>
<p align="justify">

<span class="emphasized2">[p. 40C]</span>   On the first day, a witness was brought against Milo, Caius Causinius Schola, 
who testified that he had been with Clodius when he had been killed, and he magnified 
the horror of the deed as greatly as he could.  When Marcus Marcellus began to cross-
examine him, he was so terrified by the huge outcry from the Clodian faction which was 
standing around that (in fear of ultimate violence) he was permitted to step up onto the 
magistrate's tribunal by Domitius.  For that reason Marcellus and Milo himself begged 
for a guard from Domitius.  Pompeius was in position at the Aerarium at that moment, 
and he had become quite disturbed by the same outcry.  And so he promised Domitius 
that he would appear himself next day with his guard.  Frightened by that prospect the 
Clodians allowed the testimony of the witnesses to be heard in silence for two days.  
Marcus Cicero and Marcus Marcellus and Milo himself asked them questions.  Many of 
those who lived at Bovillae offered testimony concerning the events that had taken 
place there:  that the inkeeper had been killed,  the tavern besieged, the body of 
Clodius drug out into the public highway.  The  Albanae virgines of also said that an 
unknown woman had come to them to fulfill a vow at the instruction of Milo because 
Clodius had been killed.  The last persons to give testimony were Sempronia, the 
daughter of [Sempronius] Tuditanus, the socrus of Clodius, and Fulvia, his wife;  by 
their tears they greatly moved those who were in attendance.  When the court session 
was recessed around 4:00 p.m.,  Titus Munatius exhorted the people in a public 
meeting to be present en masse on the next day and not allow Milo to get away, and he 
recalled the court session and their own gloom as they were going to present their 
tabellae.  </p>
<p align="justify">

	On the next day, which was the last day of the trial [April 7], <span class="emphasized2">[p. 41C]</span>  the pubs 
were closed throughout the entire city; Pompeius stationed guards in the Forum and at 
every entrance point to the Forum; he himself took his seat in front of the Aerarium, as 
on the day before, surrounded by a chosen band of soldiers.  The selection of the 
jurors from the first day was then made; after that there was such a silence in the entire 
Forum as had never been possible in any forum.  Then just after 8 a.m. the 
prosecutors, Appius the Elder, Marcus Antonius,   and Publius Valerius Nepos, began 
to speak; they spent two hours, in accordance with the law.
<br><br>
	Marcus Cicero was the only one to reply to them, and it pleased him to defend 
against the charge with certain arguments, in particular that Clodius had been killed for 
the good of the State--Marcus Brutus followed this line of argument in the oration which 
he composed for Milo and published as though he had actually given it--though it was 
not Cicero's argument that, if somebody should be condemned for the public good  he 
could also be killed without formalities of a judicial condemnation.  And so, while the 
prosecutors showed that Milo had made an ambush on Clodius, Cicero proved that it 
was a lie--for that attack had come about by chance--and argued to the contrary, that 
an ambush had been set by Clodius against Milo; indeed his entire presentation 
focused on that point.</p>
<p align="justify">

But it so happened, as we have stated, that the fight took place on that day without 
previous plan of either of them;  as a matter of fact it both occurred by chance and it 
ultimately  went as far as slaughter because of the engagement of the slaves.  It was 
noted, however, that each had threatened death against the other, and just as (on the 
one hand) Milo was more suspicious than Clodius' entourage generally made out, so 
(on the other hand) Clodius' men had been more stripped and ready for fighting than 
Milo's.  When Cicero began to speak, he was interrupted by the catcalls of the Clodian 
faction who were unable to be silenced, not even by fear of the soldiers standing 
around.  And so he spoke without the firmness (constantia) which was his habit.  That 
aside, there is extant his oration.  As a matter of fact he wrote what we read  as 
perfectly as it might properly have been delivered in the first place.</p>

QUAESTIONEM NULLAM HABEREMUS ... SUBLATA EST.	</span><br><blockquote>Cicero does what is called `DIVIDERE SENTENTIAM', as your age thinks it ought to be termed. <p align="justify">
	When a speaker, in giving his formal opinion, weaves together two or more proposals, and if not 
all of them are approved of, the demand is made that the proposition be divided, that is that the question 
be put on each point individually and separately.  Now perhaps you may wish to know as well who it was 
who made this demand.  This is almost never recorded.  For the person who makes the demand does 
not need to make a long formal speech, nor indeed does he even have to stand up.  For many sitting 
there may call out this one word,  DIVIDE:  and when it is heard, the person who is making the proposal is 
free to make the division.  But I, ...  also checked the Acta of the entire period; in them I found that on 
the last day of the intercalary month  a Decree of the Senate was made that the slaughter of Publius 
Clodius, the burning of the Curia, and the attack on the house of Marcus Lepidus were treasonous; 
nothing further is related in the  Acta  under that date; but on the next day, that is March 1, Titus 
Munatius revealed in a public meeting to the Populus what had been transacted in the Senate on the 
previous day.  In that meeting he spoke the following, and I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div align="justify">When Hortensius had said that the matter should be looked into 
    outside of the usual procedures by a quaesitor, he thought that it would 
    be the case that, when he had given his little drop of sweetness, they 
    would devour bitterness abundantly: we used our talent against a 
    talented man.  We found Fufius who cried `DIVIDE'.  Sallustius and I 
    interposed our veto on the remaining part of the sententia.</div>
</blockquote>

<div align="justify">This contio, I think, explains both what the Senate wanted to decree and who demanded the divisio.  I 
  don't doubt that you will remember the fact that, at the time when a decree was passed against Publius 
  Clodius de incesto, it was brought about through Quintus Fufius that a more rigorous decree was not 
  passed by the Senate.</div>

<br>Concerning Lucius Domitius he says:<br><br>
<span class="emphasizedtext">(22)	DEDERAS ENIM QUAM CONTEMNERES POPULARES INSANIAS IAM AB ADULESCENTIA DOCUMENTA MAXIMA.</span>	<br><blockquote>
  <div align="justify">He refers to the steadfastness which Lucius Domitius exemplified during his quaestorship (66 
    B.C.).  For, at that time, when Caius Manlius, tribune of the plebs, assisted by a band of freedmen and 
    slaves, was sponsoring a completely subversive law that the votes of the freedmen should be distributed 
    among all the tribes, and was pushing it forward through rioting, and was besieging the Capitoline hill, 
    Domitius had struck at and broken up the crowd in such a way that many of Manlius' supporters were 
    killed.  By that action he both earned the hostility of the lowest class of plebs and the great favor of the 
    Senate.</div>

  <div align="justify">Lucius Cassius [Longinus Ravila, consul 127, censor 125]  was  (as I have already often noted) a 
    man of greatest severity.  As often as he was a quaesitor in some trial in which inquiry was being made 
    concerning the murder of a man he would advise and even instruct the jury as to what Cicero is now 
    advising: that they should consider in whose interest (cui bono) it was that the man perish whose murder 
    they were investigating.  Because of this rectitude, on the occasion on which Sextus Peducaeus the 
    tribune of the plebs [113] indicted Lucius [Caecilius] Metellus [Delmaticus] the Pontifex Maximus [from 
    before 114 to 103] and the whole College of Pontiffs on the grounds of having improperly passed 
    judgment [December 16 and 18, 114] on the chastity of the Vestal Virgins, because they had condemned 
    only one, Aemilia, but exonerated the other two, Marcia and Licinia, the Populus appointed this Cassius 
    to investigate the same Vestal Virgins.  He condemned the two of them, and several others besides, with 
    too great asperity (as people think).</div>

  <div align="justify">It is obvious that `HAEC...PASSUS'  refers to the time when Cicero departed from Rome after the

    Cicero had been driven into exile, when Pompeius came into the Senate on June 11, it is said that a 
    dagger fell from the person of a slave of Publius Clodius, and when that was reported to the consul 
    Gabinius it was stated by the slave that he had been ordered by Publius Clodius to kill Pompeius.  
    Pompeius immediately returned home and from that moment (or `for that reason') kept himself at home.  
    He was also attacked by  [p. 47 C]  Damio, a freedman of Clodius, as I have discovered in the Acta of 
    that year.  In them, under August 16, when Lucius Novius, tribune of the plebs, a colleague of Clodius, 
    called upon the tribunes for the right of appeal against Lucius Flavius the praetor for Damio, and he 
    made a speech concerning the right of appeal that belonged to a tribune, he spoke his opinion as follows:  
    `And if I have been wounded by this servant (apparitor) of Publius Clodius, and Cnaeus Pompeius, 
    separated from public life with armed guards posted, has been besieged, when I use the right of appeal I 
    would not use the example of the man whom I loathe and take away his right to trial (and various other

	    same year in which Clodius was tribune of the plebs  [58 B.C.],  Clodius requested him during dinner that 
	    he should order Tigranes to be brought in so that he could see him.  When Tigranes was brought in he 
	    escorted him to a party, but then did not return him to Flavius.  He sent him (to his own) home and kept 
	    him without restraints.  Nor would he send him back, when Pompeius requested.  After that he put him 
	    onto a ship, and as he was fleeing he was carried by a storm to Anzio.  When he was brought back from

    <div align="justify"><br>	
      After Milo, the first to be accused under that same Lex Pompeia de vi  was  <span class="emphasized2">[p. 55 C] </span>Marcus 
      Saufeius, the son of Marcus, who had been the leader in storming the tavern at Bovillae and in killing

      acquit and  6  to convict.  And it was obvious that hatred of Clodius was Saufeius' salvation, since his 
      case was perhaps weaker than Milo's, because he had been the leader of the attack on the tavern quite 
      openly.  He was put on trial again a few days later before Caius Considius the quaesitor under the Lex 
      Plautia de vi, with the notation that he had occupied elevated positions and had been carrying weapons; 
      for he had been the leader of Milo's gang.  The indictment was sponsored by Caius Fidius, Cnaeus 
      Aponius the son of Cnaeus, Marcus Seius........the son of Sextus.  Marcus Cicero and Marcus Terentius 
      Varro Gibba defended him.  He was acquitted by a larger margin than before: he got  19 for conviction 
      and  32 for acquittal.  But the vote was cast differenly from the earlier trial, for the equites and senators

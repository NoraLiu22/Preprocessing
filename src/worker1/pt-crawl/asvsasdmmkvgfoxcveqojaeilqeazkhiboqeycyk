			<h3 id="h3-s2">ORGANISATION OF THE SECRETARIAT</h3>
			<p id="p1">At the Restoration the practice of appointing two Secretaries of State, which was well
established before the Civil War, was resumed. Apart from the modifications which
were made necessary by the occasional existence of a third secretaryship, the organisation of the secretariat underwent no fundamental change from that time until the
reforms of 1782 which resulted in the emergence of the Home and Foreign departments. <a href="#fnn1" name="anchorn1">(fn. 1)</a> The powers of the Secretaries were in theory identical. They could undertake
any of the business and were obliged to do so in cases where one of the offices was
vacant or its occupant absent. However, while there were no binding rules, certain
conventions governing the distribution of functions came to be generally understood
and accepted. English domestic affairs remained the responsibility of both Secretaries
throughout the period. In the field of foreign affairs there was a division into a Northern and a Southern Department, each of which was the responsibility of one Secretary.
The distinction between the two departments emerged only gradually. It was not
until after 1689 that their names passed into general currency. Nevertheless the
division of foreign business itself can, in its broad outlines, be detected in the early
years of the reign of Charles II. <a href="#fnn2" name="anchorn2">(fn. 2)</a> Until 1674 the incoming Secretary took over the
responsibilities of the Secretary whom he replaced. Between 1674 and 1706 it was
usual for a newly appointed Secretary to take charge of the Northern Department and
to move to the Southern Department, to which higher remuneration was attached,
when a vacancy occurred and he came to occupy the senior position. There was,
however, an exception to this convention. During Vernon's tenure of office (1697-
1702) Jersey and Manchester took charge of the Southern Department immediately
on appointment although both were junior to him in length of service. From 1706 it
was usual for a Secretary to remain throughout his period of service in the Department
to which he had been first appointed. <a href="#fnn3" name="anchorn3">(fn. 3)</a> When the process of equalising the remuneration of the Secretaries was finally completed in 1709, the distinction which had
previously existed between the senior and junior offices ceased to have any practical
significance.</p>
			<p id="p2">In 1709 a third Secretary was appointed and given responsibility for Scottish
affairs which had formerly fallen to the Secretary in charge of the Northern Department. <a href="#fnn4" name="anchorn4">(fn. 4)</a> Queensberry, the first holder of this office, was able to obtain a share in the
conduct of foreign business but his successors were confined to Scottish affairs. The
office was left vacant from 1726. It was revived in 1742 and was finally discontinued
in 1746. A third Secretary was again appointed in 1768 and given charge of colonial
business which was transferred from the Southern Department. <a href="#fnn5" name="anchorn5">(fn. 5)</a> In 1782 the secretariat was reorganised. The Colonial Department was abolished. All domestic and
colonial business was transferred to the former Southern Department which came to
be known as the Home Office while the sole responsibility for foreign business was
allocated to the former Northern Department which came to be known as the Foreign
Office. <a href="#fnn6" name="anchorn6">(fn. 6)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p3">Special arrangements were made for the performance of secretarial functions when
the King went abroad. It was generally accepted that he should be accompanied by a
Secretary of State on such occasions. However, William III, although he took first
Nottingham and then Sydney with him to the Low Countries in 1691, left both
Secretaries in England at other times. During the expedition to Ireland in 1690 Sir
Robert Southwell accompanied the King and undertook the necessary secretarial
duties; and William Blathwayt acted similarly during the annual expeditions to
Holland and Flanders between 1692 and 1701. Neither Southwell nor Blathwayt was
ever actually appointed a Secretary of State. <a href="#fnn7" name="anchorn7">(fn. 7)</a> George I and George II followed a more
orthodox course when they visited their German possessions and were, as a general
rule, accompanied by one of the Secretaries while the other remained in England.
However, this practice was varied in 1723 when both Secretaries went with the King
to Hanover and in 1736 when both remained in England, the King being accompanied
abroad by Horatio Walpole. <a href="#fnn8" name="anchorn8">(fn. 8)</a> On two occasions the royal absences abroad gave rise to
the appointment of temporary Secretaries. In June 1716 Methuen was appointed to
take charge of the Southern Department in the absence of Stanhope and in 1723
Walpole was appointed to conduct the secretarial business of the Northern and
Southern Departments in England in the absence of Townshend and Carteret.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s3">SOURCE MATERIALS</h3>
			<p id="p4">Before an attempt is made to give an account of the officials of the Secretaries of State,
something must be said about the nature of the relevant evidence. It is in several
respects less satisfactory than that available for other major departments. In consequence many details must remain tentative and imprecise. Precision is usually
attainable in the case of the periods of service of the Secretaries of State themselves
and of those officials who were appointed by instruments or who received their
salaries from some public source. Included in these two groups are the Clerks of the
Signet, the Secretaries for the Latin and French Tongues, the Writer of the Gazette
(after 1719) and the Keeper, Collector and Methodisers of State Papers. It is otherwise
in the case of the Secretaries' immediate officials-the Under Secretaries, the Clerks,
the Office Keepers and the Necessary Women. These were appointed directly by the
Secretaries and until the end of the period remained in theory their personal servants.
While conventions grew up in the course of time which were usually respected by
successive Secretaries, these never found formal or binding expression. A few
memoranda relating to office organisation have survived but they were evidently
drawn up in response to particular contingencies and there is nothing to suggest that
they formed part of a continuous collection of comparable material. <a href="#fnn9" name="anchorn9">(fn. 9)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p5">The officials in this last category received no instruments of appointment and took
no oaths of office. There was, therefore, no occasion for any systematic record of their
appointments to be kept. However, there is one reasonably satisfactory source which
in some measure supplies this deficiency. This is the series of letters written in connection with the privilege of franking which was enjoyed by the Under Secretaries, Clerks
and certain other officials designated by the Secretaries of State. Following the
appointment of a Secretary it was the usual practice for a letter to be sent to the Post
Office giving details of the composition of his office. Further letters were sent in the
event of subsequent changes. While the privilege itself was well established by 1685,
the first letter of this kind to survive is of 1708. <a href="#fnn10" name="anchorn10">(fn. 10)</a> There are considerable gaps but the
series is reasonably complete from this date until the end of the period. These letters
are of great value in determining the identity of Under Secretaries and Clerks. However, they must be used with caution since there are a number of cases in which it can
be shown from other sources that they were written a considerable time after the
appointments which they record. <a href="#fnn11" name="anchorn11">(fn. 11)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p6">Also of value in determining the periods of service of the Secretaries' officials are
the documents relating to their remuneration. These fall broadly into two categories-
the accounts of the office fees and the accounts of the receipts and disbursements of
the Secretaries of State. The practice of exacting fees of fixed amounts on certain types
of business transacted by the Secretaries was already well established in the reign of
Charles II. In 1684 the recipients in one of the offices were the Secretary himself, the
senior 'Clerk', the 'Writing' Clerk and the Chamber Keeper. This was probably the
case for the other office as well. As will be seen the pattern of distribution at this date
was the basis of the eighteenth-century convention whereby the right to official fees
in each office was enjoyed by the Secretary, the two Under Secretaries, the First or Chief
Clerk and the two Office Keepers. <a href="#fnn12" name="anchorn12">(fn. 12)</a> Originally there was considerable competition
between the offices for those types of business which gave rise to the payment of
fees. This was brought to an end in 1699 when an agreement was made according to
which the fees received in each office were periodically brought to account and then
divided equally between them. <a href="#fnn13" name="anchorn13">(fn. 13)</a> By the eighteenth century the function of keeping
the accounts of the office fees had devolved upon the Chief Clerks who were also
responsible for collecting the fees and paying them to the officials who were entitled to
them. Where signed receipts occur in the account books they enable these officials to
be identified. The earliest accounts of fees to survive cover part of Coventry's period
of office 1672-3 and the whole of Williamson's 1674-9 and Conway's 1681-3 but they
contain nothing of value for the identification of their officials. <a href="#fnn14" name="anchorn14">(fn. 14)</a> The first accounts to
be of any use in this connection are for Vernon's secretaryship 1697-1702. <a href="#fnn15" name="anchorn15">(fn. 15)</a> Apart
from Harley's accounts nothing further survives until 1727 when the series in the
Public Record Office begins. This series is far from complete. <a href="#fnn16" name="anchorn16">(fn. 16)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p7">At least two other types of accounts were kept in connection with the Secretaries'
official activities. The accounts of the <em>London Gazette</em>, the profits of which the
Secretaries shared, were kept by the printer. A few of these accounts have survived
and from these it is evident that, in the earlier part of the period, some Secretaries
made provision for the remuneration of their officials out of their receipts from this
source. Coventry assigned his share of the profits to his Under Secretary, Cooke. The
elder Sunderland divided his share between one of his Under Secretaries and two of
his Clerks. <a href="#fnn17" name="anchorn17">(fn. 17)</a> Trumbull, Harley and, during his first period of office, the younger
Sunderland paid salaries to their Clerks and inferior staff from the same source. <a href="#fnn18" name="anchorn18">(fn. 18)</a> The
more common practice, however, was for these salaries to be paid by the Chief Clerks
who came to be responsible for receiving the Secretaries' various salaries and allowances and accounting for the disbursements made from them. The earliest accounts of
this kind are for Vernon's term of office. <a href="#fnn19" name="anchorn19">(fn. 19)</a> Others survive for part of Carteret's and
Newcastle's terms of office between 1724 and 1739. <a href="#fnn20" name="anchorn20">(fn. 20)</a> Receipts for the salaries of
Clerks and others exist for the secretaryships of the younger Sunderland 1717-18,
Stanhope 1718-21, Tweeddale 1742-6 and Egremont 1761-3. <a href="#fnn21" name="anchorn21">(fn. 21)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p8">The rather meagre amount of information obtainable from these sources may be
supplemented by that contained in the warrants for the payment of travelling allowances and board wages in connection with the journeys of the court either abroad or
to one of the royal residences outside London. In the case of journeys abroad the
Secretary of State who accompanied the King took some of his officials with him. In
1736 when both Secretaries remained in England, Horatio Walpole went to Hanover
with a collection of officials drawn from both offices. Occasionally persons who were
not Secretaries' officials were temporarily attached to the staff in these circumstances.
Thus Luke Schaub acted as Under Secretary to Stanhope in 1719 and Caspar
Wetstein to Carteret in 1743. <a href="#fnn22" name="anchorn22">(fn. 22)</a> In the case of domestic journeys, which were either to
Windsor or Hampton Court, it was the practice for both Secretaries to accompany the
court. <a href="#fnn23" name="anchorn23">(fn. 23)</a> Also of some value for an understanding of the Secretaries' offices is the diary
of Brietzcke, who held office as a Clerk in the Northern and Southern departments
from 1756 to 1782 and subsequently in the Home Office. The surviving portions of the
diary which extend from 1759 to 1764 throw considerable light on working conditions
and on the principles that governed the organisation of the offices at this period. <a href="#fnn24" name="anchorn24">(fn. 24)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p9">Since so few of the documents most closely associated with establishment matters
have survived, considerable reliance must be placed on incidental references to
Secretaries' officials in tracing their careers. The appointments of Under Secretaries
are often the subject of comment in newsletters, Luttrell's <em>Historical Relation</em> and,
later, in the <em>Historical Register</em> and the <em>Gentleman's Magazine</em>. Their periods of service
can be established reasonably accurately from references to them in the official letter
books where these survive. The careers of the Clerks and inferior officials present
greater problems since they attracted less attention in view of their relatively small
importance. Contemporary published lists are, however, of some value in this connection. 'Chief Secretaries' to the Secretaries of State first appear in the edition of
Chamberlayne's <em>Present State</em> for 1682. <a href="#fnn25" name="anchorn25">(fn. 25)</a> The first reasonably full account of the
offices occurs in that for 1694. Most subsequent editions of this and other comparable
works contain such lists although it is not until the second quarter of the eighteenth
century that their accuracy can be relied upon.</p>
			<p id="p10">It will be clear from the nature of the sources that any description of the principles
which governed the organisation of the Secretaries' offices must in many respects be
tentative. However, by the end of the reign of William III, a pattern had emerged
which, with some minor modifications, was to endure until the end of the period. The
arrangements in the offices of the two older Secretaries will first be described. Those
in the Scottish and Colonial Departments will be considered later.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s4">STRUCTURE OF THE OFFICES IN 1702</h3>
			<p id="p11">By 1702 it was the established practice for each office to be staffed by two Under
Secretaries, a First or Chief Clerk, a varying number of other Clerks, two Chamber
or Office Keepers and a Cleaner or Necessary Woman. Lack of evidence makes it
impossible to trace the origin of these arrangements with any certainty. The practice
of maintaining in unbroken succession two Secretaries of State dated from the latter
part of the reign of James I. There was, therefore, a period of about a quarter of a
century before the outbreak of the Civil War during which there was an opportunity
for conventions governing the organisation of their offices to become established. A
letter of 1628 describing the conditions in Secretary Coke's office implies that certain
principles had already gained acceptance at that date. <a href="#fnn26" name="anchorn26">(fn. 26)</a> The writer in this case was
seeking appointment to the position of 'English and ancientest Secretary' to Coke. It is
clear that the holder of this office was the Secretary of State's principal subordinate,
ranking above a number of other Clerks or 'Secretaries' who received small salaries.</p>
			<p id="p12">While there is no direct evidence on the point it is reasonable to suppose that in
1660 the Secretaries of State reconstructed their offices on the principles which had
been current before the Interregnum. The first document to give a clear picture of the
situation dates in its final form from 1684. It is a memorandum describing the
situation in Middleton's office shortly after his appointment in that year. <a href="#fnn27" name="anchorn27">(fn. 27)</a> It must be
emphasised that this memorandum deals with only one of the Secretaries' offices.
Nevertheless it embodies features which have enough in common with what is known
about the situation both before and after the time when it was drawn up to make it a
suitable point of departure for a discussion of the principles governing the organisation
of the offices during the period covered by these lists. The memorandum names
Middleton's Clerks in order of seniority and gives details of their functions and
remuneration. The first Clerk in the list is Cooke who had important general responsibilities and undertook the direction of the office as a whole. He received no salary but
was entitled to fees on official business. Next is Wynne who also had general responsibilities and was rewarded by the relatively large salary of £200 paid by the Secretary
of State. Then follow three Clerks, de Paz, Chute and Carne, who received salaries
ranging from £40 to £60. Finally there is a Writing Clerk, Widdows, who was particularly attached to the service of Cooke, the senior Clerk, from whom he received a
salary. The memorandum indicates that the Writing Clerk and the Office Keeper, like
the senior Clerk, were entitled to fees on official business which were distinct from
those enjoyed by the Secretary of State himself. This suggests that they formed the
original nucleus from which the Secretaries' offices developed.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s4">UNDER SECRETARIES</h3>
			<p id="p13">The first question to be considered in the light of the memorandum of 1684 is the
origin of the office of Under Secretary. It should be emphasised in this connection
that the term 'Under Secretary', although found in use as early as 1672, <a href="#fnn28" name="anchorn28">(fn. 28)</a> passed only
gradually into general currency. For a considerable period it was used concurrently
with the designations 'Secretary', 'Clerk', and even 'Chief Secretary' and 'Chief
Clerk'. <a href="#fnn29" name="anchorn29">(fn. 29)</a> This confusion adds appreciably to the difficulty of tracing the development
of the office in the earlier part of the period. However, it is clear that in 1684, although
all Middleton's subordinates are described as 'Clerks', the two most senior, Cooke
and Wynne, are, from the point of view of function and remuneration, in a different
category from the rest and approximate to the condition of 'Under Secretaries'. It
seems that Cooke's situation corresponded to that of the 'English or ancientest
Secretary' in Coke's office in 1628 and of the 'inward men' of other early Stuart
Secretaries of State. On the other hand, the fact that the fees to which Cooke was
entitled as senior 'Clerk' in 1684 were the same as those received by the Under
Secretaries in the eighteenth century places the basic identity of his office with theirs
beyond doubt. <a href="#fnn30" name="anchorn30">(fn. 30)</a> Cooke's position as the principal subordinate in one of the offices can
be traced back to the Restoration. For how long he had had a colleague of comparable
standing is unknown. Wynne was brought into the office by Secretary Jenkins in 1680
almost certainly to replace Thynne who had served Coventry in a similar capacity
since 1672. There is thus reasonable justification for tracing the pattern of two 'Under
Secretaries' in this office at least as far back as the latter year. Wynne received his
renumeration in 1684 in the form not of fees but of a salary from the Secretary of
State which suggests that the practice of appointing a second 'Under Secretary' may
have been a relatively late development. As will be seen it was later the practice for the
two Under Secretaries to share equally in the product of the fees accruing to the
Secretary's principal subordinate, a development which had the effect of placing them
more in a position of parity. Nevertheless, in spite of this distinction between Cooke
and Wynne, it seems reasonable to describe them both as Under Secretaries. It is
worth noting in this connection that in the edition of Chamberlayne's <em>Present State</em> for
1684 both are designated 'Chief Secretaries' to Jenkins. <a href="#fnn31" name="anchorn31">(fn. 31)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p14">It is difficult to say how far the arrangements just described were reflected in the
other office during the reign of Charles II. The only document to throw any light on
this question is a memorandum drawn up by Williamson in 1673 which gives some
information about the state of Arlington's office at that date. <a href="#fnn32" name="anchorn32">(fn. 32)</a> Williamson had occupied a leading position in this office ever since the Restoration. He frequently received
communications on official business from Cooke which suggests that the two men
were of comparable standing. <a href="#fnn33" name="anchorn33">(fn. 33)</a> The precise nature of Williamson's functions is
nowhere defined and he appears not to have had any consistent designation. In his
earlier years in the office he is occasionally called 'Secretary' to Nicholas and Arlington
and seems to have occupied a position similar to that of Whittaker and Godolphin who
are also so described. But in 1673 he differentiated his situation from that of Arlington's then Secretaries, Bridgeman and Richards. At that date the direction of the
office was in Williamson's hands while Bridgeman and Richards were acting more as
Private Secretaries than as the later Under Secretaries. However, Williamson's career
was unusual. There is no parallel to the employment of a person of his prominence in
a subordinate position in the Secretaries' offices and the customary pattern of organisation may have been adapted to meet his case. When he became Secretary himself in
1674 in succession to Arlington he does not appear to have appointed a single individual to fill the role which he had occupied in the office. He retained the services of
Bridgeman as one of his 'Secretaries' and replaced Richards by Brisbane. Bridgeman
appears to have been the more important of the two and to have carried out many of
the functions that Williamson had performed <a href="#fnn34" name="anchorn34">(fn. 34)</a> but, so far as the fragmentary nature
of the evidence allows a judgment to be formed, it seems that from 1674 the pattern of
organisation in this office conformed closely to that already observed in the other.
Certainly the complier of the edition of Chamberlayne's <em>Present State</em> for 1684 felt
able to equate the position of Bridgeman and Mountsteven, 'Chief Secretaries' to
Sunderland with that of Cooke and Wynne, 'Chief Secretaries' to Jenkins. After 1689
the position of the two Under Secretaries at the head of each office was securely
established. From this date their identity and periods of service can in most cases be
accurately determined although, as has already been noted, their actual designation
continued to vary considerably.</p>
			<p id="p15">The right of appointing and dismissing the Under Secretaries lay with the Secretaries of State. However, it is clear that from an early date they were obliged to take into
account the interest of the crown in the matter. Thus Shrewsbury dismissed Wynne
in 1689 because the King disapproved of him. Newcastle was careful to consult the
Queen, in the King's absence, before appointing Couraud in 1729. <a href="#fnn35" name="anchorn35">(fn. 35)</a> There were
probably many other similar instances of which no record has survived. Later in the
eighteenth century the crown's interest was formally acknowledged. This is indicated
by the fact that after 1766 the Secretary of State, when notifying the Post Office of the
appointment of a new Under Secretary, on several occasions stated that it had been
made with the King's approbation. <a href="#fnn36" name="anchorn36">(fn. 36)</a> So long as this condition was satisfied, an incoming Secretary was free to appoint whom he wished. He was under no obligation to
retain the Under Secretaries who had served his predecessor. It was, however, almost
invariable for a Secretary to ensure that at least one of his Under Secretaries had had
previous experience of the office. <a href="#fnn37" name="anchorn37">(fn. 37)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p16">There was no firm convention corresponding to the modern distinction between the
parliamentary and permanent under secretaryships. Under Secretaries were specifically exempted from the provisions of the Place Act of 1742 <a href="#fnn38" name="anchorn38">(fn. 38)</a> and between 1660 and
1782 twenty-seven individuals sat in the House of Commons while holding the office
of Under Secretary in the two older departments. <a href="#fnn39" name="anchorn39">(fn. 39)</a> However, their membership
appears to have been determined largely by factors unconnected with their official
position and there is nothing to suggest that any steps were taken to ensure that there
was a regular succession of Under Secretaries with seats in Parliament. On the other
hand a broad distinction can be made between men of business who made a career as
Under Secretaries and those individuals whose presence in the office was determined
largely by their attachment to a particular patron. Of the seventy-three men who held
the office in the Northern and Southern departments during the period, thirty-seven
served only once. <a href="#fnn40" name="anchorn40">(fn. 40)</a> Of the careers of the remainder <a href="#fnn41" name="anchorn41">(fn. 41)</a> the most remarkable was that of
Tilson who was appointed in 1708 and remained in office until his death in 1738 after
having served during eight separate secretaryships. Also noteworthy was that of Cooke
who served under six Secretaries from 1660 to 1688. The periods of service of this
type of Under Secretary were not always continuous. For example Bridgeman's
career (c. 1667-81; 1683-8; 1690-4) was interrupted twice and Weston's (1729-46;
1761-4) once. While an analysis of the careers of Under Secretaries reveals certain
trends, <a href="#fnn42" name="anchorn42">(fn. 42)</a> the situation remained fluid and largely defies generalisation. Secretaries
naturally tended to take care that at least one of their Under Secretaries was a man of
business but it was not until the end of the period that the idea of a 'Permanent'
Under Secretary began to take root. Fraser (1765-71; 1771-89) held what amounted
to this situation in one office and Porten (1768-82) in the other while Bell considered
that he had been appointed in 1781 on the understanding that he would succeed
Porten as 'what is considered the fix'd and Resident' Under Secretary. <a href="#fnn43" name="anchorn43">(fn. 43)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p17">For the greater part of the period covered by these lists the Under Secretaries
derived their remuneration principally from official fees. As already noted these fees
were in 1684 received in Middleton's office by his senior subordinate, Cooke, whose
colleague, Wynne, was paid a salary by the Secretary of State. Later a new arrangement
was made whereby neither Under Secretary received a salary but both shared equally
in the product of the fees to which Cooke had been solely entitled. The date of this
arrangement cannot be established precisely. It was presumably not made before
Cooke's retirement in 1688. On the other hand, the fact that all four Under Secretaries
are shown in the poll tax assessment for July 1689 as receiving their remuneration in
the form not of 'Wages' but of 'Perquisites' may indicate that the change had taken
place by that date. <a href="#fnn44" name="anchorn44">(fn. 44)</a> By 1697 it was certainly the practice in one of the offices for the
product of the fees to be equally divided between the two Under Secretaries <a href="#fnn45" name="anchorn45">(fn. 45)</a> and it is
probable that the effect of the agreement of 1699 was to make the receipts of all four
Under Secretaries equal. In 1674 and 1675 Cooke and Bridgeman respectively were
granted annuities of £400 from the Exchequer in consideration of their services in the
Secretaries' offices. <a href="#fnn46" name="anchorn46">(fn. 46)</a> However, these grants were of a personal character and did not
result in salaries from public funds being accorded to their successors. The creation of
the Scottish secretaryship in 1709 brought about, at least temporarily, a reduction in
the share of the office fees available to each Under Secretary which led to a demand
that they should be accorded fixed allowances in recompense. <a href="#fnn47" name="anchorn47">(fn. 47)</a> This demand proved
unsuccessful and it was not until 1770, shortly after the creation of the Colonial
Department, that salaries of £500 from public funds were established for each of the
six Under Secretaries. <a href="#fnn48" name="anchorn48">(fn. 48)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p18">In view of their relatively precarious tenure Under Secretaries sought to acquire
additional offices, which were either sinecures or could be exercised by deputy, in
order both to augment their incomes while actually serving and to provide for their
retirement. Particularly favoured for this purpose were the patent offices in the
colonies. In 1719 the Under Secretaries prepared a petition in which they asked to be
accorded salaries or, failing that, for certain offices under the general authority of the
Secretaries of State to be reserved to them. If this petition was ever presented no
response has survived, but the Under Secretaries succeeded in establishing the substance of their case. In the course of the eighteenth century they came virtually to
monopolise the offices of Secretary for the Latin Tongue, Writer of the Gazette,
Keeper and Collector of State Papers and the clerkships of the Signet. <a href="#fnn49" name="anchorn49">(fn. 49)</a> In some cases
provision was made for them either from the secret service or in the form of a pension
at the Exchequer. <a href="#fnn50" name="anchorn50">(fn. 50)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p19">While the conventions governing the under secretaryships were in general firmly
fixed it was not unknown for individual Secretaries of State to vary them in detail. In
addition to his Under Secretaries a Secretary might employ other individuals whose
standing in the office approximated more closely to theirs than to that of the Clerks.
On entering office in 1755 Fox removed Rivers from the position of Under Secretary
to make way for Digby. However, he retained the services of the former who was given
a salary of £200 with the title of Interpreter of Southern Languages and in fact acted
as an additional Under Secretary until he regained his former position in the following
year. <a href="#fnn51" name="anchorn51">(fn. 51)</a> In 1759 Holdernesse took what was apparently an unprecedented step in
replacing one of his Under Secretaries, Wallace, by Fraser and Morin, whose subordinate position relative to the remaining Under Secretary, Potenger, was marked by
the fact that he retained a half share in the Under Secretaries' fees for the office while
they were obliged to divide the other share between them. <a href="#fnn52" name="anchorn52">(fn. 52)</a> For a decade thereafter it
was usual for this pattern to be reproduced in one of the offices. No consistent designation was applied to the Under Secretaries in this subordinate position. They were
most commonly described as 'Assistants to the Under Secretary' or 'Assistant Under
Secretaries'. <a href="#fnn53" name="anchorn53">(fn. 53)</a> For the sake of convenience the latter term has been used throughout
these lists. The usual number of Assistant Under Secretaries was two but Shelburne
employed three between 1766 and 1768. After 1768 no more were appointed and the
earlier practice of having two Under Secretaries of equal standing in each office was
observed until the end of the period.</p>
			<p id="p20">While the Under Secretaries remained formally the personal servants of the
Secretaries of State, they gradually acquired public functions in their own right.
During the reign of Charles II it was the practice for one of the Under Secretaries in
the office of the senior Secretary to be appointed by the Irish government its salaried
agent in England. <a href="#fnn54" name="anchorn54">(fn. 54)</a> From 1695 the Lords Justices selected their Secretaries from
amongst the Under Secretaries. <a href="#fnn55" name="anchorn55">(fn. 55)</a> In the early eighteenth century they were regularly
included in the commissions of the peace for Middlesex in order that they might
conduct examinations of witnesses. <a href="#fnn56" name="anchorn56">(fn. 56)</a> Their public standing was confirmed in the
Place Act of 1742, the need for the approval by the crown of their appointments and
the grant of a regular salary from public funds in 1770.</p>
			<p id="p21">Lack of evidence makes it difficult to say how far there was a regular division of
duties between the Under Secretaries. In the memorandum of 1684 specific duties
were assigned to Cooke and Wynne. Cooke's functions were in some respects similar
to those undertaken by the 'English and ancientest' Secretary in Coke's office in 1628.
After about 1689 the distinction of rank that can be observed in the case of Cooke and
Wynne seems to have disappeared and given way to the convention that the Under
Secretaries were equal in standing if not in actual importance. <a href="#fnn57" name="anchorn57">(fn. 57)</a> This may have
resulted in greater flexibility in the distribution of duties. In 1737 Couraud, Under
Secretary to Newcastle, was able to say that 'Domestic Business falls chiefly to my
care: Foreign to my brother Stone'. <a href="#fnn58" name="anchorn58">(fn. 58)</a> This distinction is a perfectly reasonable one
but there is little to suggest that it hardened into a permanent convention. It would
appear that each incoming Secretary was free to arrange the distribution of business as
he thought fit. <a href="#fnn59" name="anchorn59">(fn. 59)</a> The only occasions on which the fact that Under Secretaries were
specialising in a particular field of business was publicly acknowledged occurred in
1763 when Sedgwick was appointed Under Secretary for American Affairs by Halifax
and in 1766 when Shelburne gave two of his Assistant Under Secretaries, Macleane
and Morgann, similar responsibilities. <a href="#fnn60" name="anchorn60">(fn. 60)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p22">A detailed account of the recruitment of Under Secretaries is outside the scope of
this introduction. Broadly speaking, the holders of these offices fall into a number of
different but by no means necessarily exclusive categories. <a href="#fnn61" name="anchorn61">(fn. 61)</a> Some were close relatives
or dependants of the Secretaries who brought them into office. Others had diplomatic
experience. Perhaps of greatest interest in the context of these lists are those who had
had earlier careers in the Secretaries' offices. There is no evidence that Clerks could
look forward to promotion to under secretaryships as a matter of right. <a href="#fnn62" name="anchorn62">(fn. 62)</a> Examples of
such promotion are not frequent and appear in every case to have resulted from the
special qualities of the individuals in question. Some were appointed directly from the
offices; others after a period of service elsewhere. <a href="#fnn63" name="anchorn63">(fn. 63)</a> 
			</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s5">CHIEF CLERKS</h3>
			<p id="p23">By 1702 the place in the hierarchy of the two offices immediately after the Under
Secretaries had come to be occupied by an official known as the First or Chief Clerk.
The early history of this office, to which reference is first made in 1700, is obscure.
In 1786 the Chief Clerk in the Home Department summarised his duties as follows:
'to prepare all warrants and commissions for the Royal Signature, to distribute the
official business to the Clerks, to examine it when done, to take care that the public
dispatches are properly entered in the books of the Office, and punctually transmitted,
to receive the Secretary of State's salary, all the fees, and to pay all the Under Clerks
salaries, and contingencies of Office'. He went on to state that he had no salary and
that his official income arose principally under the following heads: 'a fixed proportion
of the fees of office' and 'a moiety of gratuities received upon certain warrants signed
by the King'. <a href="#fnn64" name="anchorn64">(fn. 64)</a> While this description dates from after the division of the secretariat
into the Home and Foreign Departments, there is no reason to suppose that it does
not provide a generally accurate account of the functions and remuneration of the
Chief Clerks throughout the eighteenth century. The evidence suggests, however, that
the special position enjoyed by the Chief Clerks was achieved gradually and only as a
result of the transfer to them of functions which had previously been carried out by
distinct officials. The earliest document to throw any light on this question is the
memorandum of 1684. In it one Clerk is singled out from the rest and described in
the following terms: 'Mr. Widdows (who may be styled the writing clerk) transcribes
all papers for the King's hand, and enters them when signed; is reckoned Mr. Cooke's
clerk and to be paid by him at £50 a year, besides 2s 6d out of each signature that
passeth and pays...'. <a href="#fnn65" name="anchorn65">(fn. 65)</a> It will be clear that this Clerk has some features in common
with the later Chief Clerks. Unlike the other junior Clerks in the office at this date he
had a recognised right to fees. He was particularly concerned with royal documents.
In connection with his duty of entering papers it should be noted that as early as 1610
there was a Clerk of the Entries in Salisbury's office and that as late as 1719 the fees
of the Chief Clerks are described as arising in favour of the 'Entering Clerk'. <a href="#fnn66" name="anchorn66">(fn. 66)</a> The
fact that Widdows was 'reckoned' Cooke's clerk and was paid by him suggests that the
functions which he performed had originally been part of the duties of the Secretary's
senior subordinate who had found it convenient to delegate them. If this is correct it
seems likely that the process of delegation continued since the task of judging 'of the
style and forms of the office when anything occurs that is difficult or without precedent' <a href="#fnn67" name="anchorn67">(fn. 67)</a> which fell to Cooke in 1684 was later one of the special responsibilities of the
Chief Clerks.</p>
			<p id="p24">While, therefore, there seems little doubt that the office of Chief Clerk evolved from
that of Entering or Writing Clerk, the nature of the evidence makes it impossible to
state with certainty when the former achieved its distinctive position at the head of the
clerical staff. One factor that would appear to be relevant in this connection is the
doubling of the fee due to the Entering Clerk on royal 'signatures' which occurred
between 1684 and 1699. <a href="#fnn68" name="anchorn68">(fn. 68)</a> It has already been suggested that it was about 1689 that a
new arrangement was made for the division of the fees between the Under Secretaries.
It is conceivable that this was part of a general reorganisation of the functions and
remuneration of the Secretaries' officials. The opportunity may have been taken to
discontinue the Entering Clerk's salary which had been a charge on the senior Under
Secretary and to increase the fee due to him in compensation. At the same time the
recipient of this increased fee may have been given enlarged responsibilities and
authority over the more junior Clerks-a development which in the course of time
gave rise to the adoption of the title 'First' or Chief Clerk.</p>
			<p id="p25">One of the problems of drawing up lists of the early Chief Clerks arises from the
fact that it was only from 1718 that the holders of these offices are regularly distinguished from their colleagues in lists of Secretaries' officials. Before this date
identification must in many cases be tentative. However, some indication of their
identity is to be found in an examination of the arrangements for keeping the accounts
of the offices. It has already been noted that this was one of the principal functions of
the Chief Clerks in the later eighteenth century. At that time they kept two separate
sets of accounts: one of the office fees and the other of the receipts and disbursements
of the Secretaries of State. According to the memorandum of 1684 the accounts of the
fees were kept at that date by the Office Keeper in one office and by a Clerk in the
other. No further information is available on this subject until the period of Vernon's
secretaryship 1697-1702. The accounts of Vernon's receipts and expenditure as
Secretary of State were kept throughout by Welby. It is clear that at this date this
function was not necessarily combined with that of keeping accounts of the office fees.
Welby was indeed responsible for keeping such accounts from 1697 to 1698 and again
from 1699 to 1702 but between May 1698 and March 1699 this function was undertaken by A. Stanyan. In this connection it should be noted that in the earliest list
which specifically mentions these officials Stanyan is designated Chief Clerk to
Vernon. <a href="#fnn69" name="anchorn69">(fn. 69)</a> This list was published in 1700 by which time Stanyan had left the office
and it must, therefore, be used with caution. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Stanyan
would have been singled out in this way if he had not in fact occupied the office at
some point. It is significant that the next list, published in 1701, names Welby as
Vernon's Chief Clerk. In the other office Swinford appears as Chief Clerk both in
1700 (to Jersey) and in 1701 (to Hedges). <a href="#fnn70" name="anchorn70">(fn. 70)</a> Swinford is known to have kept the
accounts of the fees in Hedges' office. On the basis of this evidence it would appear
that, by the time of the appointments of Vernon in 1697 and Jersey in 1699, the Chief
Clerks had already acquired the distinctive function of keeping the accounts of the
office fees.</p>
			<p id="p26">Any attempt to distinguish earlier Chief Clerks must be highly speculative. One or
two suggestions may, however, be made. In 1697 Bernard was receiving fees for
Shrewsbury and it is possible that he was doing so as his Chief Clerk. Stanyan was in
Trumbull's office in the same year. It is clear from the surviving accounts that he was
not being paid a regular salary like Trumbull's other Clerks and the explanation for
this may be that he was receiving his remuneration in the form of the fees due to the
Chief Clerk. In 1694 Stanyan occurs first in a list of the Clerks in the office of Trenchard, Trumbull's predecessor as Secretary of State, which may mean that he served
him as Chief Clerk as well. In the same list the Clerk occupying the corresponding
position in Nottingham's office is Yard. <a href="#fnn71" name="anchorn71">(fn. 71)</a> Yard heads the list of Shrewsbury's Clerks
in 1689 and may have entered Nottingham's service as Chief Clerk when the latter
became sole Secretary in 1690, displacing Armstrong who is listed as Nottingham's
most senior Clerk in the previous year. <a href="#fnn72" name="anchorn72">(fn. 72)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p27">After 1700 the identity of the Chief Clerks can be established more securely.
Although, as has been seen, it is not until 1718 that they are regularly distinguished
from their colleagues, there seems no reason to doubt that the names which appear
first on the lists of Clerks are those of the Chief Clerks. Where other evidence is
available it supports this conclusion. Thus it seems clear that Armstrong served as
Chief Clerk to Nottingham from 1702 to 1704. Harley appointed Jones, probably on
succeeding Nottingham in the latter year. Jones served all succeeding Secretaries
until his death in 1719. In the other office Swinford evidently served Hedges during
both his secretaryships (1700-1; 1702-6), his tenure of office being interrupted while
Manchester was Secretary in 1702. The latter apparently employed Lewis as Chief
Clerk. Delafaye is named first in the list of Sunderland's Clerks in 1708 and may have
been appointed Chief Clerk by him on his entry into office in 1706. Delafaye remained
to serve the succeeding Secretary, Dartmouth, but left the office in 1713 on being
appointed Private Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The identity of the
individual who served as Chief Clerk to Bromley, Dartmouth's successor, is unknown.
The next Secretary, Stanhope, appointed Micklethwaite in 1714 and when Sunderland succeeded Stanhope in 1717 he replaced Micklethwaite by Wace who remained
in office under all succeeding Secretaries until his death in 1745.</p>
			<p id="p28">The details of the probable succession to the two chief clerkships have been given at
some length in order to illustrate a significant change that occurred in the character
of the offices during the early years of the eighteenth century. Of the first identifiable
Chief Clerks several had a special personal relationship with the Secretaries whom
they were serving and a tenure similar to that of the Under Secretaries. Thus Welby,
who was Vernon's nephew, acted as Chief Clerk only during his uncle's secretaryship.
Swinford, although apparently taken over by Hedges from Jersey, served only Hedges
thereafter, leaving office with him both in 1701 and 1706. Armstrong, who was
Nottingham's man of business, served only while his master was Secretary. Lewis had
been in the service of Manchester while the latter had been Ambassador to France.
A rather different case was that of A. Stanyan whose probable tenure of the office of
Chief Clerk was punctuated by his appointment as Secretary to the Embassy to
Venice (1697-8) and terminated by his appointment as Secretary to the Embassy to
France (1699-1700). It is not difficult to see the disadvantages of this situation. With
the two Under Secretaries on a precarious tenure the fact that the Chief Clerk was not
normally a permanent official meant that there could be a serious loss of continuity on
a change of Secretary. This was probably one of the considerations which led to the
acceptance of the convention that the post should be filled from amongst the more
senior of the Clerks serving in the offices and should be held on what amounted to a
permanent tenure, unaffected by changes of Secretary. In one of the offices this
convention was established during Jones's period of service (1704-19). In the other,
the career of Delafaye, Chief Clerk 1706-13, appears to indicate the acceptance of the
same convention. However, Stanhope, by selecting as his Chief Clerk Micklethwaite
who had been his Secretary when he was Ambassador to Spain, reverted to the older
practice and it was only with the appointment of Wace, Chief Clerk 1717-45, that the
new convention finally became established in this office.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s6">CLERKS</h3>
			<p id="p29">By 1702 it had long been accepted that the Secretaries should employ a number of
Clerks apart from the Under Secretaries and the Chief Clerks. In the absence of the
relevant records it is impossible to give a complete account of these Clerks until the
eighteenth century although a few documents do survive which enable some idea to be
formed of their place in the structure of the offices in the earlier period. The memorandum on the state of Arlington's office in 1673 suggests that in this office at this date
Arlington's two 'Secretaries', Bridgeman and Richards, were the only officials in his
direct employment and that the Clerks, Yard, Ball and Swaddell, belonged rather to
Williamson than to him. This inference is supported by the evidence of the rivalry
which existed between the Secretaries and Clerks which is to be found in the letters
written to Williamson whilst he was on a diplomatic mission to Cologne in 1673. <a href="#fnn73" name="anchorn73">(fn. 73)</a> 
However, as already suggested, Williamson's position was unusual and it is doubtful
whether the organisation of Arlington's office was typical. The memorandum on
Middleton's office of 1684 is the next document to throw any light on the position of
the Clerks. This memorandum has several characteristics in common with the description of Coke's office in 1628 which suggests that it is more representative of the
normal state of affairs. In the list of Middleton's Clerks the names of Cooke and
Wynne are followed by those of three Clerks, de Paz, Chute and Carne, who are
stated to have received salaries 'at the rate of £40 or £50 per annum and Mr. Chute
at £60'. In 1628 the Junior Clerks or 'Secretaries' in Coke's office had 'allowances the
best 40 l., the others 20 l. or 30 l. per annum apiece at most'. <a href="#fnn74" name="anchorn74">(fn. 74)</a> The distinguishing
features of these Clerks were that they had no entitlement to official fees and that they
received fixed salaries. It may be inferred from the document of 1684 that these
salaries were paid directly by the Secretary of State. This was certainly the case for
both offices in 1698 <a href="#fnn75" name="anchorn75">(fn. 75)</a> and continued to be so until the end of the period.</p>
			<p id="p30">The right of appointing the Clerks belonged to the Secretaries as did that of dismissing them and fixing the level of their salaries. Before 1689 lack of evidence makes
it difficult to say how far it was the practice for an incoming Secretary to take over his
predecessor's Clerks. An examination of the careers of such Clerks as Benson, Tucker
and Yard shows that this occasionally occurred earlier. The retention of Clerks was
not, however, an automatic process at this period. In 1693 Trenchard dispensed with
the services of Le Pin, who had spent eighteen years as a Clerk in the Secretaries'
offices. In his petition for a retiring pension Le Pin makes it clear that his employment
by Shrewsbury (1689) and Sydney (1690) had in each case involved the intervention of
influential patrons. <a href="#fnn76" name="anchorn76">(fn. 76)</a> However, within a few years of this there is an indication that the
Clerks had succeeded in establishing themselves on a more or less permanent basis.</p>
			<p id="p31">The accounts of Vernon's secretaryship cover two periods when the other office was
left vacant for more than a quarter. On both occasions Vernon paid the salaries of some
at least of the Clerks in that office as well as those in his own. <a href="#fnn77" name="anchorn77">(fn. 77)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p32">From the beginning of Anne's reign it seems to have been accepted that an incoming
Secretary would take over such of his predecessor's Clerks as wished to remain in the
office. While dismissals were not unknown, <a href="#fnn78" name="anchorn78">(fn. 78)</a> it is clear that, during the eighteenth
century, the Secretaries' power was in practical terms limited to the making of new
appointments. <a href="#fnn79" name="anchorn79">(fn. 79)</a> In this respect the Secretaries' offices conformed to the general
pattern which prevailed in the government service throughout the eighteenth century.
There was a natural desire to retain the services of efficient Clerks in the interests of
continuity. On the other hand the absence of any comprehensive system of retiring
allowances made it a matter of humanity not to deprive the old or infirm of their means
of livelihood. This approach to the problem is illustrated by Newcastle's statement
'There are some (Clerks) that are of very little use but being there I don't care to
displace them'. <a href="#fnn80" name="anchorn80">(fn. 80)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p33">Subject to these considerations the Secretaries were free to fix the number of their
Clerks at whatever level they wished. In 1732 Newcastle summed up the situation by
saying'...there is not any fixed Number of clerks in my office and as they are paid
by me there are more or less as the business requires'. <a href="#fnn81" name="anchorn81">(fn. 81)</a> During the period covered by
these lists there were considerable variations in the number employed. As already
noted there were three Clerks in Arlington's office in 1673 and in Middleton's in 1684.
Trumbull (1695-7) employed four and Vernon (1697-1702) from four to five. During
the first half of the eighteenth century the average number of Clerks in each office
increased from five to six. Between 1750 and 1782 there were usually between seven
and nine although there were occasionally more marked variations. The most significant of these occurred in the years immediately after 1766 when Shelburne's appointment of additional Clerks in connection with colonial business had the effect of
increasing the number in one of the offices to thirteen. On the eve of the reorganisation
of the secretariat in 1782 there were, apart from the Chief Clerks, seven Clerks in the
Northern and nine in the Southern Department.</p>
			<p id="p34">Little is known of the functions of the Clerks. The memoranda of 1673 and 1684
give some indication of their activities at these dates. There is, however, no evidence
of any permanent arrangements for the distribution of work. Even as late as 1786 the
Clerks in the Home and Foreign Offices had 'no particular branches of business
assigned to them'. <a href="#fnn82" name="anchorn82">(fn. 82)</a> Towards the end of the period the more senior Clerks came to be
distinguished by the designation 'Senior Clerks'. In one office this was applied to two
Clerks from 1763 and in the other to three from 1772. The origin of this distinction
is unknown and there is no means of discovering whether it reflected any significant
change in the organisation of business. Much of the Clerks' time was spent in copying
letters and other documents although the more able were, in all probability, given
greater responsibilities. In 1735 and 1736 one of the Clerks, the elder Payzant, was
described as 'Translator'. <a href="#fnn83" name="anchorn83">(fn. 83)</a> Obviously a knowledge of at least one foreign language was
a useful accomplishment-a fact which no doubt explains the employment of a
significant number of Clerks of Huguenot origin. However, the fact that special
arrangements were made for the translation of German, Southern (Italian and
Spanish) and Oriental languages suggests that the Clerks' knowledge rarely extended
beyond French. <a href="#fnn84" name="anchorn84">(fn. 84)</a> 
			</p>
			<p id="p35">There are indications that, in addition to the Clerks on the establishments of the
offices, it was the practice to appoint supernumeraries. Delafaye began his career as an
unsalaried 'Extraordinary' Clerk to Jersey and Vernon. In 1717 an application was
made on behalf of a candidate that he might 'succeed Mr. Armestead or at least stand
next...as a Clerk Extraordinary which I think has been of late practised'. <a href="#fnn85" name="anchorn85">(fn. 85)</a> Similarly
in 1732 the Earl of Carlisle asked Newcastle to admit a candidate 'as a Clerk in your
office and if at present you have no room for him that you will allow him to attend as
a supernumerary which I am told is frequently done'. <a href="#fnn86" name="anchorn86">(fn. 86)</a> There are traces of this
practice later in the century although in 1785 there were no supernumeraries in either
the Home or Foreign Offices. <a href="#fnn87" name="anchorn87">(fn. 87)</a> Occasionally Secretaries of State allowed certain
individuals to spend some time in their offices on an unpaid basis in order to prepare
themselves for a career in public life. This practice is illustrated by the career of
Jenkinson who served in Holdernesse's office on this basis. In 1785 there was a person
in the Home Office who 'has no salary, but attends the office merely to obtain a
knowledge of the management of public business'. <a href="#fnn88" name="anchorn88">(fn. 88)</a> 
			</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s7">PRIVATE SECRETARIES</h3>
			<p id="p36">Something should be said at this point about Private Secretaries. In the establishments
of the Home, Foreign and War Offices drawn up in 1795 provision was made for
salaried Private Secretaries to the Secretaries of State. <a href="#fnn89" name="anchorn89">(fn. 89)</a> Before 1782, however, the
arrangements in this respect lacked definition and appear to have varied widely. In all
probability most Secretaries of State employed some kind of Private Secretary in
addition to their Under Secretaries. The nature of the evidence is such that these
individuals can only rarely be identified and it is impossible to draw up satisfactory lists
for the period. Some Secretaries of State selected their Private Secretaries from amongst
the Clerks already on the establishment of their offices. <a href="#fnn90" name="anchorn90">(fn. 90)</a> Others brought their Private
Secretaries from outside. As early as 1688 Preston brought Tempest with him to
attend to his 'private affairs in the office'. <a href="#fnn91" name="anchorn91">(fn. 91)</a> Balaguier's position in Carteret's office
1721-4 appears to have been that of Private Secretary. However, the only Private
Secretaries whose appointments were publicly acknowledged in the sense that they
were notified to the Post Office were Blair, Private Secretary to Harrington (1730 and
1742) and Cosby, Private Secretary to Halifax (1762). <a href="#fnn92" name="anchorn92">(fn. 92)</a> The standing and importance
of the Private Secretaries varied greatly. Balaguier acted as Carteret's Under Secretary
when he accompanied the King to Hanover in 1723 and when Blair accompanied
Harrington there during his periods of office he was always ranked between the Under
Secretaries and the Chief Clerk. H. V. Jones was similarly ranked in 1748 and 1750
when he was acting in fact, if not in name, as Private Secretary to Newcastle. <a href="#fnn93" name="anchorn93">(fn. 93)</a> These
are isolated cases, however, and the Private Secretary's position appears usually to
have been more humble.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s8">SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS</h3>
			<p id="p37">In 1702 the personnel of each office was completed by two Chamber or Office Keepers
and one Cleaner or Necessary Woman. The employment of some kind of Office
Keeper was probably as old as the Secretaries' offices themselves. In 1684 'the Office
Keeper' was amongst those entitled to official fees. Before the end of the seventeenth
century the number of Office Keepers employed appears to have varied. By 1698 it
was fixed at two for each office who received, in addition to their fees, salaries from the
Secretaries of State. A Cleaner is first mentioned in Trumbull's office in 1695. From
1698 it was the rule for there to be one salaried Office Cleaner or, as she was more
commonly designated in the later eighteenth century, 'Necessary Woman', in each
office. Office Keepers sometimes executed their duties by deputy.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s9">RELATIONSHIP OF OFFICIALS TO THE
SECRETARIES OF STATE</h3>
			<p id="p38">Throughout the period the attachment of the staff at all levels was to the Secretaries
of State rather than to the departments in which they were serving. It was the general
rule for a newly appointed Secretary to take over the officials who had served his
predecessor and to take his staff with him if he subsequently moved from one department to the other. But there were exceptions to this convention. When Vernon
moved from the Northern to the Southern Department in 1700 he retained one of his
Under Secretaries, Hopkins, and replaced the other, Ellis, by Yard who had served as
Under Secretary to Jersey, the last Secretary in the Southern Department. Ellis was
appointed an Under Secretary by Hedges, the incoming Secretary for the Northern
Department. As far as the Clerks were concerned, Vernon took two, Jones and de
Lacombe de Vrigny, with him, left three, Payzant, Vanbrugh and Roberts, in the
Northern Department, and took on three, Egar, Tilson and Weston, who had served
Jersey in the Southern Department. Finally Vernon left to Hedges the Office Keepers,
Smith and Ramsey, who had served him in the Northern Department and took on
Shorter and Turner, who had previously been employed in the Southern Department.
However, when Vernon returned to the Northern Department in 1702, he took his
entire staff with him. For the next three instances in which a Secretary was transferred from one department to the other during his term of office information is scarce
but it appears that, as a rule, the Secretary took his officials with him. <a href="#fnn94" name="anchorn94">(fn. 94)</a> There were no
further transfers until 1748 when Newcastle, on moving from the Southern to the
Northern Department, took all his staff with him. With one exception, Wallace, the
Clerks and subordinate staff who had served Chesterfield, the previous Secretary for
the Northern Department, moved to the Southern Department. Wallace was, however, retained by Newcastle in his old department. Perhaps the greatest change to take
place in the personnel of a Secretary's office occurred in 1754 when Holdernesse
moved from the Southern to the Northern Department. Holdernesse brought one of
his Under Secretaries, Potenger, with him to replace Amyand who was transferred to
the Southern Department. He also brought with him two Clerks, F. Wace and Fraser,
who had served him in the Southern Department. Otherwise the personnel of the two
department was unaffected by the transfer. Halifax took his whole staff with him on
being transferred from the Northern to the Southern Department in 1763. In 1766,
Seymour Conway, on being transferred from the Southern to the Northern Department took all his staff with him with the exception of two Assistant Under Secretaries,
P. M. Morin and Roberts, and two Clerks, Brietzcke and J. Morin, who remained to
serve Richmond, the incoming Southern Secretary. In addition Seymour Conway
retained one Clerk, Jouvencel, who had served Grafton, the previous Secretary for the
Northern Department. In 1768 Weymouth, on moving from the Northern to the
Southern Department, took all his officials with him. In 1770 Rochford did the same
in similar circumstances for all his staff except the Office Keepers and the Necessary
Woman.</p>
			<p id="p39">There are a few examples of officials changing departments in other circumstances.
In 1724 Delafaye, Under Secretary to Townshend in the Northern Department, was
transferred to the Southern Department as Under Secretary to Newcastle. In the
following year one of Townshend's Clerks, Couraud, was also transferred to Newcastle's service. In 1746 Newcastle selected as his Chief Clerk the elder Larpent who
was serving not in his own office but in that of his colleague, Harrington. In 1775, on
the appointment of Weymouth as Secretary of State for the South, the two Chief
Clerks, Sneyd and Shadwell, exchanged places as did the Office Keepers and Necessary Women.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s10">OFFICIALS OF THE SCOTTISH AND COLONIAL
DEPARTMENTS</h3>
			<p id="p40">The pattern of organisation which evolved for the two older offices naturally influenced
the arrangements made when the Scottish and Colonial Departments were created in
1709 and 1768. Little is known of the officials of the Scottish Secretaries except for
Tweeddale's period of office. Queensberry (1709-11) employed two Under Secretaries, a Chief Clerk, two other Clerks and an Office Keeper. Mar (1713-14) appears
to have appointed only one Under Secretary, and in this seems to have been followed
by his successors. Tweeddale (1742-6) employed one Under Secretary, a Chief Clerk,
one other Clerk, an Office Keeper and a Necessary Woman. In the Colonial Department only one Under Secretary was at first appointed, presumably because the fees in
the department were insufficient to provide remuneration for another. In 1770,
however, when salaries were made available by the crown for two Under Secretaries
in each department, a second was appointed. In other respects the structure of the
department conformed closely to that of the Northern and Southern offices. Successive Secretaries employed two Under Secretaries, a Chief Clerk, two Senior Clerks,
between four and five other Clerks, an Office Keeper and a Necessary Woman. In
general there was little interchange of personnel between the office of the third
Secretary and those of the two older Secretaries. There were, however, a few cases
where this occurred. <a href="#fnn95" name="anchorn95">(fn. 95)</a> 
			</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-s11">OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE SECRETARIAT</h3>
			<p id="p41">Throughout the period covered by these lists there were in existence a number of
offices whose holders, while not under the immediate direction of the Secretaries of
State, were in varying degrees subject to their general authority. Of these the Keeper
of State Papers, the Clerks of the Signet, the Secretaries for the Latin and French
Tongues and the Embellisher of Letters originated before the Restoration. The rest,
comprising the Gazette Writer (1665), the Decipherers (1701), the Interpreter of
Oriental Languages (1723), the Collector of State Papers (1725), the Translator of the
German Language (1735), the Law Clerk (1743), the Translator of Southern Languages
(1755) and the Methodisers of State Papers (1764) were instituted subsequently. All
these officials were common to the secretariat as a whole. The offices of Secretary
for the French Tongue, Law Clerk and Translator of Southern Languages had been
discontinued by 1782. For the remainder the reorganisation of that year had no special
significance and they continued to exist largely unchanged. Details of these offices
will be found in the introductory notes to the lists of appointments. In the interests of
continuity their holders have been included in the lists down to their abolition in the
nineteenth century. <a href="#fnn96" name="anchorn96">(fn. 96)</a>

(Shelburne MS 134 pp. 101-61). A certain amount of material covering the years 1769-82 exists amongst
the records of the Foreign Office (FO 95/591/1 ff. 1-8; FO 366/669 pp. 9-15). The first comprehensive

remained constant at £5, £1 and 2s 6d respectively. At some point between 1684 and 1699 the fee of
the Writing or Entering Clerk rose from 2s 6d to 5s (BM Add. MS 40784). For summarised totals of

The officials received travelling allowances but no board wages for the journey in 1727 which was cut
short by the King's death. Travelling allowances were paid in September 1742 in connection with a
journey which never actually took place. From 1725 it was the general rule for the Secretary of State

Thomson appears to be 'Court Post' (SP 35/14 ff. 19-20). The Secretaries of State successfully resisted
a recommendation by the Commissioners on Fees of 1786 that the offices of Keeper and Collector of
State Papers, Secretary for the Latin Tongue and Writer of the Gazette should be abolished, on the
ground that 'the nomination to these offices . . . affords almost the only means which the Secretaries of
State have of rewarding Officers for diligence and long services' (<em>1st Rept. on Fees</em>, 12; <em>16th Rept. on
Finance</em>, 310-11). They did, however, suggest the abolition of the sinecure office of Translator of the
German Language (<em>16th Rept. on Finance</em>, 310).</li></a><a id="fnn50"><li>

			<em>Notes and Queries</em>, cxcix (1954), 208. Between 1762 and 1764 Weston evidently received all the
Under Secretaries' fees in his office (ibid. cciv (1959), 284; SP 45/31). During this period the Assistant
Under Secretaries were presumably paid salaries by the Secretaries of State. For the arrangements
made in Seymour Conway's office in 1765, see Hist. MSS Comm. <em>10th Rept</em>., 391-2.</li></a><a id="fnn53"><li>
<a href="#anchorn53">53</a>.  In 1749 Aspinwall, one of Newcastle's Clerks, was described as 'Assistant Secretary' (<em>Court and
City Reg</em>. (1749), 106). The significance of this designation is obscure.</li></a><a id="fnn54"><li>
<a href="#anchorn54">54</a>.  The agency, to which a salary of £100 was attached, was exercised by Bridgeman to 1674, Thynne
1674-80 and again by Bridgeman from 1680 (<em>CSPD 1670</em>, 285; Coventry MS 17 ff. 147-9; Hist. MSS
Comm. <em>Ormonde</em>, iv, 579; ibid. v, 271; ibid. vi, 40; Evans, <em>Principal Secretary</em>, 165). The subsequent
history of the agency is obscure. It may have been replaced by the practice, first recorded in 1702,
of paying allowances of £50 from the Irish concordatum fund to each of the four Under Secretaries
(BM Add. MS 28889 ff. 158, 179, 183).</li></a><a id="fnn55"><li>
<a href="#anchorn55">55</a>.  The following Under Secretaries acted as Secretaries to the Lords Justices: Vernon 1695-7 (<em>CTB</em>,
xiii, 406); Yard 1698-1701 (ibid. xiv, 222; ibid. xv, 187; ibid. xvi, 141, 391); Delafaye 1719-26 (T 52/30
pp. 59, 442; T 52/33 p. 73; T 29/25 p. 135); Couraud and Stone 1740-1 (<em>CTBP 1739-41</em>, 407, 606);
Stone and Weston 1743 (<em>CTBP 1742-5</em>, 426); Stone and Ramsden 1745 (ibid. 824); Aldworth and

Potenger 1752 (T 52/46 p. 130); Amyand and Rivers 1755 (T 52/47 p. 170). Addison, a former Under
Secretary, acted as Secretary in 1714 (<em>CTB</em>, xxix, 776). As Secretaries these individuals received £500
for each period during which the Lords Justices acted. From 1719 an allowance was also made available
for distribution amongst the Clerks and other officials of the secretariat for their services to the Lords
Justices. Originally £200, this allowance was raised to £300 in 1740 and to £400 in 1743 (T 53/28 p. 42;
<em>CTBP 1739-41, 407; CTBP 1742-5</em>, 426).</li></a><a id="fnn56"><li>
<a href="#anchorn56">56</a>.  See the following letters requesting the appointment of Under Secretaries as Justices: 26 Jan. 1705
for Lewis (BM Loan 29/263 p. 56); 1 July 1710 for Warre and Lewis (SP 44/110 p. 8); 8 Oct. 1714 for
C. Stanhope, Pringle, Tilson and Walpole (SP 44/117 p. 5; SP 44/147); 8 May 1717 for Delafaye
(SP 44/120 p. 157). See also SP 45/8 pp. 111-15.</li></a><a id="fnn57"><li>
<a href="#anchorn57">57</a>.  Occasional references to 'First' and 'Second' Under Secretaries imply a distinction of rank but this
was not reflected in any permanent administrative arrangements. See, for example, <em>Gent. Mag</em>. (1754),
xxiv, 143; Hist. MSS Comm. <em>10th Rept</em>., 392-3.</li></a><a id="fnn58"><li>

was made by Pulteney in 1691 (BM Add. MS 34095 f. 351).</li></a><a id="fnn59"><li>
<a href="#anchorn59">59</a>.  There is no suggestion in the evidence given by the Under Secretaries in 1785 that there was any
permanent arrangement for the distribution of business at that date (<em>1st Rept. on Fees</em>, 19, 27). See also

for the Latin and French Tongues-officials appointed by the crown (ibid. 168). While there can be no
certainty on the point, the context seems to make it more natural to suppose that the individuals
in question were in the direct employment of the Secretary of State as 'Clerks'. Furthermore the
salaries are smaller than those enjoyed by the Secretaries for the Latin and French Tongues.</li></a><a id="fnn75"><li>

<a href="#anchorn79">79</a>.  There is no suggestion in Brietzcke's diary that a change of Secretary imperilled his position in the
office. The diary records the entry into office of Bute in 1761, Grenville in 1762 and Halifax in 1764
(<em>Notes and Queries</em>, cc (1955), 162-3; ibid. cciv (1959), 283; ibid. ccv (1960), 391). See also Stormont's

			<em>1st Rept. on Fees</em>, 4. Some insight into the work of the Clerks in Harley's office may be obtained
from the evidence given by Gregg in 1708 (<em>Lords Journals</em>, xviii, 516-19). Brietzcke's diary is valuable
for the 1760s. For the regulations governing the attendance of Clerks in Richmond's office in 1766, see

he was succeeded by Jouvencel as 'Translator of modern languages in the secretary of state's office for

However, in 1704 Delafaye, instead of being taken on by Harley with the rest of Nottingham's Clerks,
appears to have remained in the Southern Department to serve Hedges on his transfer there.</li></a><a id="fnn95"><li>
<a href="#anchorn95">95</a>.  T. Stanyan, the first Chief Clerk in the Scottish Department, was transferred from one of the
older offices to which he later returned as Under Secretary. Kineir, originally appointed to one of the
older offices, later served in the Scottish Department. The staff of the Colonial Department included
three individuals with previous experience in the older offices: Phelps (Under Secretary), Pollock (Chief
Clerk) and the younger Larpent (Senior Clerk). On the suppression of the department in 1782 three of
its Clerks, Pollock, Wilmot and Palman and its Deputy Office Keeper, Crowder, were absorbed into
the Home Office. Another former Clerk, Peace, eventually became its Librarian.</li></a><a id="fnn96"><li>
<a href="#anchorn96">96</a>.  The Messengers of the Chamber or King's Messengers are not included in these lists. Technically
they formed part of the Royal Household under the authority of the Lord Chamberlain. During the
18th century, and especially after 1772, they passed increasingly under the control of the Secretaries of
State. For some account of these officials, see A. V. Wheeler-Holohan, <em>The History of the King's
Messengers</em> (London 1935); <em>1st Rept. on Fees</em>, 8-9, 35-7.</li></a>

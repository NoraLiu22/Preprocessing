<A ID="p55"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p55 </SPAN></A>are brought to Aegypt, and thence sent forth again to the other regions; so that double duties are collected, on both imports and exports; and on goods that cost heavily the duty is also heavy. <A NAME="1.13.6"></A>And in fact the country has monopolies also; for Alexandria alone is not only the receptacle of goods of this kind, for the most part, but also the source of supply to the outside world. <A NAME="1.13.7"></A>And, further, one can perceive more clearly these natural advantages if one travels round the country, visiting first of all the part of the coast which begins at Catabathmus — for Aegypt extends as far as that place, though the country next thereafter belongs to the Cyrenaeans and to the neighbouring barbarians, the Marmaridae.

Canobus is a city situated at a distance of one hundred and twenty stadia from Alexandria, if one goes on foot, and was named after Canobus, the pilot of Menelaüs, who died there.

Dr. F. Zucker (<I>Philologus</I> 70, N.F. 24, 1911, pp79‑105) shows that the Romans established a government monopoly of Aegyptian papyrus; but his conclusion that under the Ptolemies there was no such monopoly and that Strabo's words, "some of those who wished to enhance the revenues, etc.," mean that "a number of large proprietors misused their power, and through limiting the cultivation to their own


<A ID="p61x"></A>advantage and to the injury of the public produced a rise in the price of papyrus," is vigorously opposed by Professor J. P. Mahaffy (<I>Hermathena</I>, 16, 1911, pp237‑41), who rightly understands Strabo to refer to "certain chancellors of the exchequer (<SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">διοικηταί</SPAN>) who had to meet a sudden demand by raising money as best they could." However, in a later article (<I>Philologus</I> 74, N.F. 28, pp184‑85) Zucker retracts his former interpretation of the passage, accepting Mahaffy's.

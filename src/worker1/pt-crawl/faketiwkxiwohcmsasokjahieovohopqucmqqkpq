These cottages and their gardens Mr.
Gardner knows how to present for us with a
delicate touch that few other artists in black
and white can ever hope to imitate. Lovers
of Nature who were fortunate enough to visit
his little exhibition last summer at Great
George Street, Westminster—the smallest
among the pictureshows, but by no means
the least—must have been surprised at the
wealth and variety of artistic effect his delicate brush had managed to extract from so apparently limited a range of subjects. As
a matter of fact, the range was not really
limited at all, because Mr. Gardner has the rare power of selecting so many diverse typical themes or points of view, and treating every one with such perfect harmony through out that the spectator’s feeling on viewing each takes a distinctive tinge from the artist’s own individuality thrown diversely into every detail of them. The skies in particular were in this respect admirable. It was not merely that each was a sky in itself, a beautiful atmosphere in the abstract, an element in the picture; but that each was so admirably selected for its particular purpose, so thoroughly in time with the key-note of the sketch to which it formed a sympathetic and harmonious background. This lyric effect in art, if I may be allowed the metaphor, this rounding off of the picture with its appropriate setting is one of the more poetical elements of landscape. Mere handicraft can never attain that skill; no technique can teach it; it is innate in the eye and soul of the true artist. . . .
</p>

<p>These sketches of
Surrey farms are most emphatically painter’s
pictures. Mr. Gardner stands confessedly
at the head of the woodengraving craft in
England at least, if not in the world, and he
has introduced into his special art a spirit
of sympathetic treatment and full realization
of textures and values which hitherto had
hardly so much as been dreamt of in that
intractable material. He has made his
blocks of boxwood positively plastic. One
might have suspected beforehand, therefore,
that his black-and-White drawings would be
success as an engravar on wood has no doubt somewhat modiﬁed Mr. Gardner’s methods. But it hasn't destroyed either his breadth or his spontaneity. It has left him still, when he paints, essentially a painter.
The trees in these drawings, I fancy, more particularly bring out the artist's feeling for the minuter points of natural form and beauty. They are all of them just the thing they pretend to be. The power of represent ing trees, shrubs, and plants in art, in fact, with grace and ease, as well as with perfect ﬁdelity to the underlying truths of Nature, is a rare and very precious quality.— <a href="../../../authors/allen/index.html">Grant Allen </a>

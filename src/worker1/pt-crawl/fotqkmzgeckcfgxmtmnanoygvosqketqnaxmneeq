<H2>Waking Ned (1998)</H2>

<P>D: Kirk Jones<BR>
S: Ian Bannen, David Kelly</P>

<P>Worthless comedy shot in the Isle of Man but set in Ireland which attempts
to capture the feel of Ealing films from forty years ago, but fails miserably
to achieve their tone, pace and humour. This film is transparently desperate
in its appeal to sentimentality and it is offensive in assuming that the
sight of Ian Bannen and David Kelly romping naked on a motorbike along the
roads of an ersatz Ireland is actually funny. Its makers seem to presume
that audiences will allow any amount of bad dialogue, poor plotting and
mawkish drivel to pass for entertainment in the name of 'old fashioned'
comedy, and that playing the Irish card will excuse the absence of any kind
of intelligence.</P>

<P>The plot has promise: a small Irish village conspires to defraud the
National Lottery when one of their number dies upon finding he has won a
&pound;7 million jackpot: but the plotting is appalling, the pace is dead
slow and the central gag (which is well known from trailers and advertising)
is not revealed until far too many utterly uninteresting sub-plots have
been set in motion. One concerns the laughably simplistic courtship between
a single mother and a pig farmer. She rejects him, believe it or not, because
he smells bad (realistic and authentic characterisation...). Another bizarrely
follows the conversations between a substitute priest and a small boy which
don't really have anything to do with anything. They certainly do not advance
the plot and neither character is significant in terms of the film's final
punchline. The main plot then trundles along on a very expositional level,
and little genuine comedy arises out of what would seem a ripe situation.
Nothing very much actually happens other than what is evident from the outset,
and the film fails to generate interesting, let alone funny, situations
arising from its central conceit.</P>

<P>Writer/director Kirk Jones (whose experience to date has been in commercials)
has been completely unable to get past what was obviously the financial
pitch for the project. The script does not deliver even the most basic level
of storytelling upon which to build larger themes, and Jones then directs
with all seriousness scenes which would seem out of place in amateur theatre
in terms of their psychological sophistication. Everything takes much too
long to transpire, and the heavy-handed set ups for big comic scenes rob
the scenes themselves of any pleasure when they finally occur. Not that
there was much to laugh at anyway. As mentioned earlier, many of the laughs
centre on the nudeness of old men, which is humiliating to Ian Bannen and
David Kelly and insulting to the people Jones assumes would find it funny.
The film's final big slapstick scene involves the comic-book death of another
elderly person, and most of what falls in between depends on the acting
ability of its experienced leads to even appear amusing despite the evident
contempt in which it holds their characters.</P>

<P><I>Waking Ned</I> is among the worst films ever made on or about Ireland
and the Irish (comparable with <I><A HREF="gits.htm">Gold in the Streets</A></I>),
and is simply a dreadful piece of film writing and direction even apart
from any considerations of what it suggests about Ireland. This is the kind
of crud which slips through the production net thanks to some backstage
packaging and manages to find a gullible audience by virtue of marketing:
in short it represents all that is worst about cinema. Sponsored by the
Isle of Man Film Commission and by French Television, this reeks of a tax
write off cashing in on a wave of interest in 'Irish' films. It would have
been set in Germany if the money had come from there, or in the Outer Hebrides
of that was the flavour of the month at whatever film festival pub this
rubbish was dreamt up at. Its cynical contempt for the people who pay to
see it is evident in its absolute falsity, and it is baffling that it has
received sympathetic reviews on its U.S. release (where it was called <I>Waking
Ned Devine</I>). Perhaps this is the final terrible irony: its makers are
probably laughing all the way to the bank, which is more than the audience
can do. This is boring, unfunny garbage, and it knows you're a fool for
watching it. It is insulting, offensive and completely without the kind
of heart which made Ealing films so enduring. Avoid it.</P>

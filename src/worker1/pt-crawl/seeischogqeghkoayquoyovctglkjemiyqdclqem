However, when it came time for the final picks segment on NBC’s coverage, Olczyk went with Verifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMage won, while Verifying finished a distant 16th in the 18-horse field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes you change and you win, and sometimes you lose,” Olczyk said during a telephone interview. “But last year probably was the most dejected that I’ve ever been walking out of the Kentucky Derby. Win or lose, you walk out of there feeling good about yourself and the experience because there’s nothing like it. It still burns, and it probably will for a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlczyk was reminded again last week when he was in Las Vegas for the Stanley Cup playoffs when a fan thanked him for the Mage pick. If there was a time to feel good about at least winning someone else money and bad about personal misfortune, that was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlczyk, though, has been right more often when it comes to his picks. The best example was the 2018 Derby when the former hockey player recommended a trifecta of Justify, Good Magic and Audible, which ended up paying $141.40 for a $1 bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlczyk — a part of NBC’s Kentucky Derby coverage since 2015 — remains a part of the network’s horse racing coverage even though it no longer carries the NHL. This is his third season doing hockey for Turner Sports, but it gives him a couple of days during the NHL playoffs to cross over and return to the track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The landscape has changed, but I’m lucky that TNT and NBC were able to come to an agreement, and that NBC still wants me part of the coverage,” he said. “Everyone around the league this time of year wants to talk Derby, and everyone want the Derby wants to talk hockey. I guess I’m the conduit that pleases both sides at this time of year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlczyk had been lobbying his NBC bosses for a couple of years to be part of the horse racing coverage. It wasn’t until he sat down to talk to analyst Randy Moss during the 2014 Sochi Olympics that things started to move forward. Olczyk worked some of the Breeders’ Cup challenge series races in 2014 and hit on a pair of longshots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been told by many people going back before Edzo started doing horse racing for NBC, you’ve got to meet this guy. This guy is a huge horse racing guy, big horse racing fan. At some point, you need to meet him,” Moss said during an NBC conference call earlier this week. “I was talked by friends of mine into going to one of the hockey games for the Olympics. ... After the first period, Eddie comes up and introduces himself and sits down next to me. The guys I was with, I told them I know nothing about hockey, and they were aghast that Eddie would come up and sit down with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All we talked about was horses, not hockey. After the second period, he came back up and sat down again, and all we talked about was horses and not hockey. It was obvious at that point that Eddie was not just a hockey guy. He knew a lot about horse racing, very knowledgeable about horse racing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlczyk’s first experience with handicapping on television wasn’t NBC. During an NHL lockout, he was the in-house simulcast handicapper at New Jersey’s Meadowlands racetrack in the fall of 1994. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlczyk was paired with the late Bob Neumeier for the first two years. Neumeier, coincidentally, called Boston Bruins games on radio for five seasons in the late 1990s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been Olczyk, Matt Bernier and Steve Kornacki for the past couple of years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bob was a legend. I’m inspired because I watched him for so many years. I miss him, especially this time of the year,” Olczyk said. “To be able to have camaraderie with Matt, have some fun, and teach the game has been great. Steve has great energy. When we’re up there, he’s a rock star. He’s brought a lot to the show. I think we all bring different things in, and it’s been great for horse racing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me and Matt coming up different ways and Steve having experience in the political world who is great with numbers and stats. I think people enjoy the camaraderie and disagreements.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e__\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2024-05-03T10:00:46.312Z","updatedDate":"2024-05-03T15:58:19.647Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/sports/horse-racing/kentucky-derby-eddie-olczyk-nbc-q45479","headline":"Year after flip flop, NBC's Eddie Olczyk hopes he feels better about his Kentucky Derby pick","teaserTitle":"Year after flip flop, NBC's Eddie Olczyk hopes he feels better about his Kentucky Derby pick","newsLabel":"","newsLabel2":"","subType":"article","gridFilter":[],"htmlBlurb":"","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.d","title":"Sports","path":"/sports","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Horseracing.d","title":"Horse Racing","path":"/sports/horse-racing","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/9b200a9d-d71a-4b0a-8438-af2eb6c267e6","title":"AP-RAC-Kentucky-Derby-NBC-Olczyk","path":"/sports/horse-racing/kentucky-derby-eddie-olczyk-nbc-q45479","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/image.1.18990194","width":0,"height":0,"title":"SPBSIDE180606_WEB","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:MjJiYTk1ZjAtNWRlMC00:Y2NlNWZj/spbside180606_web.jpg","caption":"Justify's jockey Mike Smith talks to Ed Olczyk after winning the Santa Anita Derby at Santa Anita Park on April  in Arcadia, California.","altTag":null,"byline":"Getty Images / Eclipse Sportswire","organization":null,"floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"imageSize":null,"useFreeform":false},"topMediaItem":null,"verticalMedia":null,"relatedLinks":[]}},{"id":"contentid/4ef57591-544a-4401-b52c-21abc29403a1","__typename":"Teaser","title":"'Canes trying to keep Rangers fans out of Carolina for Games 3 and 4","teaserOvertitle":null,"text":"The team is restricting sales on Ticketmaster to \"residents of North Carolina, South Carolina and southern parts of Virginia.\"","longText":"","customLogo":null,"media":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/243e9c5a-5541-4871-99ec-c65af405c7e1","width":2100,"height":1400,"title":"Rangers Hurricanes Hockey","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:ODJjNDQ0ZjYtZDczOC00:ZDczNWY0/rangers-hurricanes-hockey.jpg","caption":"Rangers fans cheer in the waning moments of a game against the Hurricanes on Feb. 11, 2023, in Raleigh, N.C.","altTag":"","byline":"Chris Seward","organization":"AP","floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"imageSize":"","useFreeform":false},"content":{"__typename":"Article","id":"contentid/4ef57591-544a-4401-b52c-21abc29403a1","lead":"The team is restricting sales on Ticketmaster to \"residents of North Carolina, South Carolina and southern parts of Virginia.\"","body":"\u003cp\u003eThe battle to keep New York fans out of road arenas continues.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, it was 76ers ownership buying up tickets themselves to keep them out of the hands of Knicks fans for Game 6 of the teams’ first-round playoff series on Thursday night.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow the Carolina Hurricanes are trying to keep Rangers fans out of PNC Arena for Games 3 and 4 of that second-round series.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFans looking to buy seats to those games on Ticketmaster’s site on Thursday were met with this warning:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“PNC Arena is located in Raleigh, NC.

CBS announced earlier in the day that Matt Ryan is joining “The NFL Today” after splitting time last season in the studio and being a game analyst.

Taylor is on his seventh team in 13 years, so he’s played with different offenses and against all types of defenses. Between the two of them, they have played in 323 NFL games and more than 14,000 snaps.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTravis plans to be a sponge around them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I observe a lot,” he said. “I watch every little thing that they do. I’m going to ask a lot of questions for sure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You have two great quarterbacks ahead of you. I’ve been looking up to them for a long time and watching them for a long time. So I have an opportunity to pick their brains every single day, see how they treat their teammates, see how they carry themselves off and on field. I’m looking forward to it for sure.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s possible that Travis would be competing for a starting job or at least a backup position on another team had the injury not happened. Instead of being bitter, Travis is focused on getting better.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a dream come true at the end of the day,” Travis said. “It’s an opportunity for me to get better. That’s how I look at every single thing that God has a plan for me. Every day I wake up, I just want to be the best person I could be, the best teammate I could be. I just want to be the best I can be in everything I do.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003eThere’s Mr. Irrelevant\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSafety Jaylen Key, who the Jets took with the last pick in the draft, is having a good time with being known as “Mr. Irrelevant.” Key said, “Everybody’s [saying], ‘Hey, Mr. Irrelevant’ while you’re walking around the facility.” In late June, Key will go to California for Irrelevant Week, an annual NFL celebration that includes a parade in Disneyland.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It’s definitely kind of cool for you to be recognized for a week,” Key said. “Go to Disney, play some golf, get on the beach, things of that nature.

The Rangers won a league-high 55 games in the regular season and finished first overall, with 114 points.

Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who has filled in for Pesce, got banged up in the Hurricanes’ series against the Islanders, but Brind’Amour said he is good to go.

The Rangers have home ice advantage in this series, and so they’ll get the last line change in four of the seven\u0026nbsp;games if the series goes that long. Rangers coach Peter Laviolette likes to use a checking line at times, too, but he’s got four defensively capable centers in Zibanejad, Trocheck, Alex Wennberg and Barclay Goodrow, so he can more easily match any of his lines against any of Brind’Amour’s lines.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNet positive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith Igor Shesterkin as their goaltender, the Rangers are usually going to have the advantage in net against almost any opponent they face, but Frederik Andersen was fabulous down the stretch for Carolina as they chased the Rangers in the battle for the Metropolitan Division title.

ESPN said it also was the most-streamed MLB event in its history, with 73.6 million minutes consumed digitally. The game averaged 19.8% of homes in the Boston market and 11.2% in the New York area.","reviewStars":null,"displayType":null,"seoTitle":null,"seoDescription":"","noIndex":false,"byline":"Neil Best","organization":"neil.best@newsday.com","premiumType":"0","fullImageTop":false,"dropCap":false,"desktopAdzone":null,"mobileAdzone":null,"videoAdzone":null,"mobileVideoAdzone":null,"chapterNav":"","sportsLink":"","updateTag":"","customCSS":"","customJS":"","newsletterOverride":null,"teaserImage":null,"footer":null,"publishingInfo":null,"enableTrinity":false,"embeds":[],"parent":{"title":"Media","__typename":"Section"},"tags":[{"name":"New York Yankees","url":"/tag/New York Yankees","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"Boston Red Sox","url":"/tag/Boston Red Sox","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"MLB","url":"/tag/MLB","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"American League","url":"/tag/American League","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"Media","url":"/tag/Media","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"AL East","url":"/tag/AL East","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"ESPN","url":"/tag/ESPN","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"Sports","url":"/tag/Sports","__typename":"Tag"}],"location":[],"source":[{"name":"Newsday","__typename":"Source"}],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/image.1.50382989","width":0,"height":0,"title":"1345043951","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:YTQ4NzgwZWMtODFmYS00:ZWNkYmUx/1345043951.jpg","caption":"Aaron Judge #99 of the New York Yankees is tagged out by Kevin Plawecki #25 of the Boston Red Sox during the sixth inning of the American League Wild Card game at Fenway Park on October 05, 2021.","altTag":null,"byline":"Getty Images/Maddie Meyer","organization":null,"floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"imageSize":null,"useFreeform":false},"topMediaItem":null,"verticalMedia":null,"relatedMedia":[],"relatedStories":[],"trendingLinks":[],"hideTrendingBar":false},"__typename":"Page"},"lastUpdate":{"articles":[{"publishedDate":"2024-05-04T21:25:31.464Z","__typename":"Article"}],"__typename":"SearchResult"}},"errorCode":false,"release":"newsday-prod-20240502130056","amp":false,"preview":false,"app":false,"beta":false},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/[...pages]","query":{"pages":["sports","media","yankees-red-sox-al-wild-card-ratings-h24740"]},"buildId":"newsday-prod-20240502130056","runtimeConfig":{"aceConfig":{"PACE_GATEWAY_URL":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/ace-pace-gateway/graphql","RSS_FEED_LOCATION":"https://sitemap.newsday.atexcloud.io/rss","DEVELOPMENT_MODE":false}},"isFallback":false,"isExperimentalCompile":false,"gssp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html> contentType 9 text/html url 84 https://www.newsday.com:443/sports/media/yankees-red-sox-al-wild-card-ratings-h24740 responseCode 3 200

Manzetti probably did not         know of the Reis telephone, though the latter was reported         in the press since 1861. Both telephones, however, were only         suitable for transmitting single tones as well as some tunes         but could not satisfactorily transmit the consonants -- and         barely, the vowels -- of the human speech. On the contrary,         Meucci's system, as finalized in 1870, could perfectly         transmit speech and featured some fundamental techniques for         long distance communication.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Manzetti telephone was         publicized in generic terms on several newspapers in 1865.         Antonio Meucci read the notice and wrote a letter to the         editors of two newspapers, claiming his priority and quoting         his first experiment in Havana of 1849. Nevertheless, being         a true gentleman and an Italian patriot, he wrote "<I>I do         not pretend to deny to Sig. Manzetti his invention, but I         only wish to make it evident that two thoughts can be found         to contain the same discovery, and that by uniting the two         ideas one can more easily reach a certainty about a thing so         important</I>."</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF">The article reported         below deals more extensively with Innocenzo Manzetti's life         and work and is extracted from vol. 1 of Basilio Catania's         book "Antonio Meucci - L'inventore e il suo tempo,"         published in 1994 by Seat, Rome, and translated in         English.</FONT></P>                  <P></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </B></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>INNOCENZO MANZETTI</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">from: B.

He became interested in acoustics,         mechanics, hydraulics, electricity and astronomy. It is said         that he only slept an average of two hours a day, working         and experimenting all the rest of the time.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">His first work, which brought him much         fame, was a flute-playing automaton, built in 1849. It was         in the stylized shape of a man, life-size, seated on a chair         with a flute in hand. Hidden inside the chair were levers,         connecting beams and compressed-air tubes, which made the         automaton's fingers move on the flute keys, as well as its         lips, according to a program mechanically recorded on a         cylinder, similar to those used in player pianos. The         automaton was wound like a clock, and could perform twelve         different arias. At the beginning of its performance, the         automaton would rise from the chair, bow its head and roll         its eyes.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In his workshop, Innocenzo Manzetti         constructed geodetic instruments that he needed for his work         as a land surveyor and also musical and scientific         instruments for third parties.</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> <FONT FACE="Arial">He also built a bicycle and a piano. He amusedhimself by inlaying precious miniatures in ivory or bone, often usinga special pantograph conceived by him for the reproduction ofbasreliefs on marble, ivory or wood, scaled at pleasure.Subsequently, Manzetti succeeded in making his joueur de fl&ucirc;teplay any piece executed by a musician on an organ, by making thelatter's keys mute and connecting them to the automaton's fingercontrols. He also built, as a toy for his daughter, a wooden flyingparrot (perroquet en bois volant) also mechanically wound, whichbegan by beating its wings, then slowly rose into the air and hoveredfor two or three minutes, then went to settle on a shelf.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><TABLE BORDER=0>   <TR>      <TD HEIGHT=346>         <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1855 Manzetti invented an ingenious         hydraulic machine to empty water from the wells of the         Ollomont mines, which were otherwise unserviceable. His         construction is minutely described by his clergyman friend         Edouard B&eacute;rard in La feuille d'Aoste in 1862. In         1864, just after marrying Miss Rosa Sofia Anzola, he built a         steam-powered car, 27 years ahead of the one realized in         Paris by Serpollet, and an earth telescope with three         converging lenses that allowed to observe a lizard's         movements at a distance of 7 km. He also built a pendulum         watch which could be wound to work for one year.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Tancredi Tibaldi, a personal friend of         Innocenzo Manzetti, recounted, in 1896, that the telephone         idea came to Manzetti out of the desire to make his         automaton talk just as he made him play. That is,         analogously to the execution of a piece played by another         person, he wanted the automaton to pronounce words spoken         from a distance by another person. Innocenzo's brother,         Anania, recounted that the inspiration came from the memory         of their childhood games with the chapeau &agrave; gibus (a         sprung top hat that could be flattened for carrying under         one's arm) that they used as a loudspeaker to scare their         peers by speaking from another room into another hat,         connected to the first with the usual system of the taut         string.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Manzetti called his first telephone         model, made in 1864, t&eacute;l&eacute;graphe parlant         (speaking telegraph). It was never patented nor presented at         conferences or described in the newspapers by Manzetti         himself, because he was timid and retiring and, moreover,         did not care about money. All the same it was spoken of,         though in generic terms and with a nearly identical text, in         the following papers, probably informed by Manzetti's         friends or after reading the first news in the Aosta's paper         <I>L'Ind&eacute;pendant</I> of 29 June 1865: <I>Il Diritto         of Turin</I> on 10 July 1865; <I>La Feuille d'Aoste </I>on         25 July 1865; <I>L'Italia</I> of Florence on 10 August 1865;         <I>L'Eco d'Italia</I> of New York on 19 August 1865; <I>Il         Commercio di Genova of Genoa</I> on 1 December 1865; the         <I>Petit Journal </I>of Paris on 22 November 1865; <I>La         Verit&agrave; </I>of Novara on 4 January 1866; and again         <I>Il Commercio di Genova</I> on 6 January 1866.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here is the English translation of the         text published by the <I>Petit Journal</I> of Paris, written         by the lawyer &Eacute;mile Qu&eacute;tand of the Paris'         Imperial Court:</FONT></P>      </TD>      <TD ALIGN=center WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=346>         <P><IMG SRC="immagini/fluteplayer.gif" ALT="The flute player automaton of Innocenzo Manzetti" WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=323 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=middle></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">The "Flute player"         automaton</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></P><CENTER>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF"><B>CURIOSITIES OFSCIENCE<BR></B>Discovery of the transmission of sound and speech bytelegraph</FONT></CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF"><I>&#171;Anew discovery immensely fruitful in its possible applications both inthe fine arts as well as the industries is going to augment themarvels of this century; and this is the transmission of the soundsand of the spoken words by telegraph.</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF"><I>The author of this discoveryis Mr. Manzetti of Aosta, inventor of a famous automaton &#133;&#133; Manzetti transmits directly the word by means of the ordinarytelegraphic wire, with an apparatus simpler than the one which is nowused for dispatches.</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF"><I>Now, two merchants will beable to discuss their business instantly from London to Calcutta,announce each other speculations, propose them, conclude them.

Besides, Meucci's expressions toward Manzetti were verycordial, admitting that "two thoughts can be found to contain thesame discovery," as we have reported in the foregoing.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The only technical description of Manzetti'sinvention came from the pen of Dr. Pierre Dupont, a friend of theinventor's, who was a medical doctor and a Major in the Sardinianarmy. His description, however, was only found after his death, amonghis papers, without date on it, although Caniggia and Poggianti (seebibl.) maintain that it was written in 1861. J. Brocherel (see bibl.)maintained that the same description appeared in "an Aosta newspaperof the period," not better specified. We include Dupont's descriptionhere, translated from French:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF"><I>"The speaking telegraphconsisted of a funnel-shaped cornet in which was placed,transversally, an iron lamina, in the shape of a very thin plate.This plate easily vibrated under the impulsion of the sound wavescoming from the bottom of the funnel. In the cornet, there was also amagnetized steel needle, running inside a bobbin, vertically placedwith respect to the vibrating lamina and very close to thesame.</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF"><I>From the bobbin or spindlestarted a silk-coated copper wire, the other end of which wasconnected to a bobbin placed in an apparatus identical to thatdescribed above. From this second apparatus started another electricwire, which was connected to join the former.

In         fact, in both cases we have a needle, as a magnetic core,         against which an iron plate vibrates. And, due to the known         limitations of the make-and-break systems, the instrument         showed defects in the transmission of articulated words,         that Manzetti was not yet able to eliminate, as was written         in <I>L'Eco d'Italia</I>. Another confirmation of this         hypothesis, comes from the clergyman B&eacute;rard who         declared that words containing the letters c, f, g, j, l, u,         v, x, and z could not be transmitted and that, consequently,         it was impossible to hold a complete         conversation.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Another posthumous description of         Manzetti's telephone came from a short notice in <I>Il         Progresso Italo-Americano</I> of New York on 12 January         1937, by a certain Italia T. Gronbony. She affirmed that a         model of Manzetti's telephone was on display in the cabinet         of Physical Sciences of the "Accademia C. D. Andreis," and         that "it is composed of a permanent steel magnet shaped in a         narrow V, about 15 centimeters long, enclosed in a wooden         sheath." From this notice, we can only learn that one of the         models contained, as a core, a permanent steel magnet shaped         in a narrow V about 15 centimeters long, instead of a         magnetized steel needle (perhaps also 15 centimeters long),         not a big difference.</FONT></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Count Th&eacute;odose Du Moncel (see bibl.),who studied Manzetti's discovery fairly thoroughly, concluded, alongour own hypothesis, that Manzetti's telephone was similar to Reis's.Finally, the Royal Commission instituted in Italy in 1910 with thetask, among others, of verifying priority on the invention of thetelephone, thus expressed itself regarding Manzetti (see bibl.):"Innocenzo Manzetti of Aosta had invented something similar &#91;to atelephone&#93; except that no trace of the principle on which it wasbased has remained."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">After 1865, the press no longer wrote ofManzetti's<I> t&eacute;l&eacute;graph parlant,</I> nor of a practicalapplication for it, which leaves us to suppose that it was abandoned.Only on 30 January 1878, the <I>Fanfulla</I> of Rome reminded itsreaders - a year after the death of the Aostan inventor - that notall credit was owed to the most acclaimed Alexander GrahamBell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Manzetti died poor and unrecognized in Aosta on17 March 1877 on the exact day of his fifty-first birthday, one yearafter the death of his second and last daughter, Marina Fortunata,who strikingly resembled him and whose loss had caused him enormouspain. The first daughter, Maria Sofia, had died in 1867, at the ageof two. The obituary that appeared in the <I>Echo du Val d'Aoste</I>on 19 March 1877, thus described Manzetti's character: "&#133; Hisexcellent qualities of heart and character, his kindness, hisincomparable affability made him be loved by all &#133;" Tibaldi (seebibl.) describes him as "&#133; of medium height. He had a blondbeard and hair the latter worn long and flowing on his nape, like aNazarene, a pale complexion, light blue eyes, a nose rather large atthe base, slightly angular lineaments &#133;"</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="immagini/manzetti_home.jpg" ALT="Innocenzo Manzetti's house and memorial plaque" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="59%" ALIGN=bottom></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Innocenzo Manzetti's home andthe commemorative plaque, placed there in 1886</FONT></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial">On the fa&ccedil;ade of the little house on ViaXavier de Maistre in Aosta, which Manzetti inhabited in the lastthree years of his life, the Association of Mechanical Industry andRelated Arts of Turin placed a plaque in 1886, with the followinginscription:</FONT></P><CENTER>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial"><B>TO<BR></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B>I</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>NNOCENZO</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B>M</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>ANZETTI<BR><I>Executor in 1864<BR>of the first telephone apparatus</I></B></FONT></CENTER><P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">Nearly three years after Manzetti'sdeath, precisely on 7 February 1880, two Americans from New York,Prof. Max Meyer, an American citizen residing in Paris and Sir HoraceH. Eldred, a New York Telegraph inspector, accompanied by the alreadycited clergyman of the Aosta Cathedral, &Eacute;douard B&eacute;rard,went to visit Manzetti's widow, Mrs. Rose Anzola, and Manzetti'sbrother, Louis, with the aim of purchasing the rights, as well as thedocuments and models of Manzetti's t&eacute;l&eacute;graph parlant.On the same day a deed was signed, at the offices of the notarypublic C&eacute;sar Grognon, by which the two Americans committed topay ten thousand Italian lire of the time (slightly over 40 millionlire, or 30,000 dollars, in 1990) to the widow, "as soon as it wasestablished that Innocenzo Manzetti was the first inventor of thetelephone." An analogous document was signed with the brother, LouisManzetti, for the sum of five thousand lire. After signing the deed,the two Americans obtained drawings and models from the widow and thebrother, for the sum of thirty French francs of the time (around 1million lire, or $830, of 1990).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The clergyman B&eacute;rard was accused byProf. M. P. Fornari of the University of Milan of having made a dealwith the two Americans, supposed to be emissaries of the AmericanBell Telephone Company, in disfavor of Manzetti's widow. His accusesappeared in two articles on L'Educatore Italiano of Milan on 13 and20 December 1883, which were later translated into French andpublished in three parts (18 and 25 January and l February 1884) bythe Aosta Valley's paper Le Patriote. B&eacute;rard defended himselfwith long arguments - published in three more issues of Le Patriote(15 and 18 January and 14 March 1884) - essentially taking GrahamBell's side and diminishing the importance of Manzetti'st&eacute;l&eacute;graph parlant. Moreover, he had Manzetti's widowrelease a statement in which she affirmed, among other things(translation from French): "&#133; The matter of the telephone of myhusband, I. Manzetti, consisted of a sort of sleeve, slightlytapered, with two ends made of pasteboard and a parchment kept at oneextremity by means of a little ring, fairly solid. This parchment wasperforated and contained inside some thing of which I have no clearrecollection &#133;" Thus, Manzetti's widow did not mention any ironplate, nor the magnetized needle with bobbin, though the shape of theinstrument seems to comply fairly well with that of the drawing shownabove.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">In another letter written by Baron B. C. Bichof Aosta to the clergyman B&eacute;rard, dated 28 December 1883, itwas specified that the few remains of Manzetti's telephone,consisting of "a little pasteboard cornet with a little iron plate"had not been entrusted to the Americans but to the Rev. Father Denza,Physics professor at the Moncalieri boarding school, who intended topay honor to Innocenzo Manzetti. The clergyman B&eacute;rard had theabove letter published and further declared that the two Americanswere by no means emissaries of the Bell Company and that, on thecontrary, they intended to use the evidence gathered in Europe tohave the Bell patents annulled. Nevertheless, subsequent searches forthe two Americans, made by order of Manzetti's brother, Louis, bothin New York and in Paris (where Prof. Meyer had said he resided),yielded no results; the two seemed to have vanished, thus leaving ashadow of doubt on the assertions of clergymanB&eacute;rard.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B>Bibliography</B></FONT></P><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">(Editorial), <I>Ancora su Meucci</I>   &#91;letter from Italia T.

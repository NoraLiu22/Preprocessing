<h3>Introduction: Shields as an Illustrator</h3>

<p class = "one">Though primarily a painter, Frederick Shields (1833–1911) produced a small but distinctive body of illustrations. He contributed several engravings to <a href="../../../periodicals/onceaweek.html"><span class = "book">Once a Week</span></a> (1861–67) and single designs to <a href="../../../periodicals/goodwords/index.html"><span class = "book">Good Words</span></a> (1868) and <a href="../../../periodicals/sunday/cooke.html"><span class = "book">The Sunday Magazine</span></a> (1865). However, his best work appeared in just two outstanding books. The first, published in 1863, was a version of Daniel Defoe’s <span class = "book">History of the Plague of London, </span> and he followed this up with an elaborate treatment of <span class = "book">Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress</span> (1864). Both series are complex and interesting, the paradoxical and sometimes confusing combination of an intense originality and a willingness to respond to visual exemplars that are drawn from elsewhere. By turns strikingly unusual and eclectic, Shields is a challenging artist. </p>

<p>Shields was primarily an illustrator of prose rather than poetry (Goldman, p.59), and his work for Defoe and Bunyan displays a strong understanding of story-telling and the need to propel the narrative forward. This emphasis is embodied in his selection of scenes, which are generally climactic or transitional moments – one variety representing epiphanies of insight and understanding, and the other passages of action and change, leading from one situation to the next. The effect is generally breathless, hurrying the reader/viewer onward. </p>

Right:   <span class="tcartwork">Christian cast down by Apollyon</span> from John Bunyan's <span class ="tcartwork">Pilgrim's Progress</span>.  [Click on images to enlarge them.]</p>


<p>In <span class = "book">The Pilgrim’s Progress, </span> Shields converts the drama into a cinematic montage of dynamic tableaux: for example, we see Faithful turning away from the House of Wanton, Mercy fainting, and Pilgrim looking vertiginously down from the Hill of Caution. Arrivals and departures are similarly privileged in the illustrations for the <span class = "book">Plague;</span > there are few scenes of true repose and the action is always focused on melodramatic moments of excess such as the ‘Imprisoned family escaping’ (facing p.48), and the depositing of bodies into the horrific ‘Dead Pit’ (facing p.64). </p>

<p>In these and other designs Shields articulates an interest not just in story-telling, as such, but in creating <em>impact</em> as an end in itself. Though he claims to have been inspired by <a href="../dgr/index.html">Dante Rossetti</a>’s illustrations in the famous <a href="../moxon.html">Moxon</a> edition (1857) of Tennyson’s poems (Goldman, p.59), his images do not have the psychological depth associated with Pre-Raphaelitism. What they do possess in both publications is a capacity to unsettle: visceral and brooding, they are often, to use Forrest Reid’s adjective, ‘grim’ (p.208). </p>

<h3>Influences: Germany</h3>

<p class = "one">Some of Shields’s illustrations are informed by a genuine inventiveness: as Reid remarks, the two books display ‘considerable power of imagination’ (p.208). But the illustrator was heavily influenced by Germanic design, borrowing and re-figuring ideas and devices from a variety of sources. </p>

<p>His treatment of the <span class = "book">Pilgrim’s Progress</span> is clearly modelled on the outline books of <a href="../german/cooke.html#retzsch">F.A.M. Retzsch</a>. He was also influenced by <a href="../german/cooke.html#rethel">Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld</a>’s <span class = "book">Bibel in Bildern,</span> the famous picture Bible published in Britain, 1856–60. Schnorr’s dramatic telling of the Old and New Testament had a significant impact on <a href = "../../../painting/fmb/index.html">Ford Madox Brown</a>, <a href="../sandys/index.html">Frederick Sandys</a> and others who contributed to the <a href="../dalziel/index.html">Dalziels</a>’ <span class = "book">Bible Gallery</span>  (1880/81), and analogies can also be traced between the German’s style and the work of Shields in the <span class = "book">Pilgrim’s Progress.</span> This is especially apparent in the dense modelling of costumes and the emphasis on dynamic movement. </p>

<p>The <span class = "book">History of the Plague of London</span> is likewise responsive to a Germanic influence, although the model here is probably the morbid art of Alfred Rethel. Goldman identifies Rethel as a primary source and finds analogies between the grim directness of <span class = "book">Auch ein Totentanz</span> (1849) and the nightmarish imagery of ‘The Dead Pit’. It is also interesting to compare Shields’s version of the Pit with <a href="../franklin/index.html">John Franklin</a>’s design for <a href="../../../authors/ainsworth/index.html">W. H. Ainsworth</a>’s <span class = "book">Old Saint Paul’s</span> (1841; 1847 edition). This earlier treatment provides an example of how to show the grisly cascade of bodies and there is a clear connection, I suggest, between Franklin’s deployment of chiaroscuro and movement and the approach adopted by Shields. Shields might in this case have been influenced by two Germanizing tendencies – one derived directly from Rethel, and one from Franklin, who would also have seen Rethel’s <span class = "book">Dance of Death,</span> and was well-known as a ‘Germanic artist’. </p>

<p>A final strand, and another which takes the form of a Germanic influence mediated through a British artist, is the influence of Frederick Sandys. There are obvious analogies between the morbidity of ‘Until her Death’ (<span class = "book">Good Words,</span>   1862) and the dark and brooding atmosphere of the Shields designs for the <span class = "book">Plague;</span> Shields further replicates the quaint details – keys in locks, objects hung up, sandglasses and sundry other things – that appear in ‘Rosmund’ (<span class = "book">Once a Week,</span>  30 November 1861), ‘The Waiting Time’ (<a href="../../../periodicals/churchmans/cooke.html"><span class = "book">Churchman’s Family Magazine,</span></a> July 1863), and elsewhere. </p>

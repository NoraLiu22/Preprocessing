<a id="Wren"></a>Hampton Court Palace is on the SW borders of London. <strong>Christopher Wren</strong> designed the present east and south wings, and the Fountain Court.
<br/>
In the Clock Court is a superb astronomical clock of <span class="non-italic">1540</span>, possibly designed by <strong>Nicholas Kratzer</strong>, 'deviser of the King's horologies', and now running with an <span class="non-italic">1879</span> works.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Kratzer had been tutor to Thomas More's family and astronomer to Henry VIII.
<br/>

<br/>
The famous maze was planted c.<span class="non-italic">1690</span> by George London and Henry Wise and is the oldest extant hedge maze as well as one of the earliest non-unicursal designs. There are islands in the maze, but the 'hand on wall' rule solves it. In <span class="non-italic">1997</span>, it was reported that the replanting with English yew in the <span class="non-italic">1960</span>s was done with the plants too close together and so the trees did not produce lateral growth, leaving gaps which have had to be filled with railings or stakes. Possibly the whole maze will have to be replanted.

<a id="Kew" observatory=""></a><h3>Kew Observatory</h3>
The King's Observatory, or Kew Observatory, is in the Old Deer Park, Richmond. Built for George III by Sir William Chambers and finished in <span class="non-italic">1769</span> in time for the King to observe the transit of Venus on <span class="non-italic">3</span> June. The prime meridian ran through here before Greenwich.
<br/>
See <a href="https://www.kingsobservatory.co.uk" target="_blank"><span class="brown-text">THIS LINK</span></a>
<br/>

<br/>
Previously, Queen Caroline had a Hermitage built on the site in <span class="non-italic">1731</span>, decorated with busts of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Boyle/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Boyle/">Boyle</a> and <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Newton/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Newton/">Newton</a> by Rysbrack; these are now at Kensington Palace.
<br/>

<br/>
In the Old Deer Park are three obelisks, to the east, west and north, used as meridian marks for adjusting the instruments.

<br/>
The King's Astronomer at Kew was, from <span class="non-italic">1768</span> to <span class="non-italic">1782</span>, George III's former mathematics tutor <strong>Stephen C. T. Demainbray</strong> <span class="non-italic">(1710</span>-<span class="non-italic">1782)</span>. He was followed, from <span class="non-italic">1782</span> to <span class="non-italic">1840</span>, by his son <strong>Stephen G. F. T. Demainbray</strong> <span class="non-italic">(1759</span>-<span class="non-italic">1854)</span>, assisted by his brother-in-law <strong>Stephen Rigaud</strong>, who died in <span class="non-italic">1814</span>. <strong>Stephen Peter Rigaud</strong> <span class="non-italic">(1774</span>-<span class="non-italic">1839)</span>, the son of Stephen Rigaud and Mary Demainbray, was Savilian professor of geometry, then astronomy, at Oxford; he succeeded his father as Observer in <span class="non-italic">1814</span> until his death in <span class="non-italic">1839</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
Demainbray brought his collection of instruments to Kew and they were incorporated with the royal collection of instruments bought by George III in <span class="non-italic">1760</span>-<span class="non-italic">1762</span> from George Adams, as well as instruments of previous kings. These were later given to King's College, London, and then to the Science Museum in <span class="non-italic">1927</span> where they have recently been put on display.
<br/>

<br/>
In <span class="non-italic">1772</span>, the horologist <strong>John Harrison</strong> asked George III to have his H<span class="non-italic">5</span> tested at Kew. It did not perform well, but the King remembered he had stored lodestones nearby! When these were removed, H<span class="non-italic">5</span> was accurate to <span class="math"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathsize="1.2em"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mstyle mathsize="1em"></mstyle></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\large\frac{1}{3}\normalsize</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.402352em;vertical-align:-0.414em;"></span><span class="mord sizing reset-size6 size7"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter sizing reset-size7 size6"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8236266666666667em;"><span style="top:-2.6550000000000002em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size7 size4 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">3</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:0.04em;"></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size7 size4 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.345em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter sizing reset-size7 size6"></span></span></span></span></span></span> sec/day over a ten week period.

<br/>
It ceased as an astronomical observatory in <span class="non-italic">1841</span>, but continued as a magnetic and meteorological observatory until the early <span class="non-italic">1980</span>s. <strong>Francis Ronalds</strong> was Director in <span class="non-italic">1843</span>-<span class="non-italic">1852</span>. In <span class="non-italic">1858</span>, <strong>Warren De La Rue</strong> set up his photoheliograph here and began the first daily recording of sunspots. It has now been renamed King's Observatory and Museum, and converted into the head office of Autoglass Holdings Ltd: to visit it one must make advance arrangements <span class="non-italic">(</span>telephone Mr Douglas Roberts, <span class="non-italic">020</span>-<span class="non-italic">8907</span>-<span class="non-italic">4193)</span>.

<a id="Royal_Observatory"></a><h3>Royal Observatory, Greenwich</h3>
<a id="Flamsteed"></a>The <span class="non-italic">(</span>old<span class="non-italic">)</span> Royal Observatory is located on the hill in Greenwich Park <span class="non-italic">(</span>Greenwich, SE<span class="non-italic">10</span>; tel: <span class="non-italic">020</span>-<span class="non-italic">8858</span> <span class="non-italic">4422)</span> overlooking the National Maritime Museum, of which it is now a part. It is of especial interest to those of an astronomical or navigational inclination. It was founded on <span class="non-italic">22</span> Jun <span class="non-italic">1675</span> by Charles II who commanded <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a> to apply 
<blockquote>the most exact Care and Diligence to rectifying the Tables of the Motions of the Heavens, and the Places of the fixed Stars, so as to find out the so-much desired Longitude at Sea, for perfecting the art of Navigation.</blockquote>
<a id="Moore_Jonas"></a><a id="Hooke"></a><a id="Halley"></a>Charles's interest had been aroused a year earlier when the Sieur de St Pierre, a French friend of his mistress, claimed to have a method for finding longitude. This was essentially the method of lunar distances, first proposed by <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Werner/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Werner/">Johannes Werner</a> in <span class="non-italic">1514</span>. A royal commission, including <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Wren/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Wren/">Wren</a> and <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Hooke/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Hooke/">Hooke</a>, had already been set up to consider using the dip of a magnetic needle to determine longitude and Charles asked them to study St Pierre's proposal. The commission asked <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a> to report on it and he showed the method was theoretically sound, but was impractical as the positions of the moon and the stars were not known with sufficient accuracy. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Moore_Jonas/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Moore_Jonas/">Jonas Moore</a>, governor of the Tower, Surveyor General of the Ordnance, instigated the foundation of an observatory and actually donated the necessary instruments to <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a>. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a>'s salary was so low <span class="non-italic">(</span>£<span class="non-italic">100</span> per year, to cover costs of instruments and assistants<span class="non-italic">)</span> that he had to take in pupils and to serve as deputy for <strong>Walter Pope</strong>, Gresham Professor of Astronomy, from <span class="non-italic">1681</span>, and to be rector of St Bartholomew's, Burstow, Surrey, in <span class="non-italic">1684</span>-<span class="non-italic">1719</span>. <span class="non-italic">(</span>Burstow is close to Gatwick Airport, at the border with West Sussex, some <span class="non-italic">23</span> miles from Greenwich<span class="non-italic">)</span>. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a>'s widow removed the instruments, leaving <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Halley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Halley/">Halley</a> with none.
<br/>

<br/>
The Astronomers Royal lived in Flamsteed House from <span class="non-italic">1676</span> to <span class="non-italic">1948</span>; this was designed by <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Wren/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Wren/">Wren</a> for, as he put it, "the Observator's habitation and a little for pompe". <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Hooke/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Hooke/">Hooke</a> directed the construction. The foundation stone was laid on <span class="non-italic">10</span> Aug <span class="non-italic">1675</span> and the first observations from it were made on <span class="non-italic">31</span> May <span class="non-italic">1676</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
Several Astronomers Royal are of interest to mathematicians and the others are of some historical importance even if not of mathematical interest, so I will list them <span class="non-italic">(</span>dates are of tenure of the post<span class="non-italic">)</span>.
<ol><br/>
<li 1=""><strong><a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">John Flamsteed</a></strong> <span class="non-italic">(1675</span>-<span class="non-italic">1719)</span>. He was the first astronomer to make regular use of telescopic sights. He also invented the conical projection for maps. His assistant, Joseph Crosthwait, prepared his observations for publication after his death.
<br/>
</li><li 2=""><strong><a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Halley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Halley/">Edmond Halley</a></strong> <span class="non-italic">(1720</span>-<span class="non-italic">1742)</span>, whose tombstone is in the courtyard. He continued as Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford while being Astronomer Royal.
<br/>
</li><li 3=""><strong><a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Bradley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Bradley/">James Bradley</a></strong> <span class="non-italic">(1742</span>-<span class="non-italic">1762)</span>, who announced the nutation of the Earth's axis in <span class="non-italic">1748</span>, using the zenith sector that he had used to discover the aberration of light in <span class="non-italic">1725</span>-<span class="non-italic">1729</span>. This instrument may still be at the observatory. He also continued as Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford. He resisted Harrison's chronometer as a solution to the longitude problem, preferring the astronomical method of lunar distances which he developed and he hoped for a share of the prize money.
<br/>
<a id="Bliss_Nathaniel"></a></li><li 4=""><strong><a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Bliss_Nathaniel/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Bliss_Nathaniel/">Nathaniel Bliss</a></strong> <span class="non-italic">(1762</span>-<span class="non-italic">1764)</span>, <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Halley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Halley/">Halley</a>'s successor as Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford. He favoured the method of lunar distances.
<br/>
<a id="Maskelyne"></a><a id="Bernoulli_Johann(III)"></a></li><li 5=""><strong><a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/">Nevil Maskelyne</a></strong> <span class="non-italic">(1765</span>-<span class="non-italic">1811)</span>. He also favoured the method of lunar distances and seems to have deliberately tried to sabotage Harrison's chronometers and the tests on them, hoping to win the Longitude Prize for himself. He founded the Nautical Almanac in <span class="non-italic">1766</span>. He determined the universal gravitational constant <em>G</em> in <span class="non-italic">1774</span>-<span class="non-italic">1776</span> <span class="non-italic">(</span>v. <a href="../Schiehallion/"><span class="green-text">Schiehallion</span></a><span class="non-italic">)</span>. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Bernoulli_Johann(III)/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Bernoulli_Johann(III)/">Jean <span class="non-italic">(</span>III<span class="non-italic">)</span> Bernoulli</a> <span class="non-italic">(1744</span>-<span class="non-italic">1807)</span> visited the Observatory in <span class="non-italic">1769</span>. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/">Maskelyne</a> installed the first transit telescope, on the present Prime Meridian. With this and new clocks, it was believed that observations could be made accurate to <span class="non-italic">0</span>.<span class="non-italic">1</span> sec. However <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/">Maskelyne</a> discovered that he and his assistant Kinnebrooke differed by an average of <span class="non-italic">0</span>.<span class="non-italic">8</span> sec and Kinnebrooke was sacked. Bessell later recognized the significance of the difference and developed it into the 'personal equation' of an observer, a phenomenon due to differing reaction times of observers.
<br/>
</li><li 6=""><strong>John Pond</strong> <span class="non-italic">(1811</span>-<span class="non-italic">1835)</span>, who was requested to resign.
<br/>
<a id="Airy"></a><a id="Adams"></a></li><li 7=""><strong><a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Airy/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Airy/">George Biddell Airy</a></strong> <span class="non-italic">(1835</span>-<span class="non-italic">1881)</span>. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Airy/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Airy/">Airy</a>'s study of oscillatory phenomena in the regulators of the Greenwich equatorial telescopes led to two papers in <span class="non-italic">1840</span> and <span class="non-italic">1850</span> which are considered the beginning of the theory of automatic control. But <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Airy/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Airy/">Airy</a> is mainly remembered as too busy to consider <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Adams/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Adams/">John Couch Adams</a>' predictions of Neptune in <span class="non-italic">1846</span>.
<br/>
On <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Airy/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Airy/">Airy</a>'s retirement in <span class="non-italic">1881</span>, <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Adams/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Adams/">J.

<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Charles Mason</strong> <span class="non-italic">(1730</span>-<span class="non-italic">1787)</span>, of the Mason-Dixon Line in the USA, was an assistant in the late <span class="non-italic">18</span>C.

<br/>

<br/>
<a id="Glaisher"></a><a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Glaisher/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Glaisher/">James Glaisher</a> was Superintendent of the Magnetic and Meteorological Department from about <span class="non-italic">1840</span>. He was a pioneering meteorologist and made numerous ascents in balloons to make observations, reaching <span class="non-italic">30</span>,<span class="non-italic">000</span> feet without oxygen in <span class="non-italic">1862</span>, a record that still stands.
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>E. Walter Maunder</strong> was Superintendent of the Physical Department, c.<span class="non-italic">1890</span>. He announced the eleven year cycle of sunspots in <span class="non-italic">1904</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Philip Cowell</strong> was Chief Assistant from <span class="non-italic">1896</span> to c.<span class="non-italic">1910</span>. In <span class="non-italic">1910</span>, Cowell and Crommelin used new numerical quadratures to predict the perihelion of Halley's comet, getting an answer off by only three days. They were able to extrapolate backward and identify all its appearances back to -<span class="non-italic">240</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
<a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Eddington/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Eddington/">A. S. Eddington</a> <span class="non-italic">(1882</span>-<span class="non-italic">1944)</span>, was Chief Assistant <span class="non-italic">(1906</span>-<span class="non-italic">1913)</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
In <span class="non-italic">1908</span>, <strong>Melotte</strong> discovered the <span class="non-italic">8</span>th moon of Jupiter.
<br/>

<br/>
The Observatory removed to <a href="../Herstmonceaux_Castle/"><span class="green-text">Herstmonceaux Castle, Sussex</span></a>, in <span class="non-italic">1948</span>-<span class="non-italic">1958</span>, due to smoke and light pollution obscuring the viewing, as well as air pollution attacking the instruments. Herstmonceux is a minute or so two off the Prime Meridian. The Greenwich buildings were turned over to the National Maritime Museum as the observatory moved out. Some departments had already had to move in the <span class="non-italic">1920</span>s, e.g. the magnetic observations.
<br/>

<br/>
When the Observatory moved, the London site became known as the <span class="non-italic">(</span>Old<span class="non-italic">)</span> Royal Greenwich Obsevatory and was part of the National Maritime Museum.
<br/>

<br/>
The Royal Greenwich Observatory left Herstmonceux Castle in <span class="non-italic">1990</span> and moved to Cambridge. When this happened the London site dropped the "Old" from its title.
<br/>

<br/>
The Royal Greenwich Observatory closed in <span class="non-italic">1998</span> and in <span class="non-italic">2012</span> the London site became part of the Royal Greenwich Museums.
<br/>

<br/>
The Prime Meridian crosses the Observatory courtyard. Outside is a <span class="non-italic">24</span> hour Shepherd slave clock installed by <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Airy/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Airy/">Airy</a> in <span class="non-italic">1852</span>, part of the system that provided time signals by telegraphy. Beneath it are standards of length, a reminder that the original standards were burnt in the Houses of Parliament in <span class="non-italic">1834</span> and had to be re-established. Note the fine views.

<br/>

<br/>
Entering the Observatory courtyard, you cross the Meridian, marked by a lighted strip. The Meridian is defined by the cobweb on the lens of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Airy/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Airy/">Airy</a>'s transit circle of <span class="non-italic">1850</span>, which is still in place and in working order, but not in use. The present Meridian was internationally adopted by a conference in Washington in <span class="non-italic">1884</span>. A report says that a laser beam now projects along it to Essex, but looking through a telescope provided, one sees that a recent building is obstructing the view to the Essex skyline!
<br/>

<br/>
There were earlier meridians through earlier instruments. From <span class="non-italic">1750</span> to <span class="non-italic">1850</span>, it was <span class="non-italic">19</span> feet west of the present one. There is an <span class="non-italic">1824</span> obelisk on Pole Hill, Epping Forest, Chingford, Essex, used for aligning the <span class="non-italic">1750</span> instrument, but in <span class="non-italic">1943</span> it had long been invisible. <span class="non-italic">(</span>A letter to The Times from Paul A. Moxey on <span class="non-italic">5</span> Nov <span class="non-italic">1982</span> confirms that the view is hidden 'by a dense growth of hawthorn and oak'.<span class="non-italic">)</span> I visited Pole Hill in <span class="non-italic">1995</span> and can confirm that the obelisk is difficult to find and there is hardly any view. From <span class="non-italic">1675</span> to c.<span class="non-italic">1720</span>, Flamsteed used a Meridian further to the west and from c.<span class="non-italic">1725</span> to <span class="non-italic">1750</span>, Halley used a Meridian a bit east of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a>'s. Plaques facing the courtyard show the positions of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Halley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Halley/">Halley</a>'s and <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a>'s Meridians.
<br/>

<br/>
The Meridian has been marked a few other places, e.g. in the underground passage at Hither Green railway station. It also passes through the Yacht pub, to the east of the Naval College, and through Greenwich Power Station. In the Lee Valley Regional Park, just north of Waltham Abbey, there is a walk which goes along the Meridian for over half a mile <span><span class="non-italic">[</span><a class="reference" data-popup='&lt;span class="markup"&gt;Limna, T. Letter; The Times &lt;span class="non-italic"&gt;(9&lt;/span&gt; Nov &lt;span class="non-italic"&gt;1982)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' href="#reference-1"><span class="non-italic">1</span></a><span class="non-italic">]</span></span>. On the pathways from the car park to Waltham Abbey are two indications, a mosaic and a <span class="non-italic">1995</span> 'Meridian Gateway' by Jon Mills. <span class="non-italic">(</span>v. also Brighton, Holbeach, Lewes, Louth.<span class="non-italic">)</span>.
<br/>
The ticket counter is in a lobby, where there is a bust of Halley and some instruments, including a <span class="non-italic">1580</span> astrolabe. At the far side of the courtyard, beyond Halley's tombstone, is a gateway leading to a small building with a camera obscura which gives a fine view of Greenwich. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a> built this room for this purpose. <span class="non-italic">(</span>A leaflet is available near the ticket counter.<span class="non-italic">)</span>
<br/>
Back in the courtyard, enter an annex to Flamsteed House. The first two rooms have material on Flamsteed, Greenwich and the longitude problem. There are a copy of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Moore_Jonas/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Moore_Jonas/">Moore</a>'s <em>Arithmetick</em> of <span class="non-italic">1650</span>, a bust of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a>, a map showing Anson's believed and real routes, Anson's log, a print of Wren and astrolabes from <span class="non-italic">1360</span> and c<span class="non-italic">1400</span>. From four small rooms, furnished as in <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Flamsteed/">Flamsteed</a>'s time, one ascends into the Octagon Room, the original observing room at the top of Flamsteed House. This is one of the few <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Wren/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Wren/">Wren</a> interiors extant, now restored to its original form. There are three replicas of the one-year clocks made by <strong>Thomas Tompion</strong> in <span class="non-italic">1676</span> which Flamsteed used to check the constancy of the day: the first clocks with Tompion's new escapement and the first clocks sufficiently accurate to check the accuracy of the rotation of the earth. One of the originals is in the British Museum. The other was recently located at Holkham Hall, Norfolk, and bought for the Observatory where it is now on display, though it had been much modified for use as a domestic clock. From the Octagon Room, one descends to an exhibition on time-keeping and longitude.
<br/>

<br/>
The background to this is the disaster when on the night of <span class="non-italic">22</span> Oct <span class="non-italic">1707</span>, Sir Cloudesley Shovell ran his <em>HMS Association</em> and three other ships aground on the Gilstone Ledges off the Scilly Isles, losing about <span class="non-italic">2000</span> lives, including his own. This is usually ascribed to his not knowing his longitude. In fact the consensus among his captains was that they were near Ushant at the south entrance to the English Channel, whereas they were approaching the Scillies, about <span class="non-italic">100</span> miles north-northwest of Ushant. Thus, the error was more one of latitude than of longitude. Nonetheless, this disaster led to Parliament passing the Longitude Act on <span class="non-italic">8</span> Jul <span class="non-italic">1714</span>, offering £<span class="non-italic">20</span>,<span class="non-italic">000</span> for a solution of the problem of finding longitude at sea to within half a degree <span class="non-italic">(</span>about <span class="non-italic">30</span> miles<span class="non-italic">)</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
<a id="Whiston"></a>At the beginning of this room is material about the longitude problem: a copy of the Longitude Act; numerous proposals of methods; a copy of the first version of William Hogarth's The Madhouse from his series <em>The Rake's Progress</em> which shows a lunatic in Bedlam drawing a scheme proposed by <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Whiston/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Whiston/">William Whiston</a> and <strong>Humphrey Ditton</strong> to determine longitude by firing bombs into the air; the first volumes of the <em>Nautical Almanac</em>; <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Huygens/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Huygens/">Huygens</a>' attempt to make a sea-going clock; etc.
<br/>

<br/>
The room opens into a larger section. Here are the most notable items of the entire Museum, the original marine chronometers of <strong>John Harrison</strong> <span class="non-italic">(1693</span>-<span class="non-italic">1776)</span>, which solved the problem of longitude. The central cases contain H<span class="non-italic">1</span> <span class="non-italic">(1735)</span>, H<span class="non-italic">2</span> <span class="non-italic">(1741)</span>, H<span class="non-italic">3</span> <span class="non-italic">(1757)</span> and H<span class="non-italic">4</span> <span class="non-italic">(</span>the first small chronometer of <span class="non-italic">1755</span>-<span class="non-italic">1759</span> which is the most important watch ever made<span class="non-italic">)</span>. H<span class="non-italic">4</span> lost only five seconds in an <span class="non-italic">81</span> day voyage to Jamaica in <span class="non-italic">1761</span>-<span class="non-italic">1762</span> and when William Harrison predicted landfall at Madeira within a day, Captain Digges was incredulous and bet it would not occur. When it did, Digges offered to buy a chronometer as soon as one became available and presented William and the absent John with an octant, now on display in this room. The return voyage was beset with bad weather, but the total error on both voyages, lasting about <span class="non-italic">140</span> days, was under two minutes and should have won the Longitude Prize. There are computer animations showing some of the key points of H<span class="non-italic">1</span> and H<span class="non-italic">3</span>. H<span class="non-italic">1</span> weighs about <span class="non-italic">75</span> lb and was originally housed in a glazed case <span class="non-italic">4</span> ft cube. H<span class="non-italic">2</span> weighs about <span class="non-italic">86</span> lb, but is smaller than H<span class="non-italic">1</span>. H<span class="non-italic">3</span> weighs about <span class="non-italic">60</span> lb. H<span class="non-italic">4</span> weighs only <span class="non-italic">3</span> lb and is <span class="non-italic">5</span> inches across. H<span class="non-italic">1</span>, H<span class="non-italic">2</span>, H<span class="non-italic">3</span> are running, because they have very little friction and use lignum vitae, so are self-lubricating <span class="non-italic">(</span>though H<span class="non-italic">3</span> needs a little lubrication<span class="non-italic">)</span>. These techniques could not be reduced to the size of H<span class="non-italic">4</span> which requires lubrication and very delicate overhauling every three years, so it has been stopped to prevent wear or damage.
<br/>

<br/>
To the sides are the only portrait of Harrison, holding the Jefferys watch because H<span class="non-italic">4</span> was being tested, and an engraving made from it but with H<span class="non-italic">4</span> replacing the Jefferys watch. There is a model showing how he made his wooden gears. There several of his drawings and a manuscript of <span class="non-italic">1775</span>. There are also the notebooks of one of the unsung heroes of the story: in <span class="non-italic">1920</span>, Lieutenant Commander <strong>Rupert T. Gould</strong> found all the Harrison chronometers in dreadful condition with some covered in corrosion and H<span class="non-italic">1</span> missing many parts. <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Maskelyne/">Maskelyne</a> had dropped H<span class="non-italic">1</span> and had put all of them in a damp cupboard! Gould spent twelve unpaid years restoring them to working order. There is also a facsimile of Harrison's large Royal Astronomical Society regulator, accurate to one second in a hundred days.
<br/>

<br/>
In the far case are various developments of H<span class="non-italic">4</span>: K<span class="non-italic">1</span> <span class="non-italic">(1770)</span>, the first replica of H<span class="non-italic">4</span> made by <strong>Larcum Kendall</strong>, costing £<span class="non-italic">450</span> and used by <strong>Captain Cook</strong> on his <span class="non-italic">2</span>nd and <span class="non-italic">3</span>rd voyages-it lost only <span class="non-italic">7</span> minutes and <span class="non-italic">45</span> seconds on the <span class="non-italic">2</span>nd voyage of <span class="non-italic">3</span> years; K<span class="non-italic">2</span> <span class="non-italic">(1772)</span>, the second replica, costing £<span class="non-italic">200</span>, used by <strong>Captain Bligh</strong> on the Bounty - it was taken to Pitcairn Island and bought by an American whaling captain in <span class="non-italic">1808</span>; K<span class="non-italic">3</span> <span class="non-italic">(1774)</span>, costing £<span class="non-italic">100</span> and used by Cook on his third voyage and by Vancouver; examples and materials of Earnshaw and Arnold who developed cheaper versions.
<br/>

<br/>
Down another staircase is an exhibit on Greenwich Time, etc. The big clock in the middle uses Grimthorpe's 'double three legged gravity escapement' which he devised for the clock in the Houses of Parliament. There is an early electric clock of <span class="non-italic">1845</span> by <strong>Alexander Bain</strong>, who patented the idea in <span class="non-italic">1840</span>. There is a facsimile of Congreve's rolling ball clock: the original is in the British Museum. The <span class="non-italic">1852</span> Shepherd Clock which electrically drove slave clocks and provided time signals by telegraphy is here. There is a <span class="non-italic">19</span>C railwayman's clock, which was set to GMT and sealed to prevent changes. A Japanese pillar clock has movable hour markers because they used 'temporal hours' obtained by dividing the day and the night into twelve equal parts, whose lengths vary with the seasons. And there is a digital hourglass <span class="non-italic">(</span>!!<span class="non-italic">)</span> of <span class="non-italic">1990</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
In the <span class="non-italic">20</span>C, Atomic clocks replaced astronomical observations as the basis of time-keeping. Coordinated Universal Time <span class="non-italic">(</span>UTC<span class="non-italic">)</span> is the average of <span class="non-italic">11(</span>?<span class="non-italic">)</span> atomic clocks, mostly using vibrations of caesium-<span class="non-italic">133</span> atoms. The earth runs a bit slow leading to the occasional introduction of 'leap-seconds' at the end of the year. Currently one or two occur per year. All observatories and radio stations, etc., now use UTC <span class="non-italic">(</span>since about <span class="non-italic">1980)</span>, but GMT is still the legal time!
<br/>

<br/>
<a id="Troughton"></a>We now pass through several old viewing rooms with many instruments on display - the collection of astrolabes is the second largest in the world. There is a five foot transit instrument made by <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Hooke/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Hooke/">Robert Hooke</a> and <strong>George Graham</strong> for <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Halley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Halley/">Halley</a> in <span class="non-italic">1721</span>, the first transit instrument in England. On the side is <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Bradley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Bradley/">Bradley</a>'s <span class="non-italic">12</span> ft zenith sector, built by Graham in <span class="non-italic">1727</span>, designed to observe the zenith of a Draconis and which established the nutation of the earth. There is also <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Halley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Halley/">Halley</a>'s <span class="non-italic">8</span> foot mural quadrant of <span class="non-italic">1725</span>. This defined the Prime Meridian until <span class="non-italic">1750</span> when <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Bradley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Bradley/">Bradley</a> had an <span class="non-italic">8</span> foot transit instrument built in the next room by <strong>John Bird</strong>. There is a portrait of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Halley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Halley/">Halley</a>. In the case to the side are many instruments including the first sextant, made by John Bird in about <span class="non-italic">1757</span>. The site of the <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Bradley/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Bradley/">Bradley</a> instrument defined the Prime Meridian until <span class="non-italic">1850</span>, though the instrument was replaced by a <span class="non-italic">10</span> foot instrument by <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Troughton/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Troughton/">Troughton</a> in <span class="non-italic">1816</span>. In <span class="non-italic">1850</span>, <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Airy/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Airy/">Airy</a> had a transit circle built which was accurate to <span class="math"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathsize="1.2em"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>100</mn></mfrac><mstyle mathsize="1em"></mstyle></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\large\frac{1}{100}\normalsize</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.402352em;vertical-align:-0.414em;"></span><span class="mord sizing reset-size6 size7"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter sizing reset-size7 size6"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8236266666666667em;"><span style="top:-2.6550000000000002em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size7 size4 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span><span class="mord mtight">0</span><span class="mord mtight">0</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:0.04em;"></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size7 size4 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.345em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter sizing reset-size7 size6"></span></span></span></span></span></span> seconds of arc.

<a id="Herschel_William"></a><a id="Herschel"></a>When you descend, walk through the garden to the Planetarium in the South Building. Beside it, under a plastic dome, are the remains of <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Herschel_William/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Herschel_William/">William Herschel</a>'s <span class="non-italic">40</span> foot telescope from his house at Slough.

<a id="Oughtred"></a><a id="Digges"></a>The Museum has a small display room in its storage area containing some of the many items not in the main displays. A serious student may be admitted upon application to a curator-ask at the ticket desk. This room currently includes the earliest<span class="non-italic">(</span>?<span class="non-italic">)</span> theodolite, signed by H. Cole and dated to <span class="non-italic">1574</span> <span class="non-italic">(</span>but I didn't see if the date is on the instrument<span class="non-italic">)</span> and surprisingly small, perhaps <span class="non-italic">5</span> inches high. It was invented by <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Digges/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Digges/">Leonard Digges</a> in the <span class="non-italic">1560</span>s and he presumably made examples then, but none are now known. There is another earliest<span class="non-italic">(</span>?<span class="non-italic">)</span> theodolite at Oxford, signed "Humphrey Cole, <span class="non-italic">1586</span>". The room also has a sundial of c<span class="non-italic">1635</span> engraved with <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Oughtred/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Oughtred/">William Oughtred</a>'s double horizontal quadrant of the <span class="non-italic">1620</span>s; <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Oughtred/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Oughtred/">Oughtred</a> was the inventor of the slide rule and this dial was probably made to his specification.

The Time Ball on the roof was first installed in <span class="non-italic">1833</span> and was the first public time-signal, dropping at <span class="non-italic">1</span>:<span class="non-italic">00</span> pm GMT. In <span class="non-italic">1852</span>, a new 'Shepherd's Master Clock System' and telegraphy were added to produce time signals at other places, e.g. on the Electric Telegraph Company in the Strand, London Bridge Station and then via the railways to time balls at other ports. <span class="non-italic">(</span>The <span class="non-italic">1852</span> clock was seen above.<span class="non-italic">)</span> Greenwich Mean Time was made the legal time in Britain in <span class="non-italic">1880</span> and was adopted as international standard in <span class="non-italic">1884</span>.

The Observatory began providing the BBC time signal on <span class="non-italic">5</span> Feb <span class="non-italic">1924</span>. The signal originally had five pips, but this was changed to six pips in the <span class="non-italic">1970</span>s.

<a id="National" maritime="" museum=""></a><h3>National Maritime Museum</h3>
The National Maritime Museum, at the foot of the hill, opened in <span class="non-italic">1937</span>. In <span class="non-italic">2012</span> it became part of the Royal Greenwich Museums. Behind the West Wing, notice the handsome Dolphin Sundial, designed by Christopher St J. H. Daniel for the Queen's Jubilee in <span class="non-italic">1977</span>. There is a statue of Cook between the West Wing and the Queen's House.
<br/>

<br/>
The central building is the Queen's House, designed by Inigo Jones in <span class="non-italic">1616</span>. It reopened a few years ago after several years in restoration. In the roadway by the entrance is a reproduction of the memorial to Cook erected by his friend Admiral Sir Hugh Palliser at his country house, the Vache, Chalfont St Giles, in <span class="non-italic">1781</span>. The Great Hall is also known as the Cube Room, being of that shape. The spiral staircase, called the Tulip Stairs, to the upper floors is very elegant and was the first cantilevered stairs built in Britain. <span class="non-italic">(</span>The statics of a cantilevered spiral staircase is intriguing.<span class="non-italic">)</span> Note the fine views from the gallery and the loggia. Since this was a royal palace, most of the rooms have been restored to their royal state and are filled with paintings of royal, maritime and Greenwich subjects, including a room on Wren and the design of the Royal Naval Hospital. At the end of the tour are two rooms presently devoted to Captain Cook and the <em>Endeavour</em>. These primarily display paintings made on the voyage and after the voyage by William Hodges, including a portrait of Cook, and botanic pictures by Sydney Parkinson, who died on the voyage. There are also plans of the Endeavour, a bust of Banks, Cook's charts of New Zealand, Tahiti, etc. and an engraving of the first drawing of a kangaroo.
<br/>

<br/>
In <span class="non-italic">1997</span>, most of the West Wing was closed for reconstruction and the part that was kept open is of no scientific interest. I append here my older list of items of interest, against the time when the West Wing reopens.
<br/>

<br/>
<em>Upper Level: Discovery And Exploration</em>
<br/>
<a id="Mercator_Gerardus"></a><a id="Gemma_Frisius"></a>Many navigational instruments, maps, globes, books, portraits, etc. in this room. There is an astrolabe, found at Valentia Island, Ireland, from a Spanish Armada ship. There is a <span class="non-italic">1537</span> celestial globe, designed by the noted mathematician <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Gemma_Frisius/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Gemma_Frisius/">Gemma Frisius</a> and engraved by his pupil, <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Mercator_Gerardus/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Mercator_Gerardus/">Gerhard Mercator</a>. There is a reproduction of the earliest known world globe, by <strong>Martin Behaim</strong> of Nuremberg, in <span class="non-italic">1491</span>.
<br/>

<br/>
There is a <span class="non-italic">1456</span> map of the Mediterranean and Europe and a <span class="non-italic">1535</span> map of the North Atlantic. Further on is an example of the earliest printed sea atlas. Portraits include Prince Henry the Navigator, Da Gama, Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, Sebastian Cabot, Magellan and <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Galileo/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Galileo/">Galileo</a>.
<br/>
<a id="Gunter"></a><span class="non-italic">(</span>I remember seeing some <a class="mlink" data-popup="../../Biographies/Gunter/popup/" href="../../Biographies/Gunter/">Gunter</a>'s scales on previous visits, but I didn't notice any this time.<span class="non-italic">)</span>

Enacted in reaction to the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/pearl-harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> attacks and the ensuing war, the incarceration of Japanese Americans is considered one of the most atrocious violations of American civil rights in the 20th century.</p></div></div><div class="article-content content"><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/413/863/BRAND_SF_THC_HOSF_200170_SUP_2398_20170510_01_0513883_HD.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">Japanese-American Relocation</div></div><button type="button" class="video-player-decoy__play" aria-label="Play Japanese-American Relocation"><span class="video-player-decoy__play-icon"></span></button></div></div><h2 id="executive-order-9066">Executive Order 9066</h2><p>On February 19, 1942, shortly after the bombing of <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/pearl-harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> by Japanese forces, President Roosevelt <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/executive-order">signed Executive Order 9066</a> with the stated intention of preventing espionage on American shores.</p><p>Military zones were created in California, Washington and Oregon—states with a large population of Japanese Americans.

In a panic, some politicians called for their mass incarceration.

General John L. DeWitt, leader of the Western Defense Command, believed that the civilian population needed to be taken control of to prevent a repeat of Pearl Harbor.</p><p>To argue his case, DeWitt prepared a report filled with known falsehoods, such as examples of sabotage that were later revealed to be the result of cattle damaging power lines.</p><p>DeWitt suggested the creation of the military zones and Japanese detainment to Secretary of War Henry Stimson and Attorney General Francis Biddle. His original plan included Italians and Germans, though the idea of rounding-up Americans of European descent was not as popular.</p><p>At Congressional hearings in February 1942, a majority of the testimonies, including those from California Governor Culbert L. Olson and State Attorney General <a href="/topics/earl-warren">Earl Warren</a>, declared that all Japanese should be removed.</p><p>Biddle pleaded with the president that mass incarceration of citizens was not required, preferring smaller, more targeted security measures. Regardless, Roosevelt signed the order.</p><h2 id="war-relocation-authority">War Relocation Authority</h2><p>After much organizational chaos, about 15,000 Japanese Americans willingly moved out of prohibited areas. Inland state citizens were not keen for new Japanese American residents, and they were met with racist resistance.</p><p>Ten state governors voiced opposition, fearing the Japanese Americans might never leave, and demanded they be locked up if the states were forced to accept them.</p><p>A civilian organization called the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/war-relocation-authority-is-established-in-united-states">War Relocation Authority</a> was set up in March 1942 to administer the plan, with Milton S. Eisenhower from the Department of Agriculture to lead it. Eisenhower only lasted until June 1942, resigning in protest over what he characterized as incarcerating innocent citizens.</p><div class="video-player wp-block wp-block-history-video"><button class="video-player__close" aria-label="Close and pause the video" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12 19 6.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div class="video-player-decoy" style="background-image:url(https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/869/859/BRANDSD2997_THC_HOSF_216068_SFD_000_2398_5_20180621_01_4x3_04_HD.jpg)"><div class="video-player-decoy__title-wrapper"><div class="video-player-decoy__title" aria-hidden="true">Flashback: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII</div></div><button type="button" class="video-player-decoy__play" aria-label="Play Flashback: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII"><span class="video-player-decoy__play-icon"></span></button></div></div><h2 id="relocation-to-assembly-centers">Relocation to 'Assembly Centers'</h2><p>Army-directed removals began on March 24. People had six days notice to dispose of their belongings other than what they could carry.</p><p>Anyone who was at least 1/16th Japanese was evacuated, including 17,000 children under age 10, as well as several thousand elderly and disabled residents.</p><p>Japanese Americans reported to "Assembly Centers" near their homes. From there they were transported to a "Relocation Center" where they might live for months before transfer to a permanent "Wartime Residence."</p><p>Assembly Centers were located in remote areas, often reconfigured fairgrounds and racetracks featuring buildings not meant for human habitation, like horse stalls or cow sheds, that had been converted for that purpose. In Portland, <a href="/topics/us-states/oregon">Oregon</a>, 3,000 people stayed in the livestock pavilion of the Pacific International Livestock Exposition Facilities.</p><p>The Santa Anita Assembly Center, just several miles northeast of Los Angeles, was a de-facto city with 18,000 incarcerated, 8,500 of whom lived in stables. Food shortages and substandard sanitation were prevalent in these facilities.</p><h2 id="life-in-assembly-centers">Life in 'Assembly Centers'</h2><p>Assembly Centers offered work to prisoners with the policy that they should not be paid more than an Army private. Jobs ranged from doctors to teachers to laborers and mechanics. A couple were the sites of camouflage net factories, which provided work.</p><p>Over 1,000 incarcerated Japanese Americans were sent to other states to do seasonal farm work. Over 4,000 of the incarcerated population were allowed to leave to attend college.</p><div class="block-story-grid"><div class="card-grid is-style-3-col"><div class="card-grid__container"></div></div></div><h2 id="conditions-in-relocation-centers">Conditions in 'Relocation Centers'</h2><p>There were a total of 10 prison camps, called "Relocation Centers." Typically the camps included some form of barracks with communal eating areas. Several families were housed together. Residents who were labeled as dissidents were forced to a special prison camp in Tule Lake, California.</p><p>Two prison camps in <a href="/topics/us-states/arizona">Arizona</a> were located on Native American reservations, despite the protests of tribal councils, who were overruled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p><p>Each Relocation Center was its own "town," and included schools, post offices and work facilities, as well as farmland for growing food and keeping livestock. Each prison camp "town" was completely surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers.</p><p>Net factories offered work at several Relocation Centers. One housed a naval ship model factory. There were also factories in different Relocation Centers that manufactured items for use in other prison camps, including garments, mattresses and cabinets. Several housed agricultural processing plants.</p><h2 id="violence-in-prison-camps">Violence in Prison Camps</h2><p>Violence occasionally occurred in the prison camps. In <a href="https://njahs.org/confinementsites/lordsburg-internment-camp/">Lordsburg, New Mexico</a>, prisoners were delivered by trains and forced to march two miles at night to the camp. On July 27, 1942, during a night march, two Japanese Americans, Toshio Kobata and Hirota Isomura, were shot and killed by a sentry who claimed they were attempting to escape. Japanese Americans testified later that the two elderly men were disabled and had been struggling during the march to Lordsburg. The sentry was found not guilty by the army court martial board.</p><p>On August 4, 1942, a riot broke out in the Santa Anita Assembly Center, the result of anger about insufficient rations and overcrowding. At California's <a href="https://www.nps.gov/manz/planyourvisit/upload/Manz42-45Timeline.pdf">Manzanar War Relocation Center</a>, tensions resulted in the beating of Fred Tayama, a Japanese American Citizen’s League (JACL) leader, by six men.&nbsp;JACL members were believed to be supporters of the prison camp's administration.&nbsp;</p><p>Fearing a riot, police tear-gassed crowds that had gathered at the police station to demand the release of Harry Ueno.&nbsp;Ueno had been&nbsp;arrested for allegedly assaulting Tayama. James Ito was killed instantly and several others were wounded. Among those injured was Jim Kanegawa, 21, who died of complications five days later.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/central-utah-relocation-center-site.htm">Topaz Relocation Center</a>,&nbsp;63-year-old prisoner James Hatsuki Wakasa was shot and killed by military police after&nbsp;walking near the perimeter fence. Two months later, a couple was shot at for strolling near the fence.</p><p>In October 1943, the Army deployed tanks and soldiers to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/anthropology74/ce3l.htm">Tule Lake Segregation Center</a>&nbsp;in northern California to crack down on protests. Japanese American prisoners at Tule Lake had been striking over food shortages and unsafe conditions that had led to an accidental death in October 1943. At the same camp, on May 24, 1943,&nbsp;James Okamoto, a 30-year-old prisoner who drove a construction truck, was shot and killed by a guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="block-story-grid"><div class="card-grid is-style-3-col"><div class="card-grid__container"></div></div></div><h2 id="fred-korematsu">Fred Korematsu</h2><p> In 1942, 23-year-old&nbsp;Japanese-American Fred Korematsu was arrested for refusing to relocate to a Japanese prison camp. His case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where his attorneys argued in <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-korematsu-v-us">Korematsu v. United States</a> that Executive Order 9066 violated the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/bill-of-rights">Fifth Amendment</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Korematsu lost the case, but he went on to become a civil rights activist and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998. With the creation of California’s Fred Korematsu Day, the United States saw its first U.S. holiday named for an Asian American. But it took another Supreme Court decision to halt the incarceration of Japanese Americans. </p><h2 id="mitsuye-endo">Mitsuye Endo</h2><p>The prison camps ended in 1945 following the&nbsp;<a href="/topics/supreme-court-facts">Supreme Court</a> decision,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep323283/">Ex parte Mitsuye Endo</a></em>.&nbsp;In this case, justices ruled unanimously that the War Relocation Authority “has no authority to subject citizens who are concededly loyal to its leave procedure.”</p><p>The case was brought on behalf of Mitsuye Endo, the daughter of Japanese immigrants from Sacramento, California. After filing a habeas corpus petition, the government offered to free her, but Endo refused, wanting her case to address the entire issue of Japanese incarceration.</p><p>One year later, the Supreme Court made the decision, but gave President Truman the chance to begin camp closures before the announcement. One day after Truman made his announcement, the Supreme Court revealed its decision.</p><h2 id="reparations">Reparations</h2><p>The last Japanese internment camp closed in March 1946. President <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/gerald-r-ford">Gerald Ford</a> officially repealed Executive Order 9066 in 1976, and in 1988, Congress issued a formal apology and passed the Civil Liberties Act awarding $20,000 each to over 80,000 Japanese Americans as <a href="https://www.history.com/news/reparations-slavery-native-americans-japanese-internment">reparations</a> for their treatment.</p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p>Japanese Relocation During <a href="/topics/world-war-ii">World War II</a>. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/japanese-relocation">National Archives</a>.<br>Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/historyinternment.htm">J.

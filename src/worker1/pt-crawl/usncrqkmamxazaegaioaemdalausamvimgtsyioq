<p>It was during the time of the Reformation. Great Britain was Protestant, France was
Catholic, and Scotland was torn between the two of them. Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots was
born into a time full of religious turmoil. Early in her life she was a pawn in the battle
between Protestantism and Catholicism. As time past she struggled for her independence and
self-determination. Nearing the end of her life she was once again at the mercy of
relatives and ultimately put to death by one of them. She is one of Scotland's most
intriguing and controversial women in history. </p>

<p>Mary Stuart, queen of Scots was born on 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace in
Scotland. Her mother was Mary of Guise, a member of the powerful French family Guise. Her
father was James V of Scotland, the son Margaret Tudor and the nephew of England's King
Henry VIII. James V died shortly after hearing his wife had given birth to a bony
daughter, rather than a son that could continue the dynasty. This made Mary the Queen of
Scotland at the age of six days old. </p>

<p>Mary was sent to France when she was only six years old to marry Francis II, the
Dauphin, in return for Frances's aid in helping the Scottish rid themselves of the
English. Mary stayed in France for the next twelve years. During this time she developed
into a very beautiful and sexy woman who loved to dance, ride horses, and gossip. She was
tall and had thick re hair. Mary was happy in the French court where she was King Henry II
and his mistress's favorite. This however made her an enemy of Catherine de'Medici, the
King's wife. </p>

<p>Francis II loved Mary so much he allowed her to rule him as well as France after he
became King in 1558. However, Mary was not destined to rule France. In 1560, Francis II
died and Mary was sent back to Scotland by her mother-in-law, Catherine de'Medici. </p>

<p>Mary returned to Scotland to find it under the influence of the Protestant, John Knox.
Though she was the Queen of Scotland, her position as the dominant figure there was not as
obvious being that she was Catholic. In Scotland Mary met, fell in love with, and married
Henry, Lord Darnley. She described him as &quot;the lustiest and best-proportioned lang
man&quot; that she had ever met. They married in 1564 and soon afterwards Henry proved
that his beauty was the limit of his positive characteristics. He was arrogant,
politically incompetent, and fond of frequenting the taverns. Mary excluded him from all
court life and their relationship was one of only marriage. </p>

<p>Mary soon began to grow fond of the companionship of her secretary, close friend, and
Italian musician David Rizzio. Lord Darnley became jealous of him and had him assassinated
right before Mary's eyes. Shortly after this horrific act in 1566, Mary gave birth to a
son, James VI of Scotland, later the I of England. Mary would never forgive Lord Darnley
for having Rizzio assassinated. </p>

<p>In 1567, Mary after a failed attempt to reconcile with Lord Darnley became attracted to
one of her firm supporters, the Earl of Bothwell. The Earl of Bothwell, with the help of
others, carried out a plan that caused an explosion at the Kirk of Field, south of
Edinburgh's Royal Mile that killed Lord Darnley. He was discovered as the assassin, but
with the help of his political connections was acquitted soon after. Mary's actual
participation in the planning of the assassination is controversial. It is not known to
what degree she was involved or if she even was involved. Soon after the acquittal of the
accusations, the Earl of Bothwell and Mary got married. Scotland was shocked and outraged.
Mary and the Earl were besieged in
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.borthwickcastle.com/">Borthwick Castle</a> while on honeymoon. The marriage
between Mary and the Earl of Bothwell is also controversial. There are some scholars that
believe that Mary was forced into the marriage and repeatedly raped, not a willing and
wanting member of the marriage. </p>

<p>Both Mary and the Earl of Bothwell escaped Borthwick Castle safely and raised an army
of supporters. They fought a battle against the opposition at Carberry Hill. Mary was
defeated and forced to abdicate on her imprisonment in Loch Leven Castle. Mary escaped
prison one year later with help from her Catholic supporters. She was defeated again by
the Protestant forces, this time at Langside near Glasgow. She tried to flee to France,
but was blown ashore in England. There she tried to gain the protection of her cousin,
Queen Elizabeth I. </p>

<p>Mary was imprisoned until she could clear herself of the accusations of Lord
Darnley's
murder. She remained in prison for some time. After trying to escape she was put under
close guard and constant watch. During her years in prison, Mary continually planned her
liberation. In early 1587, Catholic supporters of Mary attempted to assassinate Elizabeth
I so Mary could take her rightful seat at the throne and institute Catholicism was again.
Mary's association with the plot was the last straw, Elizabeth I signed Mary's warrant for
execution. Mary had been in prison for nineteen years before she was executed on the
morning of 8 February 1587. She was beheaded at Fotheringay and later buried at
Westminster Abbey by her son, James VI of Scotland and the I of England. </p>

<p>Whether Mary Stuart was the champion of women's rights in the 16th Century as her
admirers claim, or the conspiring and murderous woman that her critics claim, she was one
of the most interesting women of her time. Her life possessed all the qualities of a
tragic hero. She was beautiful and had the world in the palm of her hand, yet it was not
meant to be. She would fall from her glorious status due to circumstances that may or may
not have been out of her control. </p>

<h2 ALIGN="CENTER"><b>Annotated Bibliography</b></h2>

<p><b>Abbott, Jacob. <i>History of Mary, Queen of Scots</i>. New York: F.M. Lupton Publishing
Co., no date.</b><br>
This book provides information on Mary Stuart's life from childhood to death. The
information given is repetitive with most of the other sources. This is a very basic and
dry account of a very interesting woman's life. The source provided the framework for this
biography.</p>

<p><b>Baring, Maurice. <i>In My End Is My Beginning</i>. New York: A.A. Knopf, 1931.</b><br>
This book is divided into four sections: 1) Mary Flemming's Narrative; 2) Mary
Beton's
Narrative; 3) Mary Livingstone's Narrative; and 4) Mary Seton's Narrative. The author has
four fictitious characters that each tells a narrative of how they have witnessed Mary
Stuart's actions. Two are for Mary Stuart and two are against her. The author openly
admits in the Preface that the book is fictitious, but as close to fact as he knows. None
of the characters' dialogue is based on anything besides the author's imagination. This
source was useless for this biography, however it did help me form my own opinion of Mary
Stuart.</p>

<p><b>Briley, Jaella. &quot;Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. &quot;<a
HREF="http://www.ctbw.com/maryscot.htm">http://www.ctbw.com/maryscot.htm</a> No publishing
date (21 March 1998).<br>
</b>This site gives a general biography of Mary Stuart. The information is repetitive of
most of the other sites and sources. The site was not written by a scholar, the style and
wording resembles that of a high school history student. The information given though is
sound and was useable for the biography.</p>

<p><b>Brown, Keith M. &quot;Much Ado About Nothing?&quot; <i>History Today</i> 37, February
1987: 6-8.</b><br>
This source gives an accurate and detailed list of the great writings about Mary Stuart
that were written around the time of her death. The article describes each book and
explains its impact, all of which were surprisingly small. The article was written, it
seems, to explain why there was so much literature appearing on Mary, Queen of Scots in
1987. The reason it gives for this is that it was the 400<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of
Mary's execution. This source was not directly beneficial to the research of this
biography because it gave little historical data on Mary Stuart's life, but it did provide
a vast locations of where to find that information.</p>

<p><b>Gorman, Herbert Sherman. <i>The Scottish Queen</i>. New York: Grosset &amp; Dunlap,
1932.</b><br>
This book was written in a narrative form, not the usual third person form associated
with historical writing. The book told the life story of Mary Stuart from birth to death.
It included many historical facts that when compared to other sources were found to be
true. However, due to the style of the writing, it was hard to decide if the book was
fact, fiction, or a mix of both. This makes it hard for the reader to see the historical
facts for what they are. It is difficult for the reader to decide what is fact and what is
the author's imagination. The information is comparable to that of the other sources.</p>

<p><b>Healey, Robert M. &quot;John Knox's &quot;History&quot;: A &quot;Compleat&quot; Sermon
on Christian Duty.&quot; <i>Church History</i> 61, no. 3 (September 1992): 319-33.<br>
</b>The article's primary topic is not Mary Stuart, however it does provide a great deal of
information about her. In particular, the article discusses Mary Stuart's actions against
John Knox and her religious attitudes. It gives the reader a good sense of how Mary was
trying to gain the people's support which, at the time of her return to Scotland, was
firmly behind John Knox. This source is excellent if the reader is searching for a more
in-depth look at Mary Stuart's religious and political struggles to be the dominant figure
in Scotland.</p>

<p><b>Koren-Deutsch, Ilona S. &quot;Feminist Nationalism in Scotland: Mary Queen of Scots Got
Her Head Chopped Off.&quot; <i>Modern Drama</i> 35 (September 1992): 424-32.</b><br>
This article explains how the playwright <i>Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped</i>
<i>Off</i> caused feminist Nationalism in Scotland to be revived. The article explains how
the play came to be and how it was produced. Very few historical facts are presented in
the source. Do not use this source if looking for historically based biographical data on
Mary Stuart.</p>

<p><b>Lee, Sidney, ed. &quot;Mary Stuart.&quot; <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. Vol.
36, London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1893.</b><br>
This source provides an in-depth examination of Mary Stuart. It covers even the
smallest details of Mary Stuart's life. This source is extremely complete. This book is a
good source for historical data on Mary Stuart because it was written by scholars that
have published sound historical findings for many years. This is an invaluable source for
any biography on Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots.</p>

<p><b>MacNalty, Arthur Salusbury, Sir. <i>Mary, Queen of Scots, Daughter of Debate</i>.
London: Christopher Johnson, 1960.</b><br>
This book provides a more sympathetic view of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. Its author
attempts to explain Mary Stuart's actions as negative side effects of her many
debilitating ailments. The author's belief is that Mary Stuart was not a cruel,
conspiring, and murderous woman, but was merely a victim of bad circumstances. The opinion
of the author allows the reader to have another option to choose from on Mary
Stuart's
character. This source allows the researcher to realize that there is another argument for
Mary's behavior.</p>

<p><b>Morrison, Nancy Brysson. <i>Mary, Queen of Scots</i>. New York: Vanguard Press, 1960.</b><br>
The book is written by a Scots woman who tries to stay as objective as possible. This
objectivity is expressed throughout the book and leaves the reader knowing that Mary
Stuart was like all other humans. She was neither entirely a saint as half of Scotland
preaches her to have been, nor was she entirely a conspiring and murderous woman as the
other half of Scotland preaches her to have been.<br>
The book is divided into four parts. 1) The Spring - which discusses Mary's childhood.
2) The Summer - which discusses Mary's life after returning to Scotland from France. 3)
The Autumn - which discusses Mary's life after she had her son in June 1566. 4) The Winter
- which discusses Mary's life from the time she escaped Loch Leven in May 1568 until her
death.<br>
The author uses a very easy to read style that welcomes the reader to continue on. The
objectivity though, is this source's greatest asset. The author refuses to condemn Mary
Stuart as entirely evil or to place her on a podium to be revered. He describes her as the
way that she was, human.</p>

<p><b>Parry, Edward Abbott, Sir. <i>The Persecution of Mary Stuart; the Queen's Cause</i>.
New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1931.</b><br>
The author's attempt to give an accurate historical analysis of Mary Stuart's life
leaves the reader with serious doubts about his interpretation of the situation. The book
unsuccessful attempts to convince the reader that all of contemporary historical accounts
of Mary Stuart's life have been tarnished and should be read with great caution and
scrutiny due to their authors' personal biases against either Mary Stuart herself, or her
religious views. The book provides the reader with a detailed account of the life of Mary
Stuart as what the author perceives as the truth. This source is useful for providing the
reader with information so they can have a more objective view of Mary Stuart than is
usually given by historical authors. This source allowed for a more objective biography,
rather than the negative perception of Mary Stuart that is usually given.</p>

<p><b>Pollen, J. H. &quot;Mary Queen of Scots: The Catholic Encylcopedia.&quot; Encyclopedia
Press, Inc., 1996. <a HREF="http://www.knight.org/advent">http://www.knight.org/advent</a>. (21 March 1998).</b><br>
This source was more than just a general biography; it was an in-depth look at Mary
Stuart's plot to take the throne of England from her cousin, Elizabeth I, and the letters
she wrote prior to her execution. The information provided at this web site was somewhat
repetitive on some aspects of Mary's life, but much more detailed in other areas. In
particular, those mentioned above. The source's most intriguing information was not the
historical data that was needed for this biography, so the source was only valuable as a
verification of other sources' information.</p>

<p><b>Thomson, George Malcom. <i>The Crime of Mary Stuart</i>. New York: E.P. Dutton &amp;
Co., 1967.</b><br>
This book provides the reader with extremely detailed information about Mary
Stuart's
&quot;crime&quot;. This book does not allow the reader to decide if Mary Stuart had
anything to do with Lord Darnley's murder, its author is too busy providing evidence to
convict her. A very interesting and useful source on the aspect of Mary Stuart's
participation in the murder of her husband, but not too useful in attaining information
about her whole life.</p>

</b>This web site was quite informative. It had several misspellings that caused me to
doubt the validity of its factual information, but when cross-checked with other sources
it was accurate. This site is actually for tourists that are travelling to Scotland and
want to see some sites that are associated with Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. However, it
did contain a brief biographical history to provide some meaning to go along with the
sites. It also contained a long list of sites to see while in Scotland and what each
site's relation to Mary Stuart is. If you are travelling to Scotland this is a good
source, but for a biography it was less than desirable.</p>

This web site provides a biography of Mary Stuart. It focuses most of its efforts on
her childhood and marriage/murder of Lord Darnley. Its information is somewhat repetitive
of the other web sites. One exception is the information given on Mary's intimate friend
David Rizzio. This source was helpful to this biography in that it aided the process of
narrowing down a vast amount of information into a small space.</p>

The site provides a brief, but complete biography of Mary Stuart. It also provides a
small quiz at the end of the biography so the reader can test his knowledge after reading.
This source was extremely helpful in developing the biography because it narrowed down all
the information given in the books to two pages of only the most important events of Mary
Stuart's life.</p>

<p><b>Zweig, Stefan. Mary, <i>Queen of Scotland and the Isles</i>. New York: Garden City,
1937.</b><br>
The book provides a general biography of Mary, Queen of Scots. It argues that Mary
Stuart was the rightful heiress to the throne of England. The book contained a vast amount
of discussions on lineage and family trees. It also goes into depth about how heirs are
chosen and why Mary Stuart should have be the Queen of England as well as Scotland.</p>

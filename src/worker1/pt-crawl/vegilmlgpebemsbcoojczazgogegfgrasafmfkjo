                    <strong>1954 – Present </strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Civil Rights in the South</strong></p>
                    <p>During the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, the  United States was reverberating with change as the struggle for civil rights  came to its peak. African Americans marched in the streets in demand of equal  treatment that were due all American citizens. One of the equalities that they  fought for was integration in local school systems.  These efforts would end the &ldquo;separate but  equal&rdquo; educational structure that was being enforced at the time. In 1954, the  U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Brown v.  Board of Education</em> outlawed segregation of the nation&rsquo;s public schools. It  ruled that:</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;To separate them [children of different color] from others of similar  age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of  inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts  and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="" id="_ednref1"> </a></em></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Despite the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s  ruling, many schools in the south ignored its order, so much so, that by 1957  less than two percent of southern schools had been integrated.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="" id="_ednref2"> </a> That  same year nine black students enrolled in a white high school in Little Rock,  Arkansas, which the law granted was permissible. Nevertheless, there was so  much upheaval from the white segregationists that President Eisenhower had to  order federal troops to protect the nine black students as they attended their  school. Coincidentally, six years after the <em>Brown  v. Board of Education</em>&rsquo;s ruling, in the real world of the American South,  Ruby Nell Bridges could attend kindergarten only in an all-black school. It was  an era in which racism, political brutality, unequal educational opportunity,  and poverty were all intertwined into a seemingly impenetrable and perpetual  barrier to the equality for African American citizens. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In an interview, Ruby Bridges  talks of her experience growing up in the South: </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> &ldquo;My grandparents were sharecroppers.  My cousins and myself worked for my  grandmother in her garden; we would pick vegetables and that sort of  thing.  I realize we were all very poor….  When I was growing up the white people and the black people just didn&rsquo;t  mix.  I learned that because of going  back to Mississippi with my grandparents. They were truly a little bit  different than I was used to.  It was  always yes ma&rsquo;am and no sir to people that were much, much younger than them, always  to people who were white. They seemed to walk on eggshells; my grandmother  would bring us to the store which was a good distance away from the farm.  Whenever we had to go, she would tell us,  &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t do this and you don&rsquo;t do that and say yes ma&rsquo;am&rsquo;, that sort of  thing.  We were all briefed before she  would take us. So I knew that there was always some reason, something about  when we got around those other, white people, to be on our best behavior.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="" id="_ednref3"> </a></p>

                    <p><strong>First Grade</strong></p>
                    <p>In 1960, after a protracted legal  battle, a federal court order required integration of the New Orleans,  Louisiana school system.  Plans were  drawn up to integrate the city&rsquo;s public schools gradually, beginning with the  first grade.  On November 14, 1960, amid  violent protests, four African American girls began first grade at formerly  all-white public schools.  Three of the  girls attended McDonough School together, but Ruby Bridges integrated William  Frantz School alone.  For the duration of  her first grade year, Bridges was escorted in and out of school daily by armed  federal marshals who needed to protect the tiny girl from enraged, cursing  crowds of segregationists. Bridges, in an interview, reflected on what happened  during that school year:</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;I drove up in front of the  school. I was more impressed with the school than the people standing around  shouting.  I was impressed with this  huge, very nice building in the neighborhood.   I was trying to figure out why this was such a big deal because no one  ever explained it to me.  Back then when  you were told to do something you did it.    I remember having to take a test and in my mind the reason everyone was  making so much of a fuss was that I passed the test and must have been really,  really smart.   That was what I figured  out for myself.  I was used to Mardi Gras  and people throwing things and shouting and waving their hands so I thought  this was either Mardi Gras or they were there because they were really excited  about seeing this really smart child.  So  those people in that crowd never bothered me.&rdquo;  <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="" id="_ednref4"> </a></em></p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;There were some things that  didn&rsquo;t fit into this logic.  I couldn&rsquo;t  figure out why there weren&rsquo;t any kids in the school; that didn&rsquo;t make  sense.  So I kept searching for the  kids.  I was lonely.  I wanted to see other kids.  That troubled me a bit.&rdquo; <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="" id="_ednref5"> </a></em></p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;…the fact that the crowds would bring this coffin with a black doll  inside.  That frightened me. The one  thing that stuck in my mind was that during those days if you were black you  weren&rsquo;t allowed in a funeral home so you would have services in your house. I  remembered a coffin being in the living room of my aunt and uncle, and seeing a  baby in the coffin…so when I was going to school and people were bringing this  coffin I must have related the two and understood that it meant death.   So part of my nightmares about the crowd  outside the school had to do with the coffin.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="" id="_ednref6"> </a></em></p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>One Teacher Makes a Difference</strong></p>
                    <p>Although Bridges was the sole  student in her classroom, she was not allowed to participate in recess or lunch  with other students, and faced violence, including threats of poisoning and a  display of a black doll in a coffin. In spite of all of this, Bridges did not  miss a single day of first grade at William Frantz School. Bridges&rsquo;s first  grade teacher, Barbara Henry, speaks of the hardships that they both endured in  order for Ruby to attend school:</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;Nobody at the school lifted a finger to make Ruby&rsquo;s life easier. The  principal was a rigid, prejudiced woman who gave me no guidance or help. Ruby  and I were both treated as unwelcome outsiders. When I went to the teachers&rsquo;  lounge at lunchtime, the other teachers at first ignored me or made unpleasant  remarks about the fact that I was willing to teach a black child.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="" id="_ednref7"> </a></em></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Bridges&rsquo; family also sacrificed;  her father was fired from his job, her sharecropping grandparents were expelled  from their land, and all family members were at acute risk of harm by  segregationists.  Her stoic bravery  attracted national attention in the daily news and magazines, in Nobel Laureate  John Steinbeck&rsquo;s book, <u>Travels With Charlie</u>, and in renowned artist Norman  Rockwell&rsquo;s painting, &ldquo;The Problem We All Live With.&rdquo; The first grader&rsquo;s determination  to take a stand against injustice and receive an equal education marked a  turning point after which New Orleans and other Southern schools moved toward  full integration.</p>

                      <p>However, Ruby Bridges&rsquo; impact<strong> </strong>on society did not end in her  childhood with her historic integration of the previously all-white William  Frantz School:<br />
                        <br />
                    <blockquote> <em>&ldquo;When I got to be around 35, nothing had the same meaning.  I was really struggling to find myself and  was depressed for about a year.  I know  now I was searching for my purpose.  When  I decided to go back to my faith I thought, I don&rsquo;t know what it is I&rsquo;m  supposed to do.  For some reason nothing  was falling into place anymore, nothing was working, it was almost like  something was working against me.  So I decided,  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to go out and look for a job; I&rsquo;m not going to do anything; I&rsquo;m  going to surrender and You (God) will have to show me because whatever it is  You want me to do in life, I will do it.&rsquo;…</em></p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p><em>When I got off my knees things just started falling into place.  It&rsquo;s just awesome and amazing when the Lord  is at work in your life.  I made a  commitment, and that&rsquo;s the flip point.   There&rsquo;s no turning back when you make that kind of commitment to your  Maker.  I kept thinking, what happened to  me, when I was six going into that all-white school, has to mean  something.  </em></p>
                      <p><br />
                        <em>Then I realized, I have to work with children.  I will take my experience of going into that  school and share that with kids today and pick it apart with them.  I go back to being six when I am talking to  them and we pick the whole thing apart.   At the end of a two hour session they can walk away and say, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s  right.  Racism truly makes no sense at  all.&rsquo; &rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="" id="_ednref8"> </a></em></p>

                    <p><strong>Ruby&rsquo;s Legacy</strong></p>
                    <p>In 1999 Ruby Bridges formed the  Ruby Bridges Foundation, to promote &ldquo;The values of tolerance, respect, and  appreciation of all differences.&rdquo; Ruby believes that &ldquo;Each and every one of us  is born with a clean heart… We know nothing about hate or racism.&rdquo; Her  foundation, therefore, is dedicated to working with and educating children, so  they can live rich and meaningful childhoods and grow up to be models and  leaders of loving kindness and equality. In addition to the Ruby Bridges  Foundation, Ruby has written a memoir, gives lectures, keynote addresses, and  speaks at schools across the country. She continues to actively share with  others the lessons of the history in which she played such a pivotal part.   </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;The most important lesson that I took away that year [at William  Frantz School] was that Mrs. Henry, who came from Boston to teach me, looked  exactly like those people (hate-faced, white supremacists).  I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect from her. But  she said, &lsquo;Come in and take a seat.  I&rsquo;m  your teacher.&rsquo; And she showed me her heart.  She became my best friend.  And I believe to this very day in my heart  that she was put there for me.  And that  shaped me into who I am today.  I am not  a prejudiced person.  The lesson I  learned in first grade is the very lesson that Dr. King tried to teach all of  us: &lsquo;You should never judge a person by the color of their skin, but by the  content of their character.&rsquo;</em><br />
                        <br />
                        <em>Then I went into the schools to try to actually share my story.  Everyone was familiar with the Norman Rockwell painting.  They knew of that painting, but they did not  know who that person was, even if that person was a real person, or what that  person&rsquo;s name was.  It is very, very  important that we share those stories.   That is our shared history.  It&rsquo;s  the Good and Evil that is in the world.   I have to remind you, Good and Evil comes in all shades and colors.  Good and Evil looks exactly like you and me.  You see, I also know that first hand because  I lost my oldest son.   He was  murdered.  He was murdered by Evil.  An Evil that stood over him and shot him  eleven times looked just like me.  That  is what we need to be concerned about.   It has absolutely got nothing to do with the color of our skin.  So we need to know our history… So that we  make sure that those kids--the next generation--that they want to strive to be  exactly like these people (the humanitarians of Remember Them: Champions for  Humanity).&rdquo;<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="" id="_ednref9"> </a></em></p>

                    <p>As Ruby Bridges went into schools  to share her own story to students, she has remarked on the children&rsquo;s acute  interest in faith:</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;When I speak to  kids in schools across the country I&rsquo;m amazed that they really want to know  about this thing called faith and the belief in God.  I believe, and that is going back to my  faith, that good will always prevail. That love will conquer hate.  I think I see more than most people because I&rsquo;m  in the schools across the country, talking to the children and that is the children&rsquo;s  faith.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="" id="_ednref10"> </a></p>

                    <p><strong>Last Thoughts</strong></p>
                    <p>Ruby Bridges was not the only  black child who desegregated a white school, nor is she the only child to have  ever done something courageous. Children love knowing about role models that  are kids like them. Why don&rsquo;t we have more monuments that include them?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;Nothing can be more moving than watching a small black child climbing  the steps to her elementary school that historically and legally did not  welcome her presence. Ruby Bridges had been called by her country to perform an  act of profound bravery—to become the black child in an all-white school.</em></p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p><em>By this simple act of courage, Ruby moved the hearts and opened the  minds of millions of people.  Her story  was and is an inspiration.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="" id="_ednref11"> </a></em></p>

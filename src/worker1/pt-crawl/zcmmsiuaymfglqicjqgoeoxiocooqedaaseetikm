<P>GARDNERVILLE, Nevada (CNN) --  It's a tale of two men, one 
called a radical, the other described as man with few 
opinions about anything. </P>

<P>The men, Joseph Martin Bailie, 40, and Ellis Edward Hurst, 
52, both of Gardnerville, are charged with planting a bomb in 
front of an IRS building in Reno on December 18. The 
100-pound bomb, left in a plastic barrel near the building, 
failed to explode.</P>

<P>Those who know the men and their town struggled to understand 
what may have led them to try to blow up a federal building.</P>

<P>Both suspects worked previously for a construction company in 
Gardnerville, a suburb of Reno and Carson City.</P>

<P>Bailie often boasted that taxes were not something he had to 
pay.  He "didn't have a lot of love for the government as a 
whole," Nixon said. </P>

<P>Components of the bomb, later blown up in the desert, (<A HREF="bomb_blast2.mov">1.8M QuickTime movie</A>) led 
federal agents to Hurst.  Last week, according to agents, 
Hurst confessed.  He allegedly said he and Bailie drove the 
bomb to the building in a pickup truck.</P>

<P>Rancher John Henningsen said lots of people in Gardnerville 
have anti-government feelings, but he never heard anything 
from his next door neighbor Hurst.</P>

<P>"He seemed like a quiet person, not a man who would cause 
trouble," Henningsen said.  </P>

<P>Authorities said nothing indicates a connection between the 
December 18 attempted bombing and a series of bombing attacks 
against federal officials in Nevada since 1993.  And federal 
officials decline to disclose whether there is any evidence 
linking the men to suspected militia groups.</P>

<P>For years in west-central Nevada, there have been reports of 
anti-government groups with names like Posse Comatatus and 
Pinenut Militia.  Little is know about the organizations or 
whether they even exist at all.</P>

<P>"We do not have a Posse Comatatus, per se, an organized group 
that meets every Thursday night down at the local tavern,"  
said Douglas County Sheriff Jerry Maple</P>

<P>But local law enforcement officials say there are people 
whose views hearken back to the days of the Wild West where 
the only man in charge is the county sheriff.</P>

<P>"I've had people come up to me and say, 'If NATO and the U.N. 
send troops into Gardnerville because of a militia or a 
citizens' uprising, are you going to subordinate yourself to 
a military general or are you going to run them out of 
town?'" Maple said.</P>

<P>The plot to bomb the IRS building angered many Nevadans, 
including those who may not like the government but resent a 
violent act that could have killed innocent people.</P>

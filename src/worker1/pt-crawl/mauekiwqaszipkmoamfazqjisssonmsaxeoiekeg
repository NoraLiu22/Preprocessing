        Disclaimers
    </p>
    <p>
        OUR SITE AND SITE CONTENT ARE OFFERED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE."   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED 
        UNDER LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO OUR SITE AND 
        SITE CONTENT, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF

        ABOUT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY SITE CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH

    </p>
    <p class="head1">
        Limitation of Liability
    </p>
    <p>
        THE FOUNDATION AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM OF 
        ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER BASED ON ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, LIABILITY, OR INJURY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF OUR 
        SITE OR SITE CONTENT OR FROM YOUR BREACH OF THESE TERMS.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE FOUNDATION 
        OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
        SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR SIMILAR DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, 
        OR LOSS OF DATA) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OUR SITE OR SITE CONTENT OR THESE TERMS, 
        REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER 
        LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY.  OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY 
        NATURE ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OUR SITE IS $US25.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO 
        NOT ALLOW A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR THESE KINDS OF DAMAGES, SO THESE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS 
        MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    </p>
    <p class="head1">
        Indemnification
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation and its directors, officers, employees, and agents 
        harmless against all liabilities, losses, damages, and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) 
        that any of the indemnified parties may incur arising out of or related to your use of our Site or 
        Site Content or your violation of these Terms.  The Foundation reserves the right to assume the 
        exclusive defense and control of any matter for which we are entitled to indemnification.  You agree 
        to provide us with all cooperation we reasonably request.
    </p>
    <p class="head1">
        Termination
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to terminate these Terms, our Site, and Site Content at any time without 
        notice for any reason.  The "Disclaimers," "Limitation of Liability," "Indemnification," and 
        "General" sections of these Terms (along with any other provision that by its terms contemplates 
        survival) will survive any termination.
    </p>
    <p class="head1">
        General
    </p>
    <p>
        These Terms, which include the Privacy Statement, are the complete agreement between you and 
        the Foundation regarding your use of our Site and supersede all other agreements (oral or written) 
        between you and the Foundation regarding its subject matter except that the Youth Playwriting 
        Fellowship is governed by separate official rules and by participating in the Youth Playwriting 
        Fellowship, you must agree to those rules, which prevail over any conflict with these Terms.  
        These Terms are governed by and should be construed according to the laws of the State of New York 
        applicable to agreements made and performed in New York, unless doing so would lead to the application 
        of the laws of another jurisdiction.  If you choose to access our Site from jurisdictions other than 
        the United States, you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with any applicable 
        local laws.  You irrevocably agree: (A) to bring any claim or dispute relating to your use of our 
        Site and these Terms exclusively in the state and federal courts located in the State and County of 
        New York; (B) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts; and (C) to waive any objection 
        to those courts based on inconvenience or other reasons.  You may not assign your rights under 
        these Terms without the Foundation’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment will be 
        null and void.  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of these Terms 
        is unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be deleted (or, if possible, modified 
        in a manner that will reflect the original intent as closely as possible) and the remaining provisions 
        will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Our failure to assert any right under 
        these Terms will not be considered a waiver of that right unless the waiver is in writing.  The 
        word “including” in these Terms is intended to be illustrative and means “including without limitation.”

<p>Two thirds of the country of Afghanistan, including the capital, Kabul, is ruled by a
Pashtun-dominated ultra- conservative Islamic movement known as the Taliban. The
Talib, or &quot;students,&quot; developed their extremist
interpretation of Islam in the refugee camps of Pakistan during the 1979-89 war against
the Soviet occupation. In the political, social and economic chaos after the
Soviet withdrawal and then loss of American aid, the Taliban fought against
other Mujahideen for control of the country.&nbsp; After the September 27, 1996
takeover of&nbsp; the capital, the streets of Kabul were full of young bearded men in black turbans, high on the
Koran/Qur'an and battle. Squads from the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the
Prevention of Vice reportedly raced around Kabul, with whips of leather and cable, beating anyone
who they felt was being un-Islamic. </p>

<p>The plight of women in Afghanistan is a great concern, because the law enforces
strict segregation and restrictions based on gender, called by some &quot;gender apartheid.&quot; The Taliban has
put many restrictions on the women of this country.&nbsp; For one, they are not
permitted to go to work or school. They are considered to be under &quot;house
arrest,&quot; they are not allowed to leave their houses without a male member of their
family, even when they might not have such a person, due to the past warfare in the
country. On December 29, 1997 the Taliban rulers stoned a women to death who was with a man
that was not one of her relatives. This points out that a women found with a man who was
not a family member faces the death penalty. The Taliban closed all girl schools, and most
of the other schools in the country have closed as well because 70 percent of the teachers
in the country are women. Women are also unable to get immediate health care, restrictions
have greatly hurt their physical and psychological health. The Physicians for Human Rights
study shows that physical health of 71% of the women has deteriorated during the past two
years, and 53% of women describe occasions when they were seriously ill and denied medical
care. Their study also finds that mental stress and depression was common among 97% of the
women studied, and 42% of the women meet the diagnostic criteria for
post-traumatic stress
disorder, and 21% had suicidal thoughts. Another problem that was brought upon women by
the Taliban is, they all must wear a garment called a &quot;burqa,&quot; which completely
covers their body under thick material, and leaves only a small mesh opening to see and
breathe. Women are also not allowed to wear high heals or white socks because the Taliban
considers them sexual.&nbsp; Also music and movies are banned as well as the flying of kites.</p>

<p>Even in the eyes of some of the Islamic community the Taliban has stepped out of line in
its treatment of women. Some quotes:&nbsp; &quot;The Taliban's view has no basis in the
Qur'an, yet yet it has
been promoted by the Taliban as Islamic.&quot; &quot;This situation is very distressing
considering that women were given rights in the Qur'an to contribute to the economy by
owning and selling property 1400 years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>To end this article there is a quote from Eleanor Smeal from the National
Organization of Women: &quot;If this was happening to
any other class of people around the world, there would be a tremendous outcry. We must
make sure these same standards are applied when it is women and girls who are brutally
treated.&quot; </p>

<p>This to me is one of the most important articles, because it is from other Islamic
people, not people half-way around the world who have nothing in common with the women
being mistreated. It gives valuable information, on the fact that the Qur'an has nothing
in it like the Taliban is pushing for.</p>

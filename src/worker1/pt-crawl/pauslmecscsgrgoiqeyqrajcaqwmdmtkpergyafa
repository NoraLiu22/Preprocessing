<H2> DIONYSIAC ARTISTS HONOUR ZENON OF ARGOS</H2><BR>
<I>Greek text:</I> &nbsp; <A HREF="http://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/28077">IG_4.558</A> 
<BR><I>Provenance:</I> &nbsp; <A TITLE="Pleiades" HREF="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/570504">Nemea</A> , Peloponnese
<BR><I>Date:</I> &nbsp; 115/4 B.C. 
<BR><I>Format:</I> &nbsp; see <A HREF="../../info/translate_key.html">key to translations</A>

<P> <I>The guild of Dionysiac artists from Isthmos and Nemea was a large organisation, which had several autonomous local branches; for a summary of what is known about it, see A. Kotlinska-Toma, &quot;Hellenistic Tragedy: Texts, Translations and a Critical Survey&quot;, pp.276-7  ( <A HREF="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5BpNDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA276">Google Books</A> ).  The branch in Argos was clearly very wealthy, and was able to cultivate good relations with foreign kings such as Nikomedes of Bithynia.  The immediate background to this decree was a dispute with the Dionysiac artists from Athens, as described in <A HREF="../sig2/s705.html">Syll_705.C-D</A>.  </I>

<P> <I>There is a German translation of the inscription by H. Kotsidu, &quot;TIM&#274; KAI DOXA&quot;, p. 110 ( <A HREF="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fztbDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110">Google Books</A> ).</I>

<P> Since Zenon [of Argos], son of Hekatodoros, [has continued on every occasion to be piously] disposed towards the gods, and kindly <I>disposed</I> [towards the association of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/d/dionysiac.html#1">Dionysiac</A> artists] from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/i/isthmus.html#1">Isthmos</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/n/nemea.html#1">Nemea</A> belonging to the [guild] in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/a/argos.html#1">Argos,</A> [and in all matters] he has given [many great] demonstrations of his noble conduct and has taken every [care in the greatest] offices of the guild, in a fine manner and to the advantage of the [public] affairs [of the guild]; and in all matters he has conducted himself in a manner worthy of [the good faith that has been shown] <I>by</I> him since he was a boy; and when he was appointed by the guild to be treasurer for the thirty-second [year, he revealed] that much of the guild's money was missing from the <I>official </I> total, and he informed the community [of the artists] about [all] those who had drawn out some [of this <I>money</I>] over many years; and at the request of the artists <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> he took care of the recovery of the money, [in all matters] conducting himself in a fine manner and to the advantage of the public affairs of the guild; [and from the] money that was recovered by him, each month he performed the sacrifices prescribed by law for the artists [during the days] of the guild <I>meeting</I>; and he declared fervently [that] a statue of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/d/dionysus.html#1">Dionysos</A> should be [constructed] for the guild, with limbs of marble and a robe of gold; and when the resources of the guild were depleted, he gave the money from what had been recovered by him; [and he spoke earnestly] concerning the construction . . . in the precinct . . . and when he was asked by the artists to take care [of all] these things, he let out all the 
 tasks for the sanctuaries with all zeal, and brought about many benefits for the guild . . . and at [this he declared that] . . . <FONT CLASS="verse">20</FONT> and Bacchic tripods should be maintained for the guild, [and he] let out <I>this task</I> profitably; and in all matters he acted in a manner that was typical of his [habitual] noble conduct on [important occasions], and he blamelessly [brought about] <I>not only</I> these obvious [benefits for the] guild but also [many <I>other</I> things] that have not been mentioned, [which he performed well] on behalf of [the guild; and he took] care concerning the construction of a base for the statue of our [benefactor] king Nikomedes, and the setting up of the statue, and of another even more splendid <I>statue</I> [within the] precinct; and he also spoke about constructing a place for the god, and creating a doorway in its entrance, and putting a roof over the place where the sacrifice to the god may be <I>performed</I> from the money that has been recovered [by him]; &nbsp; therefore so that the artists may be seen to attribute [praise] and honours to their [benefactors] with suitable gratitude, and they may have many <I>others</I> who are keen <I>to act</I> similarly, with good [fortune] it is resolved by the [Dionysiac] artists from Isthmos and Nemea belonging to the guild in Argos <FONT CLASS="verse">30</FONT> to praise Zenon [of Argos], son of Hekatodoros, [for his] goodwill and his probity concerning the public affairs of the guild, and to crown him [with a golden crown] as is traditional for us on the day of the god, and to place a bronze statue of him, [with this] inscription: 'The association of the Dionysiac artists from Isthmos and Nemea [belonging to the guild in Argos <I>honours</I> Zenon] of Argos, son of Hekatodoros, on account of his virtue and his benevolence towards the guild.'  &nbsp; Xenon the [treasurer] shall give [<I>money for</I> the cost associated with the statue] to whoever is appointed as overseer of the statue. The secretary Aristokles shall take [care of the preparation of the] crown, and the magistrates - [both those <I>in office</I> now and those appointed in the future - and the] secretary [<I>in office</I> at any time] shall take care [that this decree is read out] on the day of the god, and the secretary who is appointed [shall take] care . . . [that at the next] <A CLASS="help" HREF="../../names/n/nemean.html#1">Nemean</A> <I>games</I> in the gymnastic contest [this] proclamation is made: '[The association of the Dionysiac artists] from Isthmos and Nemea belonging to the guild in Argos <FONT CLASS="verse">40</FONT> crowns [Zenon of Argos, son of Hekatodoros, with a golden crown] on account of his virtue and the benevolence which he continually has towards [the guild, and it has placed a bronze statue of him in the] precinct. With good fortune.'  &nbsp; Whoever is appointed as [overseer of the statue] shall inscribe [this decree of the guild] on the base of the statue.

<H2>Max (2002)</H2>

<P>D: Menno Meyjes<BR>
S: John Cusack, Noah Taylor</P>

<P>Slash fiction writ large and featuring the most unlikely of characters
upon which to speculate in a fantasy scenario. Writer and director Menno
Meyjes' film is set in Weimar Germany where Jewish art dealer John Cusack
(<I><A HREF="hf.htm">High Fidelity</A></I>) is pushing back the boundaries
of convention with displays of modernist art. Still suffering inside from
a war wound which has cost him his own ability to paint, he is interested
in promoting new and radical forms of expression in a society which has
lost its sense of direction. Among his new prospects is an intense young
man, a sunken-eyed demobbed army corporal by the name of Adolf Hitler (portrayed
by Noah Taylor). Hitler's art is literalist, technically competent but lacking
passion. The art dealer, named Max, becomes fascinated by the young man,
who is obviously burning up inside with anger and frustration. Max hopes
to bring out his hidden depths on canvas, assuring him that if he gives
vent to what he is feeling, his art may break boundaries. Hitler tries,
but is unable to embrace the aesthetic paradigm shift. He finds politics
a more effective means of expression when, encouraged by conservative elements
within the army, he takes to making speeches at rallies for a movement seeking
to restore order to the disorder and give vent to the frustrations of those
who feel disenfranchised by the bohemianism of the Weimar Republic.</P>

<P><I>Max</I> is an interesting film, though some may find the subject matter
distasteful. Why, though? Was Hitler a mythical monster sprung wholly formed
from the imagination of Lucifer? Or was he a man, a product of his time,
his family, and his personal psychology whose path to madness was gradual
and informed by others? It is so much easier to believe the former, when
the latter only reminds us that Hitler was once very much like any of us,
until choices and circumstances catapulted him to a position of power.<I>Max</I>
does not attempt to absolve Hitler of the crimes against humanity for which
he is justly remembered, it just puts him in a context which the director
wishes to explore. It is not an inappropriate context either. The schism
between post-war modernism and fascism is certainly one way to envision
the environment in which he became politically active, and the character's
eventual declaration that politics is the new art is an apt one in defining
the twentieth century, where 'high' art indeed did seem to vanish from the
public consciousness and enter the realm of abstraction (though how then
might we explain Picasso's 'Guernica'?). Setting the emergence of Hitler's
political sensibility in this environment, and focusing his sense of disillusionment
upon a Jewish character, Meyjes is not a million miles away from the facts,
many of them as he may have chosen to omit.</P>

<P>Thankfully, the film is more than a high-concept in-joke though. Hauntingly
photographed by Lajos Koltai, well acted by the leads and others in support,
it is a solidly crafted drama in its own right; not stunning, perhaps, but
serviceable enough to hold together around its central precept. It is not
a political film in the strictest sense of the genre, though it is concerned
with politics as a subject. It is more a character piece in which politics
play an important role, though mostly as relief to the psychological and
aesthetic issues which are really at its heart. The film is about a connection
between two people whose worlds are interlinked yet oppositional, and about
how in spite of attempts to draw closer, they are doomed to remain apart,
with tragic results on more than one level.</P>

<P>Cusack is his usual commanding self, registering his character on several
levels of sympathetic complexity. Suave and faintly arrogant at first, Max
emerges as a rounded person as much concerned with the issues facing German
society as any politician. His own personal frustration and sense of empathy
with Hitler is unclouded by their differences, which is not to say he is
unaware of them. Like many people in Germany of that time, Max cannot foresee
the lengths to which Hitler will take their differences though, nor can
he distinguish passion from madness. In the end it is more the class divide
which truly separates them, again a not wholly inappropriate reading of
the situation. It is a problem only from the point of view of the Hitler
character though, whose ravings on the subject of Jewish capitalism in public
are a counterpoint to his attempt to forge a professional relationship with
Max in private. Difference, as always, is a matter of perception, and the
tragedy at the centre of the film is one of a failure to achieve an accommodation
between divergent interpretations of humanity's purpose.</P>

<P>Taylor was faced with a difficult task in playing Hitler, though Meyjes
has given him plenty to work with. The fissures in the character's personality
reveal weakness and insecurity, traits as likely to elicit sympathy as disgust.
As represented in this film, Hitler is not entirely unsympathetic, which
is to say his response to the situation in which he finds himself is explained
in context. Yet Taylor is able to also show the edges of madness, the frustrated
adolescence of this adult character and represent his descent into politics
as the opposite of what he perceives it to be. Even Max misunderstands what
Hitler has done when he finally clicks with a coherent futurist vision of
society drawn from ancient iconography, seeing his elaborate sketches of
Nazi banners and architecture as a kind of ironic modernism when it is clearly
nothing of the sort. There is a sense of hesitation in the character as
played by Taylor and represented by Meyjes, yet there is an inevitability
to his failure to embrace otherness which is drawn from the drama as well
as the history upon which it speculates.</P>

<P><I>Max</I> is a thought-provoking film, and though not revolutionary,
it is daring in tackling the subject it does, which makes it worthwhile
cinema. It doesn't all work, and there are those who may find the whole
thing too offensive to even begin to engage with, but there are less well
made and more thoughtless films out there which promote fascism without
ever having to represent or mention Hitler. At least this film raises questions,
and if those questions are disturbing precisely because they make us wonder
how a man becomes a monster, that is all to the better. If his monstrosity
is glimpsed only in passing, it makes it even more chilling and appropriate
for us to realise that, as Jean Cayrol remarked in the holocaust documentary
<I>Night &amp; Fog</I>, the beast far from buried in the rubble.</P>

Book II
	</H1>


	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="1">1</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.1">1</A> In the preceding book I stated in the first place at what date the Romans having subjected Italy began to concern themselves in enterprises outside the peninsula; next I narrated how they crossed to Sicily and what were their reasons for undertaking the war with Carthage for the possession of that island. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.2">2</A> After relating when and how they first built naval forces, I pursued the history of the war on both sides until its end, at which the Carthaginians evacuated all Sicily, and the Romans acquired the whole island except the parts which were Hiero's dominions. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.3">3</A> In the next place I set myself to describe how the mercenaries mutinied against Carthage and set ablaze the so‑called Libyan war; I described all the terrible atrocities committed in this war, all its dramatic surprises, and their issues, until it ended in the final triumph of Carthage. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.4">4</A> I will now attempt to give a summary view, according to my original project, of the events immediately following.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.5">5</A> The Carthaginians, as soon as they had set the affairs of Libya in order, dispatched Hamilcar to the land of Spain entrusting him with an adequate force. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.6">6</A> Taking with him his army and his son Hannibal now


<A ID="p243"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p243 </SPAN></A>nine years of age, he crossed the straits of Gibraltar and applied himself to subjugating Spain to the Carthaginians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.7">7</A> In this country he spent about nine years during which he reduced many Iberian tribes to obedience either by force of arms or by diplomacy, and finally met with an end worthy of his high achievements, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.8">8</A> dying bravely in a battle against one of the most warlike and <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful tribes, after freely exposing his person to danger on the field. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="1.9">9</A> The Carthaginians handed over the command of the army to Hasdrubal his son-in‑law and chief naval officer.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="2">2</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.1">1</A> It was at this period that the Romans first crossed with an army to Illyria and that part of Europe. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.2">2</A> This is a matter not to be lightly passed over, but deserving the serious attention of those who wish to gain a true view of the purpose of this work and of the formation and growth of the Roman dominion. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.3">3</A> The circumstances which decided them to cross were as follows: <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.4">4</A> Agron, king of Illyria, was the son of Pleuratus, and was master of stronger land and sea forces than any king of Illyria before him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.5">5</A> Demetrius, the father of Philip V, had induced him by a bribe to go to the assistance of the town of Medion which the Aetolians were besieging. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.6">6</A> The Aetolians being unable to persuade the Medionians to join their league, determined to reduce them by force. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.7">7</A> Levying all their forces they encamped round the city and strictly besieged it, employing every forcible means and every device. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.8">8</A> The date


<A ID="p245"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p245 </SPAN></A>of the annual elections was now at hand, and they had to choose another Strategus. As the besieged were in the utmost extremity and were expected to surrender every day, the actual Strategus addressed the Aetolians, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.9">9</A> maintaining that as it was he who had supported the dangers and hardships of the siege, it was only just, on the town falling, he should have the privilege of dealing with the booty and inscribing with his name the shields dedicated in memory of the victory. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.10">10</A> Some, more especially the candidates for the office, disputed this, and begged the people not to decide the matter in advance, but leave it, as things stood, to Fortune to determine to whom she should award this prize. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.11">11</A> The Aetolians hereupon passed a resolution, that if it was the new Strategus whoever he might be, to whom the city fell, he should share with the present one the disposition of the booty and the honour of inscribing the shields.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="3">3</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.1">1</A> This decree had been passed, and next day the election was to be held, and the new Strategus was to enter at once into office, as is the practice of the Aetolians, when that night a hundred boats containing a force of five thousand Illyrians arrived at the nearest point on the coast to Medion. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.2">2</A> Anchoring there they landed, as soon as it was daylight, with promptitude and secrecy, and forming in the order customary in Illyria, advanced by companies on the Aetolian camp. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.3">3</A> The Aetolians, on becoming aware of it, were taken aback by the unexpected nature and boldness of the attack, but having for many years ranked very high in their own estimation and relying on their strength, they were more or less confident. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.4">4</A> Stationing the greater part of their


<A ID="p247"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p247 </SPAN></A>hoplites and cavalry on the level ground just in front of their lines, they occupied with a portion of their cavalry and their <SPAN CLASS="whole">light-armed</SPAN> infantry certain favourable positions on the heights in front of the camp. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.5">5</A> The Illyrians, charging their light infantry, drove them from their positions by their superior force and the weight of their formation, compelling the supporting body of cavalry to fall back on the <SPAN CLASS="whole">heavy-armed</SPAN> troops. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.6">6</A> After this, having the advantage of attacking the latter, who were drawn up on the plain, from higher ground, they speedily put them to flight, the Medionians also joining in the attack from the city. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.7">7</A> They killed many Aetolians and took a still larger number of prisoners, capturing all their arms and baggage. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.8">8</A> The Illyrians, having thus executed the orders of their king, carried off to their boats the baggage and other booty and at once set sail for home.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="4">4</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.1">1</A> The Medionians, thus unexpectedly saved, met in assembly and discussed, among other matters, that of the proper inscription for the shields. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.2">2</A> They decided, in parody of the Aetolian decree, to inscribe them as won <I>from</I> and not <I>by</I> the present Aetolian chief magistrate and the candidates for next year's office. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.3">3</A> It seemed as if what had befallen this people was designed by Fortune to display her might to men in general. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.4">4</A> For in so brief a space of time she put it in their power to do to the enemy the very thing which they thought the enemy were just on the point of doing to themselves. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.5">5</A> The <SPAN CLASS="whole">unlooked-for</SPAN> calamity of the Aetolians was a lesson to mankind never to


<A ID="p249"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p249 </SPAN></A>discuss the future as if it were the present, or to have any confident hope about things that may still turn out quite otherwise. We are but men, and should in every matter assign its share to the unexpected, this being especially true of war.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.6">6</A> King Agron, when the flotilla returned and his officers gave him an account of the battle, was so overjoyed at the thought of having beaten the Aetolians, then the proudest of peoples, that he took to carousals and other convivial excesses, from which he fell into a pleurisy that ended fatally in a few days. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.7">7</A> He was succeeded on the throne by his wife Teuta, who left the details of administration to friends on whom she relied. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.8">8</A> As, with a woman's natural shortness of view, she could see nothing but the recent success and had no eyes for what was going on elsewhere, she in the first place gave letters of marque to privateers to pillage any ships they met, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.9">9</A> and next she collected a fleet and force of troops as large as the former one and sent it out, ordering the commanders to treat all countries alike as belonging to their enemies.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="5">5</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.1">1</A> The expedition began by making a descent on Elis and Messenia, lands which the Illyrians had always been in the habit of pillaging, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.2">2</A> because, owing to the extent of their sea-board and owing to the principal cities being in the interior, help against their raids was distant and slow in arriving; so that they could always overrun and plunder those countries unmolested. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.3">3</A> On this occasion, however, they put in at Phoenice in Epirus for the purpose of provisioning themselves. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.4">4</A> There they fell in with certain Gaulish soldiers, about eight hundred


<A ID="p251"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p251 </SPAN></A>in number, at present in the employ of the Epirots. They approached these Gauls with a proposal for the betrayal of the city, and on their agreeing, they landed and captured the town and its inhabitants by assault with the help from within of the Gauls. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.5">5</A> When the Epirots learnt of this they hastened to come to help with their whole force. On reaching Phoenice they encamped with the river that runs past the town on their front, removing the planking of the bridge so as to be in safety. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.6">6</A> On news reaching them that Scerdilaïdas with five thousand Illyrians was approaching by land through the pass near Antigonia, they detached a portion of their force to guard Antigonia, but they themselves henceforth remained at their ease, faring plenteously on the produce of the country, and quite neglecting night and day watches. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.7">7</A> The Illyrians, learning of the partition of the Epirot force and of their general remissness, made a night sortie, and replacing planks on the bridge, crossed the river in safety and occupied a strong position where they remained for the rest of the night. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.8">8</A> When day broke, both armies drew up their forces in front of the town and engaged. The battle resulted in the defeat of the Epirots, many of whom were killed and still more taken prisoners, the rest escaping in the direction of Atintania.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="6">6</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.1">1</A> The Epirots, having met with this misfortune and lost all hope in themselves, sent embassies to the Aetolians and to the Achaean league imploring their


<A ID="p253"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p253 </SPAN></A>succour. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.2">2</A> Both leagues took pity on their situation and consented, and shortly afterwards this relieving force reached Helicranum. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.3">3</A> The Illyrians holding Phoenice at first united with Scerdilaïdas, and advancing to Helicranum encamped opposite the Achaeans the Aetolians&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref:Loeb_typo_p253" HREF="

onMouseOut="nd();">a</A> who had come to the rescue, and were anxious to give battle. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.4">4</A> But the ground was very difficult and unfavourable to them, and just at this time a dispatch came from Teuta ordering them to return home by the quickest route, as some of the Illyrians had revolted to the Dardanians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.5">5</A> They therefore, after plundering Epirus, made a truce with the Epirots. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.6">6</A> By the terms of this they gave up to them the city and its free population on payment of a ransom; the slaves and other goods and chattels they put on board their boats, and while the one force sailed off home, Scerdilaïdas marched back through the pass near Antigonia. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.7">7</A> They had caused the Greek inhabitants of the coast no little consternation and alarm; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.8">8</A> for, seeing the most strongly situated and most <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful town in Epirus thus suddenly taken and its population enslaved, they all began to be anxious not, as in former times, for their agricultural produce, but for the safety of themselves and their cities.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.9">9</A> The Epirots, thus unexpectedly saved, were so far from attempting to retaliate on the wrongdoers or from thanking those who had come to their relief, that, on the contrary, they sent an embassy to Teuta, and together with the Acarnanians entered into an alliance with Illyria, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.10">10</A> engaging in future to <SPAN CLASS="whole">co-operate</SPAN> with the Illyrians and work against the Achaeans and Aetolians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.11">11</A> Their whole conduct showed them


<A ID="p255"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p255 </SPAN></A>not only to have acted now towards their benefactors without judgement, but to have blundered from the outset in the management of their own affairs.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="7">7</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.1">1</A> For we are but men, and to meet with some unexpected blow is not the sufferer's fault, but that of Fortune and those who inflict it on him; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.2">2</A> but when we involve ourselves by sheer lack of judgement and with our eyes open in the depth of misfortune, everyone acknowledges that we have none to blame but ourselves. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.3">3</A> It is for this reason that those whom Fortune leads astray meet with pity, pardon and help, but if their failures are due to their own indiscretion, all <SPAN CLASS="whole">right-thinking</SPAN> men blame and reproach them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.4">4</A> And in this case the Greeks would have been amply justified in their censure of the Epirots. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.5">5</A> To begin with would not anyone who is aware of the general reputation of the Gauls, think twice before entrusting to them a wealthy city, the betrayal of which was easy and profitable? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.6">6</A> In the second place who would not have been cautious in the case of a company with such a bad name? First of all they had been expelled from their own country by a general movement of their <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-countrymen</SPAN> owing to their having betrayed their own friends and kinsmen. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.7">7</A> Again, when the Carthaginians, hard pressed by the war, received them, they first availed themselves of a dispute about pay between the soldiers and the generals to pillage the city of Agrigentum of which they formed the garrison, being then above three thousand strong. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.8">8</A> Afterwards, when the Carthaginians sent them on the same service to Eryx, then besieged by the Romans, they attempted to betray the city and those who were suffering siege in their company, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.9">9</A> and when this plan fell through, they deserted to


<A ID="p257"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p257 </SPAN></A>the Romans. The Romans entrusted them with the guard of the temple of Venus Erycina, which again they pillaged. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.10">10</A> Therefore, no sooner was the war with Carthage over, than the Romans, having clear evidence of their infamous character, took the very first opportunity of disarming them, putting them on board ship and banishing them from the whole of Italy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.11">11</A> These were the men whom the Epirots employed to guard their most flourishing city. How then can they be acquitted of the charge of causing their own misfortunes?

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.12">12</A> I thought it necessary to speak at some length on this subject in order to show how foolish the Epirots were, and that no people, if wise, should ever admit a garrison stronger than their own forces, especially if composed of barbarians.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="8">8</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.1">1</A> To return to the Illyrians. For a long time previously they had been in the habit of maltreating vessels sailing from Italy, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.2">2</A> and now while they were at Phoenice, a number of them detached themselves from the fleet and robbed or killed many Italian traders, capturing and carrying off no small number of prisoners. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.3">3</A> The Romans had hitherto turned a deaf ear to the complaints made against the Illyrians, but now when a number of persons approached the Senate on the subject, they appointed two envoys, Gaius and Lucius Coruncanius, to proceed to Illyria, and investigate the matter. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.4">4</A> Teuta, on the return of the flotilla from Epirus, was so struck with admiration by the quantity and beauty of the spoils they brought back (Phoenice being then far the wealthiest city there), that she


<A ID="p259"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p259 </SPAN></A>was twice as eager as before to molest the Greeks. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.5">5</A> For the present, however, she had to defer her projects owing to the disturbance in her own dominions; she had speedily put down the Illyrian revolt, but was engaged in besieging Issa, which alone still refused to submit to her, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.6">6</A> when the Roman ambassadors arrived by sea. Audience having been granted them, they began to speak of the outrages committed against them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.7">7</A> Teuta, during the whole interview, listened to them in a most arrogant and overbearing manner, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.8">8</A> and when they had finished speaking, she said she would see to it that Rome suffered no public wrong from Illyria, but that, as for private wrongs, it was contrary to the custom of the Illyrian kings to hinder their subjects from winning booty from the sea. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.9">9</A> The younger of the ambassadors was very indignant at these words of hers, and spoke out with a frankness most proper indeed, but highly inopportune: <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.10">10</A> "O Teuta," he said, "the Romans have an admirable custom, which is to punish publicly the doers of private wrongs and publicly come to the help of the wronged. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.11">11</A> Be sure that we will try, God willing, by might and main and right soon, to force thee to mend the custom toward the Illyrians of their kings." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.12">12</A> Giving way to her temper like a woman and heedless of the consequences, she took this frankness ill, and was so enraged at the speech that, defying the law of nations, when the ambassadors were leaving in their ship, she sent emissaries to assassinate the one who had been so bold of speech. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.13">13</A> On the news reaching Rome, the woman's outrage created great indignation and they at once set themselves to prepare for an expedition, enrolling legions and getting a fleet together.

Upon this the Corcyreans, in the utmost distress and despondency, sent, together with the peoples of Apollonia and Epidamnus, envoys to the Achaeans and Aetolians, imploring them to hasten to their relief and not allow them to be driven from

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.1">1</A> The Illyrians, now reinforced by seven decked ships sent by the Acarnanians in compliance with the terms of their treaty, put to sea and encountered the Achaean ships off the island called Paxi. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.2">2</A> The Acarnanians and those Achaean ships which were told off to engage them fought with no advantage on either side, remaining undamaged in their encounter except for the wounds inflicted on some of the crew. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.3">3</A> The Illyrians lashed their boats together in batches of four and thus engaged the enemy. They sacrificed their own boats, presenting them broadside to their adversaries in a position favouring their charge, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.4">4</A> but when the enemy's ships had charged and struck them and getting fixed in them, found themselves in difficulties, as in each case the four boats lashed together were hanging on to their beaks, the marines leapt on to the decks of the Achaean ships and overmastered them by their numbers. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.5">5</A> In this way they captured four quadriremes and sunk with all hands a quinquereme, on board of which was Margus of Caryneia, a man who up to the end served the Achaeans most loyally. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.6">6</A> The ships that were engaged with the Acarnanians, seeing the success of the Illyrians, and trusting to their speed, made sail with a fair wind and escaped home in safety. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="10.7">7</A> The Illyrian forces, highly elated by their

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.1">1</A> At about the same time one of the Consuls, Gnaeus Fulvius, sailed out from Rome with the two hundred ships, while the other, Aulus Postumius, left with the land forces. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.2">2</A> Gnaeus' first intention had been to make for Corcyra, as he supposed he would find the siege still undecided. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.3">3</A> On discovering that he was too late, he none the less sailed for that island, wishing on the one hand to find out accurately what had happened about the city, and on the other hand to put to a test the sincerity of communications made to him by Demetrius. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.4">4</A> Accusations had been brought against the latter, and being in fear of Teuta he sent messages to the Romans undertaking to hand over to them the city and whatever else was under his charge. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.5">5</A> The Corcyreans were much relieved to see the Romans arrive, and they gave up the Illyrian garrison to them with the consent of Demetrius. They unanimously accepted the Romans' invitation to place themselves under their protection, considering this the sole means of assuring for the future their safety from the violence of the Illyrians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.6">6</A> The Romans, having admitted the Corcyreans to their

They admitted this tribe to their friendship as well as the Atintanes, and advanced towards Issa which was also being besieged by the Illyrians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.12">12</A> On their arrival they forced the enemy to raise the siege and took the Issaeans also under their protection. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.13">13</A> The fleet too took several Illyrian cities by assault as they sailed along the coast, losing, however, at Nutria not only many soldiers, but some of their military tribunes and their quaestor. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.14">14</A> They also captured twenty boats which were conveying the plunder from the country. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.15">15</A> Of the besiegers of Issa those now in Pharos were allowed, through Demetrius' influence, to remain there unhurt, while the others dispersed and took refuge at Arbo. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="11.16">16</A> Teuta, with only a few followers, escaped to

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.1">1</A> Gnaeus Fulvius now sailed for Rome with the greater part of both forces, <!-- sss --><A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.2">2</A> and Postumius, with whom forty ships were left, enrolled a legion from the cities in the neighbourhood and wintered at Epidamnus to guard the Ardiaeans and the other tribes who had placed themselves under the protection of Rome. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.3">3</A> In the early spring Teuta sent an embassy to the Romans and made a treaty, by which she consented to pay any tribute they imposed, to relinquish all Illyria except a few places, and, what mostly concerned the Greeks, undertook not to sail beyond Lissus with more than two unarmed vessels. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.4">4</A> When this treaty had been concluded Postumius sent legates to the Aetolian and Achaean leagues. On their arrival they first explained the causes of the war and their reason for crossing the Adriatic, and next gave an account of what they had accomplished, reading the treaty they had made with the Illyrians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.5">5</A> After meeting with all due courtesy from both the leagues, they returned by sea to Corcyra, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.6">6</A> having by the communication of this treaty, delivered the Greeks from no inconsiderable dread; for the Illyrians were not then the enemies of this people or that, but the common enemies of all.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.7">7</A> Such were the circumstances and causes of the Romans crossing for the first time with an army to Illyria and those parts of Europe, and of their first coming into relations through an embassy with Greece. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="12.8">8</A> But having thus begun, the Romans immediately afterwards sent other envoys to Athens and Corinth, on which occasion the Corinthians first admitted them to participation in the Isthmian games.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.1">1</A> We have said nothing of affairs in Spain during these years. Hasdrubal had by his wise and practical administration made great general progress, and by the foundation of the city called by some Carthage, and by others the New Town, made a material contribution to the resources of Carthage, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.2">2</A> especially owing to its favourable position for action in Spain or Libya. On a more suitable occasion we will describe its position and point out the services it can render to both these countries. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.3">3</A> The Romans, seeing that Hasdrubal was in a fair way to create a larger and more formidable empire than Carthage formerly possessed, resolved to begin to occupy themselves with Spanish affairs. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.4">4</A> Finding that they had hitherto been asleep and had allowed Carthage to build up a <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful dominion, they tried, as far as possible, to make up for lost time. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.5">5</A> For the present they did not venture to impose orders on Carthage, or to go to war with her, because the threat of a Celtic invasion was hanging over them, the attack being indeed expected


<A ID="p273"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p273 </SPAN></A>from day to day. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.6">6</A> They decided, then, to smooth down and conciliate Hasdrubal in the first place, and then to attack the Celts and decide the issue by arms, for they thought that as long as they had these Celts threatening their frontier, not only would they never be masters of Italy, but they would not even be safe in Rome itself. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="13.7">7</A> Accordingly, after having sent envoys to Hasdrubal and made a treaty, in which no mention was made of the rest of Spain, but the Carthaginians engaged not to cross the Ebro in arms, they at once entered on the struggle against the Italian Celts.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.1">1</A> I think it will be of use to give some account of these peoples, which must be indeed but a summary one, in order not to depart from the original plan of this work as defined in the preface. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="14.2">2</A> We must, however, go back to the time when they first occupied these districts.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="21.1">1</A> After these reverses, the Gauls remained quiet and at peace with Rome for <SPAN CLASS="whole">forty-five</SPAN> years. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="21.2">2</A> But when, as time went on, those who had actually witnessed the terrible struggle were no more, and a younger generation had taken their place, full of unreflecting passion and absolutely without experience

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.1">1</A> The two largest tribes, therefore, the Insubres and Boii, made a league and sent messengers to the Gauls dwelling among the Alps and near the Rhone, who are called Gaesatae because they serve for hire, this being the proper meaning of the word. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.2">2</A> They urged and incited their kings Concolitanus and Aneroëstus to make war on Rome, offering them at present a large sum in gold, and as to the future, pointing out to them the great prosperity of the Romans, and the vast wealth that would be theirs if they were victorious. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.3">3</A> They had no difficulty in persuading them, as, in addition to all this, they pledged themselves to be loyal allies and reminded them of the achievement of their own ancestors, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.4">4</A> who had not only overcome the Romans in combat, but, after the battle, had assaulted and taken Rome itself, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.5">5</A> possessing themselves of all it contained, and, after remaining masters of the city for seven months, had finally given it up of their own free will and as an act of grace, and had returned home with their spoil, unbroken and unscathed. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.6">6</A> When the kings had been told all this, they became so eager for the expedition that on no occasion has that district of Gaul sent out so large a force or one composed of men so distinguished or so warlike. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.7">7</A> All this time, the Romans, either hearing what was happening or divining what was coming, were in such a state of constant alarm and unrest, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.8">8</A> that at times we find them busy enrolling legions and making provision of corn and other stores, at times marching to the

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.1">1</A> About forty thousand Celts were slain and at least ten thousand taken prisoners, among them the king Concolitanus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.2">2</A> The other king, Aneroëstes, escaped with a few followers to a certain place where he put an end to his life and to those of his friends. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.3">3</A> The Roman Consul collected the spoils and sent them to Rome, returning the booty of the Gauls to the owners. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.4">4</A> With his legions he traversed Liguria and invaded the territory of the Boii, from whence, after letting his legions pillage to their heart's content, he returned at their head in a few days to Rome. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.5">5</A> He sent to ornament the Capitol the standards and necklaces (the gold necklets worn by the Gauls), <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.6">6</A> but the rest of the spoil and the prisoners he used for his entry into Rome and the adornment of his triumph.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.7">7</A> Thus were destroyed these Celts during whose invasion, the most serious that had ever occurred, all the Italians and especially the Romans had been exposed to great and terrible peril. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.8">8</A> This success encouraged the Romans to hope that they would be able entirely to expel the Celts from the plain of the Po and both the Consuls of the next year, Quintus Fulvius and Titus Manlius, were sent against them with a formidable expeditionary force. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.9">9</A> They surprised and terrified the Boii, compelling them to submit to Rome, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.10">10</A> but the rest of the campaign had no practical results whatever, owing to the very heavy rains, and an epidemic which broke out among them.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.1">1</A> Next year's Consuls, however, Publius Furius and Gaius Flaminius, again invaded the Celtic territory, through the country of the Anares who dwelt not far from Marseilles. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.2">2</A> Having admitted this tribe to their friendship, they crossed into the territory of the Insubres, near the junction of the Po and Adda. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.3">3</A> Both in crossing and in encamping on the other side, they suffered some loss, and at first remained on the spot, but later made a truce and evacuated the territory under its terms. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.4">4</A> After a circuitous march of some days, they crossed the river Clusius and reached the country of the Cenomani, who were their allies, and accompanied by them, again invaded from the district at the foot of the Alps the plains of the Insubres and began to lay the country waste and pillage their dwellings. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.5">5</A> The chieftains of the Insubres, seeing that the


<A ID="p321"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p321 </SPAN></A>Romans adhered to their purpose of attacking them, decided to try their luck in a decisive battle. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.6">6</A> Collecting all their forces in one place, they took down the golden standards called "immovable" from the temple of Minerva, and having made all other necessary preparations, boldly took up a menacing position opposite the enemy. They were about fifty thousand strong. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.7">7</A> The Romans, on the one hand, as they saw that the enemy were much more numerous than themselves, were desirous of employing also the forces of their Celtic allies, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.8">8</A> but on the other hand, taking into consideration Gaulish fickleness and the fact that they were going to fight against those of the same nation as these allies, they were wary of asking such men to participate in an action of such vital importance. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.9">9</A> Finally, remaining themselves on their side of the river, they sent the Celts who were with them across it, and demolished the bridges that crossed the stream, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.10">10</A> firstly as a precaution against their allies, and secondly to leave themselves no hope of safety except in victory, the river, which was impassable, lying in their rear. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="32.11">11</A> After taking these measures they prepared for battle.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.1">1</A> The Romans are thought to have managed matters very skilfully in this battle, their tribunes having instructed them how they should fight, both as individuals and collectively. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.2">2</A> For they had observed from former battles that Gauls in general are most formidable and spirited in their first onslaught, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.3">3</A> while still fresh, and that, from the way

Upon the Gauls slashing first at the spears and making their swords unserviceable the Romans came to close quarters, having rendered the enemy helpless by depriving them of the power of raising their hands and cutting, which is the peculiar and only stroke of the Gauls, as their swords have no points. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.6">6</A> The Romans, on the contrary, instead of slashing continued to thrust with their swords which did not bend, the points being very effective. Thus, striking one blow after another on the breast or face, they slew the greater part of their adversaries. This was solely due to the foresight of the tribunes, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.7">7</A> the Consul Flaminius being thought to have mismanaged the battle by deploying his force at the very edge of the <SPAN CLASS="whole">river-bank</SPAN> and thus rendering impossible a tactical movement peculiar to the Romans, as he left the lines no room to fall back gradually. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.8">8</A> For had the troops been even in the slightest degree pushed back from their ground during the battle, they would have had to throw themselves into the river, all owing to their general's blunder. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="33.9">9</A> However, as it was, they gained a decisive victory by their own skill and valour, as I said, and

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.1">1</A> Next year the Celts sent ambassadors begging for peace and engaging to accept any conditions, but the new Consuls Marcus Claudius and Gnaeus Cornelius strongly urged that no peace should be granted them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.2">2</A> On meeting with a refusal, the Celts decided to resort to their last hope and again appealed to the Gaesatae on the Rhone, and hired a force of about thirty thousand men. When they had these troops they kept them in readiness and awaited the attack of the enemy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.3">3</A> The Roman Consuls, when the season came, invaded the territory of the Insubres with their legions. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.4">4</A> Encamping round a city called Acerrae lying between the Po and the Alps, they laid siege to it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.5">5</A> The Insubres could not come to the assistance of the besieged, as the Romans had occupied all the advantageous positions, but, with the object of making the latter raise the siege, they crossed the Po with part of their forces, and entering the territory of the Anares, laid siege to a town there called Clastidium. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.6">6</A> On the Consuls learning of this, Marcus Claudius set off in haste with the cavalry and a small body of infantry to relieve the besieged if possible. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.7">7</A> The Celts, as soon as they were aware of the enemy's arrival, raised the siege and advancing to meet them, drew up in order of battle. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.8">8</A> When the Romans boldly charged them with their cavalry alone, they at first stood firm, but afterwards, being taken both in the rear and on the flank, they found themselves in difficulties and were finally put to rout by the cavalry unaided,


<A ID="p327"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p327 </SPAN></A><A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.9">9</A> many of them throwing themselves into the river and being swept away by the current, while the larger number were cut to pieces by the enemy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.10">10</A> The Romans now took Acerrae, which was well stocked with corn, the Gauls retiring to Mediolanum, the chief place in the territory of the Insubres. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.11">11</A> Gnaeus followed close on their heels, and suddenly appeared before Mediolanum. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.12">12</A> The Gauls at first did not stir, but, when he was on his way back to Acerrae, they sallied out, and made a bold attack on his rear, in which they killed a considerable number of the Romans and even forced a portion of them to take to flight, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.13">13</A> until Gnaeus, calling back the forces in advance, urged the fugitives to rally and withstand the enemy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.14">14</A> After this the Romans, on their part obeying their Consul, continued to fight vigorously with their assailants, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="34.15">15</A> and the Celts after holding their ground for a time, encouraged as they were by their momentary success, were shortly put to flight and took refuge on the mountains. Gnaeus, following them, laid waste the country and took Mediolanum itself by assault,

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.2">2</A> Such was the end of the war against the Celts, a war which, if we look to the desperation and daring of the combatants and the numbers who took part and perished in the battles, is second to no war in history, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.3">3</A> but is quite contemptible as regards the plan of the campaigns, and the judgement shown in executing it, not most steps but


<A ID="p329"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p329 </SPAN></A>every single step that the Gauls took being commended to them rather by the heat of passion than by cool calculation. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.4">4</A> As I have witnessed them not long afterwards entirely expelled from the plain of the Po, except a few regions close under the Alps, I did not think it right to make no mention either of their original invasion or of their subsequent conduct and their final expulsion; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.5">5</A> for I think it is the proper task of History to record and hand down to future generations such episodes of Fortune, that those who live after us may not, owing to entire ignorance of these incidents, be unduly terrified by sudden and unexpected invasions of barbarians, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.6">6</A> but that, having a fair comprehension of how short-lived and perishable is the might of such peoples, they may confront the invaders and put every hope of safety to the test, before yielding a jot of anything they value. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.7">7</A> For indeed I consider that the writers who chronicled and handed down to us the story of the Persian invasion of Greece and the attack of the Gauls on Delphi have made no small contribution to the struggle of the Hellenes for their common liberty. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.8">8</A> For there is no one whom hosts of men or abundance of arms or vast resources could frighten into abandoning his last hope, that is to fight to the end for his native land, if he kept before his eyes what part the unexpected played in those events, and bore in mind how many myriads of men, what determined courage and what armaments were brought to nought by the resolve and power of those who faced the danger with intelligence and coolness. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.9">9</A> It is not only in old times but more than once in my own days that the Greeks have been alarmed by the prospect of a Gaulish invasion; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="35.10">10</A> and this especially

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="36.1">1</A> This digression has led us away from the affairs of Spain, where Hasdrubal, after governing the country for eight years, was assassinated at night in his lodging by a certain Celt owing to wrongs of a private nature. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="36.2">2</A> He had largely increased the power of Carthage, not so much by military action as by friendly intercourse with the chiefs. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="36.3">3</A> The Carthaginians appointed Hannibal to the chief command in Spain, although he was still young, owing to the shrewdness and courage he had evinced in their service. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="36.4">4</A> From the moment that he assumed the command, it was evident from the measures he took that he intended to make war on Rome, as indeed he finished by doing, and that very shortly. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="36.5">5</A> The relations between Carthage and Rome were henceforth characterized by mutual suspicion and friction. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="36.6">6</A> The Carthaginians continued to form designs against Rome as they were eager to be revenged for their reverses in Sicily, while the Romans, detecting their projects, mistrusted them profoundly. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="36.7">7</A> It was therefore evident to all competent judges that it would not be long before war broke out between them.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.1">1</A> It was about this time that the Achaeans and King Philip with their allies began the war against the Aetolians known as the Social War. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.2">2</A> I have now given a continuous sketch, suitable to this preliminary plan of my book, of events in Sicily, Libya and so forth, down to the beginning of the Social War and that second war between the Romans and Carthaginians


<A ID="p333"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p333 </SPAN></A>usually known as the Hannibalic War. This, as I stated at the outset, is the date at which I purpose to begin my general history, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.3">3</A> and, now bidding good-bye for the present to the West, I must turn to the affairs of Greece, so that everywhere alike I may bring down this preliminary or introductory sketch to the same date, and, having done so, start on my detailed narrative. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.4">4</A> For as I am not, like former historians, dealing with the history of one nation, such as Greece or Persia, but have undertaken to describe the events occurring in all known parts of the world — my own times having, as I will more clearly explain elsewhere, materially contributed to my purpose — <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.5">5</A> I must, before entering on the main portion of my work, touch briefly on the state of principal and best known nations and countries of the world. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.6">6</A> As for Asia and Egypt, it will suffice to mention what took place there after the above date, since their previous history has been written by many and is familiar to all, besides which in our own times Fortune has wrought no such surprising change in these countries as to render any notice of their past necessary. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.7">7</A> But as regards the Achaean nation and the royal house of Macedon it will be proper to refer briefly to earlier events, since our times have seen, in the case of the latter, its complete destruction, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.8">8</A> and in the case of the Achaeans, as I said, a growth of power and a political union in the highest degree remarkable. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.9">9</A> For while many


<A ID="p335"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p335 </SPAN></A>have attempted in the past to induce the Peloponnesians to adopt a common policy, no one ever succeeding, as each was working not in the cause of general liberty, but for his own aggrandizement, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.10">10</A> this object has been so much advanced, and so nearly attained, in my own time that not only have they formed an allied and friendly community, but they have the same laws, weights, measures and coinage, as well as the same magistrates, senate, and courts of justice, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="37.11">11</A> and the whole Peloponnesus only falls short of being a single city in the fact of its inhabitants not being enclosed by one wall, all other things being, both as regards the whole and as regards each separate town, very nearly identical.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="38">38</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.1">1</A> In the first place it is of some service to learn how and by what means all the Peloponnesians came to be called Achaeans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.2">2</A> For the people whose original and ancestral name this was are distinguished neither by the extent of their territory, nor by the number of their cities, nor by exceptional wealth or the exceptional valour of their citizens. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.3">3</A> Both the Arcadian and Laconian nations far exceed them, indeed, in population and the size of their countries, and certainly neither of the two could ever bring themselves to yield to any Greek people the palm for military valour. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.4">4</A> How is it, then, that both these two peoples and the rest of the Peloponnesians have consented to change not only their political institutions for those of the Achaeans, but even their name? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.5">5</A> It is evident that we should not say it is the result of chance, for that is a poor explanation. We must rather seek for a cause, for every event whether probable or improbable must


<A ID="p337"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p337 </SPAN></A>have some cause. The cause here, I believe to be more or less the following. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.6">6</A> One could not find a political system and principle so favourable to equality and freedom of speech, in a word so sincerely democratic, as that of the Achaean league. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.7">7</A> Owing to this, while some of the Peloponnesians chose to join it of their own free will, it won many others by persuasion and argument, and those whom it forced to adhere to it when the occasion presented itself suddenly underwent a change and became quite reconciled to their position. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.8">8</A> For by reserving no special privileges for original members, and putting all new adherents exactly on the same footing, it soon attained the aim it had set itself, being aided by two very <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful coadjutors, equality and humanity. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.9">9</A> We must therefore look upon this as the initiator and cause of that union that has established the present prosperity of the Peloponnese.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.10">10</A> These characteristic principles and constitution had existed in Achaea from an early date. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="38.11">11</A> There is abundant testimony of this, but for the present it will suffice to cite one or two instances in confirmation of this assertion.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="39.11">11</A> Up to now, these principles of government had merely existed amongst them, but had resulted in no practical steps worthy of mention for the increase of the Achaean power, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="39.12">12</A> since the country seemed unable to produce a statesman worthy of those principles, anyone who showed a tendency to act so being thrown into the dark and hampered either by the Lacedaemonian power or still more by that of Macedon.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="40.1">1</A> When, however, in due time, they found statesmen capable of enforcing them, their power at once became manifest, and the League achieved the splendid result of uniting all the Peloponnesian states. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="40.2">2</A> Aratus of Sicyon should be regarded as the initiator and conceiver of the project; it was Philopoemen of Megalopolis who promoted and finally realized it, while Lycortas&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="

I think it will be easiest for myself to set forth the narrative and for my readers to follow it if I begin from the period when, after the dissolution of the Achaean League by the kings of Macedonia, the cities began again to approach each other with a view to its renewal. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="40.6">6</A> Henceforward the League continued to grow until

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.1">1</A> It was in the 124th Olympiad that Patrae and Dyme took the initiative, by entering into a league, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.2">2</A> just about the date of the deaths of Ptolemy son of Lagus, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy Ceraunus, which all occurred in this Olympiad. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.3">3</A> The condition of the Achaean nation before this date had been more or less as follows. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.4">4</A> Their first king was Tisamenus the son of Orestes, who, when expelled from Sparta on the return of the Heraclidae, occupied Achaea, and they continued to be ruled by kings of his house down to Ogygus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.5">5</A> Being dissatisfied with the rule of Ogygus' sons, which was despotical and not constitutional, they changed their government to a democracy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.6">6</A> After this, down to the reigns of Alexander and Philip, their fortunes varied according to circumstances, but they always endeavoured, as I said, to keep their League a democracy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.7">7</A> This consisted of twelve cities, which still all exist with the exception of Olenus and of Helice which was engulfed by the sea a little before the battle of Leuctra. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.8">8</A> These cities are Patrae, Dyme, Pharae, Tritaea, Leontium, Aegium, Aegira, Pellene, Bura, and Caryneia. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.9">9</A> After the time of Alexander and previous to the above Olympiad they fell, chiefly thanks to the kings of Macedon, into such a state of

(This was about the date of Pyrrhus' crossing to Italy.) <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.12">12</A> The first cities to do so were Dyme, Patrae, Tritaea, and Pharae, and for this reason we do not even find any formal inscribed record of their adherence to the League. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.13">13</A> About five years afterwards the people of Aegium expelled their garrison and joined the League, and the Burians were the next to do so, after putting their tyrant to death. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.14">14</A> Caryneia joined almost at the same time, for Iseas, its tyrant, when he saw the garrison expelled from Aegium, and the monarch of Bura killed by Margus and the Achaeans, and war just about to be made on himself by all the towns round, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="41.15">15</A> abdicated and, on receiving an assurance from the Achaeans that his life would be spared, added his city to the League.

<A ID="p347"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p347 </SPAN></A>be confirmed by the actual evidence of facts. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="42.3">3</A> What I asserted was that the Achaeans always followed one single policy, ever attracting others by the offer of their own equality and liberty and ever making war on and crushing those who either themselves or through the kings attempted to enslave their native cities, and that, in this manner and pursuing this purpose, they accomplished their task in part unaided and in part with the help of allies. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="42.4">4</A> For the Achaean political principle must be credited also with the results furthering their end, to which their allies in subsequent years contributed. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="42.5">5</A> Though they took so much part in the enterprises of others, and especially in many of those of the Romans which resulted brilliantly, they never showed the least desire to gain any private profit from their success, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="42.6">6</A> but demanded, in exchange for the zealous aid they rendered their allies, nothing beyond the liberty of all states and the union of the Peloponnesians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="42.7">7</A> This will be more clearly evident when we come to see the League in active operation.

<A ID="p349"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p349 </SPAN></A>after this, during his second term of office as Strategus, he laid a plot to rule the citadel of Corinth which was held by Antigonus, thus delivering the Peloponnesians from a great source of fear, and induced the city he had liberated to join the League.

	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="44">44</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="44.1">1</A> But, on the death of Antigonus, the Achaeans even made an alliance with the Aetolians and supported them ungrudgingly in the war against Demetrius, so that, for the time at least, their estrangement and hostility ceased, and a more or less friendly and sociable feeling sprang up between them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="44.2">2</A> Demetrius only reigned for ten years, his death taking place at the time the Romans first crossed to Illyria, and after this the tide of


<A ID="p351"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p351 </SPAN></A>events seemed to flow for a time in favour of the Achaeans' constant purpose; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="44.3">3</A> for the Peloponnesian tyrants were much cast down by the death of Demetrius, who had been, so to speak, their furnisher and paymaster, and equally so by the threatening attitude of Aratus, who demanded that they should depose themselves, offering abundance of gifts and honours to those who consented to do so, and menacing those who turned a deaf ear to him with still more abundant chastisement on the part of the Achaeans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="44.4">4</A> They therefore hurried to accede to his demand, laying down their tyrannies, setting their respective cities free, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="44.5">5</A> and joining the Achaean League. Lydiades of Megalopolis had even foreseen what was likely to happen, and with great wisdom and good sense had forestalled the death of Demetrius and of his own free will laid down his tyranny and adhered to the national government. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="44.6">6</A> Afterwards Aristomachus, tyrant of Argos, Xenon, tyrant of Hermione, and Cleonymus, tyrant of Phlius, also resigned and joined the democratic Achaean League.

	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="45">45</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="45.1">1</A> The League being thus materially increased in extent and power, the Aetolians, owing to that unprincipled passion for aggrandizement which is natural to them, either out of envy or rather in the hope of partitioning the cities, as they had partitioned those of Acarnania with Alexander and had previously proposed to do regarding Achaea with Antigonus Gonatas, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="45.2">2</A> went so far as to join hands with Antigonus Doson, then regent of Macedonia and guardian to Philip,


<A ID="p353"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p353 </SPAN></A>who was still a child, and Cleomenes, king of Sparta. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="45.3">3</A> They saw that Antigonus was undisputed master of Macedonia and at the same time the open and avowed enemy of the Achaeans owing to their seizure by treachery of the Acrocorinthus, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="45.4">4</A> and they supposed that if they could get the Lacedaemonians also to join them in their project, exciting first their animosity against the League, they could easily crush the Achaeans by attacking them at the proper time all at once and from all quarters. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="45.5">5</A> This indeed they would in all probability soon have done, but for the most important factor which they had <SPAN CLASS="whole">over&shy;looked</SPAN> in their plans. They never took into consideration that in this undertaking they would have Aratus as their opponent, a man capable of meeting any emergency. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="45.6">6</A> Consequently the result of their intrigues and unjust aggression was that not only did they entirely fail in their designs, but on the contrary consolidated the power of the League, and of Aratus who was then Strategus, as he most adroitly diverted and spoilt all their plans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="45.7">7</A> How he managed all this the following narrative will show.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="46">46</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.1">1</A> Aratus saw that the Aetolians were ashamed of openly declaring war on them, as it was so very recently that the Achaeans had helped them in their war against Demetrius, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.2">2</A> but that they were so much of one mind with the Lacedaemonians and so jealous of the Achaeans that when Cleomenes broke faith with them and possessed himself of Tegea, Mantinea, and Orchomenus, cities which were not only allies of the Aetolians, but at the time members of their league, they not only showed no resentment, but


<A ID="p355"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p355 </SPAN></A>actually set their seal to his occupation. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.3">3</A> He saw too that they, who on previous occasions, owing to their lust of aggrandizement, found any pretext adequate for making war on those who had done them no wrong, now allowed themselves to be treacherously attacked and to suffer the loss of some of their largest cities simply in order to see Cleomenes become a really formidable antagonist of the Achaeans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.4">4</A> Aratus, therefore, and all the leading men of the Achaean League decided not to take the initiative in going to war with anyone, but to resist Spartan aggression. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.5">5</A> This at least was their first resolve; but when shortly afterwards Cleomenes boldly began to fortify against them the so‑called Athenaeum in the territory of Megalopolis, and to show himself their avowed and bitter enemy, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.6">6</A> they called the Council of the League together and decided on open war with Sparta.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="46.7">7</A> This was the date at which the war known as the Cleomenic war began; and such was its origin.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="47">47</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.1">1</A> The Achaeans at first decided to face the Lacedaemonian <SPAN CLASS="whole">single-handed</SPAN>, considering it in the first place most honourable not to owe their safety to others but to protect their cities and country unaided, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.2">2</A> and also desiring to maintain their friendship with Ptolemy owing to the obligations they were under to him, and not to appear to him to be seeking aid elsewhere. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.3">3</A> But when the war had lasted for some time, and Cleomenes, having overthrown the ancient polity at Sparta and changed the constitutional


<A ID="p357"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p357 </SPAN></A>kingship into a tyranny, showed great energy and daring in the conduct of the campaign, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.4">4</A> Aratus, foreseeing what was likely to happen and dreading the reckless audacity of the Aetolians, determined to be beforehand with them and spoil their plans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.5">5</A> He perceived that Antigonus was a man of energy and sound sense, and that he claimed to be a man of honour, but he knew that kings do not regard anyone as their natural foe or friend, but measure friendship and enmity by the sole standard of expediency. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.6">6</A> He therefore decided to approach that monarch and put himself on confidential terms with him, pointing out to him to what the present course of affairs would probably lead. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.7">7</A> Now for several reasons he did not think it expedient to do this overtly. In the first place he would thus expect himself to being outbidden in his project by Cleomenes and the Aetolians, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.8">8</A> and next he would damage the spirit of the Achaean troops by thus appealing to an enemy and appearing to have entirely abandoned the hopes he had placed in them — this being the very last thing he wished them to think. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.9">9</A> Therefore, having formed his plan, he decided to carry it out by covert means. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.10">10</A> He was consequently compelled in public both to do and to say many things quite contrary to his real intention, so as to keep his design concealed by creating the exactly opposite impression. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="47.11">11</A> For this reason there are some such matters that he does not even refer to in his Memoirs.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="48">48</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.1">1</A> He knew that the people of Megalopolis were suffering severely from the war, as owing to their being on the Lacedaemonian border, they had to bear the full brunt of it, and could not receive proper


<A ID="p359"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p359 </SPAN></A>assistance from the Achaeans, as the latter were themselves in difficulties and distress. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.2">2</A> As he also knew for a surety that they were well disposed to the royal house of Macedon ever since the favours received in the time of Philip, son of Amyntas, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.3">3</A> he felt sure that, hard pressed as they were by Cleomenes, they would be very ready to take refuge in Antigonus and hopes of safety from Macedonia. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.4">4</A> He therefore communicated his project confidentially to Nicophanes and Cercidas of Megalopolis who were family friends of his own and well suited for the business, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.5">5</A> and he had no difficulty through them in inciting the Megalopolitans to send an embassy to the Achaeans begging them to appeal to Antigonus for help. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.6">6</A> Nicophanes and Cercidas themselves were appointed envoys by the Megalopolitans, in the first place to the Achaeans and next, if the League consented, with orders to proceed at once to Antigonus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.7">7</A> The Achaeans agreed to allow the Megalopolitans to send an embassy; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="48.8">8</A> and with the other ambassadors hastened to meet the king. They said no more than was strictly necessary on the subject of their own city, treating this matter briefly and summarily, but dwelt at length on the general situation, in the sense that Aratus had directed and prompted.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="49">49</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.1">1</A> He had charged them to point out the importance and the probable consequences of the common action of the Aetolians and Cleomenes, representing that in the first place the Achaeans were imperilled by it and next <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.2">2</A> and in a larger measure Antigonus himself. For it was perfectly evident to all that the Achaeans could not hold out against both adversaries, and it was still more easy for any person of intelligence to see that, if the Aetolians and Cleomenes were <SPAN CLASS="whole">success</SPAN>&shy;ful, they


<A ID="p361"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p361 </SPAN></A>would surely not rest content and be satisfied with their advantage. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.3">3</A> The Aetolian schemes of territorial aggrandizement would never stop short of the boundaries of the Peloponnese or even those of Greece itself, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.4">4</A> while Cleomenes' personal ambition, and <SPAN CLASS="whole">far-reaching</SPAN> projects, though for the present he aimed only at supremacy in the Peloponnese, would, on his attaining this, at once develop into a claim to be <SPAN CLASS="whole">over-lord</SPAN> of all Hellas, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.5">5</A> a thing impossible without his first putting an end to the dominion of Macedon. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.6">6</A> They implored him then to look to the future and consider which was most in his interest, to fight in the Peloponnese against Cleomenes for the supremacy of Greece with the support of the Achaeans and Boeotians, or to abandon the greatest of the Greek nations to its fate and then do battle in Thessaly for the throne of Macedonia with the Aetolians, Boeotians, Achaeans, and Spartans all at once. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.7">7</A> Should the Aetolians, still pretending to have scruples owing to the benefits received from the Achaeans in their war with Demetrius, continue their present inaction, the Achaeans alone, they said, would fight against Cleomenes, and, if Fortune favoured them, would require no help; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.8">8</A> but should they meet with <SPAN CLASS="whole">ill-success</SPAN> and be attacked by the Aetolians also, they entreated him to take good heed and not let the opportunity slip, but come to the aid of the Peloponnesians while it was still possible to save them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.9">9</A> As for conditions of alliance and the return they could offer him for his support, they said he need not concern himself, for once the service they demanded was being actually rendered, they promised him that Aratus would find terms satisfactory to both parties. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="49.10">10</A> Aratus himself, they said, would also indicate the date at which they required his aid.

	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="50">50</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.1">1</A> Antigonus, having listened to them, felt convinced that Aratus took a true and practical view of the situation, and carefully considered the next steps to be taken, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.2">2</A> promising the Megalopolitans by letter to come to their assistance if such was the wish of the Achaeans too. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.3">3</A> Upon Nicophanes and Cercidas returning home and delivering the king's letter, assuring at the same time their people of his good-will towards them and readiness to be of service, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.4">4</A> the Megalopolitans were much elated and most ready to go to the Council of the League and beg them to invite the aid of Antigonus and at once put the direction of affairs in his hands. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.5">5</A> Aratus had private information from Nicophanes of the king's favourable inclination towards the League and himself, and was much gratified to find that his project had not been futile, and that he had not, as the Aetolians had hoped, found Antigonus entirely alienated from him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.6">6</A> He considered it a great advantage that the Megalopolitans had readily consented to approach Antigonus through the Achaeans; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.7">7</A> for, as I said above, what he chiefly desired was not to be in need of asking for help also, but if it became necessary to resort to this, he wished the appeal to come not only from himself personally, but from the League as a whole. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.8">8</A> For he was afraid that if the king appeared on the scene and, after conquering Cleomenes and the Lacedaemonians, took any measures the reverse of welcome regarding the League, he himself would be universally blamed for what happened, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.9">9</A> as the king would seem to have justice on his side owing to Aratus' offence against the house of Macedon in


<A ID="p365"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p365 </SPAN></A>the case of the Acrocorinthus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.10">10</A> Therefore, when the Megalopolitans appeared before the General Council of the League, and showing the king's letter, assured them of his general friendly sentiments, at the same time begging the Achaeans to ask for his intervention at once, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="50.11">11</A> and when Aratus saw that this was the inclination of the Achaeans also, he rose, and after expressing his gratification at the king's readiness to assist them and his approval of the attitude of the meeting, he addressed them at some length, begging them if possible to attempt to save their cities and country by their own efforts, that being the most honourable and advantageous course, but, should adverse fortune prevent this, then, but only when they had no hope left in their own resources, he advised them to resort to an appeal to their friends for aid.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="51">51</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="51.1">1</A> The people applauded his speech, and a decree was passed to leave things as they were for the present and conduct the war unaided. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="51.2">2</A> But a series of disasters overtook them. In the first place Ptolemy threw over the League and began to give financial support to Cleomenes with a view of setting him on to attack Antigonus, as he hoped to be able to keep in check more effectually the projects of the Macedonian kings with the support of the Lacedaemonians than with that of the Achaeans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="51.3">3</A> Next the Achaeans were worsted by Cleomenes while on the march near the Lycaeum and again in a pitched battle at a place in the territory of Megalopolis called Ladoceia, Lydiades falling here, and finally their whole force met with utter defeat at the Hecatombaeum in the territory of Dyme. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="51.4">4</A> Circumstances now no longer permitting delay, they were compelled by their position to


<A ID="p367"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p367 </SPAN></A>appeal with one voice to Antigonus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="51.5">5</A> Aratus on this occasion sent his son as envoy to the king and ratified the terms of the alliance. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="51.6">6</A> They were, however, in considerable doubt and difficulty about the Acrocorinthus, as they did not think Antigonus would come to their assistance unless it were restored to him, so that he could use Corinth as a base for the present war, nor could they go to the length of handing over the Corinthians against their will to Macedon. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="51.7">7</A> This even caused at first an adjournment of the Council for the consideration of the guarantees they offered.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="52">52</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="52.1">1</A> Cleomenes, having inspired terror by the victories I mentioned, henceforth made an unimpeded progress through the cities, gaining some by persuasion and others by threats. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="52.2">2</A> He annexed in this manner Caphyae, Pellene, Pheneus, Argos, Phlius, Cleonae, Epidaurus, Hermione, Troezen, and finally Corinth. He now sat down in front of Sicyon, but he had solved the chief difficulty of the Achaeans; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="52.3">3</A> for the Corinthians by ordering Aratus, who was then Strategus, and the Achaeans to quit Corinth, and by sending to invite Cleomenes, furnished the Achaeans with good and reasonable ground for offering to Antigonus the Acrocorinthus then held by them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="52.4">4</A> Availing himself of this, Aratus not only atoned for his former offence to the royal house, but gave sufficient guarantee of future loyalty, further providing Antigonus with a base for the war against the Lacedaemonians.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.1">1</A> Since, among those authors who were contemporaries of Aratus, Phylarchus, who on many points is at variance and in contradiction with him, is by some received as trustworthy, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.2">2</A> it will be useful or rather necessary for me, as I have chosen to rely on Aratus' narrative for the history of the Cleomenic


<A ID="p377"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p377 </SPAN></A>war, not to leave the question of their relative credibility undiscussed, so that truth and falsehood in their writings may no longer be of equal authority. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.3">3</A> In general Phylarchus through his whole work makes many random and careless statements; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.4">4</A> but while perhaps it is not necessary for me at present to criticize in detail the rest of these, I must minutely examine such as relate to events occurring in the period with which I am now dealing, that of the Cleomenic war. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.5">5</A> This partial examination will however be quite sufficient to convey an idea of the general purpose and character of his work. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.6">6</A> Wishing, for instance, to insist on the cruelty of Antigonus and the Macedonians and also on that of Aratus and the Achaeans, he tells us that the Mantineans, when they surrendered, were exposed to terrible sufferings and that such were the misfortunes that overtook this, the most ancient and greatest city in Arcadia, as to impress deeply and move to tears all the Greeks. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.7">7</A> In his eagerness to arouse the pity and attention of his readers he treats us to a picture of clinging women&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="

<A ID="p379"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p379 </SPAN></A>poet, try to imagine the probable utterances of his characters or reckon up all the consequences probably incidental to the occurrences with which he deals, but simply record what really happened and what really was said, however commonplace. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.11">11</A> For the object of tragedy is not the same as that of history but quite the opposite. The tragic poet should thrill and charm his audience for the moment by the verisimilitude of the words he puts into his characters' mouths, but it is the task of the historian to instruct and convince for all time serious students by the truth of the facts and the speeches he narrates, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.12">12</A> since in the one case it is the probable that takes precedence, even if it be untrue, in the other it is the truth, the purpose being to confer benefit on learners. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.13">13</A> Apart from this, Phylarchus simply narrates most of such catastrophes and does not even suggest their causes or the nature of these causes, without which it is impossible in any case to feel either legitimate pity or proper anger. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.14">14</A> Who, for instance, does not think it an outrage for a free man to be beaten? but if this happen to one who was the first to resort to violence, we consider that he got only his desert, while where it is done for the purpose of correction or discipline, those who strike free men are not only excused but deemed worthy of thanks and praise. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="56.15">15</A> Again, to kill a citizen is considered the greatest of crimes and that deserving the highest penalty, but obviously he who kills a thief or adulterer is left untouched, and the slayer of a traitor or tyrant everywhere meets with honour and distinction.&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.1">1</A> Now the Mantineans had, in the first instance, deserted the Achaean League, and of their own free will put themselves and their city into the hands first of the Aetolians and then of Cleomenes. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.2">2</A> They had deliberately ranged themselves on his side and been admitted to Spartan <SPAN CLASS="whole">citizen</SPAN>&shy;ship, when, four years before the invasion of Antigonus, their city was betrayed to Aratus and forcibly occupied by the Achaeans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.3">3</A> On this occasion, so far from their being cruelly treated owing to their recent delinquency, the circumstances became celebrated because of the sudden revulsion of sentiments on both sides. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.4">4</A> For immediately Aratus had the city in his hands, he at once issued orders to his troops to keep their hands off the property of others, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.5">5</A> and next, calling an assembly of the Mantineans, bade them be of good courage and retain possession of all they had; for if they joined the Achaean League he would assure their perfect security. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.6">6</A> The prospect of safety thus suddenly revealed to them took the Mantineans completely by surprise, and there was an instantaneous and universal reversal of feeling. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.7">7</A> The very men at whose hands they had seen, in the fight that had just closed, many of their kinsmen slain and many grievously wounded, were now taken into their houses, and received into their families with whom they lived on the kindest possible terms. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="57.8">8</A> This was quite natural, for I never heard of any men meeting with kinder enemies or being less injured by what is considered the greatest of


<A ID="p383"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p383 </SPAN></A>calamities than the Mantineans, all owing to their humane treatment by Aratus and the Achaeans.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="58">58</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.1">1</A> Subsequently, as they foresaw discord among themselves and plots by the Aetolians and Lacedaemonians, they sent an embassy to the Achaeans asking for a garrison. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.2">2</A> The Achaeans consented and chose by lot three hundred of their own citizens, who set forth, abandoning their own houses and possessions, and remained in Mantinea to watch over the liberty and safety of its townsmen. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.3">3</A> At the same time they sent two hundred hired soldiers, who aided this Achaean force in safeguarding the established government. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.4">4</A> Very soon however the Mantineans fell out with the Achaeans, and, inviting the Lacedaemonians, put the city into their hands and massacred the garrison the Achaeans had sent them. It is not easy to name any greater or more atrocious act of treachery than this. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.5">5</A> For in resolving to foreswear their friendship and gratitude, they should at least have spared the lives of these men and allowed them all to depart under terms. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.6">6</A> Such treatment is, by the common law of nations, accorded even to enemies; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.7">7</A> but the Mantineans, simply in order to give Cleomenes and the Lacedaemonians a satisfactory guarantee of their good faith in this undertaking violated the law recognized by all mankind and deliberately committed the most heinous of crimes. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.8">8</A> Vengeful murderers of the very men who previously on capturing their city had left them unharmed, and who now were guarding their liberties and lives — against such men, one asks oneself, can any indignation be too strong? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.9">9</A> What should we consider to be an adequate punishment for them? Someone might


<A ID="p385"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p385 </SPAN></A>perhaps say that now when they were crushed by armed force they should have been sold into slavery with their wives and children. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.10">10</A> But to this fate the usage of war exposes those who have been guilty of no such impious crime. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.11">11</A> These men therefore were worthy of some far heavier and more extreme penalty; so that had they suffered what Phylarchus alleges, it was not to be expected that they should have met with pity from the Greeks, but rather that approval and assent should have been accorded to those who executed judgement on them for their wickedness. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.12">12</A> Yet, while nothing more serious befel the Mantineans, in this their hour of calamity, than the pillage of their property and the enslavement of the male citizens, Phylarchus, all for the sake of making his narrative sensational, composed a tissue not only of falsehoods, but of improbable falsehoods, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.13">13</A> and, owing to his gross ignorance, was not even able to compare an analogous case and explain how the same people at the same time, on taking Tegea by force, did not commit any such excesses. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.14">14</A> For if the cause lay in the barbarity of the perpetrators, the Tegeans should have met with the same treatment as those who were conquered at the same time. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="58.15">15</A> If only the Mantineans were thus exceptionally treated, we must evidently infer that there was some exceptional cause for anger against them.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.1">1</A> Again he tells us that Aristomachus of Argos, a man of most noble birth, having himself been tyrant of Argos and being descended from tyrants, was led away captive to Cenchreae and there racked to death, no man deserving less such a terrible fate. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.2">2</A> Exercising in this case too his peculiar talent, the


<A ID="p387"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p387 </SPAN></A>author gives us a made-up story of his cries when on the rack having reached the ears of the neighbours, some of whom, horrified at the crime, others scarcely crediting their senses and others in hot indignation ran to the house. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.3">3</A> About Phylarchus' vice of sensationalism I need say no more, for I have given sufficient evidence of it; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.4">4</A> but as for Aristomachus, even if he had been guilty of no other offence to the Achaeans, I consider that the general tenor of his life and his treason to his own country rendered him worthy of the most severe punishment. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.5">5</A> Our author, it is true, with the view of magnifying his importance and moving his readers to share his own indignation at his fate, tells us that he "not only had been a tyrant himself but was descended from tyrants." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.6">6</A> It would be difficult for anyone to bring a graver or more bitter accusation against a man. Why! the very word "tyrant" alone conveys to us the height of impiety and comprises in itself the sum of all human defiance of law and justice. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.7">7</A> Aristomachus, if it is true that he was subjected to the most terrible punishment, as Phylarchus tells us, did not get his full deserts for the doings on one day; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.8">8</A> I mean the day on which when Aratus with the Achaeans had gained entrance to the town and fought hard to free the Argives at great risk, but was finally driven out, because none of those inside the city who had agreed to join him ventured to stir <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.9">9</A> owing to their fear of the tyrant, Aristomachus, availing himself of the pretext that certain persons were cognisant of the entrance of the Achaeans, put to death eighty of the leading citizens who were quite innocent, after torturing them before the eyes of their relatives. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="59.10">10</A> I say nothing of the crimes that he and his ancestors were


<A ID="p389"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p389 </SPAN></A>guilty of all through their lives: it would be too long a story.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="60">60</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.1">1</A> We must not therefore think it shocking if he met with treatment similar to what he had inflicted: it would have been much more so had he died in peace, without experiencing any such. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.2">2</A> Nor should we charge Antigonus and Aratus with criminal conduct, if having captured him in war they had tortured and put to death a tyrant, any man who killed and punished whom even in the time of peace would have been applauded and honoured by all <SPAN CLASS="whole">right-thinking</SPAN> people. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.3">3</A> When I add that in addition to all his other offences he broke his faith with the Achaeans, what fate shall we say was too bad for him? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.4">4</A> Not many years previously he had laid down his tyranny, finding himself in an embarrassed position owing to the death of Demetrius, and quite contrary to his expectation suffered no harm, being protected by the Achaeans, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.5">5</A> who showed themselves most lenient and generous; for not only did they inflict no punishment on him for the crimes he had committed during his tyranny, but receiving him with the highest dignity, making him their Strategus and <SPAN CLASS="whole">Commander-in‑chief</SPAN>. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.6">6</A> But instantly dismissing from his mind all these benefits, the moment it seemed to him that his prospects would be somewhat more brilliant if he sided with Cleomenes, he broke away from the Achaeans, transferring from them to the enemy at a most critical time his personal support and that of his country. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.7">7</A> Surely when they got him into their hands, he should not have been racked to death at night in Cenchreae, as Phylarchus says, but should have been led round the whole Peloponnesus and tortured as a spectacle for the public until dead.


<A ID="p391"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p391 </SPAN></A><A CLASS="sec" NAME="60.8">8</A> Yet notwithstanding his abominable character, all the harm he suffered was to be drowned in the sea by the officers in command at Cenchreae.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="61">61</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.1">1</A> To take another instance, Phylarchus, while narrating with exaggeration and elaboration the calamities of the Mantineans, evidently deeming it a historian's duty to lay stress on criminal acts, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.2">2</A> does not even make mention of the noble conduct of the Megalopolitans at nearly the same date, as if it were rather the proper function of history to chronicle the commission of sins than to call attention to right and honourable actions, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.3">3</A> or as if readers of his memoirs would be improved less by account of good conduct which we should emulate than by criminal conduct which we should shun. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.4">4</A> He tells us how Cleomenes took the city, and before doing any damage to it, sent at once a post to the Megalopolitans at Messene offering to hand back their own native country to them uninjured on condition of their throwing in their lot with him. So much he lets us know, wishing to show the magnanimity of Cleomenes and his moderation to his enemies, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.5">5</A> and he goes on to tell how when the letter was being read out they would not allow the reader to continue until the end, and how they came very near stoning the <SPAN CLASS="whole">letter-bearers</SPAN>. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.6">6</A> So far he makes everything quite clear to us, but he deprives us of what should follow and what is the special virtue of history, I mean praise and honourable mention of conduct noteworthy for its excellence. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.7">7</A> And yet he had an opportunity ready to his hand here. For if we consider those men to be good who by speeches and resolutions only expose themselves to war for the sake of their friends and allies, and if we bestow not only praise but lavish thanks and


<A ID="p393"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p393 </SPAN></A>gifts on those who have suffered their country to be laid waste and their city besieged, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.8">8</A> what should we feel for the Megalopolitans? Surely the deepest reverence and the highest regard. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.9">9</A> In the first place they left their lands at the mercy of Cleomenes, next they utterly lost their city owing to their support of the Achaeans, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.10">10</A> and finally, when quite unexpectedly it was put in their power to get it back undamaged, they preferred to lose their land, their tombs, their temples, their homes, and their possessions, all in fact that is dearest to men, rather than break faith with their allies. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.11">11</A> What more noble conduct has there ever been or could there be? To what could an author with more advantage call the attention of his readers, and how could he better stimulate them to loyalty to their engagements and to true and faithful <SPAN CLASS="whole">comrade</SPAN>&shy;ship? <A CLASS="sec" NAME="61.12">12</A> But Phylarchus, blind, as it seems to me, to the most noble actions and those most worthy of an author's attention, has not said a single word on the subject.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="62">62</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.1">1</A> Further he tells us that from the booty of Megalopolis six thousand talents fell to the Lacedaemonians, of which two thousand were given to Cleomenes according to usage. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.2">2</A> Now in this statement one marvels first at his lack of practical experience and of that general notion of the wealth and power of Greece so essential to a historian. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.3">3</A> For, not speaking of those times, when the Peloponnese had been utterly ruined by the Macedonian kings and still more by continued intestinal wars, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.4">4</A> but in our own times, when all are in complete


<A ID="p395"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p395 </SPAN></A>unison and enjoy, it is thought, very great prosperity, I assert that a sale of all the goods and chattels, apart from slaves, in the whole Peloponnese would not bring in such a sum. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.5">5</A> That I do not make this assertion lightly but after due estimate will be evident from the following consideration. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.6">6</A> Who has not read that when the Athenians, in conjunction with the Thebans, entered on the war against the Lacedaemonians, sending out a force of ten thousand men and manning a hundred triremes, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.7">7</A> they decided to meet the war expenses by a <SPAN CLASS="whole">property-tax</SPAN> and made a valuation for this purpose of the whole of Attica including the houses and other property. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.8">8</A> This estimate, however, fell short of 6000 talents by 250, from which it would seem that my assertion about the Peloponnese at the present day is not far wide of the mark. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.9">9</A> But as regards the times of which we are dealing, no one, even if he were exaggerating, would venture to say that more than three hundred talents could be got out of Megalopolis, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.10">10</A> since it is an acknowledged fact that most of the free population and the slaves had escaped to Messene. But the best proof of what I have to say is the following: <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.11">11</A> Mantinea, both in wealth and power, was second to no city in Arcadia, as Phylarchus himself says, and it surrendered after a siege, so that it was not easy for anyone to escape or for anything to be stolen, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="62.12">12</A> but yet the value of the whole booty together with slaves amounted at this very period to but three hundred talents.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="63">63</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.1">1</A> What he tells us next is still more astounding; after this assertion about the booty, he


<A ID="p397"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p397 </SPAN></A>states that just ten days before the battle an envoy from Ptolemy reached Cleomenes informing him that that king withdrew his subvention and requested him to come to terms with Antigonus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.2">2</A> He says that Cleomenes on hearing this resolved to stake his all on a battle before it reached the ears of his troops, as he had no hope of being able to meet their pay from his own resources. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.3">3</A> But if at this very time he had six thousand talents at his command, he could have been more generous than Ptolemy himself in the matter of subventions; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.4">4</A> and if he could only dispose of three hundred talents it was enough to enable him to continue the war against Antigonus with absolute financial security. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.5">5</A> But to state in one breath that Cleomenes depended entirely on Ptolemy for money and that at the very same time he was in possession of such a large sum, is a sign of the greatest levity and want of reflection. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="63.6">6</A> Phylarchus has made many similar statements not only about this period but all through his work. I think, however, that what I have said at such length as the plan of this history allows should suffice.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="64">64</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="64.1">1</A> After the capture of Megalopolis, while Antigonus was still in winter quarters at Argos, Cleomenes at the beginning of spring collected his troops, and after addressing them in terms suitable to the occasion, led them out and invaded Argolis. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="64.2">2</A> Most people think that this was rash and hazardous on his part, owing to the strength of the frontier, but if we judge rightly it was really a safe and wise course. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="64.3">3</A> For as he saw that Antigonus had dismissed


<A ID="p399"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p399 </SPAN></A>his forces, he knew well that, in the first place, he would be exposed to no danger in invading, and secondly, that, if the country were laid waste up to the walls, the Argives on seeing it would certainly be much vexed and lay the blame on Antigonus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="64.4">4</A> If, therefore, unable to support the reproaches of the people, he marched out and risked a battle with such forces as he had, the probabilities were in favour of Cleomenes gaining an easy victory; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="64.5">5</A> but if, adhering to his plan, he remained quiet, he thought he could, after terrifying his enemies and inspiring his own troops with fresh courage, effect a safe retreat to Laconia, as actually happened. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="64.6">6</A> For, when the country was being laid waste, the populace held meetings in which they heaped abuse on Antigonus; but he, like a true general and prince, paid no attention to anything but a wise conduct of affairs, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="64.7">7</A> and remained quiet, while Cleomenes, having carried out his intention of devastating the country and thus striking terror into the enemy and encouraging his own troops to face the coming danger, retired in safety to his own country.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="65.1">1</A> Early in summer, on the Macedonians and Achaeans rejoining from their winter quarters, Antigonus advanced with his own army and the allies into Laconia. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="65.2">2</A> His Macedonian forces consisted of ten thousand to form the phalanx, three thousand peltasts, and three hundred horse. He had besides a thousand Agrianians, and a thousand Gauls, while his mercenary force numbered three thousand foot and three hundred horse. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="65.3">3</A> The Achaeans furnished three thousand picked infantry and three hundred horse.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.1">1</A> Antigonus therefore decided to make no hasty attempt to force the position and come to blows with the enemy, but encamped at a short distance with the river Gorgylus on his front, and for several days remained there noting the peculiar features of the country and the character of the forces, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.2">2</A> while at the same time, by threatening certain movements, he attempted to make the enemy show his hand. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.3">3</A> But being unable to find any weak or unprotected spot, since Cleomenes always checked him at once by a <SPAN CLASS="whole">counter-movement</SPAN>, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.4">4</A> he abandoned this project, and finally the kings agreed to try issues in a battle: for they were very gifted and <SPAN CLASS="whole">evenly-matched</SPAN>, these two generals whom Fortune had brought face to face. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.5">5</A> To confront those on Euas Antigonus drew up the <SPAN CLASS="whole">brazen-shielded</SPAN> Macedonians and the Illyrians in alternate lines, placing them under the command of Alexander son of Acmetus, and Demetrius of Pharos. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.6">6</A> Behind these stood the Acarnanians and Cretans, and in the rear as a reserve were two thousand Achaeans. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.7">7</A> His cavalry he opposed to that of the enemy by the river Oenous under the command of Alexander and supported by a thousand Achaean and as many Megalopolitan infantry. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.8">8</A> He himself in person decided to attack Cleomenes on Olympus with the mercenaries and the rest of the Macedonians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.9">9</A> Putting


<A ID="p405"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p405 </SPAN></A>the mercenaries in front, he drew up the Macedonians behind them in two phalanxes with no interval between, the narrowness of the space rendering this necessary. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.10">10</A> It was arranged that the Illyrians were to begin their assault on the hill upon seeing a flag of linen waved from the neighbourhood of Olympus, for in the night they had succeeded in taking up a position close under the hill in the bed of the river Gorgylus. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="66.11">11</A> The signal for the Megalopolitans and cavalry was to be a scarlet flag waved by the king.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="67">67</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.1">1</A> When the time to begin the action came, the signal was given to the Illyrians, and, the officers calling on their men to do their duty, they all instantly showed themselves and began the attack on the hill. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.2">2</A> The <SPAN CLASS="whole">light-armed</SPAN> mercenaries, who had been posted near Cleomenes' cavalry, upon seeing that the rear of the Achaean line was exposed, attacked them from behind, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.3">3</A> and the whole force that was pressing on to the hill was thus threatened with a serious disaster, as Eucleidas' troops were facing them from above while the mercenaries were vigorously attacking their rear. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.4">4</A> At this critical moment Philopoemen of Megalopolis, who saw what was happening and foresaw what was likely to happen, first attempted to call the attention of the commanding officers to it, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.5">5</A> but as no one paid any attention to him, since he had never held any command and was quite a young man, he called on his own <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-citizens</SPAN> to follow him and boldly fell upon the enemy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.6">6</A> Upon this the mercenaries who were attacking the assailants of the hill in the rear, hearing the clamour and seeing the


<A ID="p407"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p407 </SPAN></A>cavalry engaged, abandoned what they had in hand and running back to their original position came to the aid of their cavalry. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.7">7</A> The Illyrians and Macedonians and the rest of this attacking force were now disengaged, and threw themselves with great dash and courage on the enemy. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="67.8">8</A> Thus, as became evident afterwards, the success of the attack on Eucleidas was due to Philopoemen.
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="68">68</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.1">1</A> Hence it is said that subsequently Antigonus asked Alexander, the commander of the cavalry, to convict him of his shortcomings, why he had begun the battle before the signal was given. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.2">2</A> On Alexander denying this and saying that a stripling from Megalopolis had begun it contrary to his own judgement, the king said that this stripling in grasping the situation had acted like a good general and Alexander himself, the general, like an ordinary stripling.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.3">3</A> To continue our narrative, Eucleidas' troops, on seeing the enemy's lines advancing, cast away the advantage the ground gave him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.4">4</A> They should have charged the enemy while still at a distance, thus breaking his ranks and throwing them into disorder, and then retreating slowly, have returned in safety to the higher ground. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.5">5</A> Thus having in the first instance spoilt and broken up that peculiar serried formation of the enemy so well adapted to their special equipment, they would easily have put them to flight owing to their favourable position. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.6">6</A> Instead of doing this, they acted as if the victory were already in their hand and did exactly the opposite. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.7">7</A> They remained, that is, at the summit in their original position with the view of getting their opponents as high up the hill as possible so that the enemy's flight would be for a long distance down the steep and precipitous


<A ID="p409"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p409 </SPAN></A>slope. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.8">8</A> As might have been expected, the result was just the reverse. They had left themselves no means of retreat and on being charged by the Macedonian cohorts which were still fresh and in good order, they were so hard put to it that they had to fight with the assailants for the possession of the extreme summit. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.9">9</A> From now onwards, wherever they were forced back by the weight of their adversaries' weapons and formation, the Illyrians at once occupied the place where they had stood, while each backward step Eucleidas' men took was on to lower ground, since they had not left themselves any room for orderly retreat or change of formation. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="68.10">10</A> The consequence was that very soon they had to turn and take to a flight which proved disastrous, as, for a long distance, it was over difficult and precipitous ground.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="69">69</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.1">1</A> At this same time the cavalry action was going on, all the Achaean horsemen, and especially Philopoemen, rendering most distinguished service, as the whole struggle was for their liberty. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.2">2</A> Philopoemen's horse fell mortally wounded, and he, fighting on foot, received a serious wound through both thighs. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.3">3</A> Meanwhile the two kings at Olympus opened the battle with their <SPAN CLASS="whole">light-armed</SPAN> troops and mercenaries, of which each had about five thousand. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.4">4</A> These, now attacking each other in detachments and now along the whole line, exhibited the greatest gallantry on both sides, all the more so as they were fighting under the eyes of the kings and the armies. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.5">5</A> Man therefore vied with man and regiment with regiment in a display of courage. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.6">6</A> Cleomenes, seeing his brother's troops in flight and the cavalry on the


<A ID="p411"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p411 </SPAN></A>level ground on the point of giving way, was afraid of being charged from all sides and was compelled to pull down part of his defences and to lead out his whole force in line from one side of the camp. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.7">7</A> Each side now recalled by bugle their <SPAN CLASS="whole">light-armed</SPAN> troops from the space between them, and shouting their war-cry and lowering their lances, the two phalanxes met. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.8">8</A> A stubborn struggle followed. At one time the Macedonians gradually fell back facing the enemy, giving way for a long distance before the courage of the Lacedaemonians, at another the latter were pushed from their ground by the weight of the Macedonian phalanx, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.9">9</A> until, on Antigonus ordering the Macedonians to close up in the peculiar formation of the double phalanx with its serried line of pikes, they delivered a charge which finally forced the Lacedaemonians from their stronghold. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.10">10</A> The whole Spartan army now fled in rout, followed and cut down by the enemy; but Cleomenes with a few horsemen reached Sparta in safety. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="69.11">11</A> At nightfall he went down to Gythion, where all had been prepared some time previously for the voyage in view of contingencies, and set sail with his friends for Alexandria.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="70">70</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.1">1</A> Antigonus having attacked and taken Sparta, treated the Lacedaemonians in all respects with great generosity and humanity, and, after restoring the ancient form of government, left the city in a few days with his whole army, as he had received news that the Illyrians had invaded Macedonia and were ravaging the country. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.2">2</A> Thus ever is it the way of Fortune to decide the most weighty issues against rule and reason. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.3">3</A> For on this occasion Cleomenes,


<A ID="p413"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p413 </SPAN></A>had he deferred giving battle for merely a few days, or had he, on returning to Sparta after the battle, waited ever so short a time to avail himself of the turn of events, would have saved his crown.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.4">4</A> Antigonus however, on reaching Tegea, restored the old form of government there also, and two days later arrived at Argos just in time for the Nemean festival, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.5">5</A> at which the Achaean League and each several city heaped on him every honour they could think of to immortalize his memory. He then hastily left for Macedonia, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.6">6</A> where he found the Illyrians. Engaging them in a pitched battle, he was victorious, but in the course of the fight he strained himself so much by shouting to his troops to cheer them on that from a rupture of a <SPAN CLASS="whole">blood-vessel</SPAN> or some such accident he fell sick and died shortly afterwards. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.7">7</A> He had aroused high hopes of himself throughout Greece, not so much by his support in the field as by his general high principles and excellence. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="70.8">8</A> He was succeeded on the throne of Macedon by Philip son of Demetrius.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="71">71</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.1">1</A> Now to explain why I have dealt with this at such length. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.2">2</A> As this period immediately precedes those times, the history of which I am about to write, I thought it would be of service, or rather that the original plan of this work made it necessary for me, to make clearly known to everyone the state of affairs in Macedonia and Greece at this time. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.3">3</A> Just about the same time Ptolemy Euergetes fell sick and died, being succeeded by Ptolemy surnamed Philopator. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.4">4</A> Seleucus, the son of the Seleucus surnamed Callinicus or Pogon, also died at this


<A ID="p415"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p415 </SPAN></A>time, his brother Antiochus succeeding him in the kingdom of Syria. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.5">5</A> The same thing in fact occurred in the case of these three kings, as in that of the first successors of Alexander in the three kingdoms, Seleucus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.6">6</A> who all, as I stated above, died in the 124th Olympiad, while these kings died in the 139th.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.7">7</A> I have thus completed this Introduction or preliminary part of my History. In it I have shown in the first place when, how, and why the Romans, having mastered Italy, first entered on enterprises outside that land and disputed the command of the sea with the Carthaginians, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.8">8</A> and next I have dealt with the state of Greece and Macedonia and with that of Carthage as this existed then. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.9">9</A> So having, as was my original purpose, reached the date at which the Greeks were on the eve of the Social War, the Romans on the eve of the Hannibalic War, and the kings of Asia about to enter on the war for <SPAN CLASS="whole">Coele-Syria</SPAN>, <A CLASS="sec" NAME="71.10">10</A> I must now bring this Book to its close, which coincides with the final events preceding these wars and the death of the three kings who had up to now directed affairs.

So the Loeb edition. Alert reader Sean Stone points out that this ought to be "opposite the Achaeans <I>and</I> the Aetolians". But Achaeans, Aetolians, and for that matter, Illyrians and Helicranium are all translator's artifacts, seeking to explicit the text. The Greek merely has

More attentively than others, including yours truly, reader Ian Spackman points out that "eastern extremity" seems odd here. But it's neither a transcription error of my own, nor, at first sight, a translation error in the print edition: the Greek has <SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">ἀνατολὰς</SPAN>. Possible explanations, none of which convinces me completely:
	<P CLASS="m1 i1 b0 a0 justify">
1. Polybius viewed the source of the Po as being the "eastern extremity" of the territory of the <SPAN CLASS="whole">Etruscans</SPAN> because in his mind the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy ran due N‑S: once you do that, the Po is "east". The mental map even of scholars back then was a bit odd: Ptolemy for example twists Scotland about 90 degrees east

(<I>Geography</I>, <SPAN CLASS="small">II</SPAN>.2)</A>.
	<P CLASS="m1 i1 b0 a0 justify">
2. The eastern extremity is meant, not of Etruria, but of the Celtic territories. The Greek text really doesn't seem to bear this interpretation.
	<P CLASS="m1 i1 b0 a0 justify">
3. Maybe on closer examination, translation error there is. The Greek text reads <SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">τὰ μὲν οὖν πρῶτα καὶ περὶ τὰς ἀνατολὰς τοῦ Πάδου κείμενα Λάοι κὰι Λεβέκιοι</SPAN>; and etymologically, <SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">ἀνατολή</SPAN> after all means "rising": no east or west about it, is this merely "the sources of the Po"?

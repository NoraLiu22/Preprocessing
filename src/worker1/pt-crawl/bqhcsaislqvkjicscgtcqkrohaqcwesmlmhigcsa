<p class="tc">Bust of E.A. Abbey by Thomas Brock</p>

<p class="one">Edwin Austin Abbey (1852-1911), painter and illustrator, worked in the 
idiom of the English <a href="../../../painting/prb/index.html">Pre-Raphaelites</a>, 
painting such mediaevalist oils as <span class ="painting">Castle of Maidens</span> 
(1895) and <span class ="painting">King Lear's Farewell</span> (1898). Much of his work 
is preserved in the Brandywine River Museum in Chester County, North Carolina, although 
his most famous painting, <span class ="painting">The Quest for the Holy Grail</span>, is 
the freize in the Boston Public Library, for which he painted a series of murals in the 
1890s. Born in Philadelphia, he studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts 
under Christian Schuessele.</p>

<p>A. E. Abbey provided illustrations for both <span class="book">Harper's Weekly</span> 
(1871-1874) and <span class="book">Scribner's Magazine</span>. In 1878, Abbey moved to 
England, becoming a member of the Royal Academy in 1898. There, undoubtedly his most 
prestigious commission was the 1902 coronation portrait of King Edward VII, which hangs 
in Buckingham Palace. In order to retain his American citizenship, however, in 1907 Abbey 
had to decline a knighthood. He died of cancer in 1911 in the midst of executing a vast 
commission for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, where one may still see his 
allegorical medallions of <span class ="painting">Science</span>, <span class 
="painting">Art</span>, <span class ="painting">Justice</span>, and <span class 
="painting">Religion</span>. His mural <span class ="painting">Reading of the Declaration 
of Independence</span> was completed by his assistant Ernest Board and his friend John 
Singer Sargent.</p>

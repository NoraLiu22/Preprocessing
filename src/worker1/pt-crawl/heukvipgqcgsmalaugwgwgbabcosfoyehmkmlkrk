<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z2">{2}</A> He had his head naturally bent on one side, as Timotheus, the Athenian, tells us, in his work on Lives. And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollonius.html#25">Apollonius</A>, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyre.html#1">Tyrian</A>, says that he was thin, very tall, of a dark complexion; in reference to which some one once called him an Egyptian clematis, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/chrysippus.html#1">Chrysippus</A> relates in the first volume of his Proverbs: he had fat, flabby, weak legs, on which account <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persaeus.html#1">Persaeus</A>, in his Convivial Reminiscences, says that he used to refuse many invitations to supper; and he was very fond, as it is said, of figs both fresh and dried in the sun.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="2">[2]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p2"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z3">{3}</A> He was a pupil, as has been already stated, of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crates.html#4">Crates</A>. After that, they say that he became a pupil of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stilpon.html#1">Stilpon</A> and of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/x/xenocrates.html#1">Xenocrates</A>, for ten years, as Timocrates relates in his Life of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dion.html#1">Dion</A>. He is also said to have been a pupil of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/polemon.html#3">Polemon</A>. But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hecaton.html#1">Hecaton</A>, and Apollonius of Tyre, in the first book of his essay on <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A>, say that when he consulted the oracle, as to what he ought to do to live in the most excellent manner, the God answered him that he ought to become of the same complexion as the dead, on which he inferred that he ought to apply himself to the reading of the books of the ancients. Accordingly, he attached himself to Crates in the following manner. Having purchased a quantity of purple from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phoenicia.html#1">Phoenicia</A>, he was shipwrecked close to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/peiraeus.html#1">Peiraeus</A>; and when he had made his way from the coast as far as Athens, he sat down by a bookseller's stall, being now about thirty years of age. And as he took up the second book of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/x/xenophon.html#1">Xenophon</A>'s <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/memorabilia.html#1">Memorabilia</A> and began to read it, he was delighted with it, and asked where such men as were described in that book lived; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="3">[3]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p3"> G</A> &nbsp; and as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crates.html#4">Crates</A> happened very seasonably to pass at the moment, the book-seller pointed him out, and said, &quot;Follow that man.&quot; From that time forth he became a pupil of Crates; but though he was in other respects very energetic in his application to philosophy, still he was too modest for the shamelessness of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cynics.html#1">Cynics</A>. On which account, Crates, wishing to cure him of this false shame, gave him a jar of lentil porridge to carry through the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cerameicus.html#1">Cerameicus</A>; and when he saw that he was ashamed, and that he endeavoured to hide it, he struck the jar with his staff, and broke it; and, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A> fled away, and the lentil porridge ran all down his legs, Crates called after him, &quot;Why do you run away, my little <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phoenicia.html#1">Phoenician</A>, you have done no harm?&quot; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="4">{4}</A> For some time then he continued a pupil of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crates.html#4">Crates</A>, and when he wrote his treatise entitled the Republic, some said, jokingly, that he had written it upon the tail of the dog.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z4">{4}</A> And besides his Republic, he was the author also of the following works:
<UL>
<LI> a treatise on a Life according to Nature;
<LI> one on Appetite, or the Nature of Man;
<LI> one on Passions;
<LI> one on Duty;
<LI> one on Law;
<LI> one on the usual Education of the Greeks;
<LI> one on Sight;
<LI> one on the Whole;
<LI> one on Signs;
<LI> one on the Doctrines of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pythagoras.html#1">Pythagoreans</A>;
<LI> one on Things in General;
<LI> one on Styles;
<LI> five essays on Problems relating to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/homer.html#1">Homer</A>;
<LI> one on the Listening to Poets.
</UL>
He also wrote:
<UL>
<LI> an essay on Art;
<LI> and Solutions;
<LI> and two books of Refutations;
<LI> Reminiscences of Crates;
<LI> Ethics.
</UL>
These are the books of which he was the author.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z5">{5}</A> But at last he left Crates, and became the pupil of the philosophers whom I have mentioned before, and continued with them for twenty years. So that it is related that be said, &quot;I now find that I made a prosperous voyage when I was wrecked.&quot; But some affirm that he made this speech in reference to Crates. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="5">[5]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p5"> G</A> &nbsp; Others say, that while he was staying at Athens he heard of a shipwreck, and said, &quot;Fortune does well in having driven us on philosophy.&quot; But as some relate the affair, he was not wrecked at all, but sold all his cargo at Athens, and then turned to philosophy.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z6">{6}</A> And he used to walk up and down in the beautiful colonnade which is called the Peisianactian, and which is also called  <I>poikil&#275;</I>, from the paintings of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/polygnotus.html#1">Polygnotus</A>, and there he delivered his discourses, wishing to make that spot tranquil; for in the time of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants">thirty</A>, nearly fourteen hundred of the citizens had been murdered there by them.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z7">{7}</A> Accordingly, for the future, men came thither to hear him, and from this his pupils were called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoics</A>, and so were his successors also, who had been at first called <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenonians</A>, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A> tells us in his Epistles. And before this time, the poets who frequented this colonnade (<I>stoa</I>) had been called Stoics, as we are informed by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eratosthenes.html#1">Eratosthenes</A>, in the eighth book of his treatise on the Old Comedy; but now Zenon's pupils made the name more famous. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="6">[6]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p6"> G</A> &nbsp; Now the Athenians had a great respect for Zenon, so that they gave him the keys of their walls, and they also honoured him with a golden crown, and a brazen statue; and this was also done by his own countrymen, who thought the statue of such a man an honour to their city. And the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/citium.html#1">Citiaeans</A>, in the district of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sidon.html#1">Sidon</A>, also claimed him as their countryman.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z8">{8}</A> He was also much respected by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#2">Antigonus</A>, who, whenever he came to Athens, used to attend his lectures, and was constantly inviting him to come to him. But he begged off himself, and sent <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persaeus.html#1">Persaeus</A>, one of his intimate friends, who was the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demetrius.html#30">Demetrius</A>, and a Citiaean by birth, and who flourished about the hundred and thirtieth <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympiad.html#1">Olympiad</A> <FONT CLASS="orange">[260 B.C.]</FONT>, when Zenon was an old man. The letter of Antigonus to Zenon was as follows, and it is reported by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/apollonius.html#25">Apollonius</A>, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tyre.html#1">Tyrian</A>, in his essay on Zenon.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="7">[7]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p7"> G</A> &nbsp; <B>King Antigonus to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A> the philosopher, greeting.</B>

<P> I think that in good fortune and glory I have the advantage of you; but in reason and education I am inferior to you, also in that perfect happiness which you have attained to. On which account I have thought it good to address you, and invite you to come to me, being convinced that you will not refuse what is asked of you. Endeavour, therefore, by all means to come to me, considering this fact, that you will not be the instructor of me alone, but of all the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonians</A> together. For he who instructs the ruler of the Macedonians and who leads him in the path of virtue, evidently marshals all his subjects on the road to happiness. For as the ruler is, so is it natural that his subjects for the most part should be also.

<P> And Zenon wrote him back the following answer.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="8">[8]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p8"> G</A> &nbsp; <B>Zenon to King <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#2">Antigonus</A>, greeting.</B>

<p>I admire your desire for learning, as being a true object for the wishes of mankind, and one too that tends to their advantage. And the man who aims at the study of philosophy has a proper disregard for the popular kind of instruction which tends only to the corruption of the morals. And you, passing by the pleasure which is so much spoken of, which makes the minds of some young men effeminate, show plainly that you are inclined to noble pursuits, not merely by your nature, but also by your own deliberate choice. And a noble nature, when it has received even a slight degree of training, and which also meets with those who will teach it abundantly, proceeds without difficulty to a perfect attainment of virtue. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="9">[9]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p9"> G</A> &nbsp; But I now find my bodily health impaired by old age, for I am eighty years old: on which account I am unable to come to you. But I send you some of those who have studied with me, who in that learning which has reference to the soul, are in no respect inferior to me, and in their bodily vigour are greatly my superiors. And if you associate with them you will want nothing that can bear upon perfect happiness.

<P> So he sent him <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persaeus.html#1">Persaeus</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philonides.html#2">Philonides</A>, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thebes.html#1">Theban</A>, both of whom are mentioned by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/epicurus.html#1">Epicurus</A>, in his letter to his brother <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristobulus.html#8">Aristobulus</A>, as being companions of Antigonus.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z9">{9}</A> And I have thought it worth while also to set down the decree of the Athenians concerning him; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="10">[10]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p10"> G</A> &nbsp; and it is couched in the following language.

<P> In the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archonship</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arrheneides.html#1">Arrhenides</A>, in the fifth <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prytaneis">prytany</A> of the tribe <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/acamantis.html#1">Acamantis</A>, on the twenty-first day of the month Maimacterion, on the twenty-third day of the aforesaid prytany, in a duly convened assembly, Hippon, the son of Cratistoteles, of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deme">deme</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/x/xypete.html#1">Xypete</A>, being one of the presidents, and the rest of the presidents, his colleagues, put the following decree to the vote. And the decree was proposed by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrason.html#1">Thrason</A>, of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/anacaea.html#1">Anacaea</A>, the son of Thrason.

<P> Since <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A> the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mnaseas.html#1">Mnaseas</A>, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/citium.html#1">Citiaean</A>, has passed many years in the city, in the study of philosophy, being in all other respects a good man, and also exhorting all the young men who have sought his company to the practice of virtue, and encouraging them in the practice of temperance making his own life a model to all men of the greatest excellence, since it has in every respect corresponded to the doctrines which he has taught; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="11">[11]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p11"> G</A> &nbsp; it has been determined by the people (and may the determination be fortunate), to praise Zenon, the son of Mnaseas, the Citiaean, and to present him with a golden crown in accordance with the law, on account of his virtue and temperance, and to build him a tomb in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cerameicus.html#1">Cerameicus</A>, at the public expense. And the people has appointed by its vote five men from among the citizens of Athens, who shall see to the making of the crown and the building of the tomb. And the scribe of the borough shall enrol the decree and engrave it on two pillars, and he shall be permitted to place one pillar in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/academy.html#1">Academy</A>, and one in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lyceium.html#1">Lyceium</A>. And he who is appointed to superintend the work shall divide the expense that the pillars amount to, in such a way that every one may understand that the whole people of Athens honours good men both while they are living and after they are dead. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="12">[12]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p12"> G</A> &nbsp; And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrason.html#1">Thrason</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/anacaea.html#1">Anacaea</A>, Philocles of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/peiraeus.html#1">Peiraeus</A>, Phaedrus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/anaphlystus.html#1">Anaphlystus</A>, Medon of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/acharnae.html#1">Acharnae</A>, Smicythus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sypalettus.html#1">Sypalettus</A>, and (?) Dion of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/paeania.html#1">Paeania</A>, are hereby appointed to superintend the building of the tomb.

<P> These then are the terms of the decree.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z10">{10}</A> But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#8">Antigonus</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/carystus.html#1">Carystus</A> says, that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A> himself never denied that he was a native of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/citium.html#1">Citium</A>. For that when on one occasion, there was a citizen of that town who had contributed to the building of some baths, and was having his name engraved on the pillar, as the countryman of Zenon the philosopher, he bade them add, &quot;Of Citium.&quot;

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z11">{11}</A> And at another time, when he had had a hollow covering made for some vessel, he carried it about for some money, in order to procure present relief for some difficulties which were distressing <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/crates.html#4">Crates</A> his master. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="13">[13]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p13"> G</A> &nbsp; And they say that he, when he first arrived in Greece, had more than a thousand <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A>, which he lent out at nautical usury.

<P> <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z12">{12}</A> And he used to eat little loaves and honey, and to drink a small quantity of sweet smelling wine. <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z13">{13}</A> He had very few youthful acquaintances of the male sex, and he did not cultivate them much, lest be should be thought to be a misogynist. And he dwelt in the same house with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persaeus.html#1">Persaeus</A>; and once, when he brought in a female flute-player to him, he hastened to bring her back to him. <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z14">{14}</A> And he was, it is said, of a very accommodating temper; so much so, that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#2">Antigonus</A>, the king, often came to dine with him, and often carried him off to dine with him, at the house of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristocles.html#2">Aristocles</A> the harp-player; but when he was there, he would presently steal away.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="14">[14]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p14"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z15">{15}</A> It is also said that he avoided a crowd with great care, so that he used to sit at the end of a bench, in order at events to avoid being incommoded on one side. And he never used to walk with more than two or three companions. And he used at times to exact a piece of money from all who came to bear him, with a view of not being distressed by numbers; and this story is told by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleanthes.html#1">Cleanthes</A>, in his treatise on Brazen Money. And when he was surrounded by any great crowd, would point to a balustrade of wood at the end of the colonnade which surrounded an altar, and say, &quot;That was once in the middle of this place, but it was placed apart because it was in people's way; and now, if you will only withdraw from the middle here, you too will incommode me much less.&quot; <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z16">{16}</A> And when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demochares.html#3">Demochares</A>, the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/laches.html#2">Laches</A>, embraced him once, and said that he would tell Antigonus, or write to him of everything which he wanted, as he always did everything for him; <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zenon.html#2">Zenon</A>, when he had heard him say this, avoided his company for the future. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="15">[15]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p15"> G</A> &nbsp; And it is said, that after the death of Zenon, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antigonus.html#2">Antigonus</A> said, &quot;What an audience I have lost.&quot; On which account he employed <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrason.html#1">Thrason</A>, their ambassador, to entreat of the Athenians to allow him to be buried in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cerameicus.html#1">Cerameicus</A>. And when he was asked why he had such an admiration for him, he replied, &quot;Because, though I gave him a great many important presents, he was never elated, and never humbled.&quot; <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z17">{17}</A> He was a man of a very investigating spirit, and one who inquired very minutely into everything; in reference to which, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/timon.html#1">Timon</A>, in his <i><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/silli.html#1">Silli</A></i>, speaks thus:

And in the second place, that he used to call all who were not virtuous, adversaries, and enemies, and slaves, and unfriendly to one another, parents to their children, brethren to brethren. and kinsmen to kinsmen; <A CLASS="ref" NAME="33">[33]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p33"> G</A> &nbsp; and again, that in his Republic, he speaks of the virtuous as the only citizens, and friends, and relations, and free men, so that in the doctrine of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/stoics.html#1">Stoic</A>, even parents and their children are enemies; for they are not wise. Also, that he lays down the principle of the community of women both in his Republic and in a poem of two hundred verses, and teaches that neither temples nor courts of law, nor gymnasia, ought to be erected in a city; moreover, that he writes thus about money, &quot;That he does not think that men ought to coin money either for purposes of traffic, or of travelling.&quot; Besides ail this, he enjoins men and women to wear the same dress, and to leave no part of their person uncovered.  <A CLASS="ref" NAME="34">[34]</A> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%B9_%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD/%CE%96#p34"> G</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="ref2" NAME="z29">{29}</A> And that this treatise on the Republic is his work we are assured by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/chrysippus.html#1">Chrysippus</A>, in his Republic. He also discussed amatory subjects in the beginning of that book of his which is entitled the Art of Love. And in his Conversations he writes in a similar manner. Such are the charges made against him by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cassius.html#2">Cassius</A>, and also by Isidorus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pergamon.html#1">Pergamon</A>, the orator, who says that all the unbecoming doctrines and assertions of the Stoics were cut out of their books by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/athenodorus.html#8">Athenodorus</A>, the Stoic, who was the curator of the library at Pergamon. And that subsequently they were replaced, as Athenodorus was detected, and placed in a situation of great danger; and this is sufficient to say about those doctrines of his which were impugned.

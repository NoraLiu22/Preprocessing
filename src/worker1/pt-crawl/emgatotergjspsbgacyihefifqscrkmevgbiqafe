           The aesthetic experience consists in enjoying a thing for its
          intrinsic beauty, for what it is in itself. The nature of this
          enjoyment is not, however, uniform. It is differentiated by whichever
          emotions are predominant when that thing is being experienced, and
          some emotion is always aroused when a person is intimately engaged
          with a thing. Goya's <I>Saturn Devouring His Son</I> thus stirs up
          feelings of fear and revulsion. Wilde's <I>The Importance of Being
          Earnest</I> is humorous, and Miyazaki's <I>Spirited Away</I> conjures
          up a sense of wonder. </P>
        
        <P>These emotions are, however, without the pragmatic objects and
          consequences they have in ordinary life. When the emotion of love is
          evoked by a play, for example, the viewer of that play does not fall
          in love with some character on the stage and attempt to carry away the
          actor portraying the particular character who aroused such feelings.
          When experiencing fear in the same context, the viewer does not
          believe himself actually to be in danger and flee the theater. In both
          these cases, the emotion is experienced as divorced from the practical
          considerations with which the emotions of ordinary life are concerned.
          While an emotion evoked by a work of art is focused on the events and
          characters portrayed in that work, it does not take them as its
          objects as would the ordinary emotions. Instead, the work of art
          evokes emotions that are relished as such, as pure feelings
          transcending the particularities of specific subjects and objects.
          Consequently, when enjoying the intrinsic beauty of a work of art as
          tinged by the emotions evoked by it, even fear and revulsion can be
          sources of pleasure, as the work's beauty consists, in such cases, of
          its capacity to evoke these emotions.</P>
        
        <P>Not all things, however, produce an equally intense response. There
          are other factors that can be added to a thing and themselves
          appreciated, so that, when present, they enhance the beauty of the
          thing with which they are connected. </P>
        
        <P> What is more, as a work of art is whatever has the capacity to
          produce an appreciation of its native beauty, including an
          appreciation of the skill that went into the making of it, the work
          itself serves no purpose beyond itself. Didactic content can be
          effectively included in an artistic work when it contributes to the
          production of a given emotional reaction to the work in the viewer,
          but when the purpose of a work is to convey information that work
          ceases to be art. </P>
        
        <P>The purpose of a didactic work is to convey information, and once
          information has been learned it need not be learned again unless it is
          forgotten. Having memorized my multiplication tables, I have no need
          to memorize them again. If I review them, it is either because I do
          not know them, whether because of forgetfulness or my not having
          learned them when I was first presented them, or because I enjoy
          reviewing them, in which case I am not reviewing them in order to
          learn them but to relish some pleasure. In contrast to this, I can
          read and reread a poem without learning anything from it, because the
          experience of relishing it for its own beauty does not entail
          acquiring any new knowledge. The aesthetic experience is nothing other
          than the appreciation of a thing's beauty as colored by the particular
          emotions that thing evokes in the person having the experience. Art
          serves no other purpose and is clearly differentiated from practical
          activities such as learning.</P>
        
        <P>Referring to nothing but itself, art is pragmatically useless, but,
          existing only for itself and being deeply satisfying, it is in need of
          nothing else.</P>

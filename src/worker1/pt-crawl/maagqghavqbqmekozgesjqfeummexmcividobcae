<A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.1">1</A> However, when one has undertaken to compose a history based upon readings which are not readily accessible or even found at home, but in foreign countries, for the most part, and scattered about among different owners, for him it is really necessary, first and above all things, that he should live in a city which is famous, friendly to the liberal arts, and populous, in order that he may have all sorts of books in plenty, and may by hearsay and enquiry come into possession of all those details which elude writers and are preserved with more conspicuous fidelity in the memories of men. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.2">2</A> He will thus be prevented from publishing a work which is deficient in many, and even in essential things. But as for me, I live in a small city, and I prefer to dwell there that it may not become smaller still; and during the time when I was in Rome and various parts of Italy I had no leisure to practise myself in the Roman language, owing to my public duties and the number of my pupils in philosophy. It was therefore late and when I was well on in years that I began to study Roman literature. And here my experience was an astonishing thing, but true. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.3">3</A> For it was not so much that by means of words I came to a complete understanding of things, as that from things I somehow had an experience which enabled me to follow the meaning of words. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="2.4">4</A> But to appreciate the beauty and quickness of the Roman style, the figures of speech, the rhythm, and the other embellishments of the language, while I think it

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">5</A> of my Parallel Lives, where I write about Demosthenes and Cicero, I shall examine their actions and their political careers to see how their natures and dispositions compare with one another, but I shall make no critical comparison of their speeches, nor try to show which was the more agreeable or the more <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful orator. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.2">2</A> "For useless," as Ion says, "is a dolphin's might upon dry ground," a maxim which Caecilius, who goes to excess in everything, forgot when he boldly ventured to put forth a comparison of Demosthenes and Cicero. But really it is possible that, if the "Know thyself" of the oracle&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref6" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.3">3</A> In the case of Demosthenes and Cicero, then, it would seem that the Deity originally fashioned them on the same plan, implanting in their natures many similarities, such as their love of distinction, their love of freedom in their political activities, and their lack of courage for wars and dangers, and uniting in them also many similarities of fortune. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.4">4</A> For in my opinion two other orators could not be found who, from small and obscure beginnings, became great and <SPAN CLASS="whole">power</SPAN>&shy;ful; who came into conflict with kings and tyrants; who lost each a daughter; who were banished from their native cities and returned with honour; and who, after


<A ID="p9"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p9 </SPAN></A>taking to flight again and being captured by their enemies, ended their lives as soon as their countrymen ceased to be free. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="3.5">5</A> So that, if there should be a competition between nature and fortune, as between artists, it would be difficult to decide whether the one made the men more alike in their characters, or the other in the circumstances of their lives. But I must speak of the more ancient first.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="4">4</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.1">1</A> Demosthenes, the father of Demosthenes, belonged to the better class of citizens, as Theopompus tells us, and was surnamed Cutler, because he had a large factory and slaves who were skilled workmen in this business. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.2">2</A> But as for what Aeschines the orator says of the mother of Demosthenes,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref7" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demosthenes*.html#note7
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">7</A> namely, that she was a daughter of one Gylon, who was banished from the city on a charge of treason, and of a barbarian woman, I cannot say whether he speaks truly, or is uttering slander and lies. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.3">3</A> However, at the age of seven, Demosthenes was left by his father in affluence, since the total value of his estate fell little short of fifteen talents;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref8" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demosthenes*.html#note8
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">8</A> but he was wronged by his guardians, who appropriated some of his property to their own uses and neglected the rest, so that even his teachers were deprived of their pay. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.4">4</A> It was for this reason, as it seems, that he did not pursue the studies which were suitable and proper for a well-born boy, and also because of his bodily weakness and fragility, since his mother would not permit him to work hard in the palaestra, and his tutors would not force him to do so. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.5">5</A> For from the first he was lean and sickly, and his


<A ID="p11"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p11 </SPAN></A>opprobrious surname of Batalus is said to have been given him by the boys in mockery of his physique. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.6">6</A> Now Batalus, as some say, was an effeminate <SPAN CLASS="whole">flute-player</SPAN>, and Antiphanes wrote a farce in which he held him up to ridicule for this. But some speak of Batalus as a poet who wrote voluptuous verses and drinking songs. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.7">7</A> And it appears that one of the parts of the body which it is not decent to name was at that time called Batalus by the Athenians. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="4.8">8</A> But the name of Argas (for they tell us that Demosthenes had this nickname also) was given him either with reference to his manners, which were harsh and savage, the snake being called "<SPAN CLASS="translit_Greek">argas</SPAN>" by some of the poets; or with reference to his way of speaking, which was distressing to his hearers, Argas being the name of a composer of vile and disagreeable songs. So much on this head.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="5">5</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.1">1</A> The origin of his eager desire to be an orator, they tell us, was as follows. Callistratus the orator was going to make a plea in court <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T848a">848</A>on the question of Oropus,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref9" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demosthenes*.html#note9
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">9</A> and the trial was eagerly awaited, not only because of the ability of the orator, who was then at the very height of his reputation, but also because of the circumstances of the case, which was notorious. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.2">2</A> Accordingly, when Demosthenes heard the teachers and tutors agreeing among themselves to be present at the trial, with great importunity he persuaded his own tutor to


<A ID="p13"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p13 </SPAN></A>take him to the hearing. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.3">3</A> This tutor, having an acquaintance with the public officials who opened the courts, succeeded in procuring a place where the boy could sit unseen and listen to what was said. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.4">4</A> Callistratus won his case and was extravagantly admired, and Demosthenes conceived a desire to emulate his fame, seeing him escorted on his way by the multitude and congratulated by all; but he had a more wondering appreciation of the power of his oratory, which was naturally adapted to subdue and master all opposition. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.5">5</A> Wherefore, bidding farewell to his other studies and to the usual pursuits of boyhood, he practised himself laboriously in declamation, with the idea that he too was to be an orator. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.6">6</A> He also employed Isaeus as his guide to the art of speaking, although Isocrates was lecturing at the time; either, as some say, because he was an orphan and unable to pay Isocrates his stipulated fee of ten minas,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref10" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demosthenes*.html#note10
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">10</A> or because he preferred the style of Isaeus for its effectiveness and adaptability in actual use. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="5.7">7</A> But Hermippus says that he once came upon some anonymous memoirs in which it was recorded that Demosthenes was a pupil of Plato and got most help from him in his rhetorical studies. He also quotes Ctesibius as saying that from Callias the Syracusan and certain others Demosthenes secretly obtained the rhetorical systems of Isocrates and Alcidamas and mastered them.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="6">6</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.1">1</A> However this may be, when Demosthenes came of age he began to bring suits against his guardians and to write speeches attacking them.


<A ID="p15"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p15 </SPAN></A>They devised many evasions and new trials, but Demosthenes, after practising himself in these exercises, as Thucydides says,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref11" HREF="

"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">11</A> not without toil and danger, won his cause, although he was able to recover not even a small fraction of his patrimony. However, he acquired sufficient practice and confidence in speaking, and got a taste of the distinction and power that go with forensic contests, and therefore essayed to come forward and engage in public matters. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.2">2</A> And just as Laomedon the Orchomenian — so we are told — practised <SPAN CLASS="whole">long-distance</SPAN> running by the advice of his physicians, to ward off some disease of the spleen, and then, after restoring his health in this way, entered the great games and became one of the best runners of the long course, so Demosthenes, after applying himself to oratory in the first place for the sake of recovering his private property, by this means acquired ability and power in speaking, and at last in public business, as it were in the great games, won the first place among the citizens who strove with one another on the <A CLASS="glossary" HREF="

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.3">3</A> And yet when he first addressed the people he was interrupted by their clamours and laughed at for his inexperience, since his discourse seemed to them confused by long periods and too harshly and immoderately tortured by formal arguments. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.4">4</A> He had also, as it would appear, a certain weakness of voice and indistinctness of speech and shortness of breath which disturbed the sense of what he said by disjoining his sentences. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="6.5">5</A> And finally, when he had forsaken the assembly and was wandering about


<A ID="p17"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p17 </SPAN></A>dejectedly in the Piraeus, Eunomus the Thriasian, who was already a very old man, caught sight of him and upbraided him because, although he had a style of speaking which was most like that of Pericles, he was throwing himself away out of weakness and lack of courage, neither facing the multitude with boldness, nor preparing his body for these forensic contests, but suffering it to wither away in slothful neglect.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="7">7</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.1">1</A> At another time, too, they say, when he had been rebuffed by the people and was going off homewards disconcerted <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T849a">849</A>and in great distress, Satyrus the actor, who was a familiar acquaintance of his, followed after and went indoors with him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.2">2</A> Demosthenes lamented to him that although he was the most laborious of all the orators and had almost used up the vigour of his body in this calling, he had no favour with the people, but debauchees, sailors, and illiterate fellows were listened to and held the bema, while he himself was ignored. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.3">3</A> "You are right, Demosthenes," said Satyrus, "but I will quickly remedy the cause of all this, if you will consent to recite off-hand for me some narrative speech from Euripides or Sophocles." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.4">4</A> Demosthenes did so, whereupon Satyrus, taking up the same speech after him, gave it such a form and recited it with such appropriate sentiment and disposition that it appeared to Demosthenes to be quite another. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.5">5</A> Persuaded, now, how much of ornament and grace action lends to oratory, he considered it of little or no use for a man to practise declaiming if he neglected the delivery and disposition of his words. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="7.6">6</A> After this, we are told, he built a subterranean


<A ID="p19"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p19 </SPAN></A>study, which, in fact, was preserved in our time,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref12" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demosthenes*.html#note12
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">12</A> and into this he would descend every day without exception in order to form his action and cultivate his voice, and he would often remain there even for two or three months together, shaving one side of his head in order that shame might keep him from going abroad even though he greatly wished to do so.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="8">8</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.1">1</A> Nor was this all, but he would make his interviews, conversations, and business with those outside, the foundation and starting point for eager toil. For as soon as he parted from his associates, he would go down into his study, and there would go over his transactions with them in due order, and the arguments used in defence of each course. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.2">2</A> And still further, whatever speeches he chanced to hear delivered he would take up by himself and reduce to propositions and periods, and he would introduce all sorts of corrections and changes of expression into the speeches made by others against himself, or, contrariwise, by himself against others. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.3">3</A> Consequently it was thought that he was not a man of good natural parts, but that his ability and power were the product of toil. And there would seem to be strong proof of this in the fact that Demosthenes was rarely heard to speak on the spur of the moment, but though the people often called upon him by name as he sat in the assembly, he would not come forward unless he had given thought to the question and was prepared to speak upon it. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.4">4</A> For this, many of the popular leaders used to rail at him, and Pytheas, in particular, once told him scoffingly that his arguments smelt of lamp-wicks.


<A ID="p21"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p21 </SPAN></A>To him, then, Demosthenes made a sharp answer. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.5">5</A> "Indeed," said he, "thy lamp and mine, O Pytheas, are not privy to the same pursuits." To the rest, however, he made no denial at all, but confessed that his speeches were neither altogether unwritten, nor yet fully written out. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.6">6</A> Moreover, he used to declare that he who rehearsed his speeches was a true man of the people: for such preparation was a mark of deference to the people, whereas heedlessness of what the multitude will think of his speech marks a man of oligarchical spirit, and one who relies on force rather than on persuasion. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="8.7">7</A> Another circumstance, too, is made a proof of his lack of courage for an emergency, namely, that when he was interrupted by the clamours of the people, Demades often rose and spoke off-hand in his support, but he never rendered such a service to Demades.

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.5">5</A> Greece was now in suspense as it thought of the future, and its peoples and cities were leaguing themselves together, Euboeans, Achaeans, Corinthians, Megarians, Leucadians, and Corcyraeans. But the most important struggle still remained for Demosthenes in bringing the Thebans to join


<A ID="p43"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p43 </SPAN></A>the alliance, for they had a territory bounding that of Attica and a force ready to take the field, and at that time were accounted the best soldiers in Greece. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="17.6">6</A> But it was no easy matter, in view of the recent benefits with which Philip had cultivated their favour during the Phocian war, to make the Thebans change sides, and especially because in the petty quarrels brought on by their proximity to Athens the differences which made for war between the two cities were all the while stirred up anew.

This step drove the Athenians out of their senses: no one ventured to ascend the bema and no one knew what ought to be said, but perplexity and silence reigned in the assembly. Then it was that Demosthenes, and he alone, came forward and advised the people to cling to Thebes; and after giving them courage in other ways and buoying them up with hopes, as he was wont to do, he was sent with others as ambassador to Thebes. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="18.2">2</A> Philip also, as Marsyas tells us, sent Amyntas and Clearchus of Macedonia, Daochus of Thessaly, and Thrasydaeus, to speak in opposition to the Athenians.

He managed at this time all the assemblies of the Thebans no less than those of the Athenians; he was beloved by both peoples and exercised supreme power, not illegally nor unworthily, as Theopompus declares, but rather with perfect propriety.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.4">4</A> For my own part, I cannot say that it was honourable in the Athenians to crown themselves with garlands and offer sacrifices to the gods on the death of a king who, in the midst of his successes, had treated them so mildly and humanely in their reverses; for besides provoking the indignation of the gods, it was also an ignoble thing to honour him while he was alive and make him a citizen of Athens, <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T856a">856</A>but when he had fallen by another's hand to set no bounds for their joy, nay, to leap, as it were, upon the dead, and sing paeans of victory, as if they themselves had wrought a deed of valour. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="22.5">5</A> However, for leaving his domestic misfortunes and tears and lamentations to the women and going about such business as he thought advantageous to the city, I commend Demosthenes, and I hold it to be the part of a statesmanlike and manly spirit to keep ever in view the good of the community, to find support for domestic sorrows and concerns in the public welfare, and to preserve one's dignity far more than actors


<A ID="p55"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p55 </SPAN></A>do when they take the parts of kings and tyrants; for these, as we see in the theatres, neither weep nor laugh according to their own inclinations, but as the subject of the action demands.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="23.5">5</A> It was on this occasion that Demosthenes told the Athenians the story of how the sheep surrendered their dogs to the wolves, comparing himself and his <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-orators</SPAN> to dogs fighting in defence of the people, and called Alexander "the Macedonian arch-wolf." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="23.6">6</A> Moreover, he said further: "Just as <SPAN CLASS="whole">grain-merchants</SPAN> sell their whole stock by means of a few kernels of wheat which they carry about with them in a bowl as a sample, so in surrendering us you unwittingly surrender also yourselves, all of you."

The decree was brought in by Demon of Paeania, who was a cousin of Demosthenes; and a trireme was sent to Aegina to fetch him home. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.7">7</A> When he set out to go up to the city from Piraeus, not an archon or a priest was missing, and all the rest of the people also met him in a body and welcomed him eagerly, It was at this time, too, as Demetrius the Magnesian says, that he lifted his hands towards heaven and blessed himself for that day, since he was coming home from exile more honourably than Alcibiades did; for he had persuaded, not forced, his <SPAN CLASS="whole">fellow-citizens</SPAN> to welcome him. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="27.8">8</A> It is true that his pecuniary fine remained standing against him (for it was not lawful to remit an assessment by act of grace), <A CLASS="Tsec" NAME="T859a">859</A>but they found a device to evade the law.

	<P CLASS="justify">
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="28.2">2</A> When Antipater and Craterus were reported to be advancing upon Athens, Demosthenes and his associates succeeded in escaping by stealth from the city, and the people, on motion of Demades, passed sentence of death upon them. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="28.3">3</A> Since they dispersed themselves to different places, Antipater sent his soldiers about to arrest them, under the command of Archias the so‑called <SPAN CLASS="whole">Exile-hunter</SPAN>. This man was a native of Thurii, and the story goes that he was once a tragic actor; indeed, it is recorded that Polus of Aegina, the best actor of his time, was a pupil of his. But Hermippus states that Archias was one of the pupils of Lacritus the rhetorician; while Demetrius says that he belonged to the school of Anaximenes. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="28.4">4</A> This Archias, then, finding that Hypereides the orator and Aristonicus of Marathon and Himeraeus the brother of Demetrius the Phalerean had taken refuge in the sanctuary of Aeacus at Aegina, haled them away and sent them to Antipater at Cleonae. There they were put to death, and Hypereides, it is said, also had his tongue cut out.

	<P CLASS="justify">
	<A CLASS="chapter" NAME="29">29</A>
<A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.1">1</A> Moreover, on learning that Demosthenes had taken sanctuary in the temple of Poseidon at Calauria, Archias sailed across to the island in small boats, and after landing with Thracian spearmen tried to persuade the fugitive to leave the temple and go with him to Antipater, assuring him that he would suffer no harsh treatment. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.2">2</A> But


<A ID="p73"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p73 </SPAN></A>it chanced that Demosthenes, in his sleep the night before, had seen a strange vision. He dreamed, namely, that he was acting in a tragedy and contending with Archias for the prize, and that although he acquitted himself well and won the favour of the audience, his lack of stage decorations and costumes cost him the victory. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.3">3</A> Therefore, after Archias had said many kindly things to him, Demosthenes, just as he sat, looked steadfastly at him and said: "O Archias, thou didst never convince me by thine acting, nor wilt thou now convince me by thy promises." And when Archias began to threaten him angrily, "Now," said he, "thou utterest the language of the Macedonian oracle;&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref64" HREF="

Wait a little, then, that I may write a message to my family." <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.4">4</A> With these words, he retired into the temple, and taking a scroll, as if about to write, he put his pen to his mouth and bit it, as he was wont to do when thinking what he should write, and kept it there some time, then covered and bent his head. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.5">5</A> The spearman, then, who stood at the door, laughed at him for playing the coward, and called him weak and unmanly, but Archias came up and urged him to rise, and reïterating the same speeches as before, promised him a reconciliation with Antipater. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="29.6">6</A> But Demosthenes, now conscious that the poison was affecting and <SPAN CLASS="whole">over&shy;powering</SPAN> him, uncovered his head; and fixing his eyes upon Archias, "Thou canst not be too soon now," said he, "in playing the part of Creon in the tragedy and casting this

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="30.1">1</A> As for the poison, Ariston says he took it from the pen, as I have said; but a certain Pappus, from whom Hermippus took his story, says that when he had fallen by the side of the altar, there was found written in the scroll the beginning of a letter, "Demosthenes to Antipater," and nothing more; <A CLASS="sec" NAME="30.2">2</A> and that when men were amazed at the suddenness of his death the Thracians who had stood at the door told the story that he took the poison into his hand from a cloth and put it to his mouth and swallowed it; and they themselves, strange to say, had supposed that what he swallowed was gold; and that the little maid who served him, when inquiries were made by Archias, said that Demosthenes had long worn that cloth girdle as a safeguard against his enemies. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="30.3">3</A> And even Eratosthenes himself says that Demosthenes kept the poison in a hollow bracelet, and that he wore this bracelet as an ornament upon his arm. <A CLASS="sec" NAME="30.4">4</A> But the divergent stories of all the others who have written about the matter, and they are very many, need not be recounted; except that Demarches the relative of Demosthenes says

<A CLASS="sec" NAME="31.1">1</A> Now, a short time before I took up my abode in Athens, the following incident is said to have occurred.

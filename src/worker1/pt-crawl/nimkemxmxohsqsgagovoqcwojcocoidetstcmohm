“Mr. Creswick's life and works present scant materials for biographer or critic.
Both were comparatively monotonous and devoid of stirring incident. The
works indicate a cheerful, genial mind, looking always on the bright
side of Nature in her less impressive aspects and in her familiar
moods.  Great industry was employed in frequent iteration of
popular subjects treated in an easy, elegant, airy, conventional
manner. The becks of Yorkshire, the mountain streams of Wales,
and the banks of the Wye and other rivers, supplied the staple
productions of more than forty years of a happy art-life. Mr.
Creswick was born at Sheffield, Yorkshire, in 1811. He came to
London whilst still a youth, and his first contributions to the Royal
Academy exhibitions, which were views of “Llyn Gwynant Morning, and of “Carnarvon Castle,” appeared at Somerset House as early as 1828. He continued in immediately succeeding years to exhibit subjects derived generally from the streams, lanes, and villages of the midland
counties. These were alternated in 1836 with views from the coast,
the woodlands, the heaths and downs of Sussex. Thenceforward
Mr. Creswick's subjects and effects varied but little from the class for
which we have indicated this preference.” — <span class="periodical">Illustrated London News</span>

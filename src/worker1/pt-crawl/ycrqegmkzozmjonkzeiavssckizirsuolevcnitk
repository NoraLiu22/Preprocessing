<P align=left>Christine de Pizan was a French Renaissance writer who wrote some 
of the very first feminist pieces of literature. During the Renaissance, 
Christine de Pizan broke with the traditional roles assigned to women in several 
ways during a time when women had no legal rights and were considered a man's 
property. Because she was one of the few women of the time period that were 
educated, she was able to write. When she was unexpectedly left to support 
herself and her family on her own, she became the first woman in Europe to 
successfully make a living through writing. She wrote in many different genres 
and styles depending on her subject and patron. Eventually, she began to address 
the debate about women that was happening during her life through works like 
<I>Letters to the God of Love </I>(1399), <I>The Take of the Rose </I>(1402), 
and <I>Letters on the Debate of the Romance of the Rose</I> (1401-1403). Her 
writing finally culminated in her most famous book, <I>The Book of the City of 
Ladies </I>(1404-05) and its sequel <I>Book of the Treasury of Ladies</I> 
(1405).</P>
<P align=left>Christine de Pizan's early life left her well prepared for the challenges that 
she would later face. Born in Italy, she moved to France at a young age when her 
father, Thomas de Pizan, became the astrologer of King Charles V. Her father 
assured it that she had the best education possible. She was married at the age 
of fifteen to Etienne de Castel. Though an arranged marriage, they were very 
happy together. Etienne was a nobleman and a scholar who encouraged Christine to 
continue her studies while they were married.</P>
<P align=left>Soon after their marriage, tragedy struck Christine 's life. When 
Charles V died in 1380, her father lost his position at the court. he became ill 
and eventually died in 1385. She and her husband assumed the care for her family 
after this. Then, in 1389, Etienne suddenly took ill while he was abroad with 
Charles VI. Christine was left alone to support her mother and her three small 
children.</P>
<P align=left>Despite wishing for death, Christine persevered and turned to writing 
as a way to support her family. She began to write both prose and poetry that 
she sent to various members of the court. As was the custom, they began to send 
her money in return. She would make copies of poems and send them to multiple 
people. Eventually, they started commissioning work from her and she was able to 
pull herself out of debt and save her family. Christine 's ability to write for 
specific audiences helped build her popularity with her patrons. After her 
children grew up and became independent from her, Christine was once again able to 
read and study along with her writing.</P>
<P align=left>As her life progressed, she began to deal directly with the cause 
of women in her writing. Her most important work, <I>The Book of the City of 
Ladies</I>, was written to combat the current ideas that existed about woman's 
nature. <I>City of Ladies</I> is divided into three sections in which Christine 
builds her symbolic city for women. She includes all the famous women who have 
ruled in history, women who have honored their parents, guarded their chastity, 
been faithful to their husbands, and all of those women who have become martyrs 
for their faith. Her book honored all kinds of great women and gave them a place 
to be safe from the attacks of men. Christine's book stood as a testimony to the 
greatness and accomplishments of women, putting them on the same level as 
men.</P>
<P align=left>Christine's life was remarkable because of the age she was living in. 
Women were not allowed to have a voice or be independent, but she managed both. 
Her writing allowed her family to survive and gave her the means to create not 
just for money, but for her own purposes. She worked to refute the negative 
ideas that scholars were spreading about women in the Renaissance and showed at 
least the elite women of her time how they could navigate successfully in what 
was a man's world.</P>

<P><B>Brown-Grant, Rosalind. <I>Christine de Pizan and the Moral Defense of 
Women: Reading Beyond Gender</I>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
1999</B>.<BR>This was written by a French professor at the University of Leeds. 
Brown-Grant writes on medieval literature and has translated a version of the 
<I>Book of the City of Ladies</I>. Here she does an in-depth analysis of
Christine's 
major work, examining it from a feminist perspective. Brown-Grant's aim is to 
show how the culture and audience effected Christine's writing and her moral vision 
of the world. She looks at Christine's strong beliefs in good morals and how she 
changed the genres and voices she wrote in so that she could convince men that 
women should have more rights. This is an interesting and informative source 
that is written on a scholarly level. It would be suitable for students and 
professors of literature.</P>
<P><B>Chess, Simone. "Vision and Revision: Christine de Pizan and Feminist 
Histography." (Last Updated 2002) &lt;<U><a href="http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~schess/courses/christine/" target="_blank">http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~schess/courses/christine/</a></U>&gt; 
(22 November 2005).<BR></B>This site looks at Christine's work from a feminist 
perspective, specifically looking at how <I>The Book of the City of Ladies</I> 
can be used to start a reading of history that focuses on women's history rather 
than more traditional male dominated historical texts.. Chess finds that
Christine's 
book can be seen as a model for future feminist modern revisions of history. 
This is an interesting essay that would be useful for anyone interested in a 
feminist critique of Pizan. However, Chess offers a few warnings about her page. 
While her work was certainly original, the author tends to disregard the fact 
that <I>City of Ladies</I> did not result in any large change in thinking, nor 
did a large number of women read it. Keeping these points in mind will help the 
reader interpret the page better. This site also features quite a few paintings 
of Pizan working and reading. It also has a fair selection of links to other 
online sources on Pizan, though several of them are in French.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Desmond, Marilynn, ed. <I>Christine de Pizan and the Categories of 
Difference. </I>Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1998.<BR></B>This 
collection of essay comes from a conference titled "Christine de Pizan: 
Texts/Intertexts/Contexts"&nbsp; that took place at Binghamton University in 
1995. There are several illustrations in the collection. They include paintings 
of Pizan, paintings included in her work, and other paintings of places or 
situations that influenced her writing. Much of the focus of the essays is how 
Pizan was able to write in so many different styles and tailor her work to 
specific audiences. This is a good source that focuses on her work more than her 
life. It is easy to understand and would be accessible to college level 
students.</P>

size=3><I>Myth, Montage, and Visuality in Late Medieval Manuscript Culture.</I> 
Binghamton: University of Michigan Press, 2003.<BR></FONT></B><FONT size=3>This 
book focuses specifically on </FONT>Christine's <FONT size=3> work <I>Epistre Othea </I>and how she uses 
the appearance of the text itself to affect the reader. The authors look at the 
process of creating a text during Pizan's time and how these luxury items used 
illustrations as well as text to shape the reading experience. This is an 
excellent source for anyone looking to explore in great detail how Pizan would 
fit her texts to suit her audiences. She wrote to her rich patrons in different 
styles and genres depending on their tastes and the topics. It is not as helpful 
for someone trying to learn about her life or all of her works, and is written 
on a scholarly level.</FONT></P>

(22 November 2005).<BR></B>This site is filled with quite a bit of useful 
information, but the format is quite cumbersome. It will take some time to find 
what you are looking for here. The page starts with a list of links to
Christine's 
works online along with some essays written about her. The next part of the 
page, which makes up the majority of it, contains excerpts form a variety of her 
works. Next, collections that feature her work are listed, followed by a list of 
secondary sources on Pizan. This single page contains a lot of information, but 
the poor formatting makes it difficult to find what you want. The most helpful 
part is the small table of contents at the top. It has links to the different 
sections on the page, including each of the translations. Using this is much 
easier than trying to scroll straight down the page. It would be worth the time 
for anyone who is having trouble finding print sources on Pizan because the list 
on the site is extensive.</P>
<P><B>Dufresne, Laura Rinaldi. "Women Warriors: A Special Case From the 
Fifteenth Century: The City of Ladies." <I>Women's Studies</I>. 23, no. 2 March 
1994, 111-132.<BR></B>This article examines how the text and imagery relate in 
<I>The City of Ladies.</I> In the opening, the author compares it to how 
Boccaccio's <I>Concerning Famous Women</I> portrays the 'women warriors'. When 
comparing the two, Dufresne finds that Pizan takes women much more seriously and 
tries to defend the idea of the woman warrior. Yet, she also notes that the 
images of women throughout <I>City</I> are highly conservative when compared to 
the ideas in the work. Dufresne discusses the reasons for this and goes on to 
compare the original images that Pizan used to images that were used in editions 
that came out after her death. This is a scholarly article that would be helpful 
for studying <I>City of Ladies</I> and the relationship between images and text 
in medieval literature.</P>
<P><B>Enders, Jody. "The Feminist Mnemonics of Christine de Pizan." <I>Modern 
Language Quarterly.</I> 55, no. 3 Sept 1994, 231-250.<BR></B>This article 
examines how Pizan developed her theories on women through rhetoric, which was a 
male dominated and controlled institution. Enders, a professor of French at the 
University of California, argues that Pizan is successful in using the tool that 
has been so often used to criticize and belittle women to make her case. 
Examining the visuals in <I>City of Ladies</I> shows how Pizan was able to 
rework history and give women a place in it. This is an interesting essay, but 
it requires some previous knowledge of Pizan and her work. Advanced students of 
language would best be able to understand and work with this piece.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Forhan, Kate Langdon. <I>The Political Theory of Christine de Pizan.</I> 
Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2002.<BR></B>Like the title suggests, this book looks 
at Christine's work from a political perspective. By looking at historical context 
and the work of her predecessors, Forhan shows how Christine's theories differed 
from her contemporaries. Her works are also examined to find out how she felt 
about things like kingship, laws and war. In the preface, the author states that 
this book is intended for political scientists and theorists. While this is a 
good source, it will be difficult to read for those who don't understand the 
language of politics.</P>
<P><B>Isman, Josette A. "The Resurrection According to Christine de Pizan." 
<I>Religion &amp; the Arts.</I> 4, no. 3 Sept 2000, 337-358.<BR></B>This is one 
of the more unique articles on this list. Isman chooses to explore the work of 
Pizan from a religious viewpoint. Specifically, it looks at what Pizan has to 
say about the resurrection of Christ. Isman looks at how she uses the sermon 
genre to discuss this topic and the significance of this. The article also uses 
Biblical and theological sources to explain the resurrection. Isman looks at how 
Pizan presents her information and what that says about how people of the 
Renaissance understood this doctrine. This is an interesting and useful article 
that would help anyone looking to understand how Pizan fit the style of her 
writing for her purpose. It also would be a great source for anyone interested 
in the connections between Pizan and religion.</P>
<P><B>Nowacka, Keiko. "Reflections on Christine de Pizan's 'Feminism.'" 
<I>Australian Feminist Studies</I>. 17, no. 37 March 2002, 81-97.<BR></B>This 
article examines <I>The Book of the City of Ladies</I> from a feminist 
perspective, paying close attention to Christine's claims to the moral and 
intellectual equality of the sexes. The author examines the literary styles of 
Pizan and what makes up 15th century feminism. Nowacka examines her work through 
the lens of 15th century feminism because she feels that judging the work 
through the current standards would be unfair and result in a condemnation of 
all of Pizan's work. This is one of the best articles on this list and is worth 
reading. It would be acceptable for any undergraduate student wanting to better 
understand Pizan and her work. By looking at Pizan not through what we see as 
proper feminism, but through the feminism of her time, the reader learns just 
how different and important her ideas were.</P>
<P><B>Pedro, Ana. "Christine de Pizan." (No date) &lt;<a href="http://faculty.msmc.edu/lindeman/piz1.html" target="_blank">http://faculty.msmc.edu/lindeman/piz1.html</a>&gt;&nbsp; 
(22 November 2005).<BR></B>This is one of the more useful pages on Christine . It 
offers a full biography, bibliography, and a gallery. The page features a nice 
essay on <I>The Book of the City of Ladies</I>, and there is also a detailed 
timeline of her life. Unfortunately, most of the links to other Christine web sites 
are no longer working, which would indicate that this page may not have been 
updated for a while. The site is still worth a quick look because it contains 
links to quite a few sources on Christine and would be accessible and easy for a 
wide variety of readers.</P>
<P><B>Willard, Charity Cannon. "Christine de Pizan as Teacher." (1991) &lt;<a href="http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1991/French-html/Willard,CharityCannon.htm" target="_blank">http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1991/French-html/Willard,CharityCannon.htm</a>&gt; 
(22 November 2005).<BR></B>Willard's article on Christine focuses less on her role 
in developing feminism than on her developing talents as a writer and her idea 
about the education of children. The essay goes on to examine what Christine had to 
say about some of the current methods of education during her time. Willard 
examines the methods Christine recommends for raising children, as well as her ideas 
about the qualities of effective rulers. This article is different from many of 
the other online resources on Christine because it examines something other than her 
role in feminist history. Willard is cited in many different works on Christine and 
is a reliable source for information about her.&nbsp;</P>

                     <h2>WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE</h2>

                     <p>On December 29, 1890, on Wounded Knee
Creek in southwestern South Dakota, a tangle
of events resulted in the deaths of more than
250, and possibly as many as 300, Native Americans.
These people were guilty of no crime and
were not engaged in combat. A substantial
number were women and children. Most of
the victims were members of the Miniconjou
band of the Lakota Sioux who had been intercepted
by military forces after they fled their
reservation in South Dakota for refuge in the
Badlands.</p>

                     <p>The story begins in October 1890, when
Daniel F. Royer arrived at Pine Ridge Agency,
home of the Oglala Lakotas, to assume responsibility
as agent. His selection as agent could not
have been worse: he knew nothing about Native
Americans and was irrationally fearful of them,
and from the time of his arrival the dispatches
he sent back to Washington were peppered
with warnings of an outbreak similar to the one
in Minnesota in 1862 in which hundreds of settlers
were killed by Santee Sioux. Royer's appointment
was also ill timed. In 1890 drought
replaced the bountiful rainfall of the 1880s, resulting
in crop failures and economic depression.
On their reservations, Native Americans
were forced into dependence on the federal
government for food and clothing. When
Royer took over as agent, there was widespread
anxiety among the Oglalas regarding the adequacy
of government provisions.</p>

                     <p>A year earlier, the Ghost Dance had appeared
on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Born
from the vision of a Paiute named Wovoka
(aka Jack Wilson), the Ghost Dance blended
the messianic account of Christianity with traditional
Native beliefs. This new religion told
of the return of the Messiah to relieve the suffering
of Native Americans and promised that
if they would live righteous lives and perform
the Ghost Dance in the prescribed manner, the
European American invaders would vanish,
the bison would return, and the living and the
dead would be reunited in an Edenic world.
But in Royer's paranoid mind the Ghost Dance
was a war dance that threatened imminent
bloodshed. His dispatches to Washington
urged that troops be sent to protect citizens
from war.</p>

                     <p>In mid-November 1890 President Benjamin
Harrison responded to the fears of an Indian
outbreak by ordering troops into the area.
Regular troops were sent from Fort Robinson,
Nebraska, and on November 18, 1890, the Second
Nebraska Infantry left Fort Omaha in two
special trains. On the train was also a cadre of
newspaper reporters. From that point on, the
crisis at Pine Ridge was a significant news item
in newspapers across the country and around
the world.</p>

                     <p>The trains unloaded their travelers at Rushville,
Nebraska, on November 20, 1890, and
from there the troops and reporters made
their way to Pine Ridge Agency, where they all
soon discovered that there was no crisis to be
found. Soon a regular fare of rumors and lies
began to appear in the national press, fed by
merchants who wanted to keep the reporters,
and their expense accounts, engaged in the
economically strained communities south of
the Pine Ridge Reservation. These fantastic
stories fed a growing national anxiety about
impending war. They also appeared on the
reservations, where Lakotas who had been educated
in the nation's Indian schools read the
reports of troop activities and the rumors of
outbreak to other members of their community.
In this manner, the press became an important
factor in stoking the anxiety both on
and off the reservation.</p>

                     <p>By mid-December 1890 the combination of
news reports, governmental reports (particularly
those of the panic-stricken Royer), and
Ghost Dancing had every nerve in the region
on edge. The Lakotas polarized into political
camps commonly referred to in the press as
"hostiles" and "friendlies," a distinction between
those who were opposed and those who
were reconciled to reservation life. The Ghost
Dancers were generally assigned to the "hostiles"
camp. On December 15, 1890, the Hunkpapa
holy man and Ghost Dance leader, Sitting
Bull, was killed at Standing Rock Agency. Sitting
Bull's death was seen by many as the fate
that awaited all who failed to accept reservation
life. To the south, at Cheyenne River
Agency, the Miniconjou Lakotas grew nervous.
Their leader, Big Foot, was also engaged in the
Ghost Dance, and though not considered a
major threat, he was under close observation
by the military. In an attempt to quiet the Miniconjous,
the military asked a local squatter
named John Dunn to persuade them to acquiesce
to the military's wishes that they stay in
their own village on the reservation. Dunn's
tactics are inexplicable: he is reported to have
told the Miniconjous that the military planned
to take their men prisoner and deport them to
an island in the Atlantic Ocean. He apparently
advised them to take sanctuary on Pine Ridge
Reservation.</p>

                     <p>On December 23, the Miniconjous left their
village in the dead of night and fled south
toward the Badlands. Big Foot soon contracted
pneumonia, which slowed the escape.
Nonetheless, the tribe managed to avoid the
military pursuit for five days. But on December
28, the Seventh Cavalry intercepted the
ailing Big Foot and his people and ordered
them into confinement on Wounded Knee
Creek. On the morning of December 29, Col.
James W. Forsyth convened a council with the
Miniconjous. He demanded that they surrender
all their firearms and told them that
they would be relocated to a new camp. The
order to a new camp was interpreted by the
Miniconjous as exile, probably to Indian Territory,
a prospect that they found intolerable.</p>

                     <p>While these discussions proceeded in the
Lakota camp, a number of Indians began singing
Ghost Dance songs, with some rising to
throw handfuls of dirt in the air. The troops who
surrounded them perceived the singing and dirt
throwing as signals to attack, and at this tense
moment the fuse was lit. A man named Black
Coyote (sometimes called Black Fox) refused to
surrender his rifle to a soldier. The two began
wrestling over the gun, and in the struggle it
discharged. Immediately the nervous troops began
firing, while the Miniconjous retrieved their
weapons and returned fire. The military's rifle
fire was complemented with cannon rounds
from Hotchkiss guns, whose accuracy and exploding
shells were formidable. The outnumbered
and outgunned Lakotas fled, and for
several hours intermittent gunfire continued,
with the military in pursuit. Bodies were found
as far away as three miles from the camp. Firing
ceased, and by midafternoon the troops had
gathered up their dead and wounded, as well as
Lakota wounded, and returned to Pine Ridge
Agency. The fear of a reprisal attack kept
troops and civilians entrenched at the agency
until January 3, 1891, when a military-escorted
civilian burial party proceeded to the site of
the massacre. There they buried 146 Lakotas
in a single mass grave. Other dead were accounted
for later, bringing the total to more
than 250 Lakotas; the Seventh Cavalry lost
twenty-five men.</p>

                     <p>Photographers accompanied the burial detail
and made a total of sixteen photographs.
A snowstorm that occurred shortly after the
massacre added a cold and grim edge to the
scene of carnage. The photographs sold well
and, together with news stories, carried the
story of the massacre at Wounded Knee worldwide.
Soon the event developed a meaning that
transcended the reality of the tragic loss of life,
and Wounded Knee became, and remains, the
symbol of the inhumanity of U.S. government
policy toward Native Americans.</p>

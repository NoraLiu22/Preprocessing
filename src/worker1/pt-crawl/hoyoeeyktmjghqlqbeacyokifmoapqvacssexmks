<p class="one"><span class="caption">Refuge for the Destitute  &mdash; Ward for Females</span> from the
<span class="book">Illustrated London News</span> (23 December 1843): 417.  11.8 cm high
by 15.5 cm wide. The women's ward appears better lit than the <a href="6.html">men's</a>, but both have
the look of converted warehouses (note straw for bedding being carried
to the second storey for storage). Both dormitories prominently
feature "No Smoking" signs, suggesting that lower-class women as well
as men were accustomed to smoking, and that such a habit would present
a significant fire-hazard.</p>

<p>The general jollity of <a href="4.html">Kenny Meadows</a>' and <a href="2.html">Alfred Crowquill</a>'s
illustrations of the Spirit of Christmas, anticipating the formulation
of Father Christmas in the coming decade, is undercut by the stark
misery of the London refuges for the indigent and unemployed. "<a href="1.html">A
Christmas 'At Home'</a>" celebrates the reunion of an upper-middle class
family around the dinner table, but there is not even smoking
permitted into the shelters which divide the menm from their wives and
children. The <span class="book">ILN</span>'s positive images celebrate superfluity and
conviviality, even such realistic pieces as "<a href="3.html">Prize Meat</a>" showing that
some families in the 1840s enjoyed comfortable affluence.</p>

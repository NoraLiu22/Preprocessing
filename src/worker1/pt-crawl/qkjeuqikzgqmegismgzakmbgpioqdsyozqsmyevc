<h3>Passage Illustrated</h3>

<p class="lq">The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced 
towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw 
new meaning in its solemn shape.</p>

<p class="lq">"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point," said Scrooge, 
"answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they 
shadows of things that May be, only?"</p>

<p class="lq">Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.</p>

<p class="lq">"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, 
they must lead," said Scrooge. "But if the courses be departed from, the ends will 
change. Say it is thus with what you show me."</p>

<p class="lq">The Spirit was immovable as ever.</p>

<p class="lq">Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, 
read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.</p>

<p class="lq">"Am <em>I</em> that man who lay upon the bed?" he cried, upon his knees.</p>

<p class="lq">The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.</p>

<p class="lq">"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!"</p>

<p class="lq">The finger still was there.</p>

<p class="lq">"Spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, "hear me. I am not the man 
I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, 
if I am past all hope?"</p>

<p class="lq">For the first time the hand appeared to shake.</p>

<p class="lq">"Good Spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: "Your 
nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows 
you have shown me, by an altered life."</p>

<p class="lq">The kind hand trembled. ["Stave Four: The Last of the Spirits," pp. 
149-151]</p>

<p>Scrooge's social reintegration has now begun; his spiritual reclamation is 
complete once he has gained spiritual and social insight from the periphrastically-named
"Last of the Spirits."</p>

<p class ="lq">The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. . . . . The phantom
spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing. . . . [Stave Four, pages 121 
and 139]</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p class="one">Who is this "last" Spirit whose skeletal finger points inexorably down,
towards the grave-marker in the City cemetery in Leech's celebrated confrontation between 
Ebenezer Scrooge and his own mortality? Shrouded in black cloth suggestive of deep 
mourning (and the veil of years separating the present from the future), both face and 
figure of the "phantom" are indiscernible, but Leech, undoubtedly following Dickens's 
instructions to make this last, most terrifying character indistinct, renders the pointing 
finger prominently by its central position. Generations of readers have plausibly assumed 
that the finger is that of the future, of Scrooge's personal destiny, indicating firmly 
the miser's future state. But, being mortal, of course Scrooge will die, Scrooge the 
human being, the moneylender, businessman, curmudgeon, skinflint, heart-hardened adult 
once a lonely, deserted child — the literary character, on the other hand, has
enjoyed some hundred and seventy years of immortality, thanks in part to each successive 
generation's reinterpretation of the inveterate miser. Suppose instead, following the 
logic of a narrative, we, the readers, identify with the subject of the ghostly 
visitations and, through our imaginations, undergo what Scrooge undergoes. Is it not 
plausible, then, that the finger points for us, too, as the church-bell tolls for John 
Donne in "Meditation 17"? "Never ask for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for thee." In our 
mortality as in our less gracious attributes, we are all Ebenezer Scrooge. And this, I 
think, is Leech's point. Whereas the other Spirits make plain through utterance their
personal connection to the protagonist — "Long past?". . . "No. Your past" (Stave 
Two, p. 45) — this gloomy, mute entity makes no such articulate assurance: this is 
the future to which in the text and in illustrations by Leech, Eytinge, and Furniss we 
must all come:</p>

<p class="lq">A churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, 
lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by
grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up with
too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!</p>

<p>In the 1840s, with the imminent threat of 
<a href="../../../science/health/cholera.html">typhus and cholera</a> everywhere in the 
metropolis, the closing of this final spiritual visitation would have been particularly 
telling for Dickens's comfortable, middle-class readers. In the original 1843 text the 
reader encounters this passage (verso) as he or she studies the coloured illustration 
(recto), the dominant colours of which are as somber and the poses of the repentant miser 
and implacable Spirit are static and yet emotionally moving. The last of the four 
hand-painted illustrations, this steel-engraving lacks the brightness of the frontispiece, 
<a href="../carol/l.html"><span class="illustration">The Fezziwig Ball</span></a>, <a 
href="../carol/2.html"><span class="illustration">Marley's Ghost</span></a>, and <a 
href="../carol/5.html"><span class="illustration">Scrooge's Third Visitor"</span></a>, 
all three of which feature illuminated interiors and action: the dancing couple in the 
jolly byegone days of the Regency, the young lovers under mistletoe, the bespectacled 
fiddler; the advancing ghost and Scrooge warming his hands ineffectually before the
fitful fire; the jolly giant holding aloft his torch in his right hand and gesturing 
towards Scrooge with open palm. Here we leave the fully constructed environments of human 
habitation for a zone in which nature, exemplified by rank vegetation and a skeletal tree 
(left), and the works of man (the area railing, the grave, the tomb, the church and tenements in the
backdrop) coexist. Again, as in Leech's picture of Christmas Present, the
dominant figure is the Spirit to the left; to the right, dwarfed by this
memento mori is a prostrate, diminutive Scrooge, no longer in his protective
nightcap, but bald, vulnerable, pathetic. After this tableau of an inexorable
fate and a shattered mortal, no longer the cocky capitalist mouthing
Malthusian sentiments, the dialogue that is really monologue continues, as we
read through the illustration and into the text:</p>

<p class="lq">"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?" he cried, upon his knees.</p>

<p class="lq">The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.</p>

<p class="lq">"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!"</p>

<p class="lq">The finger still was there.</p>

<p class="lq">"Spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, "hear me. I am not the man 
I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, 
if I am past all hope?"</p>

<p class="lq">For the first time the hand appeared to shake.</p>

<p class="lq">"Good Spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: "Your
nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these
shadows you have shown me, by an altered life."</p>

<p class="lq">The <em>kind</em> hand trembled. [emphasis added: Stave Four: "The Last of 
the Spirits," pp. 150-151]</p>

<p>The answer to Scrooge's rhetorical question is "yes and no," for he certainly was the 
subject of the discussions at the Exchange and at the rag-and-bone dealer's, but for the 
thoughtful reader (the original reader much aware of his own mortality at the Christmas 
of 1843) the answer must surely be "no," for that mortal, dying unfriended and alone and 
cursorily dismissed by the surviving members of the species, is the reader himself. The 
skeletal hand is specifically — enigmatically, surprisingly in terms of Dickens's 
diction —"kind," a gentle reminder to every reader then and since that mortality is 
an essential and necessary part of the human condition as Nature nudges one generation 
out to make room for the next.</p>

<p>Compare Leech's original, moving by its pose and the juxtaposition of the churchyard 
and the figures, to those of Sol Eytinge, Jr. (1868) and Fred Barnard (1878). In 
Eytinge's <a href="../eytinge/47.html"><span class="illustration">In the 
Churchyard</span></a> the illustrator has moved in for the close up, positioning a 
petitioning Scrooge at the very feet of the relentless pointer. A mist seems to shroud 
both figures as the faceless entity above the gnarled and wizened miser proclaims mutely 
the inevitability of his fate; but already, on the facing page, Scrooge has discovered 
the possible hope of free will:</p>

<p class="lq">"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends to which, if persevered in, 
they must lead," said Scrooge. "But if the courses be departed from, the ends will
change. Say it is thus with that you show me!" [Stave Four, p. 101]</p>

<p>Over the page, the Spirit's "kind hand" trembles, as if considering the merits
of the petitioner's case, and wavering in its stern judgment. Readers of the
1868 volume, lavishly illustrated (albeit, without the benefit of colourized
etchings) would undoubtedly have compared Eytinge's revision with Leech's
original, for we may assume that copies had made their way into lending
libraries across the Atlantic. The subject of Leech's "The Last of the
Spirits,"  a grim reminder of human mortality set in a London churchyard in
the depth of winter (as signalled by the leafless, blackened tree overhanging
the black-shrouded Phantom) had already been in circulation via American
pirated editions for a quarter of a century. Whereas, in Leech, Scrooge hides
his head in remorse (and, perhaps, self-pity), in Eytinge's less emblematic
and more realistic "In The Churchyard" Scrooge grabs at the Spirit's
draperies, begging for mercy as the figure relentlessly points downward, as in
Leech's steel engraving, at the grave marker displaying the name "Ebenezer
Scrooge," albeit less clearly lettered than in Leech's. Perhaps owing to the
exigencies of the wood-engraving medium, Eytinge's 1868 version — for surely
he was influenced by Leech's composition as well as Dickens's text — seems a
pallid imitation singularly lacking in detail, providing only weeds and an
area railing, and a less obscure, more skeletal form for "The Spirit of
Christmas Yet To Come." Leech has placed the grave at the very centre of his
composition, moving the figures towards the right and left margins,
highlighting the grave marker, and sketching in the urban background more
effectively. Finally, in Leech's plate Scrooge has apparently just read the
stone's inscription and "on his knees" cries, "Am I the man who lay upon the
bed?", whereas we seem to be seeing the same scene moments later in Eytinge's:</p>

<p class="lq">"Spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, "hear me! I am not the man 
I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, 
if I am past all hope?"</p>

<p class="lq">For the first time the hand appeared to shake. [Stave 4, "The Last of the
Spirits"]</p>

<p>The particularity with which Leech has realised the scene implies that he used
a definite locale as the basis for his highly atmospheric his setting;
according to Gwen Major (1932) the graveyard he had in mind was that of All
Hallows Staining, Star Alley, off Mark Lane, in London's Langborn Ward.
Eytinge's treatment of his backdrop is so general that it suggests no
particular locale, but then Eytinge had no such intimate knowledge of the
geographical setting of the novella. See "Scrooge's Chambers," in the
Dickensian, Winter 1932-33, in which Major also locates Scrooge's office as
being in St. Michael's Alley, which appropriately was in the vicinity of the
London Exchange.</p>

<p>The later illustrators in the Anglo-American 
<a href="../barnard/household.html">Household Edition</a> of the 1870s,
<a href="../abbey/index.html">E. A. Abbey</a> and <a href="../barnard/index.html">Fred 
Barnard</a>, perhaps wishing to avoid comparison with Leech's work, focus on very 
different scenes in the final; stage of Scrooge's epiphany. Barnard instead examines on 
the scene in the 'Change when Scrooge's fellow-capitalists joke about his death and the 
one in which the undertaker's man, the laundrywoman, and Mrs. Dilber approach Old Joe at 
the marine store shop with their plunder from Scrooge's chamber. More hopefully, Abbey 
depicts <a href="../abbey/6,html">Fred's welcoming his wayward uncle</a>, a changed man, 
into his home on Christmas Day, a half-page wood-engraving facing the very last page of 
text, and therefore inducing in the reader a more optimistic and seasonal response than
Barnard's ironic, anti-mercantilist visual commentaries on the fate of the investor who 
once believed it was enough to be "a good man of business," rather than "a good man whose 
business is mankind."</p>

<p>The <a href="../furniss/index.html">Harry Furniss</a> illustration, the final in his 
series of eight for the <span class="book">Carol</span> in the Charles Dickens Library 
Edition of 1910 (arguably the last Victorian treatment of the novella), is both an 
homage to Leech and a more modern reworking of the Victorian original. This india-ink and 
wash drawing transformed into a lithograph again shows the pervasive influence of John
Leech's original series of illustrations for the novella, for Furniss has borrowed even 
the title and all the essential ingredients of the 1843 steel engraving.</p>

<p>This vigorous india-ink and wash drawing transformed into a lithograph again
shows the pervasive influence of John Leech's original series of illustrations
for the novella, for Furniss has borrowed even the title. For Furniss, the
illustration marks the end of Scrooge's dream and the beginning of his social
reintegration as he determines to erase the writing from the stone by
henceforth leading "an altered life" (70) and engaging with humanity rather
than alienating himself from it. The insistent finger of The Spirit of
Christmas Yet To Come (simply designated "The Phantom" by the narrator), the
finger of Fate, dominates the entire composition from its central position.
Furniss's version is more dynamic and impressionistic than Leech's original,
as he sharply delineates only the foreground and the figures. Reversing the
positions of the two figures, Furniss maintains their postures, but makes the
spirit materialise or hover above rather than stand above Scrooge's grave: the
skeletal tree has receded in this cinematic closeup.</p>

<p>The elements of the picture, despite Furniss's distinctive and impressionistic
touches, will be familiar to most readers: the grave-marker bearing Scrooge's
name (left of centre), with a gravestone and the corner of a monument in the
foreground, and the London churchyard's area railing in the upper right; and,
of course, the anguished Scrooge, kneeling above his own grave (left) and the
implacable spirit, shrouded and unknowable, in the right-hand register.
Eytinge's "In the Churchyard" is also clearly derivative, but lacks the drama
and dynamic energy of Furniss's and the effective detailing of Leech's. The
unfinished look of the illustration, with the multiple lines at the bottom of
the Spirit's shroud, for example, and the staccato treatment of the
background, with the merest suggestion of a denuded tree (upper left) is
highly appropriate to the tentative nature of this Spirit's projections of
Scrooge's future, for these events may indeed be altered by his actions in the
present. The overall effect here is dark and dismal, but the light plays on
Scrooge's bald head and grave, highlighting his capacity for making an
intellectual and spiritual change in his motivations and behaviours.</p>

<p>Although there is no equivalent illustration in the Household Edition sequences of E. 
A. Abbey (1876) and Fred Barnard (1878), surprisingly (given his tendency to avoid 
unpleasant subjects in this picture-book intended for a child audience) the last great 
19th c. visual interpreter of the novella, Arthur Rackham, has provided a wood-engraved 
headpiece for the fourth stave in which the mute spirit, his swirling shroud agitated by 
the winds of destiny, compels his mortal companion to read the tombstone (left), on which 
are inscribed not merely Scrooge's name, but the bare data of his life — the cold, 
enscribed facts that Scrooge as a Utilitarian man of commerce and trade has so valued
above the spirit of the words. With a view to revealing the underlying psychology of the 
scene, Rackham and Furniss have both adopted the strategy of turning the dread figure 
away from the viewer, so that he or she must construct the face under the hood, whereas 
Leech completely enshrouds the visage of this future spirit, suggesting the deep mourning 
that one encounters in such Dickens novels as <span class="book">Oliver Twist</span> and 
<span class="book">Great Expectations. Again, the illustrators remind us that the dread 
figure of Death, a reaper conspicuously without a sickle or scythe, marks each of us for 
his own.</p>

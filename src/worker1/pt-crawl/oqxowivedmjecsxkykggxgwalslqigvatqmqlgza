<P> <I>These lives are unlikely to have been written by Plutarch himself, but nevertheless they contain much unique and valuable information about the ten Athenian orators, most of whom lived in the 4th century B.C.   The names of the orators are:</I>

<P>  <A CLASS="ref" NAME="832">[832]</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiphon.html#1">Antiphon</A> was the son of Sophilus, and his <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deme">deme</A> was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhamnus.html#1">Rhamnus.</A> <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif">He was a pupil of his father (for his father was a <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist">sophist</A>, and it is said that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alcibiades.html#1">Alcibiades</A> as a boy attended his school), and having acquired power in speaking - as some think, through his own natural ability - he entered upon a public career. And he set up a school and had his disagreement with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/socrates.html#1">Socrates</A> on the subject of words, not in a contentious spirit, but for the sake of argument, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/x/xenophon.html#1">Xenophon</A> has narrated in his Memoirs { <I>Mem. i. 6</I> }. And he wrote some speeches for citizens who wanted them for their suits in the law-courts, being the first who practised this profession, as some say. <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../dd.gif">At any rate no legal oration is extant of any of those who lived before his time, nor of his contemporaries either, because the custom of speech-writing had not yet arisen ; there is none by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/themistocles.html#1">Themistocles,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristeides.html#1">Aristeides,</A> or <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pericles.html#1">Pericles,</A> although the times afforded them many opportunities and also occasions when such speeches were needed. And it was not for lack of ability that they refrained from such speech-writing, as is evident from what is said by the historians about each of the above-mentioned orators. Yet all those whom we are able to record as having practised this kind of speeches, going back to the earliest occurrence, <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ee.gif">will be found to have followed Antiphon when he was already old ; I mean such as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alcibiades.html#1">Alcibiades,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/critias.html#1">Critias,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias,</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archinus.html#2">Archinus.</A> He was also the first to publish rules of the art of oratory, being of sharp intellect, and for this reason he was nicknamed <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nestor.html#1">Nestor. </A>
 
<P>  And <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caecilius.html#6">Caecilius,</A> in the treatise he compiled about him, conjectures from the terms in which <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiphon.html#1">Antiphon</A> is praised in the work of the historian <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thucydides.html#1">Thucydides</A> that he was the latter's teacher <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn1" ID="nr1" TITLE="1">**</A>. In his speeches he is accurate and persuasive, clever in invention, ingenious in handling perplexing cases ; he attacks unexpectedly, and he addresses his arguments to both the laws and the emotions, aiming especially at propriety. <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ff.gif">He was born at the time of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars">Persian Wars</A> and of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist">sophist</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gorgias.html#1">Gorgias,</A> who was somewhat older than he ; and his life extended until the destruction of the democracy by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_coup_of_411_BC">Four Hundred</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn2" ID="nr2" TITLE="2">**</A>, in causing which he seems himself to have had a part, at one time by being <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trierarch">trierarch</A> of two ships, at another by being general <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn3" ID="nr3" TITLE="3">**</A> and gaining many victories in battle and winning important alliances for the Four Hundred, by arming the men of military age, by manning sixty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme">triremes</A>, and by being on every occasion their envoy to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemon</A> at the time when Eetioneia <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn4" ID="nr4" TITLE="4">**</A> had been fortified. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="833">[833]</A> And after the overthrow of the Four Hundred he was indicted along with Archeptolemus, one of the Four Hundred, was found guilty, subjected to the punishments prescribed for traitors, thrown out unburied, and inscribed along with his descendants in the list of the disfranchised. But some tell us that he was put to death by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants">Thirty,</A> as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias</A> says in his speech in defence of Antiphon's daughter ; for he had a daughter whom Callaeschrus claimed in marriage by legal process. And that he was put to death by the Thirty is told also by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/theopompus.html#1">Theopompus</A> in the fifteenth book of his <I>Philippics</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn5" ID="nr5" TITLE="5">**</A> ; <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../bb.gif">but that must have been another Antiphon, the son of Lysidonides, whom <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cratinus.html#3">Cratinus</A> also, in his play <I>The Flask</I>, mentions as a rascal ; for how could a man who had died previously and had been put to death by the Four Hundred be living again in the time of the Thirty ? But there is also another story of his death : that he sailed as envoy to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracuse</A> when the tyranny of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#1">Dionysius</A> the First was at its height, and at a convivial gathering the question arose what bronze was the best ; then when most of the guests disagreed, he said that bronze was the best from which the statues of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/harmodius.html#1">Harmodius</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristogeiton.html#2">Aristogeiton</A> were made ; and when Dionysius heard this, suspecting that the remark was intended to encourage an attack upon himself, he ordered that Antiphon be put to death. <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif">But others say that he was angry because Antiphon made fun of his tragedies. 
 
<P>  There are current sixty orations ascribed to this orator, twenty-five of which <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caecilius.html#6">Caecilius</A> says are spurious. He is ridiculed as a lover of money by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/platon.html#1">Platon</A> in his <I>Peisander</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn6" ID="nr6" TITLE="6">**</A>. And he is said to have written tragedies both by himself and in collaboration with the tyrant <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#1">Dionysius.</A> But while he was still busy with poetry, he invented a method of curing distress, just as physicians have a treatment for those who are ill ; and at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/corinth.html#1">Corinth,</A> fitting up a room near the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora">agora</A>, he wrote on the door that he could cure by words those who were in distress ; <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../dd.gif">and by asking questions and finding out the causes of their condition he consoled those in trouble. But thinking this art was unworthy of him he turned to oratory. There are some who ascribe also to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiphon.html#1">Antiphon</A> the book <I>On Poets</I> by Glaucus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhegium.html#1">Rhegium</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn7" ID="nr7" TITLE="7">**</A>. His most admired orations are the one concerning Herodes, that against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/erasistratus.html#2">Erasistratus</A> about the peacocks, that on the Indictment, which he wrote in his own defence, and that against the general <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demosthenes.html#1">Demosthenes</A> for moving an illegal measure. He wrote also a speech against the general <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hippocrates.html#3">Hippocrates</A> and caused him to be convicted by default. 
 
<P> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caecilius.html#6">Caecilius</A> has appended a decree passed in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archonship</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/theopompus.html#1">Theopompus</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn8" ID="nr8" TITLE="8">**</A>, the year in which the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_coup_of_411_BC">Four Hundred</A> were overthrown, <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ee.gif">according to which the senate voted the trial of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiphon.html#1">Antiphon</A> : 
 
<P>  Voted by the senate on the twenty-first day of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prytaneis">prytany</A>. Demonicus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alopece.html#1">Alopece</A> was secretary, Philostratus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pallene.html#2">Pallen&#275;</A> was president. Andron moved in regard to the men whom the generals denounce for acting to the detriment of the State of the Athenians while serving as envoys to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemon</A> and for sailing from the camp in a ship of the enemy and for having passed by land through <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/deceleia.html#1">Deceleia,</A> <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ff.gif">namely Archeptolemus, Onomacles, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiphon.html#1">Antiphon,</A> that they be arrested and brought before the court for trial. And the generals, with those members of the senate whom they shall co-opt to the number of ten, are directed to produce them in court, that they may be present at the trial. And the Thesmothetae <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn9" ID="nr9" TITLE="9">**</A> shall summon them to-morrow, and when the summonses have been returned to the court, they shall propose that the chosen prosecutors and the generals and others, if anyone so desire, shall accuse them of treason; and whomsoever the court may convict, he shall be treated in accordance with the law which has been passed relating to traitors. 
 
<P>  <A CLASS="ref" NAME="834">[834]</A> Under this enactment the judgement is written : 
 
<P>  Archeptolemus, son of Hippodamus, of Agryle, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiphon.html#1">Antiphon,</A> son of Sophilus, of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhamnus.html#1">Rhamnus,</A> both being present, were found guilty of treason. The sentence passed upon them was that they be handed over to the Eleven for execution, that their belongings be confiscated and ten per cent thereof be given to the Goddess, that their houses be torn down and boundary-stones be set up on their sites with the inscription "Land of Archeptolemus and Antiphon the two traitors"; and that the two <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchos">demarchs</A> make a declaration of their property; and that it be forbidden to bury Archeptolemus and Antiphon at Athens or in any place ruled by the Athenians ; and that Archeptolemus and Antiphon be attainted, and also their descendants legitimate and illegitimate ; and that if anyone shall adopt <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../bb.gif">any descendant of Archeptolemus or Antiphon, he who so adopts shall be attainted ; and that this be inscribed on a bronze tablet, which shall be set up where the decrees relating to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phrynichus.html#1">Phrynichus</A> are placed. 
 
<P>  <B>II. &nbsp; <A NAME="Andocides">ANDOCIDES</A></B> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0344%3Achapter%3D2"> G</A>

<P> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/andocides.html#2">Andocides</A> was the son of Leogoras, son of that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/andocides.html#1">Andocides</A> who once made peace between the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemonians</A> and the Athenians <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn10" ID="nr10" TITLE="10">**</A>; he was as regards his <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deme">deme</A> a <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cydathenaeon.html#1">Cydathenian</A> or a <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thorae.html#1">Thorian,</A> and was descended from nobles, and even, according to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hellanicus.html#1">Hellanicus</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn11" ID="nr11" TITLE="11">**</A>, from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hermes.html#1">Hermes</A> ; <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif">for the race of heralds traces its origin to him. On this account, too, he was once chosen along with Glaucon to go with twenty ships to aid the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/corcyra.html#1">Corcyraeans</A> who were embroiled with the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/corinth.html#1">Corinthians.</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn12" ID="nr12" TITLE="12">**</A> And after this he was accused of impiety as being one of those who mutilated the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herma">Hermae</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn13" ID="nr13" TITLE="13">**</A> and as profaning the mysteries of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demeter.html#1">Demeter</A> <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../dd.gif">[because at an earlier time he was dissipated and in a nocturnal revel had broken one of the images of the god, and when he was indicted refused to surrender the slave whom his accusers were looking for, so that he gained a bad name and was suspected and accused in the second suit also, which was brought shortly after the expedition went to Sicily, when the Corinthians sent in men from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leontini.html#1">Leontini</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/segesta.html#1">Egesta</A> and, as the Athenians hesitated about aiding them privately, they mutilated the Hermae about the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora">agora</A>, as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cratippus.html#1">Cratippus</A> says, and profaned the mysteries besides]. At his trial on these charges he was acquitted on condition that he should inform against the wrongdoers. He exerted himself greatly <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ee.gif">and discovered those who were guilty of the sacrilege, among whom he informed against his own father. And he brought about the conviction and death of all the others, but saved his father, although he had already been put in prison, by promising that he would be of great service to the city. And he kept his promise ; for Leogoras caused the conviction of many men who were embezzling public funds and committing other misdeeds. And for these reasons he was acquitted of the charge. 
 
<P>  But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/andocides.html#2">Andocides,</A> since his reputation in public life was not good, took to merchandising and became a friend of the Cypriote kings and many other men of note, at which time he abducted a girl of Athenian birth, daughter of Aristeides and his own niece, without the knowledge of her family, and sent her as a gift to the King of Cyprus. <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ff.gif">Then, when he was to be brought to trial for this, he stole her back again from Cyprus and was caught and put in prison by the king ; but he ran away and came back to Athens at the time when the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_coup_of_411_BC">Four Hundred</A> were in control of affairs. He was put in prison by them, but escaped, and again, when the oligarchy was overthrown, he . . . was banished from the city after the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants">Thirty</A> had taken over the government. He spent the period of his exile in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/elis.html#1">Elis,</A> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="835">[835]</A> but when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrasybulus.html#1">Thrasybulus</A> and his band returned <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn14" ID="nr14" TITLE="14">**</A>, he also returned to the city. He was sent to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemon</A> to negotiate a peace, but was suspected of wrongdoing <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn15" ID="nr15" TITLE="15">**</A> and banished. He gives information about all this in the speeches which he wrote ; for some of them he composed in his defence in the matter of the mysteries, and others when he was asking to be allowed to return home. There is also extant his speech <I>On the Indictment</I>, also the <I>Defence against Phaeax</I> and the speech <I>On the Peace</I>. He flourished at the same time as <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/socrates.html#1">Socrates</A> the philosopher ; the date of his birth was the seventy-eighth <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad">Olympiad,</A> when Theogenides was <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archon</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn16" ID="nr16" TITLE="16">**</A> at Athens, so that he was about ten years older <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn17" ID="nr17" TITLE="17">**</A> than <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias.</A> The <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herma">Hermes</A> called the Hermes of Andocides is named after him. It is a dedication of the tribe <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aegeis.html#1">Aegeis</A> <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../bb.gif">and is called Hermes of Andocides because Andocides lived near it. He himself supplied the chorus for his tribe <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn18" ID="nr18" TITLE="18">**</A> when it was competing in a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithyramb">dithyrambic</A> contest, and he gained the victory, for which he set up a tripod on a high spot opposite the limestone <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/silenus.html#1">Silenus.</A> He is simple and free from artifice in his orations, plain and employing no figures of speech.

<P>  <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif"> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias</A> was the son of Cephalus, grandson of Lysanias, and great-grandson of Cephalus. His father was by birth a <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracusan</A> but moved to Athens because he wished to live in that city and also because <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pericles.html#1">Pericles,</A> son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/x/xanthippus.html#1">Xanthippus,</A> persuaded him to do so, as he was a personal friend of Pericles and they were connected by ties of hospitality, and he was a man of great wealth. But some say that he moved because he was banished from Syracuse when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gelon.html#2">Gelon</A> was tyrant. Lysias was born at Athens in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archonship</A> of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philocles.html#1">Philocles</A> {<FONT CLASS="green">459-458 B.C.</FONT>} who succeeded Phrasicles <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn19" ID="nr19" TITLE="19">**</A>, in the second year of the eightieth <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad">Olympiad,</A> and at first he was a schoolmate of the most prominent Athenians ; but when the city sent the colony to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sybaris.html#1">Sybaris,</A> <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../dd.gif">which was afterwards renamed <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thurii.html#1">Thurii,</A> he went out with his eldest brother Polemarchus (for he had two others, Euthydemus and Brachyllus), their father being already dead, to share in the allotment of land <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn20" ID="nr20" TITLE="20">**</A>. This was in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archonship</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/praxiteles.html#1">Praxiteles</A> {<FONT CLASS="green">444-443 B.C.</FONT>}, and he was then fifteen years old. He remained there, was instructed by the Syracusans Teisias and Nicias, acquired a house, had a share of the allotment, and was a citizen for thirty-three years, until Cleocritus was <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archon</A> at Athens <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn21" ID="nr21" TITLE="21">**</A>.

He was deprived of his property and lost his brother Polemarchus, <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ff.gif">but he himself escaped from the house in which he was kept to be executed (for it had two doors) <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn25" ID="nr25" TITLE="25">**</A> and lived at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/megara.html#1">Megara.</A> But when the men at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phyle.html#1">Phyle</A> set about their return to Athens, he was seen to be more helpful than anyone else, since he supplied two thousand <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma">drachmas</A> and two hundred shields and, when sent with Hermas, hired three hundred mercenaries and persuaded Thrasydaeus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/elis.html#1">Elis,</A> who had become his guest-friend, to give two <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A>. For these services <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thrasybulus.html#1">Thrasybulus,</A> after the restoration of the exiles to the city and in the period of anarchy <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn26" ID="nr26" TITLE="26">**</A> before <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/eucleides.html#1">Eucleides,</A> proposed a grant of citizenship for him, and the popular assembly ratified the grant, but when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archinus.html#2">Archinus</A> had him up for illegality because it had not been previously voted by the senate <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn27" ID="nr27" TITLE="27">**</A>, <A CLASS="ref" NAME="836">[836]</A> the enactment was declared void. And after losing his citizenship in this way, he lived the rest of his life at Athens with all the rights of citizenship except the vote and eligibility to office, and died there at the age of eighty-three years or, as some say, seventy-six or, as others say, over eighty ; and he lived to see <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demosthenes.html#3">Demosthenes</A> as a youth. They say he was born in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archonship</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philocles.html#1">Philocles. </A>
 
<P>  Four hundred and twenty-five orations attributed to him are current. Of these <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#26">Dionysius</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caecilius.html#6">Caecilius</A> and their school say that two hundred and thirty-three are genuine, and he is said to have lost his case with only two of them. There is also his speech in support of the enactment against which <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/archinus.html#2">Archinus</A> brought suit and deprived him of citizenship, <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../bb.gif">and another against the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants">Thirty.</A> He was very persuasive and concise and produced most of his speeches for private clients. There are also <I>Textbooks of Rhetoric</I> prepared by him, and <I>Public Addresses, Letters</I> and <I>Eulogies, Funeral Speeches, Love Speeches</I>, and a <I>Defence of Socrates</I> addressed to the judges <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn28" ID="nr28" TITLE="28">**</A>. In the matter of his diction he appears to be easy, although in fact he is hard to imitate <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn29" ID="nr29" TITLE="29">**</A>. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demosthenes.html#3">Demosthenes</A> in his speech against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/neaera.html#1">Neaera</A> { <I>lix. 21</I> } says that he was in love with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/metaneira.html#1">Metaneira,</A> a fellow-slave with Neaera ; but later he married the daughter of his brother Brachyllus. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/plato.html#1">Plato</A> also mentions him in the <I>Phaedrus</I> { <I>279A</I> } <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif">as an able speaker and older than <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isocrates.html#1">Isocrates.</A> Moreover Philiscus, a pupil of Isocrates and comrade of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias,</A> composed an <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegiac_couplet">elegiac</A> poem to him, from which it is plain that he was earlier in years, which is indicated also by what Plato said. The verses are as follows : 
 
<BR> &nbsp;  Now, O <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/calliope.html#1">Calliop&#275;'s</A> daughter endowed with great eloquence Phrontis,

<BR> &nbsp;  Him who is altered and changed to another form, him who in other

<P>  He also wrote two speeches for <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/iphicrates.html#1">Iphicrates,</A> one against Harmodius, the other for use in accusing <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/timotheus.html#3">Timotheus</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn32" ID="nr32" TITLE="32">**</A> of treason, with both of which he won his case ; but when Iphicrates accepted the responsibility for the actions of Timotheus, assuming at the rendering of accounts the accusation for treason, he defended himself with the speech by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias</A> ; and he himself was acquitted, but Timotheus was very heavily fined. And at the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/o/olympic.html#1">Olympic</A> festival also he read a very great oration urging that the Greeks make peace with one another and overthrow <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#1">Dionysius.</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn33" ID="nr33" TITLE="33">**</A>

<P> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isocrates.html#1">Isocrates</A> was the son of Theodorus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/erchia.html#1">Erchia,</A> a citizen of the middle class, an owner of slaves who made flutes, through whom he became prosperous, so that he paid for a public chorus <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn34" ID="nr34" TITLE="34">**</A> and gave his children an education <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn35" ID="nr35" TITLE="35">**</A>(for he had other sons, Telesippus and Diomnestus, and also a daughter), and hence he is ridiculed on account of the flutes by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aristophanes.html#1">Aristophanes</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/strattis.html#1">Strattis.</A> <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ff.gif">Isocrates was born in the eighty-sixth <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad">Olympiad,</A> in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_of_Athens">archonship</A> of Lysimachus of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/myrrhinus.html#1">Myrrhinus</A> {<FONT CLASS="green">436-435 B.C.</FONT>}, being twenty-two years younger than <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias</A> and seven years older than <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/plato.html#1">Plato</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn36" ID="nr36" TITLE="36">**</A>. In his boyhood he was as well educated as any Athenian, for he attended the lectures of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/prodicus.html#1">Prodicus</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/ceos.html#1">Ceos,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gorgias.html#1">Gorgias</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leontini.html#1">Leontini,</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/teisias.html#1">Teisias</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syracuse.html#1">Syracuse,</A> and the orator <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/theramenes.html#1">Theramenes</A> ; and when the last-named was in danger of being arrested by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants">Thirty</A> and had fled for safety to the altar of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hestia.html#1">Hestia</A> Boulaea <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn37" ID="nr37" TITLE="37">**</A>, everyone else was terrified, but Isocrates alone arose to speak in his aid ; and at first he was silent for a long time, <A CLASS="ref" NAME="837">[837]</A> then afterwards he was urged to be silent by Theramenes himself, who said that his misfortune would be more painful if any of his friends should share it. And it is said that certain rhetorical teachings of Theramenes - those which go under the name of Boton - were of use to Isocrates when he was falsely accused in the courts. But when he became a man he kept away from political affairs, since he had a weak voice and a timid disposition <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn38" ID="nr38" TITLE="38">**</A> and had lost his inherited property in the war against the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Lacedaemonians.</A> It is evident that he composed speeches for others, but he delivered only one, that on the <I>Exchange of Property</I>. He set up a school <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../bb.gif">and turned to philosophy and to writing out the results of his thinking, and he composed his </I>Festival Oration</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn39" ID="nr39" TITLE="39">**</A> and some others of an advisory nature, some of which he delivered himself and some of which he prepared for others to deliver, hoping that in this way he might lead the Greeks to think as they ought. But when he failed of his purpose he gave up that sort of thing and became the head of a school, at first, as some say, at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/chios.html#1">Chios,</A> where he had nine pupils. That was the time when, as he saw the tuition fees counted out, he burst into tears and said, "Now I recognise that I have sold myself to these people." He would carry on conversation with all who desired it and was the first to make a distinction between contentious speeches and those of a political character, to which latter he devoted himself. <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif">And he also instituted at Chios public offices and the same constitution which existed in his native city. He made more money than any other <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist">sophist</A>, so that he was even a <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trierarch">trierarch</A>.
 
<P>  His pupils numbered about one hundred, including among many others <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/timotheus.html#3">Timotheus,</A> son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/conon.html#1">Conon,</A> with whom he visited many cities ; and he composed the letters which Timotheus sent to the Athenians, on account of which Timotheus presented him with a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talent</A>out of the sum remaining after the relief of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/samos.html#1">Samos</A> {<FONT CLASS="green">365 B.C.</FONT>}.

There, too, were set up statues of the famous poets along with his ; of these only the poet <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/homer.html#1">Homer</A> exists now. And Leodamas the Athenian and Lacritus the Athenian law-maker and, as some say, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hypereides.html#1">Hypereides</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isaeus.html#1">Isaeus</A> were his pupils. And they say that while he was still teaching oratory <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demosthenes.html#3">Demosthenes</A> came to him eager to learn and said that he could not pay the thousand <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma">drachmas</A> which he asked as tuition fee, but would give two hundred for one fifth of the instruction ; whereupon Isocrates replied : <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ee.gif">"We do not cut our instruction into bits, Demosthenes, but just as people sell fine fish whole, so, if you wish to be my pupil, I will sell you my course whole."

Just before the end he declaimed the opening lines of three dramas of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/euripides.html#1">Euripides</A> :

<P>  <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ff.gif">He died at the age of ninety-eight or, as some say, one hundred years, for he could not endure the sight of Greece enslaved four times <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn44" ID="nr44" TITLE="44">**</A>. A year (or, as some say, four years) before his end he wrote the <I>Panathenaic Oration</I> ; and for the composition of the <I>Festival Oration</I> he took ten (but some say fifteen) years. This, they say, he derived from the speeches of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gorgias.html#1">Gorgias</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leontini.html#1">Leontini</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lysias.html#1">Lysias.</A> The speech on the <I> Exchange of Property</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn45" ID="nr45" TITLE="45">**</A> he wrote at the age of eighty-two years, and those against <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/philippus.html#2">Philip</A> shortly before his death. <A CLASS="ref" NAME="838">[838]</A> When he was an old man he adopted <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aphareus.html#1">Aphareus,</A> the youngest of the three sons of Plathane, daughter of the orator <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hippias.html#3">Hippias.</A> He acquired ample wealth, for he not only collected money from his pupils, but he also received from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicocles.html#2">Nicocles,</A> king of Cyprus, who was the son of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/euagoras.html#1">Evagoras,</A> twenty <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28weight%29">talents</A> for the oration written in his honour. On account of his wealth he was envied and was proposed three times as <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trierarch">trierarch</A>. Twice he alleged illness and was exempted by petitions presented by his son, but the third time he undertook the duty and spent no small sum. To a father who said that he gave his son only a slave as companion he said, "Go your ways, then, for you will have two slaves instead of one." <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../bb.gif">He took part also in the competition offered by <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/artemisia.html#2">Artemisia</A> in honour of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mausolus.html#1">Maussolus</A> <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn46" ID="nr46" TITLE="46">**</A>, but his <I>Eulogy</I> is not extant.

He departed this life some say on the ninth day of his abstention from food, others on the fourth day at the time of the funeral of those who fell at <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaeronea_(338_BC)">Chaeroneia.</A> His son Aphareus also wrote speeches. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/i/isocrates.html#1">Isocrates</A> was buried with his family near <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynosarges">Cynosarges</A> on the left side of the hill - he himself, his father Theodorus, and his mother ; and her sister Anaco, the orator's aunt, and his adopted son Aphareus, <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif">and his cousin Socrates, son of Anaco Isocrates' mother's sister, and his brother Theodorus who had the same name as his father, and his grandsons, the sons of his adopted son Aphareus, Aphareus and his father Theodorus, and the latter's wife Plathane, mother of the adopted son Aphareus. And over them there were six tablets which do not now exist. On the monument of Isocrates himself was a column thirty cubits high, on which was a siren seven cubits high as a symbol ; but this exists no longer. There was also a tablet near by <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../dd.gif">with poets and his instructors on it, among whom was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gorgias.html#1">Gorgias</A> gazing into an astrological sphere and Isocrates standing beside him.

It bears this inscription : 
 
<BR> &nbsp;  Here to the goddesses twain Timotheus giveth this statue 
<BR> &nbsp;  Tribute to friend and to sage, image of Isocrates. 
<BR> &nbsp;  It is a work of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/leochares.html#2">Leochares. </A>
 
<P>  Sixty orations are current under his name, of which twenty-five are genuine according to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/dionysius.html#26">Dionysius,</A> twenty-eight according to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/caecilius.html#6">Caecilius,</A> and the rest are spurious. He was averse to public declamation, so much so that once, when three persons came to hear him, <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ee.gif">he retained two but let the third go, telling him to come the next day, since now the lecture-room had a full audience. And he used to say to his pupils that he himself gave instruction for ten <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina_%28unit%29">minas</A>, but would give ten thousand to anyone who would teach him self-confidence and a pleasant voice. And when he was asked how he, not being a good speaker himself, could make others so, he replied that whetstones cannot themselves cut, but make iron fit to do so. <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ff.gif">Some say that he also wrote textbooks of oratory, others that in his teaching he made use of practice, not of method. He never demanded a fee from a fellow-citizen. When his pupils went to meetings of the assembly, he told them to report to him what was said there. He was greatly grieved by the death of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/socrates.html#1">Socrates,</A> and the next day he appeared in black clothing. And again, when someone asked him "What is oratory ? " he said, "the art of making small things great and great things small." And once when he was a guest at a banquet in the house of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicocreon.html#1">Nicocreon,</A> despot of Cyprus, and some of those present urged him to discourse, he said, "for subjects in which I am competent this is not the time ; in the subjects for which this is the time I am not competent." <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn47" ID="nr47" TITLE="47">**</A> When he saw the tragic poet <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sophocles.html#1">Sophocles</A> amorously following a boy, he said, "Sophocles, we must not only keep our hands to ourselves, <A CLASS="ref" NAME="839">[839]</A> but our eyes as well." <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn48" ID="nr48" TITLE="48">**</A> And when <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/e/ephorus.html#1">Ephorus</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cyme.html#1">Cyme</A> had left his school without learning anything and had been sent back by his father with a second tuition-fee, he called him in fun Diphorus (Twice-bringer) ; he took, however, great pains with him and even suggested to him the subject of his work <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn49" ID="nr49" TITLE="49">**</A>. He showed himself also prone to sexual indulgence ; he used an additional mattress beside him on his bed and kept his pillow wet with saffron. And when he was young he did not marry, <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../bb.gif">but in his old age he kept a mistress named Lagisce, by whom he had a daughter who died unmarried at twelve years of age. Then he married the daughter of the orator <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hippias.html#3">Hippias,</A> Plathane, who had three sons, one of whom, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aphareus.html#1">Aphareus,</A> as has been said above, he adopted. This Aphareus dedicated a bronze statue of him near the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus,_Athens">Olympieium</A> on a column with the inscription : 
 
<BR> &nbsp;  Aphareus set up this statue his father Isocrates' image, 
<BR> &nbsp;  Sacred to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zeus.html#1">Zeus,</A> to exalt gods and his ancestors' worth. <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn50" ID="nr50" TITLE="50">**</A> 
 
<P>  <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../cc.gif">And it is said that he rode a horse in a race when he was still a boy ; for a bronze figure of him as a boy riding a horse is set up on the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens">acropolis</A> in the ball-ground of the Arrhephoroi <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn51" ID="nr51" TITLE="51">**</A>, as some have said. In all his life but two lawsuits were brought against him : first when Megacleides challenged him to an exchange of property <A CLASS="help" HREF="#fn52" ID="nr52" TITLE="52">**</A>. He did not appear in court in this suit, because he was ill, but sent his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aphareus.html#1">Aphareus</A> and won his case.

And he put the foundation-walls round the <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panathenaic_Stadium">Panathenaic Stadium.</A> This he accomplished, and also the levelling of the ravine, because a certain Deinias who owned this plot of land gave it to the city when Lycurgus suggested to him that he make the gift. 
 
<P>  <IMG HEIGHT="11" WIDTH="11" ALT=" " SRC="../ee.gif">He was charged also with guarding the city and arresting malefactors, whom he drove out entirely, so that some of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist">sophists</A> said that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lycurgus.html#4">Lycurgus</A> signed warrants against evil-doers with a pen dipped, not in ink, but in death.

Blass distingxiishes, in addition to the orator: (1) a patriotic and worthy citizen (Xenophon, Hell. ii. 3. 40) in defence of whose daughter Lysias wrote a speech, and to whom the military activities belong which are here ascribed to the orator ; (2) the tragic poet who was put to death by Dionysius of Syracuse (Aristotle, Rhet. ii. 6. p. 1385 a 9) ; (3) Antiphon the sophist (Xenophon, Mem. i. 6. 5; Diog. Laert. ii. 5. 25), who is probably the one who practised mental healing at Corinth ; (4) the son of Pyrilampus (Plato, Parmenides, 127 a); (5) the son of Lysonides (Moralia, 833 a); and (6) an Antiphon derided by Aristophanes (Wasps, 1270), as a starveling. The Pseudo-Plutarch has evidently fused several of these personalities with that of the orator.

 <P> <A ID="fn22" HREF="#nr22">22.</A> &nbsp; The dates given by our author for events in the life of Lysias are consistent (see also 835 a above, and 836 f below, cf. also Dion. Hal. Isocrates, i.), on the assumption that he went to Thurii when the colony was founded, in 444 B.C. But if that is correct, his activity as a writer of speeches to be delivered in the Athenian courts would not begin until his fifty-seventh year. Blass, Die attische Beredsamkeit, 2nd ed., i. p. 345, after stating the evidence, comes to the conclusion that Lysias was born at Athens probably about 446 B.C., the only certain date being his age (fifteen years), when he went to Thurii, and his return to Athens in 413-412 B.C. or the year following. It is quite possible that he did not go to Thurii until some years after the foundation of the colony. The latest of his extant speeches may be dated about 380 B.C., so that we may believe that he died not long after that date.

 <P> <A ID="fn28" HREF="#nr28">28.</A> &nbsp; Cicero, De Oratore, i. 231, and Diogenes Laertius, ii. 20, 40, say that Lysias composed an oration in defence of Socrates, and offered it to him, but Socrates refused it. A speech in defence of Socrates is mentioned several times by the scholiast on Aristeides. It was composed probably some years after the death of Socrates, as an epideictic oration in reply to a similar speech against Socrates by the sophist Polycrates. This is doubtless the speech which Cicero and Diogenes wrongly believed to have been composed for use in the actual trial of Socrates. See Blass, Die attische Beredsamkeit, 2nd ed., i. p. 351.

 <P> But Isocrates himself, at the end of his third letter, writes to Philip : "But I am grateful to old age for this thing only, that it has continued my life to this point, so that of the things which I meditated in my youth and undertook to write in my Panegyric Oration and in that which I sent to you, I now see some being accomplished through your deeds and hope that others will be accomplished."

His widow, Artemisia, caused eulogies to be written in competition by Greek orators and completed the magnificent tomb which he had, apparently, begun.

At all of these dramas were performed, but new tragedies were not produced at the Rural Dionysia, and for a time the same was true of the Lenaean festival.

 <P> <A ID="fn66" HREF="#nr66">66.</A> &nbsp; Aeschines was sent in 347 and 346 b.c. on two embassies to Philip concerning peace. The second is probably the one especially referred to here. In his orations On the Peace (346 B.C.) and On the False Legation (343 B.C.) Demosthenes attacks Aeschines and his colleagues. 
<BR><BR>
 
 <P> <A ID="fn67" HREF="#nr67">67.</A> &nbsp; The author's extreme brevity reduces to two sentences the events of about eight years. The acquittal of Aeschines took place in 343 B.C.  
<BR><BR>
 
 <P> <A ID="fn68" HREF="#nr68">68.</A> &nbsp; Anyone who brought a suit against another for proposing a measure forbidden by law was subject to a fine and was debarred from bringing any similar suit if he received less than one-fifth of the votes cast by the dicasts.

 <P> <A ID="fn70" HREF="#nr70">70.</A> &nbsp; The Hellenotamiae were a board of ten members who collected and administered the tribute paid to Athens by the members of the Delian Confederacy.  
 <BR><BR>

 <P> <A ID="fn71" HREF="#nr71">71.</A> &nbsp; 338-326 B.C. The title of his office is not known. No regular office so extensive as this is mentioned in Aristotle's Constitution of Athens. He may have been in charge of the theoric fund or the military fund, or both, by virtue of a special commission, which in the next generation became a regular office ; see Ferguson, Hellenistic Athens, p. 10, Tarn, Cambridge Ancient History, vi, p. 441. The period meant may be the quinquennium.  
 <BR><BR>

 <P> <A ID="fn72" HREF="#nr72">72.</A> &nbsp; Probably while he was in control of the finances. Cf. Dorpfeld and Reisch, Das griechische Theater, pp. 39 f.

 <P> <A ID="fn74" HREF="#nr74">74.</A> &nbsp; The Trag&#333;doi and Kom&#333;doi alone were eligible to be chosen by lot as protagonists for the tragedies and comedies to be presented at the City Dionysia, the subordinate roles being assigned to plain hypokritai. Prior to the passage of the law of Lycurgus those only were eligible who had previously won a victory at the City Dionysia. The effect of the law of Lycurgus was, therefore, to increase the number of those from whom the archon could choose a kom&#333;dos for each of the five comedies to be presented. See Rohde, Rheinisches Museum, xxxviii. p. 276, and J. B. O'Connor, Chapters in the History of Actors and Acting, pp. 57 ff.

 <P> <A ID="fn75" HREF="#nr75">75.</A> &nbsp; Prisoners of war were usually auctioned off into slavery regardless of their previous condition. If such a captive could prove his free birth through the testimony of the man who owned him when taken captive, he could not under this new law be purchased by any Athenian for slavery, cf. M. H. E. Meier, Comment. de vita Lycurgi, xxxix. ff.  
<BR><BR>
 
 <P> <A ID="fn76" HREF="#nr76">76.</A> &nbsp; This refers to the great annual procession to Eleusis in the celebration of the mysteries of Demeter and Persephon&#275;. 
<BR><BR>
 
 <P> <A ID="fn77" HREF="#nr77">77.</A> &nbsp; The story may well be apocryphal. The saying of Lycurgus, repeated by Plutarch in his Comp. of Nicias and Crassus, 3, is not there connected with the Eleusis incident ; and Aelian, Var. Hist. xiii. 24, expressly states that the statesman's wife paid a fine after legal condemnation, not a bribe to the informer.

 <BR><BR>
 
 <P> <A ID="fn80" HREF="#nr80">80.</A> &nbsp; The Corcyraean whip was especially stinging, and the orator's outbreak means : "I would give a great deal to use a cat-o'-nine-tails on you people."

 <P> <A ID="fn82" HREF="#nr82">82.</A> &nbsp; Judeich, Topogr. v. Athen,2 p. 409, conjectures that the garden of Melanthius was in the neighbourhood of the Academy.
 <BR><BR>
 
 <P> <A ID="fn83" HREF="#nr83">83.</A> &nbsp; The Bouleuterion was the meeting-place of the Boul&#275; or Senate ; the foundations of this and of the temple of the Great Mother have recently been found on the west side of the Agora. See T. L. Shear, Hesperia, iv. pp. 349 ff.

 <P> <A ID="fn88" HREF="#nr88">88.</A> &nbsp; The inscription on the base of this statue is probably preserved in I.G. ii.2 3776. Another statue stood not far from the Prytaneium ; cf. Pausanius, i. 8. 2.

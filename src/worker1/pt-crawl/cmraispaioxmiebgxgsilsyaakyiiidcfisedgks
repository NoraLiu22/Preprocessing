<H2>Bogwoman (1997)</H2>

<P>D: Tom Collins<BR>
S: Rachael Dowling, Peter Mullan</P>

<P>The evolution of 'the troubles' in Northern Ireland seen through the
eyes of a single mother from Donegal who moves to Derry City in 1958. Rachael
Dowling plays the woman in question, who comes to marry shiftless gambler
Peter Mullan (<I><A HREF="joe.htm">My Name is Joe</A></I>) and finds a network
of women with whom strong personal and community bonds develop living in
the Catholic/Nationalist Bogside area of the divided city. As political
events proceed at pace around her, Dowling faces various personal pressures
in the form of her rapidly expanding family, her husband's erratic success
as a bookmaker and eventually his fatal illness which leaves her to struggle
on alone just as Northern Ireland seems poised on the edge of the abyss.</P>

<P>Documentarist Tom Collins has not quite succeeded with this move to fiction
(following Alan Gilsenan's equally ill-judged <I><A HREF="asd.htm">All Souls'
Day</A></I>). The fragmented and often dramatically unconvincing script
works only as trope, a sort of symbolic backdrop to the occasional flashes
of documentary footage (with a contemporary voice over provided by RTE newsreader
Bryan Dobson) which detail the development of political unrest. The intention
seems to be that the film would deal with a family on the fringes rather
than directly involved (only to prove, of course, that everyone is involved
whether they know it or not). This is interesting in theory, but the writing
is not up to the task of blending the personal and the political, and its
rapid and uneven temporal shifts move between days, weeks, months and years
in fits and starts which leave the viewer confused, especially when the
make-up is not especially convincing and actors have adult children while
looking the same as they did ten minutes earlier as a younger person.</P>

<P>The story proceeds clumsily from anecdotal incident to anecdotal incident;
revealing little, telling much. Characters make lengthy speeches which describe
their state of mind and lay out their particular difficulties of the moment
for the audience to contemplate, leaving little to the imagination and leaving
the actors with little to do other than read their lines. The film then
cuts away to archive footage portraying significant moments from the period
between 1958 and 1968, climaxing with the arrival of British troops in the
city. The drama abruptly comes to an end with the rather simplistic and
certainly unconvincing 'awakening' of its leading lady, who joins her militant
neighbour on the front line making petrol bombs, and as the credits roll
you can't help but wonder if &quot;Bogwoman II&quot; will then continue
the logical trajectory of the drama and chart her eventual disillusionment
with Nationalism. Alas, this will not happen, and the final impression the
film leaves is of a rather silly propaganda exercise which does not credit
its audience with much intelligence.</P>

<P>Completed in 1997, the film waited until 1999 for a theatrical release
in Ireland. It is certainly a disappointment after considerable hype, and
after the not uninteresting documentary work of this filmmaker. How it will
fare abroad, if at all, remains to be seen.</P>

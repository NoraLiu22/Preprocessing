<p ALIGN="CENTER">Aung San Suu Kyi</p>
</b>

<p>Aung San Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945 in the city of Rangoon, Burma. General Aung San Kyi and Daw Khin Kyi brought her into the world. Her father, General Aung Sun,
was the national leader of Burma until his assassination on July 17, 1947. His death would
be one of the main contributors to her fight for peace and independence for the country of
Burma. She was educated in the city of Rangoon until she was fifteen years old. Her mother
would soon become Burmese ambassador to India and Nepal. In 1960 she would travel with her
mother to these other countries. While living in these foreign lands she studied politics
at Delhi University. She continued her education at St. Hugh's College and Oxford
University where she received a BA in economics, politics, and philosophy. During the next
several years she worked abroad and met her future husband Dr. Michael Aris. The couple
soon married and had two children.</p>

<p>Aung's life was a little different then what most people are accustomed to in the
world. Her father was assassinated for his political beliefs and her mother was an
ambassador of the country of Burma. Politics played a big role in Aung's life and that is
why it is not hard to believe what would soon happen to her. Aung had made her way back to
her homeland in 1988, to take care of her sick mother. While in Burma she joined the
pro-democracy movement, which was pushing for political reforms in Burma. On August 26,
1988 she addressed a half million people in a rally at the famous Shwedagon Pagoda in
Rangoon. She had preached to these people and called for a democratic government so that
the people of Burma could experience freedom. An army unit in the Irrawaddy Delta
confronted her almost a year later on April 5, 1989 while she was delivering a speech for
democratic freedom. The army unit had orders to aim their weapons at her during the speech
waiting for the order to fire. A major had finally ordered the troops back which prevented
her from being assassinated like her father. Three months later on July 20, 1989 Aung San
Suu Kyi is placed under house arrest in the city of Rangoon.</p>

<p>The elections were going to be held in May of 1990 in which she was declared
ineligible. Even though she was unable to run in the election the National League for
Democracy had a landslide victory even without her present. She would spend the next six
years of her life at her lakeside villa in Rangoon to serve her house arrest. She wrote
many speeches and books that were published. During this time she received many awards
dealing with her great aspiration toward peace. However, maybe her greatest honor was the
Nobel Peace Prize that she won on October 14, 1991. With her prize money of 1.3 million
dollars she established a health and education trust for the people of Burma. </p>

<p>Aung San Sunn Kyi was released from house arrest on July 10, 1995. In 2002 
authorities arrested her once more.&nbsp; Freed in 2002, the next year the 
Burmese government again arrested her.&nbsp; She remains in prison in 2006, 
despite ill health and international protests.&nbsp; She keeps on fighting for 
democracy and freedom in her homeland of Burma. She has dedicated her life to 
the citizens of Burma so that they can experience the freedom that they deserve.&nbsp; 
She has secured her name in Burmese history and will forever fight for 
democracy.&nbsp; </p>

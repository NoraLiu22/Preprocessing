I have directed the course of rivers at my will; and my will has directed them where they might prove useful.  I have made a barren land produce plenty, and fertilised it with my rivers.  I have built walls which are impregnable; and with iron forced a way through inaccessible rocks.  At great expense I have formed roads in places, which before not even the wild beasts could traverse.  And great and various as my exploits have been, I have always found leisure hours, in which to indulge myself and my friends.

Without waiting to have her hair dressed, she mounted her horse, and put herself at the head of her army.  At the same time, she vowed never to have her hair dressed, till she had subdued the rebels; which she eventually achieved after a tedious war.  She then bathed, and had her hair dressed.

The Persian army, closely pursuing her, entered and plundered her camp.  There they found a great quantity of wine, and all sorts of provisions; on which they indulged immoderately, revelling throughout the night, as if they had obtained a victory.  In that situation Tomyris attacked them, and cut them to pieces, while they were partly buried in sleep, and partly so drenched with wine, and surfeited with banqueting, that they could scarcely stand upright; and Cyrus himself was slain.

Nitetis long passed for the daughter of Amasis, while she cohabited with Cyrus.  But after having borne him children, and made herself mistress of his affections, she informed him, who she was; that her father was Apries, the king and master of Amasis.

The Romans were at that time in no condition to engage in a war, and yet were unwilling to part with their daughters.  Philotis, a young and handsome slave, proposed to them to dress her, and such other good-looking slaves as they could pick out, and send them to the Latins in place of their daughters; at the same time she engaged to let them know by lighting a torch, at what time in the night the Latins went to rest.  Accordingly, as soon as they had retired to repose with their new brides, Philotis lit the torch, and the Romans surprised the Latins in bed, and slew them.

Thus she gave him proof of the resolution, with which she could inflict the wound, and bear the pain.  Brutus no longer hesitated to reveal to her the conspiracy; she carried her own dress to him, and he found a sword privately concealed in it.   He used this sword, when with the rest of the conspirators he murdered Caesar.

He was defeated, and fell upon his own sword.  Then Porcia at first endeavoured to starve herself.  But not being able to achieve that, because of the intervention of her relations and servants, she ordered some fire to be brought to her, under pretence of using some unguents; and seizing the burning coals in her hands, she swallowed them, before anybody who was present had time to prevent it.  Thus died Porcia; a memorable instance of resolution and fortitude, and of conjugal affection.

At the celebration of a solemn festival called Neleis, Pieria, the daughter of Pythus a man of distinction, went to Miletus.  Phrygius, one of the descendants of Neleus, met her there; and becoming enamoured of the girl, he asked her how he could most agreeably serve her.  "By giving me an opportunity," replied the maid, "of coming here frequently, and with as many companions as I please."  Phrygius understood her meaning; he effected a permanent peace, and a re-establishment of the union of the two states.  The love of Phrygius and Pieria became famous ever after in the annals of Milesian history.

He became enamoured of Polycrete, and cohabited with her not on the terms of a slave, but as his wife.  In the Milesian camp a local festival was celebrated, at which the Milesians give themselves up to drinking and pleasure.  Polycrete requested Diognetus' permission to send her brothers a small present of the sumptuous fare that was prepared; in a cake she moulded up a piece of lead, and she ordered the bearer to tell her brothers, that it was intended only for their use.  On the lead she inscribed, that if they  attacked the Milesian camp, they might surprise the enemy in a state of intoxication and sleep.  The Naxian generals accordingly made the attack, and succeeded.  Polycrete was highly honoured by her citizens for her service; and at her instance they preserved Diognetus, and his possessions.

By their courage and conduct they had obtained many victories, and had enriched themselves with great spoils; which so drew upon them the envy of the barbarians, that in the absence of Mandron, the barbarians formed a resolution to massacre them.  But Lampsace, the daughter of Mandron, got intelligence of the plot, and as she could not prevent it, she secretly revealed it to the Greeks.  The Phocaeans prepared a magnificent sacrifice in the suburbs, and invited the barbarians to partake of it.  They then divided themselves into two groups; one of which secured the walls; and the other slew the banqueters, and made themselves masters of the city.

She was finally acquitted by the tyrant's order; and supposing that she had suffered innocently, he afterwards treated her with marks of great attention and affection.  Aretaphila had a daughter, who was extremely beautiful, and she introduced her to Leander, the tyrant's brother.  He fell in love with her, and with the consent of Nicocrates married her.

Sinorix conceived a passion for her., which he despaired of gratifying either by force or entreaties, while her husband was alive.  He therefore procured the assassination of Sinatus; and not long afterwards, paid his addresses to Camma, who repeatedly rejected his advances.  At last however, yielding to the pressing solicitation of her friends and acquaintances, she pretended to consent, on these terms: &quot;Let Sinorix come to the temple of Artemis, and there we will make our marriage vows in the presence of the goddess&quot;.  On the day, Sinorix, attended by a great number of Gauls, both men and women, waited on her; and she accompanied him to the altar with fond words and tenderness.  There she drank to him from a golden cup, and bade him partake with her in the drink.  He received it with pleasure, as a token of bridal love, and drank it down.  But the bridal cup was a potion of strong poison.  As soon as she saw that he had drunk it, she fell down on he knees, and said with a loud voice: &quot;I thank you, venerable Artemis, for granting me in this your temple a glorious revenge for my murdered husband.&quot;  After saying this, she dropped down, and expired; and the bridegroom expired with her, at the altar of the goddess.

She acknowledged she had vases, cups, and other pieces of ornamental furniture, which on the city being taken, she said she had deposited in a dry well. The Thracian pressed her immediately to go with him, and show him the place, which she accordingly did; conducting him through the garden, and bringing him to the well. Fearing lest any one should preempt him, he eagerly entered the well: but instead of a treasure, found a shower of stones: which Timocleia and her servants discharged upon him, and buried him under the pile. When the Macedonians learnt of what had happened, they seized her, and carried her before Alexander.

Laarchus conceived a violent passion for her, and made her proposals of marriage; on which subject, she referred him to her brothers.  When they, as had been agreed between them and their sister, demurred upon it, she sent a servant to Laarchus, informing him that her brothers seemed to disapprove of the marriage; but if he would grant them a meeting at her house, she expected that the discussion might remove their present objections.  So fair an opening seemed to him to promise a favourable outcome, and he visited Eryxo's house by night without a guard.  There he found Polyarchus her eldest brother, together with two youths, armed and waiting to receive him; they immediately fell upon him, and slew him.  Then they proclaimed Battus king; and restored to the inhabitants of Cyrene their ancient form of government.

The people were all uneasy at the land being suffered to lie uncultivated; as in the meantime there was likely be no corn, no fruits, nor anything to be had for the purposes of life.  The women entreated Pythopolis, the wife of Pythes, to use her influence with her husband on this subject of general complaint.  She bade them not to be uneasy; and assured them that she would.  Accordingly, she sent for some goldsmiths, and ordered them to make in gold for her fish, ripe fruits, cakes, and meats of various kinds.  Pythes, on his return from a journey, asked if supper was ready.  A golden table was placed before him, covered with the resemblance of various foods, all worked up in gold.  Pythes much admired the workmanship; then he ordered them to be taken away, and the supper to be brought.  Other dishes were accordingly served up, and others after them; but in all of them, only the golden resemblance of foodstuffs was served up.  Pythes in a rage told her her to put an end to her show, and let him have his supper; for he was tired and hungry.  &quot;You do not consider,&quot; replied his wife, &quot;that victuals are difficult to procure.  The whole country is employed in ransacking the bowels of the earth for gold; and unless we can eat it, we must all soon starve.&quot;  Pythes, convinced of the justness of this remonstrance, ordered the people out of the mines; and ordered them to employ themselves in agriculture, and other useful occupations.

Possessing great skill in the occult qualities of herbs, she chose out of the herd a large and beautiful bull, gilded his horns, and decorated him with garlands, and purple ribbons embroidered with gold.  She mixed in his fodder a medicinal herb that would excite madness, and ordered him to be kept in the stall and fed upon it.  The efficacy of this medicine was such, that not only the beast, who ate it, was seized with madness; but also all, who ate the flesh of it, when it was in such a state, were seized with the same insanity.  When the enemy encamped against her, she directed an altar to be raised in sight of them; and after every preparation for a sacrifice had been made, the bull was brought forth.  Under the influence of the medicine, the bull broke loose; he ran wild into the plain, roaring, and tilting at everything he met.  The Erythraeans saw the victim, intended for the enemy's sacrifice, running towards their camp, and considered it as a happy omen.  They seized the beast, and offered him up in sacrifice to their gods; everyone, in participation of the sacrifice, ate a piece of the flesh.  The whole army was soon afterwards seized with madness, and exhibited the same marks of wildness and frenzy the bull had done.  When Chrysame observed this, she directed Cnopus immediately to draw out his forces, and charge the enemy.  Incapable of making any defence, the Erythraeans were cut to pieces; but Cnopus made himself master of Erythrae, a great and flourishing city.

During the night, while the bridegroom was asleep, she dispatched him with the sword so secretly, that not the least noise was heard.

The tyrant then sent an embassy to her, requesting his son; she promised to give him up, after she had received her parents.  Phricodemus accordingly sent her parents; but nevertheless the Acarnanians would not hand over Heracon, but scourged him, and afterwards put him to death.  The tyrant himself not many days afterwards fell by the hands of his citizens.  And, what is most remarkable, the citizens of Helice along with their city were not long afterwards engulfed in the sea, which swelled over them in an earthquake.

Satyrus prevailed on two of his friends, to revolt to her, and put themselves under her protection; so as the more easily to find an opportunity to assassinate her.  On their revolt, Satyrus wrote a letter, to ask for them to be handed over; which she answered, by alleging that the law of nations justified her in protecting those, who had placed themselves under her protection.  The two men, who had revolted, one day requested an audience of her.  While one distracted her with a pretended matter of importance, the other levelled a blow at her with a drawn sword, which fell upon her girdle; and the guards immediately seized and imprisoned them.  They were afterwards examined by torture, and confessed the whole plot; upon which, Tirgatao ordered the hostage to be executed, and laid waste the territories of Satyrus with fire and sword.  Stung with remorse for the calamities he had brought upon himself and his country, Satyrus died in the midst of an unsuccessful war; leaving his son <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gorgippus.html#1">Gorgippus</A> to succeed him in the throne.  He renounced his father's proceedings, and sued for peace, which she granted on payment of a tribute, and put and end to the war.

When he treated her prohibition with contempt, she marched against him with a hundred and twenty men of tried courage, and extraordinary strength, each of them provided with three horses.  In one night and day she covered a distance of twelve hundred <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://www.sizes.com/units/stade.htm">stades</A>, and arriving unexpectedly at the palace, she slew all the guards.

She put the inhabitants of Chersonesus back in free possession of their country, and gave his hereditary dominions to the son of the Scythian prince; warning him to take a warning from his father's death, and not to invade the territories of the neighbouring Greeks and barbarians.

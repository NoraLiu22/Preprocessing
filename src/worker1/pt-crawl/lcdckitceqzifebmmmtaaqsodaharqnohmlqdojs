          <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Philosophy</font></strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">My 
            philosophy is similar, I want all the kids to have fun and be able 
            to try the different positions. I spoke at length with my assistant 
            coach and it turns out his ideas are not that different from mine. 
            We have 11 kids on the team and there are only 2 of them that have 
            limited skills (both are a whole year younger too). His idea was more 
            geared towards them, having them specialize in something simpler that 
            they can do well. It will give them more satisfaction due to more 
            success and let them concentrate on a small number of tasks (the other 
            kids being older and more proficient can handle many more assignments). 
            We'll incorporate them in all the other aspects of practice of course, 
            but we'll give them some easy plays designed just for them (we'll 
            call it our secret plays or something, they'll love it). We've also 
            found that only 3-4 kids really want to play qb, so that problem solved 
            itself. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">One 
            of the big problems we encountered during the game is that on every 
            play, everyone is open and wants the ball. My assistant calls the 
            plays in the huddle on offense and he said it was really bothering 
            him as he was bombarded by chatter while he's trying to call the play. 
            It was the same last season and I witnessed it in the huddle too. 
            At tonight's practice I'm going to institute my "no asking for the 
            ball plan." Any player who asks for the ball, tells us he was open, 
            why don't you pass it to me, etc., will be taken out of the game for 
            a minimum of two plays. I'm going to implement it our scrimmage and 
            hopefully it will eliminate the problem. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">It 
            got so bad that one of our players was moping and crying on the sideline 
            because he wanted the ball. Of course he caught several passes during 
            the game but he wanted more. We have a lot of kids that can catch 
            and run well, plus we move the ball quickly downfield so we have fewer 
            possessions to spread around. Some players only get one touch (I make 
            sure everyone gets at least one), while if someone gets 3-4 that's 
            a lot on our team. It's a good problem to have so many capable players 
            but some of my kids need to be broken of this whining habit.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Something 
            that has helped us is having one of our team parents track ball touches, 
            passes, etc. for b-ball and soccer. In between subs, I can do a quick 
            check to see who isn't getting the ball or who needs to take more 
            shots and make changes on the fly during a game. The stats also help 
            the kids and parents see the real deal, memories run short after the 
            game is over. Football is a different animal than b-ball and soccer, 
            but there might be some stats that would be worth tracking.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Defense</strong> </font></p>
        </div>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">There are 
          6 teams in our league and we've played 4 of them already. We're the 
          only one that runs a zone defense, all the others run man-to-man. We've 
          given up no more than one touchdown in each game (actually we've given 
          up exactly one td each game). Against our opponents we've scored 5, 
          3, 4 and 2 tds. I feel that the zone is easy to understand for them 
          although man defense is a little easier. You can go with either but 
          I really prefer zone. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Either 
          way you have to focus on two things in practice: <b>Pulling flags and 
            swarming to the ball</b>. Missed flags are the biggest reason teams 
          give up tds. The second reason is that once a flag is missed the other 
          kids are standing around watching (because they expected the other player 
          to pull his flag). We spend no less than 15 minutes each practice on 
          defense (far more than anyone else). I run the same <b><a href="http://www.y-coach.com/CD/Coaching.htm#Flag_Football_Drills.htm">flag 
            football drills</a></b> for defense. They consist of: </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Movement 
          drills: I form two lines and have them bend their knees and keep their 
          arms up and move side to side, backpedal some, etc. Same as in bball. 
          During this drill I'll sometimes hold a ball in my hand and after a 
          while yell swarm! Then all the kids have to run to the ball. I'll watch 
          for stragglers and call them out. I used to do this far more last year 
          but with all the same players they don't need to do the swarm drill 
          too much.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Flag pulling: 
          I form a line of kids, each with a flag on and a ball. One kid (the 
          defender) stands inside a rectangle and waits. The line goes one by 
          one versus the defender. They have to stay in the rectangle. After the 
          line completes then I switch defenders, each kid gets a turn. There 
          are several things to look for during this drill. Make sure the offensive 
          guy is not flag guarding or anything. For the defender the hardest thing 
          to do is get positioning. Let me explain. The defender should be trying 
          to do two things 1) pull the flag (obvious) but 2) slow down the runner. 
          Sometimes you get what I call the "matador" pull, kind of like when 
          a matador whips his cape past the bull. If you pull flags like a matador 
          then if you miss he's still going full speed. So I'll vary the flag 
          pulling drill without flags. The defender simply has to move in front 
          of the runner and slow him down. That way the defender can focus on 
          blocking him instead of the flags.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Zone 
            Defense </b></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">As for 
            ZONE, here's some reasons why I like it. The biggest reason is that 
            all my defenders can watch the qb and the backfield. In man coverage 
            you're turned around trying to follow your guy.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Our guys 
            can sit back into coverage and it's easy for them to make interceptions. 
            They're in an area and I tell them to watch the qbs eyes. 7-8 year 
            olds DO NOT look off their receivers. We pick off 2+ passes per game 
            and we either score on the INT or get great field position. In contrast 
            we've only had one pass picked off in 4 games (that's partly due to 
            my offensive philosophy too). In our league when the ball turns over 
            on downs or after a score you start at your own 5. IF you intercept 
            you get the ball at the spot so it's a great advantage to intercept.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Against 
            runs, your defenders are watching the backfield and can see the runs 
            coming. I put my two LB's on the line about 5 yards left and right 
            of the center. We stuff runs big time. Also the corners stay home 
            so reverses and misdirection are less likely to work against us. Against 
            a man defense a reverse is deadly because kids bite hard on it.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">A good 
            qb can pick apart a zone because there are many holes in coverage. 
            I've only seen one 7-8 year old so far that was accurate enough that 
            I had to switch to a partial zone-man (that was our first game). And 
            then we still only gave up one td and picked him off 3 times.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">We had 
            been running a standard cover 2 zone. We'd place 2 corners close to 
            the line of scrimmage over the wideout's, two LB's on the line of 
            scrimmage about 5 yards left and right of center, and 2 safeties deep 
            over the middle. This week I switched. I noticed that the corners 
            were too wide to be effective. I'd keep telling them to move towards 
            the middle. So I tried a cover 3 zone. This time I placed 3 safeties 
            back deep. At the line of scrimmage I put one over the center and 
            2 kids on the line over the slot receivers. It provided us with good 
            coverage and we still stopped the run well. I don't think anyone throws 
            outside to the wideout's, they usually just run them deep on posts 
            anyway or ins over the middle.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">While 
            I think you can be very successful with running just a 2 1 2 zone 
            and no rush I would think that you'd want to pressure the qb as much 
            as possible. Can the qb run when you rush? Can he run when you don't 
            rush? That would make a difference to me.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Let's 
            assume that you want to rush every time. If you can trust your safety 
            that he's fast and can close and go after the ball, then you could 
            maybe get away with one deep. Have him play deep and just shadow the 
            QB sideline to sideline. Take the other and play him also in the middle 
            with the qb and move him side to side. But honestly, I'd say that 
            due to the distances the kids can throw (or lack of) the safeties 
            in a pair can close quickly enough for stuff over the middle. The 
            corners, well they aren't truly corners. Have them play over the slot 
            receiver position maybe on the outside shoulder of where the slot 
            guy should be. They'll also be able to cheat over and cover on the 
            middle routes.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">With 
            your safeties and corners playing zone they will be staring at the 
            qb. That will give them a huge advantage in coverage. There are not 
            7-8 year olds who can pick apart a defense AND receivers that can 
            catch well enough that precise passes are a threat.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I'd initially 
            go with the 2 1 2, the middle guy being your rusher, your corners 
            not truly corners but closer in towards the slot and the safeties 
            splitting the middle. If the qb can only run when you rush, rush him 
            and see what he does. If he's a good runner and starts beating you 
            for yardage, stunt the rusher; meaning have him start from 7 yards 
            back, run to the line of scrimmage and then don't rush. The qb will 
            be waiting for him to rush and become confused. Then have the rusher 
            drop back in the middle and then maybe have him rush after the qb 
            begins looking for receivers. Mix it up. I'm very confident that a 
            straight 2 1 2 zone with no rush (assuming the qb cannot run) will 
            be an awesome defense so don't be afraid to fall back to it.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I originally 
            began lining up 2 corners who would play over the wide outs. During 
            the season I realized that they really didn't need to be that wide 
            so I pinched them in over the slot receiver or actually on the outside 
            of the slot receiver. From there they were very effective at stopping 
            runs that didn't go directly up the middle. And the opposing quarterbacks 
            couldn't throw to the outside flats to take advantage of them either. 
            They were instructed to hold their position but drop a little if the 
            other team looked to pass. With the zone you need to have someone 
            deep. I played 2 deep, splitting the middle of the field left and 
            right. To me you had to have the most reliable kids here who could 
            ball hawk and keep everything in front of them. I'd line them up not 
            quite as far as a 8 year old could throw but close to it. My MLB is 
            my rusher. The key is sending a rusher and keeping pressure on the 
            QB. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">The one 
            problem you'll run into is when the other team decides to dink it 
            over the middle to their center or a receiver running a small slant 
            over the middle. Tough to defend when you're sending a rusher from 
            the middle, so we always taught our rusher to have his/her hands up 
            in the air to make it more difficult for the QB. If I started to sense 
            that the other team was going to try the dink over the middle, I'd 
            tell one my better DB's to watch the center and usually they'd get 
            there in time to pull a flag.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I'm rewriting 
          a bunch of my plays and refocusing my offense this week. My overall 
          philosophy is to keep the passes very short and run. That's not changing. 
          What I need to change is to have more misdirection and incorporate some 
          of things that worked better and some of the things that didn't work. 
          When you drop back a 7-8 year old and have him throw downfield you get 
          too many incomplete's and interception's. Completion percentages are 
          too low to be worth it. Sure we'll chuck it sometimes we get a good 
          matchup but not often.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">First off 
          we line up in the same formation every play. Other teams use all kinds 
          of formations but my team never changes. We had two wideout's, two slot's 
          a center and a qb. Many of the teams use kids in the backfield as running 
          backs but not us. It's too easy to see the run coming. We run end around's 
          and delay's to the center. Some will load up a side which is an obvious 
          charade for a run to the open side, not us. We create open sides by 
          clearing out receivers on their routes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Our best 
          play has been our center drag. It's very basic. The center snaps the 
          ball and takes two steps forward and then turns 90 degrees. The qb takes 
          the snap and begins running parallel to the line of scrimmage. The center 
          has to keep pace with the qb. They run about 5-7 yards sideways and 
          the qb tosses the ball to the center. It's a pass on the run but it's 
          like a 3 yard pass so it's near impossible to miss. The center catches 
          it on the run which is key because he takes his momentum and keeps going. 
          The receivers on the side of the play have routes that clear them out 
          of the area. Therefore when the center gets there he only has to beat 
          his man in a sprint. We call this without fail on all short yardage 
          plays.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I'm not 
          going to go into all my plays but that illustrates how we keep it simple 
          and easy but are very effective. We have variations off that play too 
          like a fake end around that precedes the center drag and a play that 
          begins as a center drag then reverses direction with the slot receiver 
          for a slot drag going the other way. Also, I found that teams began 
          keying on our end around (our basic run) so I'm putting a fake end around 
          on several other plays so the defense will have lots of things to look 
          at.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I believe 
          strongly that misdirection and isolation is the way to go for offense. 
          I want to put the ball into my players hands and have them running downfield. 
          Good things happen when your kid is carrying the ball full speed. Incomplete 
          passes and especially interceptions are very bad things so we design 
          plays to minimize that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking 
          a step back and looking at some things other teams did against us:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">One team 
          did a double reverse. The first time they did it the kids ran into each 
          other and the one who got the second handoff busted his lip and began 
          crying. They lost yards. They ran it again later and it gained a few 
          yards but my guys stayed home. I feel like the double reverse is a very 
          risky play because if it works well it could gain big but with 7-8 year 
          olds, you're asking a lot (several handoffs while running).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Another 
          team had two halfbacks behind the qb in a pro formation. They faked 
          a handoff to the first rb and gave to the second one the other way. 
          This one worked against us because my LB's both bit on the fake. But 
          once my kids saw it, it didn't work again. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Other teams 
          run end around's like we do and it only works (against us) when you 
          have an exceptional runner who is very fast and can make people miss. 
          Last game they gave the handoff on an end around and the kid took it 
          and immediately went back the other way. This worked because we over-pursued 
          it. A few games ago with little time left I placed my defense in a prevent 
          zone and the other team ran the end around. They gave it to their best 
          kid and because he had time to turn the corner (we were too far back) 
          and get to full speed it was almost a td if we didn't save it with a 
          timely flag pull. Lesson learned was to keep defenders at the line of 
          scrimmage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">As for 
          passing, don't expect that the kids will run patterns with any sort 
          of consistency. Your well drawn up play will look like shambles in about 
          5 seconds. That's why we try to isolate a receiver so even if he alters 
          his pattern he should be by himself with only one defender. Also that's 
          why we stick to very short passes mostly. I say mostly because we have 
          2 kids who can throw it very far and maybe 3-4 kids who can possibly 
          catch a long pass. We'll sometimes see a favorable matchup with one 
          of our deep threat receivers and send him long but the catch ratio is 
          still low even when the ball nails him in the numbers. Of course it's 
          always fun to hook up on a bomb.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I have 
          drawn up all the plays on paper, two to a page, front and back. During 
          the huddle I kneel with the play in hand facing away from the line of 
          scrimmage. All the kids in the huddle are facing the line of scrimmage. 
          I point to each position and call out a kids name so that they can visualize 
          which position and direction they'll be running while looking at the 
          play. I think this makes it easier for them to understand where they 
          are and which way to run.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">One of 
          my assistants had my plays laminated which seemed like overkill at the 
          time but during one rainy game I'm glad he did it. My loose pieces of 
          paper with notes I like to keep fell apart and was worthless within 
          minutes. But the laminated plays were as good as new. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I had all 
          my plays on 4 sheets of paper, I used both sides, two plays each side. 
          On each side I simply had the left and right version of the play, they 
          were essentially the same. One of my goals was to keep the number of 
          plays to a minimum to avoid overwhelming my players. Also, I numbered 
          the plays and wrote them on the page in large numerals. I didn't have 
          them all memorized but I knew that if I wanted one of my basic plays 
          I knew what the number was. Pre-scripting your plays before the game 
          helps to cut down on wasted time in the huddle. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'll highlight 
          what really worked on offense:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">In the 
          huddle I knelt down facing the line of scrimmage. I had all the kids 
          stand behind me such that they were also facing the line of scrimmage. 
          I'd hold up the play towards the line of scrimmage such that they could 
          all see it over my shoulder. Then I pointed to each position and named 
          the kid who'd run it. I tended to keep kids in the same position from 
          play to play and that helped them. I'd usually highlight certain things.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">The other 
          thing that really worked well was when my quarterback dragged (or rolled) 
          along the line of scrimmage. The reason it works is because the defense 
          usually places 1-2 kids over the center and dragging leaves them trailing 
          behind the play. If the qb just takes the snap and stands there then 
          he has to contend with those kids in his face and has to throw around 
          them. Also, when the qb drags with the receiver it shortens the distance 
          of the throw. Most of our passes are under 5 yards.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">The final 
          thing that really helped our offense this week was an emphasis on proper 
          patterns. We had gotten to a point of assuming everyone knew how far 
          and how to run each pattern. In reality we were getting 11 different 
          versions of the same pattern from 11 kids. So we drilled them and instructed 
          them in patterns over and over. ALSO, and most importantly, for our 
          drag plays and shuffle passes, we instructed them to only run 1-2 steps 
          beyond the line of scrimmage. Throughout the season our kids were running 
          them further and further until it was finally like a 10 yard pass, not 
          at all what we intended. That little 2 step drag play was magical, and 
          we ran it with the center and slot guys.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">You should 
          only have a few pass plays. Post, flag, down and in and hook. I'd line 
          them up in a few lines and have them run them over and over. Do it without 
          throwing them the ball. Specify exactly the distance and where to cut. 
          Use cones or something on the field to help them run it a few times 
          then take it away so they can run it without it. On your playbook you 
          might even want to write the name of the pattern next to the play for 
          double emphasis in the huddle. Since your team is new you might want 
          to spend more than 10 minutes a practice for now. And during the game, 
          the patterns will vary quite a bit, they are only 7-8. It's just a matter 
          of being familiar and repetition.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">One of 
          the biggest problems you will probably encounter is everyone wanting 
          the ball or to play a certain position. During games and practice this 
          can be a killer as it wastes a lot of time. I was forced to implement 
          a simple rule. If you ask/ complain/ etc. during the huddle or game 
          you immediately have to sit out for 2 plays. It sounds harsh but the 
          problem was instantly cleared up. I enforced it more in practice so 
          I didn't have to during the games. I did however tell the players that 
          they could ask me anything they wanted at the end of practice or the 
          end of games. That was my time to discuss anything they wanted like 
          getting the ball or playing a certain position.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Playing 
          everyone at quarterback in one game I think is a huge mistake. I'd stick 
          to your best 2 and rotate in 1-2 others for some handoffs and such. 
          You can make it such that all players will eventually get to play quarterback 
          during the season, but rotating everyone in one game is crazy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">To avoid 
          throwing a lot of interceptions at the younger age groups make sure 
          you design your pass plays with short routes, usually 2-3 yards. You 
          get your receiver isolated by moving the qb down the line of scrimmage 
          with the receiver running in tandem. I teach them to "push" the ball 
          to the receiver. The "push" is like a shuffle pass not an overhand throw. 
          Of course we throw regular passes too but those are much less often 
          and usually only after we've sucked the defense in with all our short 
          passes and runs. Pocket passing is just a bad idea at the younger age 
          levels.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I only 
          had two plays where the qb had more than one option to throw to and 
          even on those plays I'd tell them who to watch for. In practice there 
          were a few times where the qb had to improvise when the play went the 
          wrong way. We strongly complimented our guys when they did that, taking 
          things into their own hands.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">As for 
          tracking who got how many touches, I can tell you what I did. My goal, 
          as stated was simply to make sure every kid got >= one touch per game. 
          Some kids would get more, some less. I didn't write it down or really 
          need to as I could remember who got a chance. This may not work for 
          you so you may want to recruit someone to track ball touches for you. 
          You also want to decide before the season what constitutes a touch. 
          This may sound silly but it will stop a lot of problems with your players 
          and their parents before they get started. As for who plays qb, I gave 
          them all chances in practice. In theory I wanted many of them to get 
          a chance in the game. In execution I ended up playing 2 kids a majority 
          of the time and would work in maybe two others towards the end of the 
          half's.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">To avoid 
          having to move the players around to different positions in order to 
          get them ball touches create similar plays for every position and leave 
          the players in the same position.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">I color 
          coded my plays so I have Red/Yellow for more complicated pass plays, 
          Red/Blue for the more complicated run plays. Also color coded the easy 
          runs/passes so I can adjust on the fly depending upon who I have at 
          QB, receiver, etc. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">The trick 
          in flag football (at this age) is to keep the kids happy with ball touches. 
          I've designed a few offensive plays just for my best QB, best runner 
          and best receiver. When I allow some of the weaker QB's to play and 
          they don't move the ball, I can go to those plays which usually work. 
          This keeps me from constantly using my best QB over and over.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Player 
          Participation </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">As for 
          switching players my system is very simple and effective. I divide my 
          team into two groups evenly. In the first half one group plays offense 
          and the other group plays defense. In the second half they switch so 
          now the offensive group plays defense and the defensive group plays 
          offense. That way everyone gets approximately the same time on offense 
          and defense and I don't have to worry about subbing in and out. I make 
          sure that each group has a mixture of players that have strengths and 
          weaknesses spread out so that both groups are equally capable. When 
          the numbers are not equal I still split them but then make up the difference 
          from the group on the sideline. So since we're 6-on-6 and lets say I 
          have 9 show up I split them 5 and 4. When my group of 4 is on the field 
          I pull 2 from the group on the sideline for that series, trying to mix 
          it up.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">You have 
          to try to work it to every kid and as long as you're moving the ball 
          with runs and short passes, everyone should be able to get it. I admit 
          that in certain downs and situations I'll make sure to get the ball 
          to a key player but in other situations I make sure a not so great player 
          gets the ball. Example: Start of game, 1st down at our own 5. I'll run 
          a play to someone I know can do well and he goes the length of the field 
          getting stopped just short of the goal line. Now it's 1st and goal at 
          the 2 yard line. Here's a perfect chance to let one of my kids who doesn't 
          have the super speed or catching ability to make an easy TD. I'll call 
          a short 2 yard drag to him and he scores and then talks about that touchdown 
          for the rest of the season like he won the Super Bowl.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Basic 
          Practice Plan and Drills</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">My practices 
          have evolved as the team has become more focused and I work on things 
          I see need attention during the games. I'll give you the outline from 
          my last practice first. I always write it down as its easy to lose track 
          of what you want to do while you're in the middle of it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">5 minutes 
          - movement drills. I use a large square say 20 yards by 20 yards. The 
          kids line up. They sprint to the first corner, then sidestep left to 
          the next corner, backpedal to the next corner and finally sidestep right 
          to where they began. We might do this twice. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">15 minutes 
          - <a href="http://www.y-coach.com/CD/Coaching.htm#Youth_Flag_Football_-_Flag_Pulling_Drill.htm">flag 
            pulling</a>. I use a rectangle about 10 yards wide and 20 yards long. 
          At one short end I line everyone up with a flag and a ball. At the other 
          short end stands a defender. One by one they have to try to run past 
          the defender and cross the line. They cannot step out of bounds. If 
          the defender forces them to slow down significantly, pulls their flag 
          or they step out of bounds he wins. If not the ball carrier wins. I 
          stand behind the defender and compliment or correct him on just about 
          every flag pull. Usually I can run this through twice with 11 guys. 
          Sometimes I'll have them just use positioning (no flag pulling) one 
          time, asking them to merely impede the runner so he has to slow down 
          or hopefully stop.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">10 minutes 
          - patterns. We run through all the patterns in the playbook. I emphasize 
          distance and where they should cut and end up. We go over and over the 
          few patterns until I feel confident they have it down.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">10 minutes 
          - patterns with passing/ catching. Same thing as above but we have a 
          kid throwing the ball to them. Here we're more focused on the short 
          1-2 yard drags and crosses and the qb rolling with the receiver as that's 
          what we mainly run in the games. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">10 minutes 
          - offensive plays. We run through the plays with no defense. I'll call 
          the plays in a huddle and they execute just like in a game situation. 
          I try to go at game speed since we only have 30 seconds to get the play 
          off. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">10+ minutes 
          - scrimmage. If numbers are uneven I grab an older brother or two (there 
          are usually a few hanging around the field) and have them play defense.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">As I mentioned 
          my practices have evolved as my team understands many things now they 
          didn't at the start of the season. I'll give you some other drills I 
          think helped earlier and even last year. First off I like to start with 
          drills they can do singularly or one-on-one. Then I move to drills that 
          require more participation but not all the moving parts. Towards the 
          end of practice I like to put it all together. I really like scrimmages 
          for any team but especially one you're trying to teach and learn about. 
          Things will become obvious when you scrimmage so do at least 15-20 minutes 
          for the first few practices.</font></p>

          and throwing one-on-one. Start them close and work with them on technique.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Defensive 
          swarming. Preach this in all scrimmages over and over. Call out the 
          ones who don't do it and congratulate the ones that go all the way across 
          the field even if they never end up in the play. I ran a little drill 
          where I'd stand in front of them with a ball and they'd all backpedal, 
          sidestep, etc. on my command. Then suddenly I'd yell swarm and they'd 
          all chase after the ball (don't throw it or you'll get a pileup). After 
          you yell swarm try to watch for stragglers and call them out. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Coverage 
          drills. Funny I haven't run one of these all year but they seemed so 
          important last year. Basically teaching man-to-man coverage. You can 
          work this several ways but having a qb and receiver and one or two cover 
          guys is a good one. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Defensive 
          theory. I lecture on zone, staying home, angles of pursuit. I'll set 
          the kids up in positions and have them stand there and ask/ tell them 
          what to do in various situations. Get them to thinking about where to 
          go and what to do. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Center/ 
          qb exchange. Had all kids work on this. We're directly under center 
          but if you run shotgun you're going to want to work on this.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Handoff's. 
          Don't assume this will go smoothly. Practice over and over the exchange. 
          You have to tell the qb where to put the ball and how to turn, how the 
          runner should clutch the ball. I want my end around to go full speed. 
          When we don't practice this they get cautious and slow or end up dropping 
          the ball. When that end around hits full speed it's great. When it comes 
          slow it's easier for the defense to anticipate and get it. And a fumbled 
          ball is a loss of down, never a good thing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Do you 
          have assistants in practice? I had two although with their schedules 
          I usually only had one show up. We'd divide the kids into smaller groups 
          so they all got a lot more reps during the practice drills. I think 
          this kept them more interested in the practice. Also, I think if you 
          have a fun attitude you can make it fun for them. But I do agree that 
          football drills at least the ones I did weren't like the fun games we'd 
          do in soccer for instance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">The toughest 
          challenge will be getting everything crammed in a one hour practice. 
          In the early season practices, I would split my kids up into 3 groups 
          and have my assistant plus another dad help. One group would be running 
          pass routes, another group doing a flag pulling drill and another group 
          working on handoffs/pitches. Working on the fundamentals in each group. 
          I'd switch the groups every 10 minutes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">Swarm drill 
          for about 5 minutes. I'd put on several flag belts and act as QB facing 
          the kids. When I pointed the football left, they moved left, right - 
          they moved right, act like pass - they yelled "PASS" and moved back, 
          if I tucked the ball and started to run - I'd yell SWARM and look to 
          make sure all the kids were swarming me and grabbing flags. This was 
          an idea from Orange that really worked great. The more you emphasize 
          this concept, the better.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">15 minutes 
          of two separate groups, one on offense, one on defense. Half throttle. 
          Switched them 1/2 way through. Just running through plays on offense 
          and having my assistant working on defensive formation, rushing, throwing 
          the ball to certain zones or running to see how they stopped the run.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10 min 
          scrimmage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">After a 
          few practices, I got a feel for what we needed to work on. Spending 
          a good chunk of time on flag pulling is a key.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="text-align: justify">As for 
          the most fun, I ask my kids this throughout the year. They almost universally 
          say they love scrimmaging. I try to get in at least 10 minutes of scrimmage 
          each practice.</font></p>

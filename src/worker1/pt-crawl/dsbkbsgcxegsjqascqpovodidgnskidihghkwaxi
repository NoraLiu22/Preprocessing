<p>Marie
Curie is one of the most famous scientists that ever lived. Her contributions
such as the discovery of Radium and other key elements help us out every day,
especially when getting an x-ray. </p>
<p>Manya,as she was called, was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland on November 7,
1867. Maria was only eight when her oldest sister caught typhus and died. That
death was followed less than three years later by the death of her mother,
Madame Sklodowska, who lost a five-year battle with tuberculosis at the age of
42. The surviving family members, Professor Sklodowski, his son Joseph and his
daughters Bronya, Hela, and Maria drew closer to one another.</p>
<p>Manya was the star student in her class. Her personal losses did not block her
academic success. After graduating at the age of 15, Maria hoped to get an advanced degree,
but while Joseph was able to enroll in the medical school at the University of
Warsaw, women were not allowed to. In 1891, she attended Sorbonne and changed
her name to Marie.&nbsp; Marie realized that neither her math or science background nor
her ability in technical French equaled that of her fellow students. Refusing to
let go of her goals, she was determined to overcome these drawbacks through hard
work. Marie finished first in her master's degree physics course in the summer
of 1893 and second in math the following year. Having little money stood in the
way of her math degree, but senior French scientists recognized her abilities
and were able to help her by awarding a scholarship.</p>
<p>In Paris she met her future husband and collaborator, Pierre 
Curie. Pierre was Lab Chief for the Paris Municipal School of Industrial Physics 
and Chemistry. Marie and Pierre shared lab space. Pierre gave Marie a lab of her 
own. In Marie, Pierre found an equal with a comparable devotion
to science. They would soon marry and have two daughters.</p>
<p>The
Curies would work together and combine to receive the Nobel Prize in 1903 for
their research with radium. The
Curies published in detail all the processes they used to isolate radium,
without patenting any of them. Radium was tightly linked with the Curies. Pierre's pioneering work on the effects of radium on living organisms showed it
could damage tissue, and this discovery was put to use against cancer and other
diseases.</p>
<p>Health
and Financial concerns were not the only problems to plague the Curies as Marie
wound up her thesis research. Hardship would soon follow Marie once again with
her husband dying in an accident. Pierre's life ended tragically on April 19, 1906, when he 
slipped and fell in the street. His head was crushed under the wheel of a 
horse-drawn car. Marie took over his classes and continued her own research. It
was the first time that a woman would hold an important university research position. She would work harder than ever and receive much prestige.&nbsp;
She won the Nobel Prize again in 1911.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<P align=left>Rumors and gossip surround the award: many jealous scientists 
snipe that she has been awarded the Nobel Prize only out of pity, since her 
husband, Pierre, has recently died, while others alleged that she is "morally 
unfit" to receive the prize because of an affair with a married man, Paul
Langevin, a long time family friend and a student 
of Pierre's. Paul was known as a sexist and a philanderer. 
When word of the affair reached the public, it nearly destroyed Marie's career 
and public standing in the scientific community. When the scandal broke, no one 
in the physics community supported Marie. Earlier in the year, the Swedish 
Academy informed Marie that she would again receive the Nobel Prize. When 
letters to Paul were published in a newspaper in Paris, the Academy told her 
that they did not want her to come to the public ceremony in Stockholm. Marie 
defied their wishes and went to the ceremony. Eventually, her honor and reputation 
were restored. </P>
<P align=left>During World War I, Marie worked as an "X-ray technician," 
taught radiological technology, and equipped mobile X-ray vans to assist in the 
war effort. She became head of the Paris Institute of Radium in 1914 and helped 
found the Curie Institute. Her health deteriorated quickly but still she worked 
diligently.&nbsp; </P>
<p>In 1934 at the age of 67, she died from leukemia, thought to have been from
research. Marie would lead an exciting life receiving 15 gold medal awards, 19
degrees, and many other honors. Mary Curie has opened a lot of doors for the
young women today.

  This medical journal focuses on the one-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of Radium by Marie and Pierre Curie. It deals with the expression of news from the discovery by the amazing scientists. The medical journal then goes on to explaining Marie’s death due to radiation and the harmful effects it has.  &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Curie, Eve. <i> Madame Curie</i>. Garden City, New Jersey:
Doubleday, Doran and Company, 1937.</b>&nbsp;<br>
The author of this book is the youngest daughter of Marie Curie. She has written this book by using records and letters of her mothers. Her own personal experience also is used in the book. The text is easy to follow and the writing is very clear. Pictures in the book give it an inside look at Marie. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>D.B."X-rays, not radium, may have killed Curie." <i>Nature</i> 377 (1995): 96.</b>  &nbsp;<br>
  This article deals with Marie’s fatal illness that brought her to her death. All signs of her dying are toward her experimentation with radiation. But they examine her work during World War I and her uses of X-rays. It is an interesting look at how they determine her cause of death. They author also speculates that the radiation is escaping from the dead
corpses.</p>

 Marie Curie’s fascination with science was developed early on by her father. School only elevated her curiosity and led her to a life of discovery. This book displays her love for science and her husband Pierre. Pictures help to relay the information more clearly.   Poynter, Margaret, Marie Curie: Discoverer of Radium. Chicago, Illinois: Enslow Publishers,            1994.  In an easy-to-read format, the biography emphasizes Marie
Curie's early life of poverty, desire to study, and contributions to the fields of chemistry, physics, and medicine. The science activities and the Periodic Table of Elements provided at the end of the book take away from the
volume's biographical intent. Black-and-white photographs are included.    &nbsp;</p>

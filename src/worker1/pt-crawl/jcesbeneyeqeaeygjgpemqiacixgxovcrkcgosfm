That’s 400 billion!&nbsp; In 2006 new domain registrations increased by an average of 2.1 million per month and Internet users quadrupled from 250 million to 1 billion versus 2000.&nbsp; How can a business “even be found” in this on-line universe much less be able to correlate all this information into a 1 to 1 marketing advantage, today?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if it isn’t tough enough already, how then will a business cope and reach down for customers in a market 10 times larger in 2010 when over 1.8 billion users will make over 4 trillion daily Internet inquiries? That’s 4 trillion!&nbsp; Our 10-plus years of technological and business-based leverage of the Internet’s capabilities indicates most businesses won’t because most have no clue how to leverage this virtual direct market bonanza.&nbsp; More particularly, and sadly, many new web-enabled companies believe that just because they have a website with a shopping cart, “the orders will just roll in” to them!&nbsp; Orders don’t and many of these will augment the typical U.S. new business failure rate of 10% that historically occurs within 18 months of start-up.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, if a company is properly set-up to take advantage of this ever-growing market, the reward for “getting found” on the web is substantial.&nbsp; Today, Internet search engines are the equivalent of electronic phone books of over 4+ billion pages – not only names - to our computer savvy population.&nbsp; They are ideal for finding anything and propagating marketing messages anytime if they are properly pointed.&nbsp; <br>Some key win-result facts: <br>(1) 80% of all new website traffic traditionally referred to as reach, comes from search engines; <br>(2) most importantly, 85% of all new Internet revenue transactions, traditionally referred to as lift, start with a search engine;&nbsp; <br>(3) these reach and lift success ratios translate to Web Marketing reaching searchers/buyers at their Exact "Buying Moment”!&nbsp; <br>Better known as one-on-one selling!&nbsp; Such results correspond to the shopper intersection in a grocery store aisle where 80% of the buyers make purchase decisions while standing in front of the product.&nbsp; No surprise given the web delivers to advertisers the 24 x 7, one-to-one marketing environment and results reviewed.</p><p>The above win-results created a break through milestone in the advertising and marketing world in 2006. For the first time ever, more advertising dollars were spent on the Internet than Radio, Television and Print combined.&nbsp; With such realities in mind, increasing focus is being placed on online promotion and marketing of products and services.&nbsp; And with the web’s non-stop expansion making it harder and harder to get found, small to medium sized online businesses are more at risk of falling behind because increasing know-how and capital are required to market their own sites.</p><p>In recognition of the above facts, etc., and to not fall prey to a misplaced “build it and they will come” Internet attitude, the smart Web Marketers have learned to invest an increasing percentage of their budgets in web advertisement.&nbsp; For reference, the below table highlights agency reports on their client web advertisement expenditures in 2006 and 2007.&nbsp; While it is stated there was an overall increase of 3% in total web advertisement expenditure, it is also clear the collective expenditure decreases of 14% in the 0% to 10 % categories were offset by an equal increase of 14% in the 11% to 60% category. </p><p>So where does the smart web marketer go?&nbsp; Internet Lift! After all, web advertisement comes in many forms at varying costs, but the smart web marketers have learned what 7mark.com has always known.&nbsp; The first advertisement budget step to getting “found” on the web demands Organic Search Engine Optimization (SEO).&nbsp;<a title="Search Engine Optimization Placement" href="http://cormarc.com/search_engine_optimization_placement.html" target="_blank"> Click Here!

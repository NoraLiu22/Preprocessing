<P align=left>For much of history, Elizabeth Petrovna, also known as Tsar 
Elizabeth I, has been regarded as the intermediary ruler between the two famed 
18th-century Russian Tsars, Peter the Great and Catherine I. She has been 
celebrated as a court favorite, renowned for having an "ethereal spirit," 
establishing herself as the center of attention at balls, and loving to dance. 
Yet, throughout the historiography of Russian rulers, few contributions of 
substance had been attributed to Elizabeth's reign. In recent years, however, 
the positive effects of her control over the throne have been published and the 
stigma of being the "transitional" leader during the middle years of the 1700s 
has diminished. </P>
<P align=left>Elizabeth Petrovna led a charmed existence. Born on 18 December 
1709, to Peter the Great and Martha Skaronska, or Catherine I, a peasant, she 
was technically illegitimate, (her father had not found the time to marry her 
mother until after Elizabeth was born); nevertheless, she grew up in a 
supportive and loving environment. She lived an enchanted lifestyle in which she 
learned to appreciate the customs and etiquette of both Western culture and 
Russian tradition; Elizabeth was a passionate church attendee, Russian patriot, 
fluent speaker of the French language, and a competent dancer of the minuet. 
</P>
<P align=left>Elizabeth’s father, Peter, had abolished the law of succession 
during his reign. Subsequently, the Supreme Council was given the right to 
choose Peter’s heir to the throne. In the initial years after her father’s death 
in 1725, Elizabeth was nonchalant regarding political activity; she was content 
with being a social butterfly and Russian society’s fashion leader. In 1730, 
Elizabeth’s cousin Anne of Courland became Empress and Elizabeth was allowed to 
remain a promiscuous, apathetic Russian socialite. For years, she trounced 
around Russia, courting numerous lovers and spending exorbitant amounts of 
money.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>By 1740, however, Elizabeth had matured; she was frustrated by her 
cousin, Empress Anne's, vindictiveness as a political leader and the perpetual 
threats of banishing Elizabeth to a nunnery. As Empress Anne lay on her 
deathbed, the people hoped that Elizabeth would take the throne. Instead, she 
was passed over in favor of Prince Anton and Anna Leopoldnovna’s newly born son, 
Ivan VI, on whose behalf his mother, served as regent. Secret agents acting on 
the orders of the Regent Anna watched Elizabeth day and night. Anna was worried 
that Elizabeth would incite a revolt against her, because Anna recognized that 
as a foreigner, the Russian populace distrusted her, while Elizabeth was a 
favorite of the guards and loved by the people.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>On November 25, 1741, Elizabeth was ready to take her place among 
the annals of Russian political leaders. She began her coup d’état by praying in 
a private chapel with a silver cross in hand. Then, with the help of her 
political supporters, Elizabeth arrested Regent Anna's husband, advisors, and 
person, consequently establishing herself as Empress. Even in victory, Elizabeth 
was fair, graceful, and managed to keep her revenge in check; she had emerged 
from the shadows of neglected, carefree princess status to become Russia’s 
ruler.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>Elizabeth's almost twenty-year reign that officially began with 
her coronation on April 25, 1742, proved to be politically and militarily 
beneficial to Russia. The incompetence of the previous two tsars had cost the 
country scores of national pride; Elizabeth increased morale by reinstating her 
father's policy of appointing only Russian citizens to top advisory positions 
within the government, thereby avoiding foreign influence. The Senate was 
revitalized and the 'Secret Council' was eradicated. She made humanitarian gains 
by outlawing the death penalty. In 1743, she attained a historic victory for 
diplomacy by negotiating an end to the long-standing land dispute between Russia 
and Sweden. She was also chiefly responsible for maintaining the alliance 
between Russia, Austria, and France, against Prussia during the Seven Years' 
War.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>Elizabeth's reign was marked by political as well as cultural 
advancements. On January 25, 1755, she set forth a decree to establish the 
founding of the University of Moscow. She proved to be a blessing to the Russian 
Orthodox Church; she donated large sums of money to the church and set the price 
of bibles at five rubles. Elizabeth established a solid foundation for the arts; 
she created a state theater, brought in Italian instrumentalists, singers, and 
set designers to complement the court choir. In addition, she changed Petersburg 
architecture to reflect the styles that were dominant in Western Europe at that 
time.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>On December 25, 1761, Elizabeth died leaving no children as heirs; 
she had never married due to disputes within her family and her love of sexual 
freedom. Instead, she left the throne to her nephew, Peter II who died shortly 
thereafter. His wife, Sophia of&nbsp; Zerbst, who would later become <a href="catherine2.html"> Catherine 
the Great</a>, succeeded him as one of Russia's greatest tsars. For years, Elizabeth 
had been portrayed as a minimal player in Russian tsarist history. Recently, 
however, her own accomplishments have been highlighted. She is no longer the 
transitional monarch, solely responsible for preparing Catherine for the throne. 
Instead, she is considered a powerful, free-spirited, and strong willed woman 
who coalesced Russia militarily, politically, and culturally.&nbsp;</P>

<P align=left><B>Almedingen, E.M. Catherine, Empress of Russia. New York: Dodd, 
Mead and Company. 1961.</B><BR>While this source is about Empress Catherine I, 
Tsar Elizabeth is covered extensively, as it was she who brought Tsar Catherine 
to Russia. Elizabeth is depicted as moody and vindictive, displayed by the fact 
that she would make decisions, and then quickly change her mind. In addition to 
a sullen attitude, the book gives examples of Elizabeth's cruelty, especially 
directed at Catherine and Elizabeth's disappointment with Peter III, her 
successor, because he was German, Lutheran, and therefore friendly with Sweden. 
Little is said of Elizabeth's feelings toward the other relevant nations of her 
time, although the author notes that she was feared by Prussia, liked by 
Austria, and had peaceful relations with Sweden. Through all of the criticisms 
and open talk of Elizabeth's personality, the author takes a positive look at 
the disposition and character of Elizabeth, and her relationship with those who 
would succeed her: Peter III and then Catherine the Great. </P>
<P align=left><B>Anthony, Katherine. Catherine the Great. New York: Garden City 
Publishing Company. 1925.</B><BR>The author provides interesting details about 
Tsar Elizabeth and her life before she came to power: Elizabeth’s signing of her 
mother's will so that her half brother, Peter II, could become tsar, Elizabeth's 
childhood, and her private life. On a basic human level, Anthony argues 
Elizabeth was a contradiction in terms as she was in some ways immoral, yet also 
very religious. While the book does not mention much about Elizabeth's own 
reign, it does describe how Elizabeth’s successful acquisition of Catherine the 
Great to Russia’s throne. </P>

part of resources for their Russian Studies and History departments. The site 
supplies a chronological list of all the Russian rulers from Peter I, the great 
to Nicholas II. The name of each ruler is linked to a page that provides a short 
biography. In addition, each ruler has a timeline of events under their name 
that includes all of the major events that occurred during their lifespan. Under 
Elizabeth, some notable events listed include: the founding of Moscow 
University, formation of the first Russian theater, and the granting of power to 
nobles to ban serfs to Siberia . However, the Russian wars are not listed. This 
site provides a useful starting point for research in denoting key events and 
people in the history of the Russian empire. </P>
<P align=left><B>Coughlan, Robert. <i> Elizabeth and Catherine: Empresses of all the
Russia</i>s. Ed. Jay Gold. New York: Putnam. 1974.</B>&nbsp;<BR>The author uses the 
story of Empress Elizabeth I as the backdrop for the life and reign of Catherine 
the Great. According to Coughlan, Catherine, who was neither named Catherine nor 
of Russian blood, would not have become the ruler she was without the influence 
and tutelage of Elizabeth I. The accomplishments and influence of Tsar Elizabeth 
have often been overshadowed by other Russian Tsars or overlooked by historians. 
This author takes a chronological approach to the study of the life and 
influence of Elizabeth I on the reign of Catherine the Great. This book is a 
useful tool to any Elizabeth I historian; however, it does not look at the 
history of Elizabeth from what she personally contributed to society, but 
rather, approaches the study of Elizabeth’s life and reign from the perspective 
of how she influenced one of the greatest rulers of Russian history, Catherine 
the Great. </P>
<P align=left><B>Grey, Ian. <i> The Horizon History of Russia</i>. New York: American 
Heritage Publishing Co. 1970.</B><BR>Ian Grey is a Russian Tsarist historian who 
has researched numerous political leaders and historical events. In the History 
of Russia, he describes Elizabeth Petrovna's desire to westernize Russia, as she 
had learned from the example of her father, Peter I, and subsequently she 
transformed Petersburg into the styles of Western Europe. This book gives a more 
complete account of her rise to power than Grey’s other work, <U>The&nbsp; 
Romanovs</U>. During her reign, she was credited with founding Russia's first 
state theater, possessing ill feelings for Frederick II of Prussia, and 
involving Russia in two wars: the Seven Years War and the war with Sweden over 
lands conquered by her father. She was a forceful and decisive woman who refused 
to lose the latter mentioned military engagement.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left><B>Grey, Ian. <i> The Romanovs; the Rise and Fall of a Dynasty</i>. New 
York: Doubleday and Company, Inc. 1970.</B><BR>The author dedicates an entire 
chapter in this book to Elizabeth's life, both before and after becoming tsar. 
Elizabeth was seventeen when Peter ruled as tsar and therefore, the perfect age 
for marriage. This book delves into issues regarding Peter's plans for her 
marriage. The author then goes into detail on such issues during her reign as 
her approach to dealing with the church, the military and outside countries. The 
piece also details Elizabeth's insistence of having no foreign advisors 
following her father's death. This is a useful tool in the research of Empress 
Elizabeth I as it gives a history of all of the&nbsp; Romanov Dynasty and 
particularly helpful information on Elizabeth. </P>

Rediscovering the Romanovs</i>. Ed. Donald J. Raleigh. Armonk, NY: M. E. Sharpe 
Publishing. 1996.&nbsp;</B><BR>The author of this compilation regarding Russian 
Emperors and Empresses from the&nbsp; Romanov Dynasty dedicates an entire 
chapter to Empress Elizabeth I. While her twenty-year rule has often been 
dismissed as superficial, the author attempts to honestly describe both the 
negative and positive aspects of Elizabeth’s reign. At times, she was frivolous, 
owning more than 15,000 ball gowns, but she also maintained a strong arm when it 
came to issues of the death penalty and the importance of her father, Peter the 
Great's, canonization. Overall, the author views Elizabeth in an affirmative 
light, and this work is useful in discovering more about the reign not only of 
Elizabeth, but all of the&nbsp; Romanovs. </P>

Her Reign and Her Russia, 1741-1762.&quot; <i> History Today</i> 47 (1997).</B><BR>This 
journal article is actually a book review from History Today of&nbsp; Evgney V. 
Anismov's book, <U>Empress Elizabeth: Her Reign and Her Russia, 1741-1762</U>. 
Within the book, Elizabeth is depicted as a poor ruler who merely held the 
throne until Catherine II came to Russia's aid. The reviewer criticizes the 
author’s portrayal of Elizabeth as simply an interlude between two great rulers. 
Rather he believes that she was an accomplished singer who helped developed the 
Russian theater. Subsequently, the strength of the book, according to the 
reviewer, is in the book’s presentation of court life and culture in 
mid-eighteenth century Russia.&nbsp; </P>

Published by the Moscow State University at Lomonsov, the article details the 
history of the university. It was named after Mikhail Lomonosov (1711 - 1765), 
an outstanding Russian academician and scientist of the day who greatly 
contributed to the building of the university. Tsar Elizabeth I commissioned the 
building of the university on January 25, 1755 (St. Tatiana's Day as established 
by the Russian Orthodox Church). The opening ceremony took place on April 26, 
1755. While the website provides valuable and vast information on Moscow State 
University and touts Elizabeth I as the reason for its inception (and a copy of 
the charter document), it does little to provide information about her life and 
reign. Therefore, it is not a helpful source in the study of the life of Empress 
Elizabeth I and only beneficial to those looking at the influence of Elizabeth I 
on the founding of the university. </P>
<P align=left><b>Longworth, Phillip. The Three Empresses: Catherine I, Anne, and 
Elizabeth of Russia. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. 1972.</b><br>
The author is an accomplished Russian historian who was taught the language 
while serving in the British army. His work details the lives and reigns of 
three of the Great Russian Tsarinas of the 18th century, Catherine I, Anne, and 
Elizabeth. In the section on Tsar Elizabeth, the author takes a chronological 
approach to the life of Elizabeth I. He does a nice job of breaking down the 
stereotypes about her carefree, and sometimes negligent behavior as displayed 
through her possession of 15,000 ball gowns at the time of her death. He goes on 
to develop a complete character sketch that details her weaknesses (her tendency 
to flounder and love of carousing with men) as well as strengths (her devotion 
to the Russian state and her vehement opposition of the death penalty). This is 
a useful source for finding a relatively concise and complete background on the 
life of Elizabeth I of Russia.</P>

(16 December

tourism to Russia. While it provides a brief historiography of the country from 
the beginning of the Russian empire through the presidency of Vladimir Putin, 
the article makes no mention of Elizabeth I. In addition, it has a disclaimer 
that states that a professional historian did not write the information. 
Therefore, one must be wary of the accuracy. However, as a source of travel 
information it is quite useful in providing vacationers with a concise guide to 
the country. The site has links to destinations, transportation, visa, 
practicalities, apartment rent, accommodations, airline tickets, train tickets, 
tours and taxi service. Therefore, while it is a useless source for finding 
information regarding the life of Tsar Elizabeth I, it is a beneficial link to 
travelers wishing to visit the Russian state.<BR><BR><B>Rice, Tamara Talbot. <i> 
Elizabeth, Empress of Russia</i>. New York: Praeger Publishers. 1970.</B><BR>While 
numerous books cover Elizabeth I as a secondary or tertiary character, this book 
focuses solely on her life and reign as the primary source of interest. Details 
and conditions about her life are broken down by chapter. The book recounts the 
trouble Elizabeth had as Peter I's only child to reach maturity and details her 
inner turmoil regarding whether or not she desired to take possession over the 
Russian throne. In addition, knowing that her successor was not Russian 
Orthodox, Elizabeth was perplexed at the difficulty of her situation; she wanted 
to spread Russian control past its contemporary boundaries, but could only do so 
by naming a successor from without the confines of the Russian Orthodox Church's 
control. To date, this book is the most complete source published concerning 
Elizabeth's life as Empress of Russia and her contributions to the Russian 
empire.&nbsp;</P>

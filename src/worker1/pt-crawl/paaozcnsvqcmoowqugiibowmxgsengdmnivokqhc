/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: Wallace delivered a 
        portion of this lecture at his last public appearance, before the Royal 
        Institution on 22 January 1909. Shortly thereafter it was printed in full 
        in <u>Fortnightly Review</u> (London) and <u>The Independent</u> (New 
        York). Wallace would later take up these matters in more detail in his 
        last major book, <u>The World of Life</u> (S732), in 1910. Original pagination 
        (from <u>Fortnightly Review</u>) indicated within double brackets. To link directly

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 411]]</font> The theory 
        of Natural Selection, commonly called Darwinism, is one of the most simple 
        and easy of comprehension in the whole range of science, yet, after fifty 
        years of continuous exposition and study, there is perhaps none that is 
        so widely and persistently misunderstood.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the more remarkable because it is based 
        upon facts of Nature which are not only universally admitted, but are 
        well known at least verbally to every one who takes the slightest interest 
        in living things; and, further, this misunderstanding is not confined 
        to the ignorant or unscientific alone, but prevails also among the educated 
        classes, and is found even in our highest seats of learning among the 
        teachers and highly placed professors of various departments of Biology.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention here to combat these 
        strange misapprehensions in detail, but it is my hope--if I can succeed 
        in placing the subject before my readers in all its simplicity--while 
        yet fully emphasising its underlying complexity and grandeur--to satisfy 
        them that the theory of Darwin is the only one that is in accordance with 
        Nature herself--with her most obvious facts and phenomena, with the broad 
        and fundamental laws which are in action now, and have been so throughout 
        all past ages--and that any less far-reaching and less fundamental theories 
        are altogether inadequate and unmeaning. </p>
      <p><i>Why Darwinism is Simple and Intelligible.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some readers may be surprised at the statement 
        that the theory of Darwinism is essentially simple, and easily understood. 
        Why is meant is, that it needs no special training to understand it; no 
        laboratory work is required, no knowledge of anatomy or physiology. The 
        facts appealed to are, throughout, the facts of external nature, which 
        every one has (or ought to have) the opportunity of observing for himself. 
        And the more important principles arising out of these facts are also 
        of the most simple and obvious nature, so much so that the objection is 
        often made that they are self-evident truisms.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps for the very reason that Darwinism 
        is so simple that it is so persistently misunderstood. Those who have 
        gone <font color="990000">[[p. 412]]</font> through a long course of study 
        in the anatomy, physiology, or embryology of animals or plants, very naturally 
        think that a theory which can dispense with their work (though it is often 
        strikingly supported thereby) cannot be of much value; while it often 
        happens that those who have the most extensive knowledge of these departments 
        of Biology do not possess the special type of faculty that is essential 
        for a full grasp of the great masses of fact which underlie and are essential 
        to the actual working of the principle of evolution through Natural Selection.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, and much more, will, I hope, be made 
        clear as we proceed with the examination of our subject.</p>
      
      <p><i>Numbers, Variety, and Intermingling of Life-forms.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first great group of facts to which I must 
        refer is that of the vast <i>numbers</i>, the astounding <i>variety</i>, 
        and the universal <i>intermingling</i> of the species or forms under 
        which life is manifested on the earth.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking first the vegetable kingdom, as that 
        upon which the very existence of animal life depends, and limiting ourselves 
        to the higher, or <i>flowering</i> plants, as those best known, and 
        which from our point of view are alone of importance, we find that so 
        comparatively poor a flora as that of the British Isles comprises about 
        1,800 species (counting only the species and sub-species in Sir J. Hooker's 
        British Flora), but probably over 2,000 on the estimate of most local 
        botanists. Europe has about 9,000 species, while in the whole world there 
        are now about 136,000 described species, but perhaps nearly twice that 
        number, if the whole area were as well explored botanically as Europe.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, while Britain in proportion to its area 
        seems to be much richer than Europe, the latter seems much poorer than 
        the world, as it really is on account of the superabounding luxuriance 
        of the tropics and the warmer regions, in vegetable life.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though Europe as a whole seems poorer than 
        Britain, yet many equal areas in Europe are much richer. Thus the European 
        Alps from Savoy to Styria, with about the same area as Britain, has more 
        than double the number of species. In the warmer regions of the world 
        there is still more abundance of species--the limited Cape district of 
        South Africa, in little more than half the area of Britain, has about 
        4,500 species of flowering plants.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last is held by some botanists to be the 
        richest plant-area in the world; but I believe when the Equatorial regions 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 413]]</font> come to be as well explored by 
        resident botanists, districts will be found which are very much richer.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large number of distinct species that live 
        together in small areas is very well shown by the following table from 
        the personal observation of one of our best British botanists, the late 
        H. C. Watson, and therefore quite trustworthy as to comparative numbers:--</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S669a.jpg" width="55%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here a most striking example 
        of the close intermingling of the species, nearly half those of a whole 
        county being found in one square mile of that county, while ten square 
        miles has almost as many species as sixty square miles.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just mention two other examples given 
        me by the resident clergymen of two parishes. Dorsetshire possesses 1,010 
        species of flowering plants, and the small parish of Edmonsham has 640 
        species, though only 1/340 the area. Lincolnshire, a very large and flat 
        county, but with a very diversified soil, has 1,200 species, while the 
        parish of Cadney, 1/920 its extent, has 720 species.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very small areas are also often unexpectedly 
        productive. In Cadney parish, a plot of sixteen feet square produced 38 
        species, while Darwin records a patch of turf 4ft. by 3ft. in which he 
        found 20 species. In insect and bird life very similar facts have been 
        noticed, though few observers have recorded them; and we thus see how 
        complex must be the adaptations of the various species which enable them 
        to live thus intermingled, each in its special station and due proportion 
        to the rest.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This special adaptation is well shown in the 
        case of those rare species which only exist in one or two limited spots. 
        Such are the lovely <i>Gentiana verna</i>, found only in a few square 
        miles of wild moorland in Upper Teesdale, in Yorkshire; the Spring Snowflake 
        (<i>Lencojum vernum</i>) in one small thicket in West Dorset, and several 
        confined to single mountains in the highlands of Scotland or Wales. Here 
        the conditions seem almost identical in other adjacent areas, yet these 
        particular plants do not find it possible to live elsewhere.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving this part of my subject, which 
        might be greatly extended, I must call attention to the somewhat close 
        agreement in the variety of interrelated insects and plants in the same 
        areas. The larv&aelig; of Lepidoptera, commonly known as caterpillars, 
        almost all feed upon the foliage of living plants. Many <font color="990000">[[p. 
        414]]</font> plants support several species of caterpillars, while some 
        of the commoner caterpillars will feed on several different though usually 
        allied plants. Now it is very suggestive that the number of species of 
        Lepidoptera and of flowering plants is very nearly the same--somewhere 
        about 2,000. Beetles, however, are much more numerous (3,260 species), 
        but these feed largely on decaying vegetable and animal matter, while 
        many devour other insects.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps even more important than the numbers 
        of the species of plants and animals and of their existing so constantly 
        intermingled in the same area, is the fact that a very large proportion 
        of the whole are what may be termed common or widely distributed species. 
        Perhaps one-half of the known species are in this class, and thus the 
        individuals in each species, though often local or thinly scattered over 
        the country, yet exist in millions or thousands of millions. Many of our 
        best known plants, birds, and insects, range over a large part of Europe 
        and North Africa, while several extend all across Northern Asia to Manchuria 
        and Japan. They are what Darwin has termed dominant species, and it is 
        these which have always given rise to new forms when changed conditions 
        required them. This leads us to the next branch of our subject.</p>
      
      <p><i>The Powers of Increase of Plants and Animals.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important factors in the development 
        of the world of life, from its first appearance to the present time, has 
        been the power of increase possessed by every species of organism. This 
        is best shown in plants, and in some of the lower animals, in which the 
        possible increase of a single pair is not four- or five-fold, as in some 
        of the higher animals, but usually many hundred- and often many thousand-fold.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fair-sized oak tree will produce yearly at 
        least a hundred thousand acorns, and the tree lives several centuries. 
        The botanist Kerner states that a common British weed (<i>Sisymbrium Sophia</i>) 
        often has three-quarters of a million seeds; and that if all these grew 
        to maturity for only three years, the whole of the land-surface of the 
        globe would not hold them all!<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> A tall spike 
        of foxglove, loaded with its seed-vessels full of minute seeds, has probably 
        as many, as have some of the orchids and many other plants, so that the 
        powers of increase of the vegetable world seem to us wholly beyond what 
        can possibly be needed. But there are certain considerations which lead 
        us to conclude that this is not so; one being that when at rare <font color="990000">[[p. 
        415]]</font> intervals very large areas are devastated by fire, by flood, 
        or by volcanic eruption, it is of great importance that the lands so rendered 
        bare should be covered again with vegetation as quickly as possible, and 
        thus avoid the extinction of numerous species of both plants and animals.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the animal kingdom we still find the 
        reproductive powers always ample and often enormous. The slowest breeding 
        of all is the elephant, which is supposed to rear one young one every 
        ten years; but as it lives to more than one hundred years, Darwin calculates 
        that in 750 years (a few moments only in the geological history of the 
        earth) each pair would, if only all their offspring lived and bred, produce 
        nineteen millions of elephants.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smaller mammals and most birds increase 
        much more rapidly, as many of these produce two or more families every 
        year. The rabbit is one of the most rapid breeders, and Mr. Kearton calculates 
        that, under the most favourable conditions, a single pair might easily 
        increase to a million in four or five years. Australia, being so favourable 
        in climate, vegetation, and absence of enemies, they have so multiplied 
        as to become a nuisance and almost a danger, and though their introduction 
        was very easy, all our powers of destruction seem, so far, impotent against 
        them.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that the numbers of 
        many of the species of animals bear little or no relation to their rate 
        of increase, the slowest rate being amply sufficient to keep up the greatest 
        population when the conditions of life are otherwise favourable. Two well-known 
        cases are those of the American bison and the Passenger pigeon of the 
        same country. In the eighteenth century the bison ranged over almost the 
        whole of temperate North America, being abundant in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, 
        sometimes reaching the east coasts; while within the memory of living 
        persons it occurred all over the western plains in vast herds of 10,000 
        or 20,000 each. The Passenger pigeon lays only two eggs, but seldom rears 
        more than one chick in each nest. The quantity of these birds was formerly 
        enormous. In the early part of the nineteenth century the ornithologist 
        Wilson gave a wonderful account of them. One of their breeding places 
        in Kentucky was a tract of forest forty miles long and several miles wide, 
        and in this space (in April and May) almost every tree was crowded with 
        nests, both on the higher and lower branches. The parent birds daily roamed 
        the country to a distance of nearly one hundred miles for their food and 
        that of their young. Wilson describes one of these great flocks on its 
        daily excursions as being more than a <font color="990000">[[p. 416]]</font> 
        mile wide and of very great depth, in the air far above gunshot. They 
        flew with immense speed--50-60 miles an hour--and the stream went on for 
        several hours before it diminished in density, and some hours more in 
        straggling parties. He calculated, roughly, that this one flock, going 
        to and from one breeding place, contained about two thousand millions 
        of birds, and this was only one out of many such aggregations known at 
        that time in the United States.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the spread of cultivation and the clearing 
        away of the forests have entirely destroyed this most striking illustration 
        of what Darwin termed a dominant species; which, though so apparently 
        defenceless, with so many enemies, and with a very slow rate of increase, 
        was yet able to maintain such an enormous population.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An equally remarkable but somewhat different 
        phenomenon is that of the curious little Lemming of the north of Europe 
        (something like a very short-tailed vole) which at intervals of ten or 
        fifteen years, under some unknown favourable conditions, increases so 
        enormously in the Arctic and sub-Arctic mountains of Scandinavia, as to 
        overrun the adjacent parts of the country, always migrating southward 
        and spreading out east and west towards the sea. The migrating hordes 
        march on slowly, increasing as they go, devouring the country like a flight 
        of locusts, sometimes continuing their march for from one to three years, 
        but always going on, and never returning, crossing over lakes, climbing 
        over houses, eating their way through haystacks, till they ultimately 
        disappear in the ocean. The whole great army thus melts away, the remnants 
        being everywhere cleared off by the multitude of enemies attracted to 
        the feast. A somewhat similar picture of the sudden increase of swarms 
        of rodents, is given by Mr. Hudson in that wonderful chapter of his fascinating 
        <i>Naturalist in La Plata</i> entitled &quot;A Wave of Life.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insects show the same phenomena, but they generally 
        possess a still higher rate of increase. The queen bee lays from two to 
        three thousand eggs, and many moths are equally productive. But one of 
        the most striking cases is that of the flesh-fly, which lays twenty thousand 
        eggs and these go through their complete transformation of grub and pupa 
        to perfect fly in two weeks. Linn&aelig;us calculated that the progeny 
        of three of these flies would devour a dead horse as quickly as could 
        a lion.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These overwhelming powers and possibilities 
        of increase throughout the whole realm of Nature must never be forgotten; 
        for they serve to explain many of the phenomena of the world of life. 
        They afford as it were the material and the motive power which has led 
        to the interpenetration of so many widely <font color="990000">[[p. 417]]</font> 
        different types, all securing their food and that of their offspring in 
        the same localities, yet in many different ways, so as not to interfere 
        with each other--in the earth, the water, or the air, in field or forest, 
        on marshes, or dry uplands, or sandy wastes. Thus, in the course of ages, 
        every vacant place in Nature has come to be occupied, and immediately 
        one type dies out others similarly or divergently modified are ever ready 
        to take its place.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds afford many illustrations of this specialisation. 
        Our Tree-creeper has a slender curved bill and very strong feet and toes, 
        adapted to run up the trunks and branches of trees and pick out the small 
        insects that hide in the crevices of the bark. In South America there 
        is a quite distinct family, the Dendrocolaptid&aelig;, specialised for 
        a similar purpose. A still more numerous and more highly specialised family 
        are the Woodpeckers, whose chisel-like beaks, extremely hard skulls, and 
        elastic, very muscular necks, enable them to cut away the solid wood of 
        trees so as to reach the various kinds of large grubs and other insects 
        which make their burrows there. Their very long and extensile tongue with 
        a horny barbed tip enables them to pierce and draw out the defenceless 
        insect. These three families have all been modified to obtain insects 
        from trees, yet are not closely related to each other.</p>
      
      <p><i>Inheritance with Variation.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now pass on to consider two combined groups 
        of facts which are of the most vital importance to a comprehension of 
        Darwinism--inheritance and variation.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are often termed &quot;laws&quot;; but, taken in 
        their generality, they are the commonest and best known of all the facts 
        pertaining to living things, and it is rather the mode and extent of their 
        occurrence than the occurrence itself which are subject to special laws. 
        Our ignorance of the fundamental causes of these two phenomena is often 
        adduced as a difficulty in the way of the Darwinian theory, but it has 
        really nothing to do with it, as all we require to know are the facts. 
        The <i>facts</i> alone, not their causes, are the agents in bringing 
        about Natural Selection.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great fact of inheritance--of each species 
        producing its like--is so common, so universal even, that it is only the 
        deviations from it that surprise us. That offspring should be like their 
        parents seems to us quite natural and to require no explanation; it is 
        only when there is a considerable difference that we begin to ask the 
        reason why.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheritance, therefore, is a universal fact 
        in the world of life-- <font color="990000">[[p. 418]]</font> but it is 
        not absolute and nobody expects it to be absolute. Never do we see a son 
        absolutely like his father--even so like as twins often are, and they 
        are never <i>absolutely</i> alike. But in all well-marked species of plants 
        or animals the offspring are so much like the parents as never to be mistaken 
        for other species. Yet variation always exists; it is really very considerable 
        even when small numbers of individuals are examined, and it follows certain 
        laws of a general nature, which are of great importance to a comprehension 
        of Darwinism, and to these laws we must therefore devote some attention.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first great law is that the frequency of 
        a certain amount</p>
      
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S669b.gif" width="65%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p>of variation of any character, in any species of animal or plant, depends 
        (in any inverse ratio) upon the amount of its departure from the mean 
        value. It may be accurately represented in a diagram by what is termed 
        by mathematicians the Curve of Error, but perhaps more intelligibly as 
        the Curve of Variation.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above diagram shows this curve, obtained 
        from the measurements of 2,600 men, taken at random. The horizontal scale 
        gives the heights in feet and inches, while the figures are so arranged 
        as to show the number of men at the height on the scale in a line with 
        their inner margins.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 419]]</font> Beginning 
        on the left we see that only one man was so short as 4ft. 8in., about 
        twelve were 5ft. high; while fifty were 5ft. 4in.; and above this height 
        the numbers increase rapidly till we find 150 at 5ft. 7in. and 160 at 
        5ft. 8in. From this point the numbers of each successive inch of height 
        decrease, just as they had increased up to that height, there being 150 
        at 5ft. 9in., only fifty at 6ft., less than ten at 6ft. 6in., and only 
        one who reaches 6ft. 8in. The point where the numbers reach a maximum 
        show us the mean height of the whole of the men measured; and as there 
        were numerically more of this particular height than at any other, and 
        also more at each half-inch or inch below or above it than at any lesser 
        or greater height, we are almost sure to find that those about the mean 
        height form the majority in every miscellaneous assemblage of people, 
        even when only a few hundreds in number.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the extremes of stature there 
        is less certainty, just because they are so rare. Among even a hundred 
        people you might chance to find a giant or a dwarf, but if a million were 
        measured in Europe or America we should almost certainly find some as 
        tall as 7ft., and others as short as 4ft. 4in. By adding together the 
        whole of the figures on the above diagram we obtain the total of the 2,600 
        men measured, each figure showing the number of men in a range of half 
        an inch above and below the height on the scale.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these diagrams apply not to man only, but 
        serve to show very closely what occurs with almost all the commoner animals 
        and plants in a state of nature. This was long doubted or denied, simply 
        because no one had taken the trouble to collect and measure large numbers 
        of individuals of the same species. Even Darwin himself did not realise 
        how much and how universally most wild species vary. Hence he used misleading 
        expressions, as--&quot;if they vary: for without variation Natural Selection 
        can do nothing.&quot; And again--&quot;A variety must, perhaps after a long interval, 
        vary or present individual differences of the same favourable nature as 
        before.&quot; These expressions (used in the <i>Origin of Species</i>) have 
        been seized upon and exaggerated so as to present quite a false picture 
        of the facts of variability in a state of nature.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is one of the most important series 
        of facts on which Natural Selection depends, I must call your special 
        attention to two other diagrams which show the actual variations among 
        even a very few individuals of some common birds, and these will also 
        serve to show what has now been proved to be the case with <i>all animals</i> 
        and still more remarkably with <i>plants</i>.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diagram shows the amount of variation among 
        forty <font color="990000">[[p. 420]]</font> specimens of the common North 
        American bird, the Redwing. These forty birds were all full-grown males, 
        and were obtained at the same place and on the same day, so that all differences 
        due to age, sex, season, or locality are excluded.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bird is represented by a dot, and the amount 
        of variation of four distinct parts is shown. Each group of dots must 
        be considered separately as showing a variation in proportion to that 
        of the mean dimensions of that part. The scale of each group &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S669c.jpg" width="55%" height="auto" />
      </p>
<p>or part is therefore different, as shown by the bill and 
        the total length, which could not be here given in the true proportions.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing to notice here is that in 
        all the different parts the amount of variation in proportion to the mean 
        dimensions of that part is very large, varying from 1/8 in the length 
        of wing to 1/5 in the length of the tail. Of course, with hundreds or 
        thousands of specimens the extremes of variation would be much greater, 
        while the great irregularity in the grouping of the dots would be diminished, 
        and with higher and higher numbers a tolerably <font color="990000">[[p. 
        421]]</font> uniform curve would at length emerge of the same character 
        as that of our first diagram.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important feature is the diversity 
        of grouping of the dots in each case, showing that each part varies to 
        a considerable extent independently of the other parts. This is well shown 
        in the case of the wing and tail of these birds, the former showing a 
        less range of variation and more regularity in the grouping on each side 
        of the mean value. This is what we might expect, since the exact adjustment 
        of the wing for flight is probably more important than an equally exact 
        adjustment of the tail. The very large amount of variation in the length 
        of the bill is a rather unexpected feature, and one that is very liable 
        to be overlooked. The bird's bill is, however, of immense importance to 
        it, serving all the various purposes for which mammals use their fore 
        feet, teeth, and lips. A considerable amount of constantly occurring variability 
        is therefore of high value as affording the material for more and more 
        exact adjustment whenever adverse changes in the environment render such 
        adjustment necessary.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give one example of a very instructive 
        form of diagram in which we are able to show the actual dimensions of 
        the various parts of small animals within the limits of a page, and thus 
        obtain more exact knowledge of the kind and degree of variability that 
        exists in all the commoner species of animals than we could by having 
        the specimens before us. Hundreds of collectors and naturalists had continually 
        examined large numbers of specimens of the same species without ever noticing 
        how much they varied from each other in every part and organ; and so constantly 
        were these differences overlooked, that when Darwin appealed to them in 
        support of his theory, they denied their existence. Darwin himself was 
        not aware of the extent and universality of this variability till Mr. 
        J. A. Allen published exact measurements so many hundreds of specimens 
        of common American birds in 1871.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diagram here given (see page 423) is constructed 
        from Mr. Allen's measurements, and serves to illustrate the value of the 
        materials he has given us. It has been chosen because the bird measured 
        is of small size, and is thus suitable for presentation here, while the 
        graduated proportions of the six important parts of the bird which are 
        compared enable them to be given on the same page without overlapping.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird is one of the commonest in North America, 
        where it is called the Bob-o-link, or Rice-bird. It is allied to our Yellow-hammers 
        and Buntings and to the Ortolan of Europe. Twenty specimens were measured, 
        as shown by the vertical <font color="990000">[[p. 422]]</font> rows of 
        dots numbered 1 to 20. The specimens are arranged in the order of their 
        size, No. 1 having the shortest and No. 20 the longest body. The upper 
        rows of dots shows this increasing length as measured from the bottom 
        line of the diagram, the mean length of the body of the twenty birds being 
        4 &#189; inches. It will be seen that in none of the other parts here shown 
        does the variation agree at all closely with that of the body length. 
        The longest-winged bird, No. 5, has a quite short body. In No. 6 and No. 
        11 the tail is longer than in the largest bird, No. 20. The longest tarsus 
        is in No. 15, the longest middle toes in Nos. 7, 9, 15, and 18--all being 
        about equal. The outer toe is decidedly longest in No. 15; the hind toe 
        in Nos. 7, 15, and 18 is equal and longest.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again we have a wonderful diversity 
        of proportionate variation, in the external parts of one bird among only 
        twenty specimens taken at random--a fact of the highest importance in 
        its relation to our problem and yet one which is either positively denied, 
        or treated by almost all our critics as if it had never been investigated.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking of the results of his very important 
        work, Mr. Allen says:--&quot;The facts of the case show that variation of from 
        15 to 20 per cent. in general size, and an equal degree of variation in 
        the relative size of different parts, may be ordinarily expected among 
        specimens of the same species and sex taken at the same locality, while 
        in some cases the variation is even greater than this.&quot; He further points 
        out that each part varies to a considerable extent independently of the 
        other parts; so that when the size varies, the proportions of all the 
        parts vary, often to a much greater amount. The wing and tail, for example, 
        besides varying in length, vary in the proportionate length of each feather, 
        and this causes their outline to vary considerably in shape. The bill 
        also varies in length, width, depth, and curvature. The tarsus also varies 
        in length, as does each toe separately and independently; and all this 
        not to a minute degree requiring very careful measurement to detect, but 
        to an amount easy to be seen without any measurement, as it averages one-sixth 
        of the whole size, and often reaches one-fourth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that colour and markings, 
        which so often constitute the chief characters by which species are distinguished, 
        are equally, if not more, variable. Mr. Allen tells us that the difference 
        in intensity of colour between the extremes of a series of fifty or one 
        hundred specimens of any species, collected at the same locality and the 
        same season, is often as great as occurs between truly distinct species. 
        The markings also, whether spots, stripes, or bands, vary to an equal 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 423]]</font> extent, but these cannot, of course, 
        be represented either in tables or diagrams.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the diagrams here given are only samples 
        of an extensive body of similar facts available either in diagrams or 
        in tables</p>
      <p align="center">
      <img src="../pics/S669d.jpg" width="65%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p>of measurements. I myself gave sixteen such diagrams in 
        my <i>Darwinism</i>, and since that first appeared far more extensive 
        comparisons have been made, more than a thousand individuals having been, 
        in some cases, accurately measured. In every case without exception a 
        large amount of variation has been <font color="990000">[[p. 424]]</font> 
        found to exist in every part and organ, and almost every student of the 
        subject has re-observed the interesting and suggestive fact that the different 
        parts of the individuals measured always exhibited a large amount of independent 
        variability.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore now ample proof that the 
        phenomena of variation here shown are such as are present throughout the 
        whole realm of Nature, while it has been found that in the lower and less 
        specialised forms the variation is very much greater than among the higher.</p>
      
      <p><i>The Law of Natural Selection.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various phenomena we have now seen to form 
        essential features of every part of the world of life--its enormous extent 
        and diversity of form, structure, and habits--the vast population of every 
        species, especially of those which we term common--the great number and 
        variety of the species which live together on the same area, each one 
        more or less dependent on all the others, either as competitors for food 
        or in escaping from enemies or from the elements, thus leading to a constant 
        or intermittent &quot;struggle for existence&quot; of extreme severity--the almost 
        incalculable powers of increase of every species, so that no vacant spaces 
        can occur which are not very quickly taken possession of by the ever-flowing 
        tide of new life--and, lastly, the marvellous facts of <i>inheritance</i> 
        with <i>variation</i>, in their combined effects lead us inevitably 
        to what Darwin termed Natural Selection, or the preservation of favoured 
        races in the struggle for life. Herbert Spencer suggested the term &quot;survival 
        of the fittest,&quot; as more closely representing what actually occurs; and 
        it is undoubtedly this survival, by extermination of the unfit, combined 
        with universally present variation, which brings about that marvellous 
        <i>adaptation to the ever-varying environment</i>, which is an essential 
        feature of every living creature which survives to produce offspring.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the evidence at our command goes to prove 
        that species remain unchanged for long periods, certainly for many thousand 
        years. Some few have no doubt become extinct during historical times, 
        but that has always been due to human agency. Since the last Glacial Epoch, 
        however--a period of time estimated for Europe as not more than 80,000 
        years, and in many districts much less, the remains we find of plants 
        and animals are all of species still living, though their distribution 
        has become somewhat different from what it formerly was.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is thus a wonderful stability of the forms 
        of life under all the vicissitudes of climate and of general environment 
        which have occurred during the last ten or twenty thousand years or perhaps 
        more; and this alone demonstrates the complete though <font color="990000">[[p. 
        425]]</font> generalised adaptation of every species to what may be termed 
        a constantly fluctuating environment--but fluctuating periodically and 
        within defined limits, the average conditions during each century, for 
        example, being almost identical.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this continuous preservation of the same 
        complex aggregate of life-forms is evidently due to the series of facts 
        here adduced--enormous powers of multiplication, combined with a large 
        amount of variation of every part, every organ, every faculty, in each 
        generation. For, let us consider what happens in one of those severe winters 
        which occur only a few times or only once in a century, when even in our 
        favoured climate the ground is frozen two or three feet deep, or buried 
        for a month together in a vast snow-field. An enormous destruction from 
        cold or absence of food then occurs among many of our smaller birds and 
        mammals, but so wonderfully are they adapted to support life under these 
        adverse conditions, that some (probably many in actual numbers), always 
        escape, either from capacity to resist cold or from greater ability to 
        procure food or from having found shelter--and these &quot;fittest&quot; that survive 
        rapidly increase during the succeeding summer, and their offspring for 
        the most part inheriting their &quot;fitness&quot; quickly stock the country with 
        well-adapted forms.</p>
      
      <p><i>Nature of Adaptations.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going further it will be well to give 
        a few facts illustrating the nature and amount of the adaptations that 
        are present everywhere, and on which the whole existence of living things 
        depends.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an obvious fact that animal life of every 
        kind depends on the vegetable world for its very existence, and it can 
        also be easily perceived that it is on the overwhelming variety of plants 
        that the corresponding variety of animals has been rendered possible.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though so well known it may be useful to recall 
        here Darwin's striking example of the complex relations and inter-actions 
        of animals and plants, in which he showed that cats may determine the 
        abundance of a plant which has no direct relation with them whatever. 
        The common red clover is fertilised by humble-bees almost exclusively, 
        and without these insects little or no seed is produced; field-mice destroy 
        the nests of humble-bees and feed upon larv&aelig;; cats feed upon the 
        field-mice. Hence, where there are plenty of cats the field-mice are destroyed, 
        the humble-bees then increase, the red clover is well fertilised and produces 
        plenty of seeds. Thus without cats there would be a great scarcity both 
        of humble-bees and of red clover.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 426]]</font> No doubt 
        there are hundreds of such complex relations of which we know nothing, 
        but I will here ask your attention to a few of the broader adaptations 
        of familiar plants and animals to each other.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most persons, especially those who have gardens, 
        occasionally see with horror the leaves and buds of their fruit trees 
        devastated by various kinds of caterpillars, while everyone has noticed 
        in certain years the oak-trees almost denuded of leaves by insect enemies. 
        Many garden-crops, and even fields of grass, are sometimes destroyed by 
        wire-worms and various other insect larv&aelig;, which burrow in the soil 
        and devour the roots. And we are apt to look upon all this defacement 
        and destruction as we do upon epidemics in the animal world. They seem 
        to us to be inflictions which we should be much better without, and are 
        inclined to wonder why trees and shrubs, herbs and flowers, should not 
        be allowed to develop in their full and beautiful luxuriance of foliage 
        and blossoms. Yet all this destruction and disfigurement arises from a 
        little exceptional increase of a portion of the life-world, without which 
        some of its most beautiful features could not exist. To show how this 
        is we need only consider what takes place in our country every spring 
        and summer.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that delightful season our gardens and hedgerows, 
        our copses and woods are thronged with birds both resident and migratory, 
        which are building their nests and rearing their young. A considerable 
        number of these--thrushes, warblers, tits, finches, and many others--are 
        so prolific that they have two or three, or even more families every year, 
        so that the young birds reared annually by each pair vary from four to 
        five up to ten or twenty or even more.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when we consider that the parents of these 
        are all common birds and must exist in our islands in numbers amounting 
        to several millions each, we can partially realise the quantity of food 
        required to rear say five or ten times this number of young birds from 
        the egg up to full growth--and the whole of the food they consume consists 
        of the various caterpillars and other insect-larv&aelig;, with occasionally 
        small worms and molluscs. Even the common sparrow, though one of the great 
        army of specialised seed-eaters, feeds its young on caterpillars, this 
        kind of food being the most digestible for young birds.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In numerous cases (both by old and recent observers) 
        many of these birds have been closely watched while feeding their young, 
        with very interesting results. A chiff-chaff fed its five young ones almost 
        incessantly from morning till night. She brought small caterpillars, aphides, 
        and flies at the rate of four times in five minutes.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 427]]</font> A pair 
        of blue tits, with a large family, worked for sixteen hours a day at midsummer, 
        and it was estimated that they brought in that time about two thousand 
        caterpillars or small grubs.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of marsh tits, with a crowded nest of 
        young ones, always went and came together--their mouths filled with small 
        green caterpillars for their chicks.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flycatchers sit on a dead branch near the nest, 
        from which they catch flies, &amp;c., in the air, and bring them to their 
        young at intervals of from two to five minutes; while a wren brought food 
        to its nestlings 278 times in a day, or about every three minutes for 
        fourteen hours!</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abundance of nests in all suitable places 
        is known to every egg-collecting schoolboy; while Mr. Kearton found nine 
        species of birds with nests and young in a small copse in Hertfordshire, 
        all within fifty yards of each other; and in another case three nests--a 
        tit's, a flycatcher's, and a wood wren's--were only ten or fifteen yards 
        apart. Yet all these found sufficient food for their young and for themselves 
        in the immediately surrounding trees and bushes, or among the herbage 
        below them.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this vast destruction of insect-life goes 
        on for months together, and the supply never seems to fail. When the parent 
        birds leave the nest in search of food, they may be seen to fly to some 
        adjacent bush, hop about it rapidly, and then perhaps fly off to another, 
        where, finding what they require, they soon get a throat full of small 
        caterpillars and return to the nest; but unless the numbers of such insects 
        were enormous, and their development from the egg were going on day by 
        day, week after week, and month after month, it would seem to be quite 
        impossible for the many millions of these small birds to succeed in finding 
        the required daily supply without fail. For if they had to go further 
        away, or if the caterpillars required much longer searching for, the young 
        would soon die of starvation, or of cold, or be devoured by stronger birds 
        or small arboreal mammals during their parents' absence.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a wonderful perfection of adjustment there 
        must be in these little creatures, what acuteness of vision, rapidity 
        of motion, and parental love, enabling them to keep up this constant search 
        for food, the extreme care and watchfulness of their nests and young, 
        on the continuance of which day by day for several weeks the very existence 
        of those young depends.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this would be of no use unless the insect-tribes 
        were so abundant, so varied, and so omnipresent as they are, and also 
        unless vegetation was everywhere so luxuriant, and its <font color="990000">[[p. 
        428]]</font> productive power of leaves and buds so superabundant, that 
        the destruction of a considerable proportion of it by insects rarely produced 
        permanent injury to the individuals, much less to the species.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, then, we see that what we term insect-pests, 
        when they are a little more abundant than usual in our gardens and orchards, 
        do not exist solely for themselves as an apparently useless part of the 
        scheme of Nature, but are and have been through the geological ages absolutely 
        essential to the original development and continued existence of the most 
        wonderful, delightful and beautiful of the living things around us--of 
        our garden pets and song-birds. Without the myriad swarms of insect-life 
        everywhere devouring the new and luxuriant vegetation, the nightingale 
        and the lark, the red-breast, the wren, and the fairy-like tits and gold-crests 
        would disappear for ever.</p>
      
      <p><i>A Vision of the Earlier Life-World.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the help of the fragmentary, though often 
        abundant records preserved for us in the earth's crust, we are able to 
        some extent to picture to ourselves an earlier and a still earlier world, 
        always, as now, teeming with life, but, just in proportion as we recede 
        into the past, with life of a somewhat lower type, and manifested through 
        somewhat less numerous and less varied specific and family groups. The 
        ancestral types were always more generalised--their successors in the 
        line of descent more specialised.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always and everywhere, these life-forms were 
        being slowly modified (as they still are) so as to keep them in constant 
        adaptation with the slowly changing environment. The great gaps we find 
        in the existing series of classes, orders, and families, are well explained 
        by the continuous increase of specialisation and of adaptation, which 
        necessarily involves the dying out of most of the less specialised and 
        less adapted forms. But, at the same time, numbers of the most highly 
        specialised forms of earlier times also died out; and this, too, was a 
        necessary result of the process of evolution. These were for the most 
        part specialised in adaptation to local and temporary conditions of environment 
        in an ever-advancing life-world; and when those conditions changed--when 
        new and more powerful competitors or enemies were developed--these specialised 
        and often huge and unwieldy forms could no longer exist. Thus it was, 
        probably, that as birds and the larger mammalia developed the flying Pterodactyles, 
        and the huge Atlantosaurus and Diplodocus with hosts of other reptilian 
        forms first diminished in numbers and then became extinct.</p>
      
      <p><font color="990000">[[p. 429]]</font> <i>A Common Objection Answered.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the best way of explaining how Natural 
        Selection actually works will be by quoting one of the common objections 
        to it, and showing how the actual facts of Nature afford a sufficient 
        reply. The most common of all the objections to the action of survival 
        of the fittest in the production of new species rests upon the strange 
        belief that variation is a rare phenomenon, that favourable variations 
        occur singly and at long intervals, and, therefore, can have no effect 
        in producing any important change.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a rather recent example of this objection 
        we may take its statement by the late Lord Salisbury in his Presidential 
        Address to the British Association at Oxford in 1894.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After describing how the most diverse races 
        are produced by artificial selection, he continued:--</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><font size="-1"> 
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But in Natural Selection, who is to 
        supply the breeder's place? Unless the crossing is properly arranged the 
        new breed will never come into being. What is to secure that the two individuals 
        of opposite sexes in the primeval forest, who have been both accidentally 
        blessed with the same advantageous variation, shall meet, and transmit 
        by inheritance, that variation to their successors? Unless this step is 
        made good the modification will never get a start; and yet there is nothing 
        to ensure that step but pure chance. The law of chance takes the place 
        of the cattle-breeder or the pigeon-fancier.&quot;</blockquote>
      </font> 
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have it plainly set forth that advantageous 
        variations occur <i>singly</i>, on <i>rare</i> occasions, and <i>remote</i> 
        from each other; and that even when they do occur, unless by some lucky 
        accident a male and female should accidentally find each other &quot;in the 
        primeval forest&quot; nothing happens, and the &quot;advantageous&quot; variations are 
        swamped in the general mass of the species supposed not to vary.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What totally false ideas of Nature such critics 
        must have, both as to the numbers of individuals in every common, widespread, 
        and dominant species, and as to the nature and amount of variation, to 
        imagine that the very existence of the organic world during each period 
        of changing conditions should have been dependent on the chance meetings 
        of single individuals--that, having millions, even hundreds and thousands 
        of millions to her hand, Nature should be dependent on a few scattered 
        individuals only!</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recur for a moment to the numbers of 
        individuals in most of the common species. The &quot;Brambling&quot;--one of our 
        rather common autumn and winter migrants--comes to us often in immense 
        flocks of from fifty thousand to one hundred thousand individuals each. 
        It breeds in the Arctic regions, <font color="990000">[[p. 430]]</font> 
        feeding its young on the myriads of mosquitoes and other flies that often 
        darken the air in those regions; and in early autumn spreads southward 
        over all Europe and a good deal of Asia, only a kind of small overflow 
        of the migrating stream coming to us. On the Continent the numbers have 
        been occasionally estimated. In Lorraine in 1765 about twenty thousand 
        were killed every night for many nights in succession, and in 1865 in 
        Luxembourg, a single flight was estimated by a French ornithologist to 
        have numbered sixty millions of birds. What must have been the numbers 
        spread over the whole of Europe and much of North Africa and Asia? Probably 
        a thousand millions would be below the mark. And with these all varying, 
        in every part and organ to the large amount shown to exist in every common 
        species which has been measured, and with such very slow changes of the 
        environment as we know to occur, there is hardly any conceivable modification 
        that could be required to bring such a species into harmony with the new 
        conditions, but such as would easily be effected in even a few generations.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be remembered also that Nature does 
        not act by preserving favourable variations in such characters only as 
        we can observe and measure, but in their results, as shown in faculties 
        and powers of action; and as regards any such faculty or power the whole 
        adult population of every species can always be divided into two nearly 
        equal portions, those which possess the faculty in a greater or a less 
        degree than the mean value. Thus, if a new enemy comes into a country, 
        and can be avoided or escaped only by a combination of watchfulness and 
        speed (or any other combination of characters) then the whole mass of 
        a species will consist of those which possess the combination in a degree 
        above the average, or below it. In countries like Europe or North America 
        there will be many hundred millions of each sort; and we can hardly suppose 
        that the new enemy could at once exterminate even the less adapted half. 
        The better adapted would almost wholly escape, and would thenceforth, 
        by producing their like, increase the adaptation of the whole species 
        year by year till only a moderate toll could be taken by the enemy. And 
        it must always be remembered that the enemy would not limit its attacks 
        to one species only, but would, for a number of years, find an ample supply 
        of food by capturing the young and the less-adapted members of perhaps 
        a score or even a hundred species inhabiting the same country, so that 
        there would be ample time for the better adapted portion to raise its 
        standard year by year, owing to the regular elimination of the less fit 
        in regard to this special enemy. The enemy would itself bring about the 
        adaptation to the new and somewhat less favourable environment its presence 
        had created.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 431]]</font> Now I 
        cannot imagine any state of things to which this reasoning will not apply. 
        No living thing can continue to exist which is not sufficiently adapted 
        to all the recurring phases of its environment, inorganic and organic. 
        The completeness and generality of the adjustment is indicated, as Darwin 
        has pointed out, by the average number of individuals in a species and 
        the extent of the area it occupies; and it is the populous and widespread 
        species which vary most, and which, under changed conditions, give rise 
        to several divergent new forms, or species, each of them often adapted 
        to fill some special place in the economy of Nature.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows--not as a theory but as a fact--that 
        whenever any advantageous variation is needed, it can only consist in 
        an increase or a decrease of some power or faculty already existing, and 
        variations of these powers or faculties do actually occur in every dominant 
        species, not by ones or twos as the popular critics assume, but at least 
        by millions and in most cases by hundreds or by thousands of millions.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What midsummer madness then is this often repeated 
        tale of the <i>one</i> or <i>two</i> superior individuals meeting 
        by chance in the primeval forest!</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly less remote from the actual facts and 
        processes of Nature which are effective in originating new species, are 
        those modern studies termed Mutationism and Mendelism, which deal only 
        with some of the rarer forms of variation occurring chiefly under the 
        influence of domestication or cultivation. Yet the students of these strictly 
        limited phenomena which have seldom been found under natural conditions 
        sometimes claim for them an important part in the development of the entire 
        organic world comparable with that of universal variation and unceasing 
        elimination of the least adapted portion.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To both these theories the objection put forth 
        by Lord Salisbury does really apply, because they deal with rarely occurring 
        forms of variation. Herbert Spencer's objection as to the need of many 
        coincident and co-ordinated variations in order to bring about improved 
        powers or qualities, also applies to them with very great force, because, 
        even the single variations being rare in Nature, combinations of co-ordinated 
        variations would hardly ever occur. But neither objection applies to Darwinism, 
        because the many millions of individual differences constantly present 
        in dominant species would supply the combinations which lead to increased 
        capacities and powers of action in ample quantity.</p>
      
      <p><i>Protective Colours and Mimicry.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the innumerable subjects of interest presented 
        by living things which are only intelligible by means of the facts and 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 432]]</font> processes which I have endeavoured 
        to set before you, are those of protective coloration among the more highly 
        organised animals, and the endless modifications of flowers and fruit 
        so as to benefit the former by securing cross-fertilisation, and the latter 
        by aiding in their wider dispersal.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most persons interested in Nature know something 
        of the phenomena of mimicry which, since its discovery by Bates soon after 
        the publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, has been greatly extended 
        in its range and somewhat improved in its explanation, so that it now 
        forms one of the most important branches of the study of insects as regards 
        adaptation to their environment.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every department of Nature colour is one 
        of the most variable of all characters, and it is this variability, together 
        with the enormous importance to all insects of concealment from or protection 
        against their innumerable enemies, especially in tropical countries, that 
        has enabled those minute and striking resemblances to be brought about 
        that were long the greatest puzzle to the naturalists who had the opportunity 
        of observing them in their native haunts.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts already given with regard to the universality 
        of variation, enormous powers of multiplication, and incessant weeding 
        out of the unfit afford a complete explanation of the phenomena of colour, 
        in all their variety and beauty, while no other adequate explanation has 
        ever been set forth, or even attempted.</p>
      
      <p><i>Concluding Remarks.</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding this necessarily incomplete exposition 
        of the fundamental facts which alone render Organic Evolution intelligible, 
        I must again impress upon my readers the enormous scale upon which Nature 
        works. It is for this purpose that I have put before them a number of 
        figures, not easily accessible to the general reader, in order to give 
        some idea of the superabundance of life, whether in its endless diversity 
        of types and of specific forms, or the overwhelming quantity of the individuals 
        comprised in all the more dominant species.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also necessary to show by direct evidence 
        and illustration the universality of variation, pervading every part and 
        organ, every form of action, every sense, instinct, and emotion; and further, 
        that these variations are not &quot;infinitesimal,&quot; as so often stated, not 
        even small in proportion to the mean dimensions, but of such amounts as 
        are easily to be seen even without measurements. Everyone knows that no 
        two of his friend's children are so much alike that the difference cannot 
        be at once perceived when they are together; and this is true throughout 
        Nature, as shown by the fact that the huntsman knows each of <font color="990000">[[p. 
        433]]</font> his hounds and the shepherd each of his sheep, and recognises 
        also their differences of faculty and character.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enormous powers of increase, year by year, 
        and the complex relations and interactions of all the various plants and 
        animals that live together in each considerable area, complete the series 
        of facts which, taken as a whole, render Natural Selection inevitable. 
        And the reason why this great principle is not seen and recognised by 
        every observer is, firstly, because it has not been systematically looked 
        for, but mainly perhaps because it only occurs on a large scale under 
        permanently changed conditions of the environment. There are, however, 
        several cases in which it <i>has</i> been clearly seen at work--in the 
        rabbits of Porto Santo, the mice upon an island in Dublin Bay, the sparrows 
        in the Rhode Island blizzard, and the crabs in Plymouth Sound--all briefly 
        described in my <i>Darwinism</i>.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we must always remember that where <i>we</i> 
        observe or experiment with tens or hundreds of individuals, Nature carries 
        on her work with millions and thousands of millions; that, whereas our 
        observations are only intermittent and for short periods, Nature acts 
        perpetually and has so acted throughout all past geological time; and, 
        lastly, that while we are concerned with one or two species at a time, 
        and to a large extent ignorantly and blindly, she acts simultaneously 
        on all living things--plants as well as animals, that occupy the same 
        area--and always in such a way as to preserve every advantageous variation, 
        however slight, in all those which are destined to continue the race and 
        to become, step by step, modified into new species in strict adaptation 
        to the new conditions which are slowly being evolved.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only by continually keeping in our minds 
        all the facts of Nature which I have endeavoured to set forth that we 
        can possibly realise and comprehend the great problems presented by the 
        <i>World of Life</i>--its persistence in ever-varying but unchecked 
        development throughout the geological ages, the exact adaptations of every 
        species to its actual environment both inorganic and organic, and the 
        exquisite forms of beauty and harmony in flower and fruit, in mammal and 
        bird, in mollusc and in the infinitude of the insect-tribes, which have 
        all been brought into existence through the unknown but supremely marvellous 
        powers of <i>Life</i> in strict relation to the great law of <i>Usefulness</i>, 
        which constitutes the fundamental principle of <i>Darwinism</i>.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding I must, however, add a few 
        words to avoid misconception. Neither Darwinism nor any other theory in 
        science or philosophy can give more than a secondary explanation of phenomena. 
        Some deeper power or cause always has to be postulated. I have here claimed 
        that the known facts, when fully examined and reasoned out, are adequate 
        to explain the <font color="990000">[[p. 434]]</font> method of Organic 
        Evolution; yet the underlying fundamental <i>causes</i> are, and will 
        probably ever remain, not only unknown, but even inconceivable by us. 
        The mysterious power we term life, which alone renders possible the production 
        from a few of the chemical elements of such diverse fabrics as bone and 
        skin, horn and hair, muscle and nerve, and brain cells; which from identical 
        soil, water, and air, manufactures all the infinitely varied products 
        of the vegetable kingdom--the thousand delicious fruits for our use and 
        enjoyment, the endless woods and fibres, gums and oils and resins, to 
        serve the purposes of our ever-developing arts and manufactures, will 
        surely never be explained--as many suppose they will be, in terms of mere 
        matter and motion.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond even these marvels is the yet greater 
        marvel of that ever-present organising and guiding power, which--to take 
        a single example--generation after generation, and even year after year 
        during the life of the individual, builds up anew that most wonderful 
        congeries of organs, the bird's covering of feathers. Not only is a feather 
        a miracle of complex structure, in every minutest part adapted for most 
        important and even vital ends, but it may be safely stated that no two 
        feathers on any bird are absolutely identical, varying in contour, in 
        curvature, in rigidity, in size, by almost imperceptible gradations, so 
        that each fulfils its special purpose. And beyond this, in the great majority 
        of cases, these feathers are adorned with colours, which are infinitely 
        varied, and which we can so often perceive to be of use to the individual, 
        the sex, or the species, that we conclude all to be so. But to produce 
        the result of well-defined and very constant colours, shades, and patterns 
        on the outer surface of the bird, each feather has to be coloured on that 
        portion of its surface which is not overlapped by the adjoining feathers 
        <i>at the time when the colour is needed</i>, and this is invariably 
        the case.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every attempt to explain these phenomena--even 
        Darwin's highly complex and difficult theory of Pangenesis--utterly breaks 
        down; so that now, even the extreme monists, such as Haeckel, are driven 
        to the supposition that every ultimate cell is a conscious, intelligent 
        individual, that knows where to go and what to do, goes there and does 
        it!</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These unavailing efforts to explain the inexplicable, 
        whether in the details of any one living thing, or in the origin of life 
        itself, seem to me to lead us to the irresistible conclusion that beyond 
        and above all terrestrial agencies there is some great source of <i>energy</i> 
        and <i>guidance</i>, which in unknown ways pervades every form of organised 
        life, and of which we ourselves are the ultimate and fore-ordained outcome.</p>

  <p>Delaware Route 1, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, is a 51-mile-long 
  limited access highway built to full Interstate standards, and it parallels US-13, 
  between US-13 and Dover Air Force Base south of Dover, and I-95 in northern Delaware. 
  The last section opened to traffic on May 19, 2003, a 8.9-mile-long section south 
  of Odessa. The northern 1/4 of the highway is toll-free, and the southern 3/4 
  of the highway is tolled. The highway includes the signature cable-stayed bridge 
  over the Chesapeake and Delaware (C &amp; D) Canal near the town of St. Georges. The 
  total cost of the new highway was almost $900 million, and that includes the costs 
  of engineering, right-of-way, and construction. The highway has 4 lanes between 
  I-95 and US-13 at Tybouts Corner, and it has 6 lanes between US-13 at Tybouts 
  Corner and just south of the C &amp; D Canal Bridge, and 4 lanes south of there to 
  Dover Air Force Base, with a 4-lane connector from DE-1 to US-13 south of Dover. 
  The highway&#39;s planning, design, construction and maintenance is administered by 
  the <a href="http://www.deldot.net/">Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT)</a>.

  </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">State Route 1 Korean War Veterans 
  Memorial Highway - originally called the U.S. Route 13 Relief Route - is the single 
  largest public works project ever undertaken in Delaware history. The completion

  of a great many individuals and organizations. The advice and consultation of 
  the public and elected officials were also critical to the success of the project. 
  DelDOT extends thanks to everyone involved. The total cost of the State Route

  <p>DelDOT called this highway the “U.S. 13 Relief Route” from its planning stages 
  beginning in 1983, until it was officially named the Korean War Veterans Memorial 
  Highway in 2003. The highway itself never did have “Relief Route” designation 
  signs posted on the highway, and the various sections were designated as DE-1 
  when they opened. The highway is seldom referred to as the Relief Route anymore, 
  and certainly not officially. I will generally refer to it in this article as 
  the DE-1 superhighway, to distinguish the new freeway from the older 4-lane arterial 
  highway sections of DE-1 that continue from the southern end of the new freeway, 
  to the Atlantic Ocean beach towns in southern Delaware.</p>
  <p>The DE-1 superhighway had its origins in the planning for the North-South Extension 
  of the Delaware Turnpike from 1971-78. That proposal was rather controversial 
  with regard to the communities involved and the environmental concerns. The Turnpike 
  extension was planned to parallel US-13, much like today&#39;s new road. </p>
  <p>DelDOT began developing a new proposal, starting in 1985. This proposal qualified 
  as one of six 1987 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) demonstration projects 
  where, for the first time, federal-aid highway funds were allowed to be mixed 
  with toll revenue bond financing on new highways. This would allow a new highway 
  to draw funds from both sources, significantly reducing toll rates and bond amortization 
  time. The total mainline toll for the DE-1 superhighway is $2.00, which is inexpensive 
  by today’s standards for new toll roads, just 3.9 cents per mile if figured over 
  the whole 51 miles. Electronic open-lane (full-speed mainline highway) toll collection is available through EZ-Pass. </p>

  <p>I wrote this (now italicized) in my original website article about this highway, 
  when I created the article in August 1997: <i>DelDOT called the road the &quot;U.S. 
  13 Relief Route&quot; since it was intended not only to provide a bypass of heavily-traveled 
  US-13, but also to relieve traffic. My personal opinion is that the road is similar 
  to the original proposed turnpike extension, but marketed in a much better fashion. 
  DelDOT throughout the process has held regular, in-depth community involvement 
  workshops to develop the various portions of the expressway. They are carefully 
  addressing environmental concerns in the various watercourse areas, and they are 
  carefully addressing historical site concerns. I think the very name &quot;Relief Route&quot; 
  is a brilliant name to use, since the name depicts not a bland concrete expressway, 
  but a friendly road that causes Delawareans to smile and breath a sigh of relief 
  when they think about the expressway&#39;s ongoing development, and ensuing traffic 
  improvements. Marketing is very important for an organization.</p>
  </i>
  <p>Now that the “Relief Route” is completely open to traffic, I would surmise 
  that DelDOT no longer needs the marketing aspect of that name! Actually, an Internet 
  search reveals many roads around the world called “Relief Route”, so it is not 
  an uncommon name. The term “relief route” implies a highway that supplements the 
  highway that it “relieves”, and would imply a highway of the same functional class 
  or of a lower functional class, in that it wouldn’t replace the function of the 
  older highway, it would just provide relief to it. That really never was the case, 
  though, since US-13 is (and was back in 1985 as well) a 4-lane divided highway 
  that is mostly comprised of high-speed 55-mph segments, and to a lesser degree 
  comprised of various urban segments with many traffic signals and lower speed 
  limits in the ranges of 45-mph and 35-mph. The DE-1 superhighway from its inception 
  in planning back in the 1980s, in a functional sense, would be similar to the 
  many places in the U.S. where an Interstate highway or other freeway was built 
  parallel to a major primary highway, with the intent being that the new freeway 
  would replace the long-distance traffic function and the interregional traffic 
  function of the older highway, thus relegating the older primary highway to a 
  local traffic role. That is exactly the case with the DE-1 superhighway, as it 
  handles the long-distance traffic function and the interregional traffic function 
  in the Wilmington-Dover corridor, and US-13 has the local traffic function in 
  that corridor, although since US-13 is a 4-lane divided highway, it will function 
  quite well for a long time to come as a local highway.</p>
  <p>The first major DE-1 superhighway milestone was the circulation of the Draft 
  Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and the first Public Hearings were held 
  on December 2-4, 1985. On July 23, 1987, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 
  gave Location Approval to the route. In early 1990, the decision was made to pave 
  the mainline of the highway with Portland cement concrete pavement, with bituminous 
  concrete pavement (asphalt or hotmix) on the shoulders and side roads. The total 
  tonnage quantity of each for the entire corridor is about 55% concrete and 45% 
  hotmix. The first construction started in early 1990 near Smyrna, and at that 
  point the cost estimate for the entire route was $500 million.</p>
  <p>From the beginning, DelDOT has published periodic newsletters about the project. 
  In Summer 1989 a revised format came forth, called &quot;On the Road&quot;, subtitled &quot;The 
  Relief Route - SR 1&quot;. It was published several times per year. I have most of 
  the publications published from the beginning of the project, and most of my information 
  comes from them. The DelDOT website now has nearly all of the newsletters on their 
  website in .pdf Abobe format, on the webpage
  <a href="http://www.deldot.net/static/projects/sr1/newsletters.html">State Route 
  1 - Newsletters</a>.</p>
  <p>A number of posters in the Usenet newsgroup
  <a href="news:misc.transport.road">misc.transport.road</a> have suggested designating 
  this highway as Interstate Route I-99 when complete. I think that is a good idea, 
  since a logical future Interstate corridor would run from I-95 near Wilmington, 
  Delaware, to I-64 in Norfolk, Virginia, and the number 99 would fit into the Interstate 
  numbering scheme. </p>
  <p><font size="5" color="#008000"><a name="C&amp;D_Canal_Bridge">Delaware Route 
  1&nbsp; C &amp; D Canal Bridge</a></font></p>
  <p>The DE-1 C &amp; D Canal Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It is 4,498 feet long, 
  has six lanes, and the main span has 145 feet of vertical navigational clearance 
  above the average high tide water level, and 750 feet of horizontal navigational 
  clearance. The C &amp; D Canal bridge main span completely crosses the canal, and 
  this was done to make it impossible for a ship to hit a bridge pier and bring 
  the bridge down. The northbound and southbound roadways each have three 12-foot-wide 
  lanes with 10-foot-wide left and right shoulders. The design is such that if one 
  roadway has to be closed for maintenance, the other could temporarily carry four 
  lanes (2 each way). The design is also convertible to eight lanes, by simply restriping 
  the roadways. One construction contract for the entire bridge substructure and 
  superstructure and was awarded on April 1, 1992, at $57.9 million (well under 
  the engineering estimate), and the bridge opened to traffic in December 1995, 
  with the final contract cost at the end of the project&#39;s construction tallying 
  to $57,782,823.33. (Contract award and final costs are always to the penny, but 
  I often round the number to 3 places for simplicity).</p>

  <p>The cable-stayed design, when utilized on a medium-length main bridge span, 
  is often less expensive to build than the older suspension and cantilever designs. 
  DelDOT and USACE got a lot for their money on the C &amp; D Canal bridge. Cable-stayed 
  bridges were still a relatively recent advent in the U.S. when this bridge was 
  built, with less than 10 such bridges built at that point. The C &amp; D Canal Bridge 
  is actually two bridge roadway structures side-by-side, with one set of center 
  pylons between the two bridges and one set of common stays that supports both 
  roadway structures. The bridges piers, pylons, and roadway structures were all 
  built by the segmental pre-cast post-tensioned construction method. These reinforced 
  concrete segments were built in a fabrication yard, and then trucked to the bridge 
  construction site. The segments were assembled on the bridge, glued together with 
  grout, and then longitudinal steel cables were connected through multiple longitudinal 
  channels inside the series of segments, and then the steel cables were post-tensioned 
  so that the end result was structurally the same as if the whole structure was 
  one solid unit. </p>
  <p>The DE-1 C &amp; D Canal Bridge is very similar to the I-295 Varina-Enon Bridge 
  near Richmond, Virginia. Both bridges have the cable-stayed design with center 
  pylons and twin roadway structures, both utilized the segmental pre-cast post-tensioned 
  construction method, both have the same number of lanes, both have full right 
  and left roadway shoulders, each has almost the same navigational clearances, 
  and each has almost the same overall length. </p>

  <p>US-13 passes over the C &amp; D Canal on a fixed high-level bridge that has 135 
  feet of vertical navigational clearance above the average high tide water level, 
  and the bridge was opened to traffic in 1943. Given its age and its being paralleled 
  by the new DE-1 C &amp; D Canal Bridge about 1/2 mile to the west, DelDOT considered 
  a plan to close and remove the US-13 St. Georges Bridge after the new DE-1 bridge 
  opened.</p>

  </p>
  <p>I wrote this (now italicized) in my original website article about this highway, 
  when I created the article in August 1997: <i>The Summer 1997 &quot;On the Road&quot; newsletter 
  issue concerns the US-13 St. Georges Bridge over the C &amp; D Canal. It is a high-level 
  fixed crossing that was completed in 1943 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
  when the canal was widened and deepened. The new DE-1 C &amp; D Canal Bridge opened 
  nearby in December 1995, and the age and condition of the old bridge has led to 
  debate about whether it should be removed. If retained, it will need about $30 
  million worth of rehabilitation to continue to carry four lanes of unrestricted 
  traffic. The &quot;On the Road&quot; newsletter says that the corridor local and through 
  traffic in the St. Georges area will be 88,000 vehicles per day (VPD) by 2018, 
  reaching the capacity of the new bridge. The current recommendation is to retain 
  the US-13 bridge. The local people want it to stay open so that they can cross 
  the canal without using the expressway. </i></p>
  <p>This issue has been resolved in favor of keeping the US-13 St. Georges Bridge 
  in service. Based on the projected traffic data above, I think that is a good 
  idea. Local traffic access to the south approach of the DE-1 C &amp; D Canal Bridge 
  is just about as convenient as local traffic access to the south approach of the 
  US-13 C &amp; D canal bridge, as there are northerly local ramps that connect to DE-1 
  a few hundred feet south of the C &amp; D Canal Bridge. However, local traffic access 
  to the north approach of the DE-1 C &amp; D Canal Bridge is not nearly as convenient, 
  as the closest local DE-1 interchange north of the canal necessitates a trip of 
  over 3 miles for someone in St. Georges north of the canal to cross the C &amp; D 
  Canal, and vice versa.</p>
  <p>So there are several reasons that together provide warrants for keeping the US-13 
  canal bridge open to traffic, ease of local motorized vehicular access between 
  the two portions of the town of St. Georges on either side of the canal, and future
  capacity in the north-south highway corridor at St. Georges beyond 2018. </p>
  <p>Keeping US-13 at 4 lanes or more throughout the corridor where it was bypassed 
  by the DE-1 Korean War Veterans Highway, I think will be smart from a future perspective 
  of maximizing the ability of US-13 to handle the local traffic, so that the DE-1 
  superhighway can keep adequate capacity for its function for long-distance and 
  interregional traffic. This will also help for incident management on DE-1, if 
  part of the highway is temporarily closed due to a traffic accident; even though 
  US-13 would struggle to handle the detoured traffic, it would still provide a 
  reasonable alternate during the timespan of the incident. </p>

  </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">During the planning and development 
  of State Route 1, it was determined that a new bridge over the C &amp; D Canal was 
  needed. Through analysis of several alternatives and extensive public involvement, 
  it was determined that the best location for the new bridge would be west of the 
  St. Georges Bridge. All along this project&#39;s timeline, there has been a debate 
  as to the fate of the old St. Georges Bridge: who would be responsible for its 
  upkeep if it were to remain; and how would the residents of St. Georges, whose 
  town is split in half by the C &amp; D Canal, be able to easily get from one side 
  to the other if the bridge was dismantled. It so happens the St. Georges Bridge 
  recently underwent a major facelift. Its 4-lanes handle traffic for St. Georges, 
  and those heading toward State Route 7. The 6-lane C &amp; D Canal Bridge, or the 
  Route 1 Bridge, carries traffic from State Route 1 northward toward Wilmington 
  and I-95. US13 may also cross over to the new bridge to reach points north.</font></p>

  <a href="http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/stg/stg.htm">St. Georges Bridge</a> - this is from the USACE website with a June 2002 publish
  date (blue text):<br>

  <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">
The St. Georges Bridge is a fixed, high-level, four-lane highway bridge
that carries U.S. Route 13 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal at 
St. Georges, Del.  Completed in 1942, it is owned and operated by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>In December 1995, the Delaware Department of Transportation opened to
traffic a replacement bridge to carry State Route 1 across the C&D Canal
approximately 1,800 feet west of the St. Georges Bridge.  The
replacement bridge was authorized by Congress under the Water Resources
Development Act of 1990, and the state was reimbursed by the federal
government for the cost of design and construction.</p>
<p>After the opening of the new bridge, the Corps of Engineers prepared a
study on alternatives for disposing of the old St. Georges Bridge.  As a
result of the study, the Army then directed the Corps to close the
bridge effective July 1997 and proceed with plans to remove it.  The
closure did not take place, however, and Congress has since passed
legislation that effectively placed all such activities on hold until
further traffic studies could be completed.</p>
<p>Because of an increased incidence of lead paint chips flaking off the
old bridge, in early 2001 the Corps began a $10 million project to
remove all lead-based paint from the bridge and repaint it to protect
against further oxidation.  The contract is currently on schedule for
completion in June 2002.</p>
<p>In coordination with the State of Delaware's Department of Natural
Resources and Environmental Control, the Corps also conducted two rounds
of soil testing on properties under and near the bridge in both North
and South St. Georges.  Then in November 2001, DNREC and the Corps
agreed to work cooperatively to conduct (1) additional investigation of
previously tested residential properties in St. Georges and 60 others
that had  not been tested to date and (2) initial remediation at 12
properties identified as containing the highest levels of
contamination.  The remediation is scheduled to begin in mid-June 2002.</font></p>

  Canal (C &amp; D Canal)</a></font></p>
  <p>The 14-mile long Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (C &amp; D Canal) crosses the northern 
  Delaware/Maryland peninsula, and its eastern mouth is at Reedy Point, Delaware, 
  on the Delaware River, with its western mouth at Chesapeake City, Maryland, on 
  Chesapeake Bay. The name of the canal reflects the names of the two water bodies 
  that it connects.</p>
  <p>This canal is a very interesting facility. I read a book about the canal years 
  ago, and it said that it is one of the few fully sea-level shipping canals in 
  the world. The original C &amp; D Canal was built privately in the 1820s, it had 10 
  feet of water depth, and it had four locks and it carried barges and sailing vessels 
  that were towed by teams of mules and horses. These stated channel depths are 
  as measured below the average low tide water level. The canal was purchased by 
  the U.S. government in 1919, and there were several expansions of the canal by 
  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (US ACE) over the years. In the 1920s, the canal 
  was excavated and deepened to create a sea-level facility with a channel 12 feet 
  deep and 90 feet wide, with no locks, completed in 1927. From 1935 to 1938, the 
  canal channel was deepened to 27 feet of water depth and widened to 250 feet, 
  with another project to provide same-draft access to the C &amp; D Canal from Chesapeake 
  Bay, which expanded a federal navigation channel for 26 miles, to 27 feet deep 
  and 400 feet wide.</p>
  <p>By the mid 1970s, further deepening/widening projects increased the channel 
  depth to 35 feet of water depth, with the channel width increased to 450 feet, 
  which is adequate for two-way traffic for most oceangoing ships. The upper Chesapeake 
  Bay dredged channel was also deepened to 35 feet deep, in conjunction with the 
  last set of projects. Even though Delaware is relatively flat, the canal did cut 
  through a &quot;ridge&quot; about 60 feet above sea level, and the last expansion project 
  required an enormous amount of excavation. The C &amp; D Canal provides a shortcut 
  of about 300 miles for ship traffic between the Port of Baltimore, and the northeastern 
  U.S. cities and Europe. The C &amp; D Canal is listed on the National Register of 
  Historic Places, and it is designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering 
  and Mechanical Engineering landmark. The C &amp; D Canal is the only major commercial 
  canal in the U.S. that is still in use, among those which were built during the 
  heyday of canal building in the early 1800s. The C &amp; D Canal is also the site 
  of 6 large bridges that were built for the specific purpose of crossing the canal

  <p>DE-1 Korean War Veterans Highway sections presented in chronological opening 
  order:</p>
  <p>The Route 7 Relocation connects the I-95/DE-7 interchange, parallels DE-7, 
  and connects into US-13 near Red Lion. It is 6 miles long, it has 4 lanes, and 
  it was completed in three sections, in August 1991, November 1991, and April 1993. 
  It was designated DE-1 when it opened.</p>
  <p>The Smyrna-Dover Bypass passes east of Smyrna and Dover, is 18.3 miles long, 
  4 lanes wide, and it opened Dec. 21, 1993.</p>
  <p>The St. Georges Bypass with the new C&amp;D Canal Bridge, is 6.6 miles long, 6 
  lanes wide, and it opened in December 1995.</p>
  <p>The section of DE-1 from the St. Georges Bypass to south of Odessa, including 
  the Odessa Bypass, is 7.2 miles long, 4 lanes wide, and it opened in November 
  1999.</p>
  <p>The section of DE-1 at Dover Air Force Base involved upgrading the existing 
  US-113 to 4-lane freeway standards, and it is 2.1 miles long, and it was completed 
  in two sections, in December 1998 and in July 2000.</p>
  <p>The Puncheon Run Connector is a 2.3-mile-long 4-lane connector from US-13 south 
  of Dover to the new DE-1, and it opened in December 2000.</p>
  <p>The section of DE-1 from south of Odessa to the north end of the Smyrna Bypass, 
  is 8.9 miles long, 4 lanes wide and it opened in May 2003, completing the DE-1 
  superhighway.</p>

  <p>The US-13 Dover Bypass was completed in 1952, and it didn&#39;t take long for it 
  to develop into a congested commercial strip of fast-food restaurants, gas stations 
  and other businesses strung along US-13. The bypass is a 4-lane divided highway, 
  but it does not have access controls, so there was nothing to prevent the eventual 
  development of businesses, homes, and housing subdivisions along the highway, 
  with driveway access; and all intersections were at-grade, so eventual heavy cross-traffic 
  necessitated the installation of numerous traffic signals in many places. </p>
  <p>A study in 1958 was performed to determine the best route for a limited-access 
  highway between south of Dover and Frederica, and the recommendation was to build 
  a completely new highway, but nothing transpired with it except for the Frederica 
  bypass on US-113. </p>
  <p>The next 25 years saw nine efforts to study the possibility of a new Dover 
  bypass or a north-south new highway to relieve traffic on US-13, but all of these 
  studies came to naught, because of various political problems and citizen opposition.
  </p>
  <p>A map of the DE-1 superhighway reflects the political minefields that were 
  successfully sidestepped in the Relief Route studies, and that is why the highway 
  criss-crosses back and forth across US-13.</p>
  <p>The DelDOT approach with the Relief Route was to go to the public for the first 
  series of meetings without any lines on a map. The study team of engineers, consultants, 
  historians, environmentalists and others studied a huge map of the US-13 corridor, 
  looking at the best way to cross the C &amp; D Canal, bypass Smyrna and Dover, avoid 
  wetlands, and reduce the impact on farmland. Three principal alternatives evolved 
  from that, a railroad (Conrail then, CSXT today) paralleling alignment to the 
  west, a near east route paralleling mostly just to the east of US-13, and the 
  conversion of the existing US-13 into a freeway with service roads (this third 
  alternative was considered unworkable from the beginning by the planners, but 
  DelDOT did that to show good faith with the farmers).</p>
  <p>When the alternatives were narrowed to three, the next series of public meetings 
  began. The final Relief Route alignment, selected in 1986, did not choose any 
  of the three alternatives exclusively, although from Smyrna south it follows the 
  near east route. </p>

  </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">1952 -- The original Dover 
  bypass opens, but rapidly develops with strip commercial development. <br>
  1958 -- Study by DeLeuw, Cather and Brill recommends six alternatives for a limited 
  access highway south of Dover to Frederica. Frederica bypass is constructed on 
  a portion of one of the recommended routes. <br>
  1964 -- Dover Area State Planning Study concludes that new growth can be expected 
  west and south of the city and recommends the construction of a limited-access 
  bypass west of Dover. <br>
  1966 -- At a public hearing in Dover, objections are raised by businesses and 
  farmers to a western bypass of the city. <br>
  1967 -- A study on the economic and social effects of the proposed bypass concurs 
  with the concept of a western bypass and says the loss of farms to urban development 
  is a natural free-market trend. <br>
  1967 -- State highway department issues a resolution approving the location of 
  the west Dover bypass. <br>
  1968 -- Study by DeLeuw, Cather and Associates recommends a western alignment 
  for a Dover bypass and proposes a 19.5-mile limited access highway with seven 
  interchanges. <br>
  1969 -- Dover Planning Commission approves a west Dover bypass. At a public hearing, 
  extensive opposition is raised by agricultural organizations. The notion that 
  future growth would occur mostly to the west of Dover is challenged. A study by 
  Knoerle, Bender, Stone and Associates recommends a north-south toll road network 
  with east-west links, but a governor&#39;s committee declares it unworkable. <br>
  1970 -- A Delaware State North-South Corridor Route Study analyzes six alternatives 
  and recommends a revised western alignment because of its more minimal farmland 
  requirements. <br>
  1971 -- Kent County&#39;s new comprehensive plan recommends a westerly Dover bypass. 
  A study by Michael Baker Jr. Inc. recommends a free, 34-mile north-south highway 
  from Tybouts Corner south, with an easterly bypass of Smyrna and a westerly bypass 
  of Dover. <br>
  1971-1978 -- Studies for North-South Extension of the Delaware Turnpike.<br>
  1974 -- Another DeLeuw, Cather study conducts an extensive analysis of a north-south 
  divided highway to the west of U.S. 13 and recommends that it be a toll road.
  <br>
  1979 -- A study by Howard, Needles, Tammen and Bergendoff evaluates all studies 
  to date, including eight alignments ranging from far west to far east. It recommends 
  a near west bypass of Dover. <br>
  1979 -- The North-South Road Study Committee recommends the construction of a 
  new north-south limited-access freeway to Gov. Pierre S. du Pont. <br>

  <p>The northern end of the DE-1 Korean War Veterans Highway, is the 
  interchange between I-95 and DE-1. This interchange dates to at least the 
  early 1970s, and it was originally 
  built to connect I-95 to Delaware Route 7, and DE-7 was and is a local thoroughfare. 
  This interchange has a modified cloverleaf design, adequate for connecting a freeway 
  to a local thoroughfare, but inadequate for connecting one freeway to another 
  freeway. DE-1 conceptually has a “T junction” with I-95, and the DE-1 freeway 
  becomes the DE-7 thoroughfare north of I-95. DelDOT has a project in the works 
  to properly connect DE-1 to I-95, with the construction of two new 2-lane 
  high-speed semi-directional 
  ramps, for the movement from DE-1 northbound to I-95 northbound, and the 
  movement from I-95 southbound to to DE-1 southbound. The current interchange 
  provides a freeway-design connection between the two freeways, but only from a 
  technical standpoint. Several people who live in Delaware have told me that 
  during peak traffic periods, that there are serious traffic backups for the 
  movement from I-95 southbound to DE-1 southbound. The traffic movement from 
  DE-1 northbound to I-95 northbound, is inadequate also. Interestingly, the 
  I-95 southerly movements with DE-1 are not congested, according to these 
  Delaware residents.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/updates/DelDOTunveilsI-.html">DelDOT 
  unveils I-95 construction plans</a>, by
  <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/">The News Journal</a>,&nbsp; May 10, 
  2004, had an article about the proposed I-95/DE-1 interchange upgrade. 
  Excerpts (in blue text):<br>
  </font>
  <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">
  The Delaware Department of Transportation will widen I-95 by adding a new lane 
  on the existing shoulder and increasing the capacity of the interchange with 
  Del. 1, agency officials said today. The plan to ease congestion on the 
  interstate also includes rebuilding the Newark toll plaza with high-speed E-ZPass 
  lanes at the existing location. The improvements will cost $150 million to 
  $200 million. Construction could begin as soon as June 2006. Details of the 
  plans were made public by DelDOT at a workshop tonight at the Embassy Suites 
  Hotel in Newark. The new interchange between I-95 and Del. 1 will allow two 
  lanes of traffic to exit from I-95 south to Del. 1 south, and two lanes from 
  Del. 1 north to I-95 north. The toll booth project will improve safety for 
  toll takers with underground tunnels that go directly to toll booths and add 
  high-speed E-ZPass lanes, similar to the Del. 1 Biddles Corner toll plaza. 
  High-speed E-ZPass lanes allow vehicles with the electronic toll-paying 
  service to drive through without slowing down to have sensors pick up the E-ZPass 
  signal.</font><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
  <br>
  The 6 miles of DE-1 freeway between US-13 at Tybouts Corner and I-95 at DE-7 
  at the Christiana Mall, was built with 4 lanes. The 6 miles of DE-1 freeway adjoining 
  the above section to the south, the St. Georges Bypass which includes the C &amp; 
  D Canal Bridge, was built with 6 lanes. From what the several Delaware residents 
  told me, the 6 miles of DE-1 freeway between Tybouts Corner and I-95, is very 
  congested at peak hours, now that all of the DE-1 Korean War Veterans Highway 
  has been completed and is opened to traffic; and that this 6-mile-long section 
  of DE-1 needs to be widened to 6 lanes. I need to find out if there is any such 
  widening project planned for this section of DE-1.</p>
  <p>Excerpt for the northernmost 6 miles of the DE-1 superhighway, all the rest 
  of the highway will be adequate for the traffic volumes for many, many years into 
  the future beyond the 2003 completion year of this highway.</p>
  <p><font size="5" color="#008000"><a name="SR1_Corr_Preserv_Plan">SR 1 Corridor 
  Preservation Plan</a></font></p>
  <p>The SR 1 Corridor Preservation Plan will preserve the 33 miles of existing 
  4-lane-divided DE-1, from Dover Air Force Base at the south end of the DE-1 superhighway, 
  to US-9 near Lewes. This involves corridor protection by ensuring that enough 
  land is available for service roads and interchanges, so the road can be upgraded 
  to full freeway standards when it becomes necessary 15 or 20 years in the future. 
  The concept is to preserve the existing capacity, by limiting the development 
  along the highway. The segments that will see capacity improvements will most 
  likely be those with signalized intersections with development, and stretches 
  of highway with several driveways.</p>

  <p>This article was created with the title &quot;The Relief Route (Delaware Route 1)&quot; 
  on 8-14-1997, and the article received major updates and the title was changed 
  to &quot;DE Route 1 - Korean War Veterans Highway&quot; on 7-1-2003. I changed the name 
  of the article because the Relief Route name is no longer officially used in reference 
  to this highway. Since the name &quot;Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway&quot; is a bit 
  unwieldy to use in common speech and writing, I&#39;ve taken my prerogative as a citizen 
  journalist to shorten the name to &quot;DE-1 superhighway&quot; in many cases when I refer 
  to it on my websites, since I want to distinguish the new freeway from the older 
  4-lane arterial highway sections of DE-1 that continue from the southern end of

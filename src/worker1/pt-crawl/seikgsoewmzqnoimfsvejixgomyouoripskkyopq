<P>Margery Kempe is a controversial woman because of her lack of education and 
her mystic and spiritual belief of endeavors. She was the daughter of a 
respected merchant and public official. She was born in Lynn, a town in Norfolk, 
England and though she grew up in a wealthy family, she was never given a chance 
to be educated. Her mysticism begins as a child when she refuses to confess a 
secret sin which most likely affects her all through her adult life. She married 
merchant John Kempe in the year of 1393, with whom she had fourteen children. 
When Margery was in her twenties she began to have visions in which she talked 
to Jesus, Mary, and the Saints. In one vision, Jesus told her to go deeper in 
her religious practices. Margery Kempe dedicated her life by the call of Jesus 
in an unusual state by weeping, screaming and praying for Christians during 
religious services. She became so involved that she detached her daily life from 
her husband and children and set out on a long journey ending up in Jerusalem. 
When her pilgrimage comes to an end she dictates her spiritual autobiography to 
scribes.</P>
<P>Her Autobiography, <I>The Book of Margery Kempe </I>has great significance 
because it&nbsp; is the earliest known autobiography in English. In her book, 
Kempe portrays herself as an honest and devote human being. Margery's message is 
taken from her direct relationship with Jesus that is based on unconditional 
faith and love. The <I>Book</I> discusses every aspect of Margery's life: from 
her marriage, religious conversion, and many pilgrimages. She was accused by her 
contemporaries of fraud and heresy, and often criticized by later scholars as 
hysterical and crazy.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Margery Kempe is a woman of mystery because of the unknown truth to her 
spiritual hysterias. Her lack of education gives scholars today a reason to 
exclude her from truly being a significant woman of medieval times. Nonetheless, 
Margery Kempe also had admirers, even among clergy, who defended her visions as 
genuine signals from God.</P>

realized that it was indeed essential to the study of history and spiritual 
life. Cholmeley describes 
Kempe's attitudes towards religious leaders who were not fulfilling their duties

Collis has turned the life of Margery Kempe into a literature piece which 
includes a history of explicit detail of her life in an exciting quest 
narrative. Usually known as a novel author, Collis also gives a precise 
historical overview of life in Europe while Margery was alive. With its many 
historical references, <i> Memoirs of a Medieval Woman</i> would be most appreciated by 
historians or those with medieval history knowledge. The text is comprehensible 
and is a easily flowing text, however, the historical references may frustrate 
general readers. Illustrations are included and the book can be used in 
conjunction with <i> The Book of Margery Kempe</i>. Collis does cite the sources she using 
and also uses footnotes and a bibliography.</P>

Philolog</i>y 87 (November 1989): 
132-141.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Nona Fienburg, of Millsaps College, attempts to show how <i> The Book of Margery 
Kempe</i> exploits society during Kempe's lifetime. Fienburg believes that Kempe 
established her value in society and succeeded in challenging the evaluative 
system of medieval society. She uses examples from Margery's personal finances 
and family to show that she did succeed in establishing herself in a 
predominantly male society. Fienburg feels that Kempe's value is assured with 
the very existence of her book. Written for scholars, this essay can be used to 
further investigate Margery Kempe's personal triumphs</P>

enormous amount of history of the town and Margery Kempe. Her book examines the

Anthony Goodman is Professor of Medieval and Renaissance History at the 
University of Edinburgh, gives information about medieval life and times of a 
wife, mother, world traveler, and mystic in particular of Margery Kempe. He 
studies the <I>Book of Margery Kempe</I> trying to examine her life by each day 
dealing with the late medieval Lynn of England more than&nbsp; her divine 
spirituality. This source would be useful to a person who is interested in the 
life of a women during the medieval area of England. This book would not be 
helpful to a person looking at Margery Kempe's mysticism as much as <I>Margery 
Kempe: Genius and Mystic</I> by Katharine Cholmeley.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Harvey, Nancy Lenz. "Margery Kempe: Writer as Creature." Philological 
Quarterly 71 (Spring 1992): 
173-184.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Nancy L. Harvey, from the University of Cincinnati, attempts to show how Margery 
created <i> The Book of Margery Kempe</i>. Harvey states that Margery felt her book was 
"inside" her and that it was another person's duty to write it (Coincidentally, 
Margery was illiterate.) This essay looks at several aspects to the Book, 
including its medieval vocabulary, as well as sources and influences that shaped 
Margery's ideas. Harvey feels that Margery's spiritual experience had its 
physical manifestation in the Book. There are 
many quotes from the original text and no translation is provided. Harvey's 
essay would be most appreciated by scholars with some knowledge of medieval 
text. Overall, an interesting evaluation of Margery's self-reflections and 
inspiration.</P>

Lynn Staley Johnson, along with this essay, has written a book about Margery 
Kempe entitled <i> Margery Kempe's Dissenting Fiction</i>s. This essay discusses how 
medieval works and their authors were at the mercy of scribes who copied, 
interpreted, and edited written texts. Scribes could have changed or used 
metaphors when Margery Kempe dictated her life story and she may have no way of 
knowing because of her illiteracy. Johnson repeatedly inquires if the scribes 
intentionally use words to reach complete power of the meaning of the work. 
Johnson feels that Kempe's constant emphasis of her own illiteracy caused many 
of her contemporaries to question her Book, thus contributing to the reputation 
of scribes. Johnson contrast the language of the two women by using Chaucer's 
use of language. This intriguing essay is an easy read for interested scholars 
and is a great for literary studies. Johnson's contains fascinating research 
concerning the scribes behind several of medieval history's distinguished 
authors.</P>

in The Book of Margery Kempe." Thought 64 (September 1989): 
250-267.</B>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;In this essay, Partner believes that inordinate love is the motif at the center 
of the Book. Partner feels that Margery's life was governed by two opposing 
sides: one religious and holy, the other dark and repressive. This essay focuses 
on the denied desires that occurred in Margery's life story. She examines 
several examples of love and desire found in Margery's experiences. Partner 
concludes that Kempe's guilt over sins and the pressure of forbidden desire 
describes the life of any woman in late medieval society. This article is an 
interesting perspective on Margery's life. It can easily be read and understood 
by scholarly and general readers. An alternative to the religious and spiritual 
interpretations of Kempe's life.</P>

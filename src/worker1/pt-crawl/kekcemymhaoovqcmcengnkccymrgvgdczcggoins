<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardly a day goes past now that I don't either give 

          or receive the advice "Have you checked the Web?--you might find what 

          you're looking for there." The World Wide Web has undoubtedly emerged 

          as a major source of information, especially for those who do not have 

          access to a large university library. Increasingly, in fact, even those 

          who <i>do </i>have access to a large library are often taking the easier 

          route, using various electronic search engines to seek answers from 

          the comfort of an office or lab. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is a darker side to all of this convenience. 

          The Web, as we increasingly see, has no internal quality control. Lots 

          of what's out there is of very inferior quality, and hardly passes for 

          "information." I have been hearing more and more complaints from teaching 

          faculty especially; many of these have gone so far as to forbid their 

          students from using Web-based sources. At first I wondered whether this 

          was reasonable or just reactionary, but the truth was brought out to 

          me recently when I decided to do a detailed search on a subject I personally 

          have been studying for some twenty years. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of my search was the nineteenth and early 

          twentieth century evolutionist, naturalist, and social critic Alfred 

          Russel Wallace (1823-1913). I used several search engines to come up 

          with close to five hundred items that really did pertain to Wallace, 

          and what I found when I looked in detail was a bit upsetting. To be 

          sure I did find a number of unexpected and welcome new tidbits of information, 

          and I already had been prepared to find few if any of Wallace's own 

          writings or secondary periodical or monographic sources, but in way 

          too much of the rest erroneous statements and evaluations proved epidemic. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace as a subject for investigation presents 

          a particularly good opportunity for testing the quality of the Web's 

          resources. There is first the matter of his unusually spelled middle 

          name: "Russel." Nearly half of the items I found spelled it "Russell," 

          a slip-up which is something of a dead giveaway that the person who 

          was in charge of producing the entry doesn't know what he or she is 

          talking about. Second, Wallace was a complex, unorthodox thinker who 

          came up with a lot of ideas that are still rather poorly understood; 

          thus he tends to fall prey to misrepresentation, obfuscation and out-of-context, 

          inappropriate, quotation. Moreover, he was involved in the famous story 

          of the public introduction of the natural selection concept, and his 

          relations with Darwin feature the real possibility of intrigue and scandal. 

          Lastly, quite a lot actually <i>is </i>known about the historical particulars 

          of his life, and such could be uncovered easily enough were a person 

          really interested in maintaining some accuracy in his or her writings 

          about him. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a moment I'll present a sample of some of the 
          Wallace-related passages I found during my survey, but first, for contextual 
          reasons, it is useful to provide a capsule biographical review. Wallace, 
          an Englishman, was born into a decently upstanding but poor family (his 
          father was a non-practicing lawyer; his mother of reputable middle class 
          stock), and was forced to leave school at the age of thirteen to learn 
          a trade. He eventually took up with an older brother who ran a surveying 
          and construction business in the West of England. During a slow period 
          in late 1843 he was let go and took a teaching position at a private 
          school in Leicester. There by chance he met the amateur entomologist 
          Henry Walter Bates (later of "Batesian mimicry" fame), who got him interested 
          in natural history collecting. In early 1845 Wallace went back to surveying 
          when his brother died, but before long he and Bates had decided to make 
          natural history collecting their livelihood. In 1848 they left for the 
          Amazon Valley, where Wallace stayed four years (Bates remained until 
          1859). On his way home in 1852 the ship he was sailing on caught fire 
          and sank, sending his collections to the bottom. Wallace was eventually 
          rescued, however, and within eighteen months he was ready to try again: 
          after securing a grant for passage to the East he set out on what this 
          time would be an eight year long expedition. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace had been contemplating the notion of biological 

          evolution since around 1845 (and social evolution, even earlier), and 

          in 1858 the natural selection concept finally came to him--during a 

          bout with malaria in the Moluccas. After writing out his thoughts in 

          the form of an essay, he sent the manuscript, along with a letter, to 

          Darwin (who he knew was interested in "the species question" and with 

          whom he had struck up a relatively innocuous correspondence) for possible 

          forwarding on to Darwin's friend Charles Lyell, the celebrated geologist. 

          Darwin, fearing that his life's work was about to be eclipsed, appealed 

          to Lyell and the botanist Joseph Hooker, another friend, for help in 

          deciding what to do about this challenge to his priority. A decision 

          was made to have Wallace's essay and two extracts from unpublished writings 

          by Darwin read at the next meeting of the Linnean Society, and this 

          took place on July 1, 1858--without getting Wallace's permission first. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of 1859 Darwin had completed and published 

          <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, and the rest, as we say, is history. 

          Wallace returned to England in 1862 something of a celebrity, and from 

          that point on his reputation continued to grow. He immersed himself 

          in an incredible range of studies including various extensions of the 

          natural selection concept, biogeography, anthropology, physical geography 

          and glaciology, land nationalization and planning, socialism, epidemiology, 

          and social criticism. As a result, by the end of his life he was possibly 

          science's most recognized name (I have in my possession period writings 

          that refer to him, among other things, as "England's greatest living 

          naturalist" (<i>Boston Herald</i>, October 31, 1886, p. 13); "[one of 

          the two] most important and significant figures of the nineteenth century" 

          (<i>English Illustrated Magazine</i>, January 1904, p. 420); "this greatest 

          living representative of the Victorians" (<i>London Daily Chronicle</i>, 

          November 3, 1910, p. 4); and "only a great ruler could have been accorded 

          by the press of the world any such elaborate obituary recognition..." 

          (<i>Current Opinion</i>, January 1914, p. 32)). 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, on to the Web site samples. In what follows 

          I am admittedly poking fun and deliberately drawing attention to various 

          kinds of error. It is not, however, my purpose to publicly embarrass 

          anyone: hopefully the reader will therefore forgive my not providing 

          exact sources. A good place to start is with the "Russell" spelling 

          errors: 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...another English scientist, Alfred Russell 

          Wallace..."</i> (from an online encyclopedia); <i>"...fellow scientist 

          Alfred Russell Wallace..."</i> (from a sketch of Darwin for a college 

          course);<i> "Alfred Russell Wallace had..."</i> (from an "internet ancillary" 

          to a popular psychology text); <i>"Operation Wallacea is named after 

          the eminent naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace..."</i> (from a homepage 

          describing a research expedition named after Wallace (!));<i> "...for 

          his contribution with Alfred Russell Wallace..."</i> (from a Darwin 

          Studies homepage (!)); <i>"...Alfred Russell Wallace..."</i> (from the 

          announcement of a prestigious book prize given to a work wholly about 

          Wallace (!)). Many other examples, the more or the less entertaining, 

          can also be retrieved. Perhaps I appear too picky here; on the other 

          hand, what degree of confidence can one have in a source that doesn't 

          even recognize an incorrect spelling of its primary subject? 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along similar lines, we have: <i>"...updating the 

          original theories by Sir Alfred Russell Wallace..."</i> (from the announcement 

          of a prestigious book prize given to a work wholly about Wallace);<i> 

          "...quoting Sir Alfred Wallace in Indonesia in the 1860's..."</i> (from 

          the site of a major conservation organization); <i>"Lord Alfred Russell 

          Wallace..."</i> (from a digital library project). Poor Wallace would 

          turn over in his grave to hear himself referred to as "Sir," much less 

          "Lord," Wallace! After all, here was a man who was a utopian socialist 

          and campaigner for the divestiture of large land holdings (Wallace 1882, 

          1883), who wrote two full length essays favoring complete restructure 

          of the House of Lords (Wallace 1894, 1907), and who at one point even 

          published a public notice to the effect that, no, he had not (as rumors 

          had suggested) been nominated for knighthood, and would not accept the 

          honor were he so noticed (Wallace 1908)! 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing on... Among the more amusing items of 

          unabashed nonsense I encountered were the following: 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>...meanwhile, a grad student named Alfred Russell 

          Wallace was studying the flora and fauna of Malaysia..."</i> (from a 

          college course synopsis); <i>"An American worker, Alfred Russel Wallace, 

          developed similar ideas..."</i> (from lecture notes for a college course);<i> 

          "Wallace flourished around 1855-61. During this period he listed Australian 

          birds."</i> (from the homepage of a university-based education project); 

          <i>"...the life and discoveries of Alfred Russel Wallace, whose work 

          was in biodiversity conservation awareness in the Malay Archipelago"</i> 

          (from a university newsletter);<i> "[Wallace was] lower class, sold 

          tropical bugs for a living"</i> (from a college course synopsis). Wallace--a 

          "graduate student?" Wallace--an American? Wallace--"lower class" (his 

          father had hung around with prominent socialites such as Beau Brummel 

          in his youth, and his mother's family included town mayors and other 

          respectable sorts--see Wallace 1905)? The comment on "flourishing" (usually 

          used to describe persons of whom we know almost nothing) is also interesting, 

          given that this represents the <i>entire</i> entry, and that the same 

          database contains a listing for "A. R. Wallace" that contains a good 

          deal more information. And, celebrated tropical naturalist though he 

          may have been, it is entirely inaccurate and out of context to depict 

          Wallace's work as being in "biodiversity conservation awareness," a 

          description that suggests a late-twentieth century, rather than mid-nineteenth 

          century, association. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let us proceed on to the more serious errors. 

          These may be grouped into two main classes: the erroneous descriptions 

          of his role in the 1858 Linnean Society introduction of the natural 

          selection concept, and "other," especially as concerning various misappreciations 

          of his worldview. We begin with examples of the former. One might suppose 

          that the history of this subject, relayed as it has been in countless 

          sources, is so familiar that mistakes would be unlikely. But consider 

          the following... 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...like Darwin, he had written a book on the 

          origin of species, citing exactly the same kinds of evidence and reaching 

          precisely the same conclusion. ...Darwin now...said Wallace should be 

          allowed to publish first. Wallace insisted on Darwin's right to be first. 

          So they presented a paper together to the Linnean Society..."</i> (from 

          the text of a public lecture). Practically all of this is utterly untrue. 

          Wallace had not written a book on the origin of species, had not cited 

          the same evidence, and didn't insist that Darwin be allowed to publish 

          first; nor did they present a paper together. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...natural selection was first articulated by 

          Alfred Russel Wallace; the theory was subsequently co-opted by Charles 

          Darwin with the assistance of scientists Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker. 

          ...Hard though it might be to believe, there is no real proof that Darwin 

          conceived of, or committed to paper, the central idea of so-called 'classical 

          Darwinism'...prior to his receipt of the so-called Ternate papers..."</i> 

          (from commentary by a skeptics group). Contrary to this statement, the 

          evidence is quite clear that Charles Darwin both thought out the idea 

          and committed it to paper many years before Wallace's discovery--though 

          he had not published anything, of course (McKinney 1972; Brooks 1984; 

          Desmond and Moore, 1992). 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Darwin's letter concerned some information that 

          Wallace had published which Darwin had used to come to his conclusion 

          that species had evolved. Darwin did not tell Wallace exactly what he 

          was up to, however."</i> (from a slide program used in a college course). 

          This is pure fiction; Darwin had done no such thing. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alfred Russell Wallace actually committed the 

          concept of adaptation by natural selection to writing before Darwin 

          [who]...upon reading Wallace's paper, quickly wrote one of his own, 

          and both papers were read at the same meeting of the Linnean Society 

          in 1858..."</i> (from an apparently uncompleted Ph.D. Dissertation). 

          Darwin wrote no such paper, though again, he did have much earlier, 

          informally prepared, writings that he quickly supplied for the reading. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On July 1 Charles Darwin read Alfred Wallace's 

          paper on evolution to the Linnean Society along with portions of Darwin's 

          own long-withheld manuscript of The Origin of Species..."</i> (part 

          of a historical chronology put up by a major psychology association). 

          Darwin wasn't at the meeting, actually, nor had he at that point even 

          started writing the work that would become <i>The Origin of Species</i>. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "[Darwin] published a short paper on [natural 

          selection] in 1858. Alfred Wallace published a paper with the same idea 

          in the same year; indeed, after Wallace wrote to Darwin telling him 

          of his own idea of natural selection, he and Darwin agreed to publish 

          simultaneous papers..."</i> (from background material for a college 

          geology course). There was no agreement; Wallace was not even consulted. 

          Moreover, Darwin's contributions were not truly papers, they were fragments 

          from writings that he had never intended for publication. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "[Darwin] co-authored a short article about evolution 

          in July 1858 with another Englishman, Alfred Russell Wallace. ...I believe 

          an editor took the best parts of two articles the men presented and 

          'wrote' the co-authored article. ...Thus, by publishing just a short 

          time ahead of Wallace (I think the time lag was just a few months) Darwin 

          became famous..."</i> (from material for a teachers education course). 

          There was, of course, no such editor involved; neither was there any 

          "time lag" as Wallace never did publish a larger work until many years 

          later. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...in a generous gesture it was Darwin himself 

          who presented Wallace's paper to the Royal Geographic Society later 

          that same year, 1858..."</i> (from materials by a private company that 

          produces educational material for the Web). Again, Darwin was not even 

          there, and the Linnean Society, not the RGS, was involved. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The idea came to him while he was delirious 

          with fever in the jungles of Borneo. His letter made Darwin realize 

          that he could dally no longer. A presentation was made to the Royal 

          Society of London, and the cat was out of the bag..."</i> (from an "internet 

          ancillary" to a popular psychology text). Once again, the wrong professional 

          society is named--also note that the event took place in the Moluccas, 

          not Borneo. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could go on and on with a good deal more of the 

          same, but consider finally the following two selections that feature 

          the last word in creative obfuscation: 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "[Charles Darwin] stole most of his ideas from 

          another evolutionist, Alfred Russell Wallace, who published before Chuck. 

          Wallace published 'Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro' in 1853, six 

          years prior to Darwin's 'Origin of Species.' Darwin undoubtedly stole 

          many of his ideas from Wallace for they corresponded with each other. 

          Chuck claimed Mr. Wallace stole his ideas from him by reading a manuscript 

          sketch written in 1842."</i> (from an article in an online magazine 

          produced by a skeptics group). 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wallace had requested time to speak at an upcoming 

          conference to officially put forth his theory. Some of Charles Darwin's 

          friends...heard about this and decided that the credit should go to 

          Darwin, not Wallace. They did this by asking the meeting organizers 

          for a few minutes just before Wallace to read aloud excerpts from some 

          of Darwin's letters and notes to them which dealt with his theory of 

          evolution..."</i> (from notes for a college course). 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just about nothing in any of the above, needless 

          to say, has even a grain of truth to it, and one cannot help but suspect 

          that some rather dubious agenda are being pursued in the dissemination 

          of such slander. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, some attention should be drawn to the many 

          erroneous statements about other aspects of Wallace's career that appear 

          on the Web, for example: 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...while until recently, hardly anyone had ever 

          heard of Alfred Russell Wallace..."</i> (from notes for a college course). 

          As mentioned earlier, this is hardly the case. In his own time Wallace 

          was a very well known figure. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Geologist Charles Lyell...and biologist Alfred 

          Russel Wallace...both insisted that the origin of human beings was a 

          special case requiring divine intervention..."</i> (from a reprinted 

          magazine article). The problem here is that while Lyell appears to have 

          had rather conventional religious beliefs, Wallace did not, and certainly 

          did not believe in the notion of "divine intervention." He did, however, 

          believe that the actions and progress of humankind were being affected 

          by some manner of what we might today term "paranormal" or "psychical" 

          influence. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coining the phrase, 'survival of the fittest,' 

          Wallace stated..."</i> (from an educational resources site). Unfortunately, 

          it was Herbert Spencer who coined this phrase, not Wallace. (I find 

          this mistake particularly irritating, as the writer goes on to directly 

          quote the Introduction to my Wallace anthology (Smith 1991) in an effort 

          to elaborate on her misstatement.) 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...the eminent physicist and co-discoverer of 

          Evolution, Alfred Russel Wallace..."</i> (from a reprinted article). 

          One of the few areas of science that Wallace did <i>not</i> tinker in 

          was physics. Moreover, we should constantly remind ourselves that neither 

          Wallace nor Darwin "discovered" evolution, but instead the particular 

          mechanism of evolution known as natural selection. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...Wallace would today (1997) be considered 

          a 'Creationist'..."</i> (from a skeptics site); <i>"Alfred Wallace, 

          Darwin's partner...argued that such complex systems still required a 

          God..."</i> (from the instructor's notes for a college course). Well, 

          no, he wouldn't/didn't. Wallace was a lifelong agnostic who did not 

          believe in a "personal" God (that is, an entity capable of miraculous, 

          spontaneous, "first causes"). True, he was a Spiritualist, but he treated 

          the "Spirit World" as a non-physical extension of the natural world, 

          governed by analogous natural laws. He often waxed poetic, using terms 

          like "God" or "Creation," but this only when he was alluding to natural 

          forces so subtle, complex, or grandiose as to trivialize humankind's 

          attempts to understand them. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace, who maintained 

          notions that natural selection is the only ordering principle in nature..."</i> 

          (reprint of an interview with a skeptic). Not so, even assuming that 

          the subject is restricted to the parameters of evolutionary change. 

          Wallace in particular accepted natural selection as what might be termed 

          a "universal filter" through which all living things had to pass, but 

          he well recognized that many other "ordered" natural processes were 

          contributing to the emergence of the variation upon which selection 

          worked. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wallace became a fervent selectionist, ending 

          up not believing in human evolution because he could not envision the 

          adaptive purpose for the human mind..."</i> (from a slide program for 

          a college course). This statement confuses several things at once. Wallace 

          did in fact continue to believe in human evolution--at least physical 

          evolution--in Darwinian terms, and he <i>could</i> envision an adaptive 

          purpose for the human mind, but he was unwilling to conclude that conscious 

          awareness <i>per se</i> constituted a strictly biological process. 

        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, to save a special place for our own 

          species, Wallace even rejected the possibility that life forms and intelligent 

          beings may exist elsewhere in this cosmos..."</i> (from a reprinted 

          public lecture); <i>"Wallace was the most visible early proponent of 

          Mars as a lifeless planet..."</i> (from a digital library project). 

          Actually, Wallace only rejected the more specific notion that intelligent 

          beings might exist elsewhere: "I have never suggested that this earth 

          alone in the whole universe is the abode of life..." (Dawson 1903, p. 

          177). 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, enough. This by no means exhausts the full 

          stock of misguided items I retrieved, but I think my point has been 

          made. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I suppose some readers might complain, alright, 

          but this is just history, after all, and perhaps we can forgive a bit 

          of sloppy research here and there, and even a few instances of obvious 

          axe-grinding. But there is a certain danger in allowing ourselves this 

          degree of tolerance, I think. In the case of Wallace we are dealing 

          with a moderately important person in the history of science who, but 

          for an accident of fate (and given his rather broader interests than 

          Darwin), might well have become the <i>most</i> important person in 

          the history of science. Surely we are doing no one a favor by trivializing 

          his role in history, or by allowing ourselves to assume that we understand 

          enough at this point to ignore it. If nothing else, all of this misinformation 

          tends to draw prospective investigators' attention away from potentially 

          more significant issues. My own research suggests, for example, that 

          Wallace was more upset by Darwin's actions during the summer of 1858 

          than he publicly let on, and for good reason: his own model of natural 

          selection probably was never intended to provide an explanation for 

          the phenomena of conscious awareness. 

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a more limited sense this exercise has produced 

          two immediate results. First, it has caused me to have generally more 

          sympathy for those who mistrust Web-based resources. Surely, any teacher 

          who permits his or her students to take advantage of the Web should 

          thoroughly forewarn them of its limitations. And second, I have decided 

          to respond to the particular problem at hand by leaping into the fire 

          myself with a Web site, "The Alfred Russel Wallace Page." If you can't 

          join 'em, beat 'em! <br>

        <P>For a given work to be eligible for review on this site it must meet
          the following criteria.</P>
        
        <P>1. The work must exist as a visual recording of some kind. The
          specific means used to create this recording are not, however, taken
          into account. A work can, thus, have been originally recorded on film,
          videotape, computer disk, or any other format on which a visual
          recording can be made. Furthermore, I do not take into account the
          place or medium in or by which a given work was originally or
          subsequently made available to the public.</P>
        
        <P>2. The work must have been created with the intention that it be
          viewed primarily as a visual recording. This may appear to be a
          somewhat vague requirement, but I believe it is needed to exclude such
          things as filmed plays, operas, and the like. If a play is produced in
          such a way that it is clear that it was meant to be viewed as a visual
          recording, then it is eligible to be reviewed on this site. If a play
          is produced in such a way that it is clear that it was meant to be
          viewed as a stage production, then, even if that stage production has
          been filmed, it is not eligible to be reviewed on this site.</P>
        
        <P>3. The work must have been created as a finite entity. I intend with
          this restriction to exclude any work that was or is being created as
          open ended. I do not, however, demand that a given work be shown in
          its entirety at one time. A television miniseries is as much a finite
          work as is any two hour film. Some television programs, especially a
          number of series from Japan, likewise have a definite duration and
          are, consequently, more like extended movies shown over a period of
          time than they are like open ended American television programs, which
          can, potentially, go on forever. If a given work has a defined
          duration, it can be treated as a coherent whole and is eligible to be
          reviewed here. If a work does not have a defined duration, if it is,
          potentially, of infinite length, it is not eligible to be reviewed
          here.</P>
        
        <P>4. The work must be watchable as an artistic work. That is to say,
          it cannot be watchable only as a didactic work. By this restriction, I
          intend to exclude any work whose value must be determined, principally
          or exclusively, by the accuracy with which it conveys information to
          the viewer. A given work that has been created to convey information,
          but which, in fact, can be viewed as an artistic work, according to
          the standards outlined in my &quot;<A HREF="summary.htm">Summary of
            Aesthetic Principles</A>,&quot; is, however, eligible to be reviewed
          here. </P>
        
        <P>5. The work must be at least twenty minutes in length.</P>

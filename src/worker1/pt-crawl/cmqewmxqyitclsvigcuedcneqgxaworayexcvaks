<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Review by Mark Dujsik</b> | April 25, 2024</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"></o:p></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"></o:p></o:p>
</span></p>

<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It's all about being stuck—in a job, in
relationships, in certain types of behaviors, in particular ways of thinking.
Ann, the central figure of <i>The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has
Passed</i>, might have had some dreams and big plans for her life, but they're
all but gone now. Replacing them is the reality of working a corporate job every
day, seeing the same guy who seems primarily interested in controlling her at
night, and sitting around her bare apartment whenever she's off work and the guy
is too busy or disinterested.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">In other words, writer/director/editor/star
Joanna Arnow's movie is about patterns and repetition. It's also a comedy,
because Arnow's Ann is so set in her ways that she fails at or even sabotages
her active attempts to change them. If that sounds more tragic than funny, it
probably is, but Arnow has a way with dry humor that keeps how depressing this
material could be at a distance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Instead, we just follow Ann's life over the
course of who-know-how-long a time period, as she contends with a corporate
merger, sticks with her pseudo-boyfriend Allen (Scott Cohen), and eventually
decides that maybe some kind of change or two might be in order for her. Is it
too late, as the title suggests, or is Ann just content to keep things the way
they are, as the title suggests in a more cryptic way?</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The biggest part of the episodic narrative has
to do with Ann's romantic relationships or, at least, her notion of romance and
intimacy. Allen takes up most of that. He's a well-to-do guy, although he argues
he isn't exactly that well-off after alimony payments to his ex-wife, paying for
his kid's schooling, and other financial responsibilities. They don't talk much
about personal stuff, anyway, because Ann plays a subservient role to Allen's
domineering side in the bedroom. She likes it that way, and in fact, it's kind
of the only sexual relationship she knows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The humor of these scenes is in the
juxtaposition of what we assume about the couple and what truth of their
connection actually is. The whole relationship looks as if it's just supposed to
be fun for the two of them, as Allen orders her around and Ann follows his every
command, as ridiculous as it may be (One scene has her running back and forth
from a wall to him, and after the second time, it's tough to imagine this
activity being much fun for either party).</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">After the fact, the two lie in bed, and Allen
starts asking about Ann's life. She has to remind him which college she
attended, and when we later learn that the couple has been up to this routine
for almost a decade, there are two possibilities: Either Allen really is this
cold and uninterested in a woman he has been regularly seeing for several years,
or the whole thing is part of the act. Who's actually in control here? There are
hints that Ann is the one telling Allen exactly what she wants him to do—how
she desires him to command her. The mystery is amusing and tantalizing, because
the answer could tell us one thing or another about who Ann really is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It's also a bit frustrating, if only because
the whole movie is more about its assorted gags and less about unlocking that
mystery. The rest of the narrative focuses on Ann's work life, her relationship
with her parents, and her efforts to expand her intimate relationships. All of
those things point to a person who has no control over what she does. Is the
bond with Allen just another part of it, or in arranging how one person will
domineer her, is that relationship the one thing she can control? By the end,
it's difficult to tell, and maybe the disappointment with the lack of a clear
answer reflects how intriguing Ann is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The other stuff, at least, is fairly amusing,
too. Ann's work life has her debating a new job title, sitting in meeting where
she's mildly scolded for not paying attention, having online calls with her new
boss (played by Michael Cyril Creighton) about the merger, and somehow avoiding
making her own job unnecessary, even though that's exactly what she was hired to
do in the first place. Again, maybe Ann has more control than she or anyone else
gives her credit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Then, there's her uncomfortable relationship
with her parents, played by Barbara Weiserbs and David Arnow (Knowing that
they're the filmmakers' actual parents gives their scenes together an added
level of awkwardness, which is a major point of the comedy). Her mother is
domineering, in that passive-aggressive and guilt-trippy sort of way (The
father's one act of useless rebellion here is genuinely funny), so is this where
she learned it all? That's probably the case, and it's likely why her attempt to
have a real romance with Chris (Babak Tafti) looks good in theory but is clearly
missing something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">There's plenty to admire about <i>The Feeling
That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed</i>, especially the way these
comedic vignettes paint a portrait of Ann that's somehow as focused about how
she behaves as it is messy about who she actually is. One could argue that Ann
isn't too sure herself, but the movie could—maybe should—have a better idea.</font>

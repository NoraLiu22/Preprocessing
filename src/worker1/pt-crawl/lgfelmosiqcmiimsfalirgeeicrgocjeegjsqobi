And even to the present day the Thracians, Illyrians, and Epeirotes live on the flanks of the Greeks (though this was still more the case formerly than now); indeed most of the country that at the present time is indisputably Greece is held by the barbarians — Macedonia and certain parts of Thessaly by the Thracians, and the parts above Acarnania and

However, the whole of what is now called Ionia used to be inhabited by Carians and Leleges; but the Ionians themselves expelled them and took possession of the country, although in still earlier times the captors of Troy had driven the Leleges from the region about Ida that is near Pedasus and the Satnioïs River. So then, the very fact that the Leleges made common cause with the Carians might be considered a sign that they were barbarians. And Aristotle, in his <I>Polities</I>,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref397" HREF="

And the same might be said of the Caucones, since now they are nowhere to be found, although in earlier times they were settled in several places.

Now although in earlier times the tribes in question were small, numerous, and obscure, still, because of the density of their population and because they lived each under its own king, it was not at all difficult to determine their boundaries; but now that most of the country has become depopulated and the settlements, particularly the cities, have disappeared from sight, it would do no good, even if one could determine their boundaries with strict accuracy, to do so, because of their obscurity and their disappearance. This process of disappearing began a long time ago, and has not yet entirely ceased in many regions because the people keep revolting; indeed, the Romans, after being set up as masters by the inhabitants,

Nevertheless, I shall attempt, in so far as it is appropriate to my description and as my knowledge reaches, to traverse the several different parts, beginning at the seaboard of the Ionian Gulf — that is, where the voyage out of the Adrias ends.

	<P CLASS="justify">

After Ambracia comes Argos Amphilochicum, founded by Alcmaeon and his children.

The Amphilochians are Epeirotes; and so are the peoples who are situated above them and border on the Illyrian mountains, inhabiting a rugged country — I mean the Molossi, the Athamanes, the Aethices, the Tymphaei, the Orestae, and also the Paroraei and the Atintanes, some of them being nearer to the Macedonians and others to the Ionian Gulf. It is said that Orestes once took possession of Orestias — when in exile on account of the murder of his mother — and left the country bearing his name; and that he also founded a city and called it Argos Oresticum. But the Illyrian tribes which are near the southern part of the mountainous country and those which are above the Ionian Gulf are intermingled with these peoples; for above Epidamnus and Apollonia as far as the Ceraunian Mountains dwell the Bylliones, the Taulantii, the Parthini, and the Brygi. Somewhere near by are also the silver mines of Damastium,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref450" HREF="

In earlier times these peoples were ruled separately, each by its own dynasty. For instance, it was the descendants of Cadmus and Harmonia who ruled over the Enchelii; and the scenes of the stories told about them are still pointed out there. These


<A ID="p309"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p309 </SPAN></A>people, I say, were not ruled by men of native stock; and the Lyncestae became subject to Arrabaeus, who was of the stock of the Bacchiads (Eurydice, the mother of Philip, Amyntas' son, was Arrabaeus' daughter's daughter and Sirra was his daughter); and again, of the Epeirotes, the Molossi became subject to Pyrrhus, the son of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles, and to his descendants, who were Thessalians. But the rest were ruled by men of native stock. Then, because one tribe or another was always getting the mastery over others, they all ended in the Macedonian empire, except a few who dwelt above the Ionian Gulf. And in fact the regions about Lyncus, Pelagonia, Orestias, and Elimeia, used to be called Upper Macedonia, though later on they were by some also called Free Macedonia.

In the Greek word for "peoples" (<SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">λαούς</SPAN>) Hesiod alludes to the Greek word for "stones" (<SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">λᾶας</SPAN>). Pindar (<I>Olymp.</I> 9.46 ff.) clearly derives the former word from the latter;


<A ID="p291x"></A>"Pyrrha and Deucalion, without bed of marriage, founded a Stone Race, who were called Laoi." One might now infer that the resemblance of the two words gave rise to the myth of the stones.

The site of Damastium is unknown. Imhoof-Blumer (<I>Ztschr. f. Numism.</I> 1874, Vol. I pp99 ff.) think that it


<A ID="p307x"></A>might be identified with what is now Tepeleni, on the Viosa River. But so far as is now known, there is no silver ore in Epeirus or Southern Illyria. Philippson (Pauly-Wissowa, <I>s.v.</I> "Damastion") suggests that Argyrium (near Argyrokastro, on the Viosa) might be connected with the presence of silver.

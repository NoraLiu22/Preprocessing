Introduction</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="8" id="pa8">Defendant General Motors LLC (&ldquo;GM&rdquo;) used an image of Albert Einstein in a November 2009 advertisement for its 2010 Terrain vehicle. The ad depicted Einstein's face digitally pasted onto a muscled physique, accompanied by the written message &ldquo;Ideas are sexy too.&rdquo; The ad ran in only one issue of <i>People</i> magazine. Plaintiff Hebrew University of Jerusalem <span page-number="933" pagination-id="903 F. Supp. 2d 932" id="p933"></span>(&ldquo;HUJ&rdquo;), which claims to own Einstein's right of publicity as a beneficiary under Einstein's will and thus exclusive control of the exploitation of his name and likeness, brought suit against GM for this unauthorized use of Einstein's image.<a note-disclosure="1" href="#N196635"></a>  </p><div note-container="1" id="N196635"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="9" id="pa9"> Article 13 of Einstein's will states: &ldquo;I give and bequeath all of my manuscripts, copyrights, publication rights, royalties and royalty agreements, and all other literary property and rights, of any and every kind or nature whatsoever, to my Trustees hereinafter named, IN TRUST, to hold the same for a term measured by the lives of my secretary Helena Dukas, and my step-daughter, Margot Einstein.... Upon the death of the said Helena Dukas and the said Margot Einstein, this trust shall terminate, and thereupon all funds or property, if any, still held in this trust, including all accrued, accumulated and undistributed income and all literary rights and property, shall pass and be distributed to Hebrew University....&rdquo;<br> <br> </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="10" id="pa10">On March 16, 2012, the Court issued an order permitting HUJ to proceed to trial to attempt to prove (1) that Albert Einstein would have transferred his postmortem right of publicity under New Jersey law had he been aware that such a right of publicity existed at the time of his death and (2) that GM had violated that right. <i>See </i> <i>Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem v. Gen. Motors LLC,</i> <a href="/case/hebrew-univ-of-jerusalem-v-gen-motors-llc-2#p1033" class="raw-ref">878 F.Supp.2d 1021, 1033&ndash;36</a> (C.D.Cal.2012).<a note-disclosure="2" href="#N196647"></a> GM has asserted that even if HUJ could prove both Einstein's intent with respect to the right of publicity and GM's violation of that right, it should not be entitled to recover damages because too much time elapsed between Einstein's death in 1955 and the filing of this lawsuit in 2010.  </p><div note-container="2" id="N196647"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="11" id="pa11"> In that order, the Court also granted summary judgment in favor of GM on HUJ's causes of action under the Lanham Act (<a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-15-commerce-and-trade/chapter-22-trademarks/subchapter-iii-general-provisions/section-1125-false-designations-of-origin-false-descriptions-and-dilution-forbidden" class="raw-ref">15 U.S.C. &sect; 1125(a)</a>) and California's Unfair Competition Law, but denied summary judgment on HUJ's remaining claims based on California's right of publicity statute <a href="/statute/california-codes/california-civil-code/division-4-general-provisions/part-1-relief/title-2-compensatory-relief/chapter-2-measure-of-damages/article-3-penal-damages/section-33441-using-deceased-persons-name-voice-signature-photograph-or-likeness" class="raw-ref">(Civil Code &sect; 3344.1</a>) and New Jersey's common law right of publicity.<br> <br> </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="12" id="pa12">Now before the Court is HUJ's motion <a note-disclosure="3" href="#N196654"></a> requesting that the Court find that the duration of the postmortem right of publicity is indefinite under New Jersey common law or, in the alternative, that it lasts for 70 years after death, as is the case with copyrights under the federal Copyright Act. In essence, HUJ seeks a ruling from this California federal court as to what New Jersey's highest court would likely determine to be the postmortem duration of that state's common law right of publicity.<a note-disclosure="4" href="#N196659"></a> For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that the New Jersey Supreme Court would likely find that the postmortem right of publicity endures for no more than 50 years after death. As to HUJ's cause of action under California's right of publicity statute ( <a href="/statute/california-codes/california-civil-code/division-4-general-provisions/part-1-relief/title-2-compensatory-relief/chapter-2-measure-of-damages/article-3-penal-damages/section-33441-using-deceased-persons-name-voice-signature-photograph-or-likeness" class="raw-ref">Civil Code &sect; 3344.1</a>), the Court also rules that the rights encompassed in that statute do not apply to Plaintiff.   </p><div note-container="3" id="N196654"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="13" id="pa13"> Dkt. 154.<br> <br> </p> </div><div note-container="4" id="N196659"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="14" id="pa14"> Given that New Jersey courts have not decided the duration of that state's postmortem right of publicity, this Court is called on to &ldquo;predict how the highest state court would decide the issue.&rdquo; <i>In re Kekauoha&ndash;Alisa,</i> <a href="/case/kekauohaalisa-v-ameriquest-mortg-co-in-re-kekauohaalisa#p1087" class="raw-ref">674 F.3d 1083, 1087&ndash;88</a> (9th Cir.2012).<br> <br> </p> </div> <h3></h3> <h3>II. Facts and Procedural History</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="17" id="pa17">The facts of this case are set forth in the Court's summary judgment order, <i>Hebrew University of Jerusalem v. General Motors LLC,</i> <a href="/case/hebrew-univ-of-jerusalem-v-gen-motors-llc-2" class="raw-ref">878 F.Supp.2d 1021</a> (C.D.Cal.2012), and therefore only a brief review of the background is presented here. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="18" id="pa18">Nothing in Albert Einstein's will specifically mentioned any right of publicity, and during his lifetime he did not claim or receive any monetary compensation for the use of his persona. Applying New Jersey law (because Einstein was domiciled there at the time of his death in 1955), this Court concluded that New Jersey would recognize a common law postmortem right of <span page-number="934" pagination-id="903 F. Supp. 2d 932" id="p934"></span>publicity without the requirement of lifetime exploitation. <i>Id.</i> at 1027&ndash;28, 1031&ndash;32. The Court therefore found that Einstein had a right of publicity that survived his death, but that the remaining question&mdash;whether he would have intended to transfer that right to HUJ through a provision in his will&mdash;was a factual question. <i>Id.</i> at 1034&ndash;36. For that reason, the Court held, HUJ was entitled to prove Einstein's intent at trial. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="19" id="pa19">For the present motion, the Court assumes without deciding that HUJ succeeded in proving that Einstein would have intended to bequeath his right of publicity to HUJ. The dispositive question now before the Court is the duration of that right. For how many years may HUJ enforce Einstein's common law, postmortem right of publicity? </p> <h3></h3> <h3>III. Legal Standard</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="22" id="pa22">Although HUJ has styled this motion as one for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/rules-of-civil-procedure-for-the-united-states-district-courts-1/title-vi-trials/rule-50-judgment-as-a-matter-of-law-in-a-jury-trial-related-motion-for-a-new-trial-conditional-ruling" class="raw-ref">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)</a>, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/rules-of-civil-procedure-for-the-united-states-district-courts-1/title-vi-trials/rule-50-judgment-as-a-matter-of-law-in-a-jury-trial-related-motion-for-a-new-trial-conditional-ruling" class="raw-ref">Rule 50(a)</a> only applies after a jury trial has begun. <i>See </i> <i>McSherry v. City of Long Beach,</i> <a href="/case/mcsherry-v-city-of-long-beach#p1019" class="raw-ref">423 F.3d 1015, 1019&ndash;21</a> (9th Cir.2005) (&ldquo;We hold that the district court may not grant a motion filed under <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/rules-of-civil-procedure-for-the-united-states-district-courts-1/title-vi-trials/rule-50-judgment-as-a-matter-of-law-in-a-jury-trial-related-motion-for-a-new-trial-conditional-ruling" class="raw-ref">Rule 50</a> prior to the presentation of any evidence in a case.&rdquo;). The Court therefore treats this motion as a motion for summary adjudication pursuant to Rule 56. <i>See </i> <i>id.</i> at 1021 (treating improper <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/rules-of-civil-procedure-for-the-united-states-district-courts-1/title-vi-trials/rule-50-judgment-as-a-matter-of-law-in-a-jury-trial-related-motion-for-a-new-trial-conditional-ruling" class="raw-ref">Rule 50</a> motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings); <i>see also</i>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d) (stating that when &ldquo;matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56&rdquo;); <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/rules-of-civil-procedure-for-the-united-states-district-courts-1/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)</a> (permitting summary judgment on &ldquo;part of&rdquo; a claim). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="23" id="pa23"> <a href="/statute/united-states-code/title-28-appendix/federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/rules-of-civil-procedure-for-the-united-states-district-courts-1/title-vii-judgment/rule-56-summary-judgment" class="raw-ref">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56</a> provides for summary judgment when &ldquo;the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&rdquo; The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a &ldquo;genuine issue of material fact for trial.&rdquo; <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc#p256" class="raw-ref">477 U.S. 242, 256</a>, <a href="/case/anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc" class="raw-ref">106 S.Ct. 2505</a>, <a href="/case/anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc" class="raw-ref">91 L.Ed.2d 202</a> (1986). A fact is material if it could affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law. <i>Id.</i> at 248, <a href="/case/anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc" class="raw-ref">106 S.Ct. 2505</a>. The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to establish, beyond the pleadings, that there is a genuine issue for trial. <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> <a href="/case/celotex-corporation-v-catrett#p324" class="raw-ref">477 U.S. 317, 324</a>, <a href="/case/celotex-corporation-v-catrett" class="raw-ref">106 S.Ct. 2548</a>, <a href="/case/celotex-corporation-v-catrett" class="raw-ref">91 L.Ed.2d 265</a> (1986). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="24" id="pa24">For the limited purpose of this motion, there are no factual issues in dispute. The parties agree that Einstein died while domiciled in New Jersey and that 55 years passed between his death in 1955 and 2010, when HUJ filed this lawsuit. The parties disagree as to whether the duration of the right of publicity extends as long as 55 years or even longer. This is a question that may properly be decided as a matter of law. </p> <h3></h3> <h3>IV. Analysis</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="27" id="pa27">J. Thomas McCarthy, the leading commentator on the right of publicity, has characterized the determination of the right's duration as &ldquo;by nature almost arbitrary.&rdquo; 2 J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>Rights of Publicity &amp; Privacy</i> &sect; 9:16 (2d ed. 2012) (henceforth, <i>&ldquo;McCarthy&rdquo;</i> ). An &ldquo;almost arbitrary&rdquo; ruling is unacceptable, however.

HUJ argues that despite this Court having already determined the very existence of the right of publicity under New Jersey law, the Court should apply d&eacute;pe&ccedil;age and determine the right's duration pursuant to California law. The Court disagrees. D&eacute;pe&ccedil;age is inappropriate because the existence and duration of the right of publicity are not separate issues. They are simply two aspects of the single question before the Court&mdash;whether HUJ may enforce Einstein's right of publicity. Moreover, it is clear from California and Ninth Circuit cases that there is no common law postmortem right of publicity in California and that California's postmortem right of publicity statute does not apply to non-domiciliaries. <i>See </i> <i>Comedy III Prods., Inc. v.

The court found that it does, holding that &ldquo;Elvis Presley's right of publicity survived his death and became part of Presley's estate.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i> at 1354&ndash;55. With respect to the duration of the right of publicity, however, the <i>Presley</i> court merely stated that the state legislature should determine that question, although it also noted that the federal Copyright Act, which at that time provided for a copyright term of life plus 50 years, could provide guidance. <i>Id.</i> at 1355 n. 10. No state court in New Jersey has ever addressed the issue. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="37" id="pa37">Although the New Jersey Legislature has considered at least two bills that would create a statutory right of publicity, it has thus far not seen fit to enact such a right. <i>See</i> A.3536, 213th Legis.

Post mortem uses are also less likely to create a false suggestion of endorsement or sponsorship.&rdquo;). The obviously humorous ad for the 2010 Terrain having been published 55 years or more after Einstein's death, it is unlikely that any viewer of it could reasonably infer that Einstein or whoever succeeded to any right of publicity that Einstein may have had was endorsing the GMC Terrain. </p> <h3>2. Copyright Law Considerations</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="48" id="pa48">HUJ argues that, if the Court must set a limit on the postmortem right of publicity, it should be coterminus with the current federal Copyright Act, which protects copyrights for 70 years after death. <i>See</i>17 U.S.C. &sect; 302. This Court disagrees. The purpose of the right and its underlying policies do not warrant a mechanical application of the Copyright Act's term of life plus 70 years. Indeed, although McCarthy ultimately recognizes that using the federal Copyright Act as a model will &ldquo;[m]ore often than not ... provide the tie-breaking solution to the problem&rdquo; of determining the postmortem duration of the right of publicity, <i>McCarthy,</i> &sect; 9:16, it is clear that such an analogy is inconsistent <span page-number="938" pagination-id="903 F. Supp. 2d 932" id="p938"></span>with McCarthy's own views about the purpose and policies underlying the right. In fact, he would prefer to limit the extent of the right to 10&ndash;20 years after death, despite noting that other commentators have proposed longer durations, including a life&ndash;plus&ndash;50&ndash;year term modeled after the former version of the federal Copyright Act. <i>Id.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="49" id="pa49">The current 70&ndash;year postmortem term was enacted by the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act, which increased the length of copyright protection from its former duration of life plus 50 years. <i>See </i> <i>Eldred,</i> 537 U.S. at 193, <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">123 S.Ct. 769</a>. HUJ acquired Einstein's right of publicity in 1982, <i>Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem,</i> <a href="/case/hebrew-univ-of-jerusalem-v-gen-motors-llc-2#p1024" class="raw-ref">878 F.Supp.2d at 1024&ndash;25</a>, at which time the 1976 Copyright Act was in place&mdash;with a 50&ndash;year postmortem duration. <i>See </i> <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft,</i> <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft#p193" class="raw-ref">537 U.S. 186, 193</a>, <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">123 S.Ct. 769</a>, <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">154 L.Ed.2d 683</a> (2003). HUJ's reasonable expectation at that time, based on the same theory of analogy to copyright that it advocates today, necessarily would have been that any rights it acquired would not last more than 50 years after Einstein's death. Similarly, when the <i>Presley</i> court suggested that the New Jersey Legislature consider the Copyright Act as a guide in setting a postmortem duration for the right of publicity, that statute had only a life&ndash;plus&ndash;50&ndash;year duration. <i>See </i> <i>Estate of Presley,</i> <a href="/case/estate-of-presley-v-russen#p1355" class="raw-ref">513 F.Supp. at 1355</a> n. 10. This was approximately one year before HUJ acquired its interest. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="50" id="pa50">There are certain similarities between the goals of copyright and those of the right of publicity. In a sense, both rights evolve from an act of creation, whether it is the creation of a &ldquo;work&rdquo; such as a writing or the creation of a cultivated persona. These acts of creation are the product of an individual's choices and self-expression. Some courts, accordingly, have analogized between copyright and the right of publicity in the context of balancing the interests protected by those rights with the interests protected under the First Amendment. <i>See, e.g., </i> <i>Hart,</i> <a href="/case/hart-v-electronic-arts#p776" class="raw-ref">808 F.Supp.2d at 776&ndash;77</a> (noting the &ldquo;common underlying principles shared by the right of publicity and copyright doctrine&rdquo;); <i>Estate of Presley,</i> <a href="/case/estate-of-presley-v-russen#p1359" class="raw-ref">513 F.Supp. at 1359</a> n. 21 (describing Elvis's likeness as an &ldquo;original work&rdquo;); <i>see also </i> <i>Comedy III Prods., Inc. v.

First, as HUJ itself has argued, the right of publicity is an intensely personal right meant, to some extent, to protect against personal and dignitary harms, such as having one's persona associated with a product or idea of which he disapproves. <i>See</i>Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &sect; 46 cmt. c. Thus, &ldquo;the focus of copyright is on recorded creative expressions while the focus of the right of publicity is on the identity and &lsquo;persona&rsquo; of a human being.&rdquo; <i>McCarthy,</i> &sect; 5:45; <i>see also</i>Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &sect; 46 cmt. i <span page-number="939" pagination-id="903 F. Supp. 2d 932" id="p939"></span>(&ldquo;[T]he subject matter of the right of publicity generally lies outside the scope of copyright. Moreover, the protection afforded by the right of publicity against the exploitation of a person's identity for purposes of trade is not ordinarily &lsquo;equivalent&rsquo; to the rights against reproduction, distribution, performance, and display recognized under copyright.&rdquo;). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="52" id="pa52">Moreover, the protection of copyright is designed to encourage the future creation of works of art, whereas the interest sought to be protected by the right of publicity is usually the byproduct of a different and earlier endeavor. &ldquo;The commercial value of a person's identity often results from success in endeavors such as entertainment or sports that offer their own substantial rewards. Any additional incentive attributable to the right of publicity may have only marginal significance.&rdquo; Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &sect; 46 cmt. c. For this reason, it is questionable whether those interests should be protected for as long a period after the death of the person to whom they belong as are his copyrighted works. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="53" id="pa53">Finally, among the reasons for Congress's 1998 extension of the federal Copyright Act to protect works for life plus 70 years (increased from life plus 50 years) were the desire to harmonize U.S. copyright protection with the protection afforded by countries in the European Union, <i>see </i> <i>Eldred,</i> <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft#p205" class="raw-ref">537 U.S. at 205&ndash;06</a>, <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">123 S.Ct. 769</a>, and, arguably, to promote the interests of the American entertainment industry, <i>see </i> <i>id.</i> at 262, <a href="/case/eldred-v-ashcroft" class="raw-ref">123 S.Ct. 769</a> (Breyer, J., dissenting). These political and economic considerations are distinct from those policies underlying copyright protection that also support a right of publicity.

Public Policy Counsels in Favor of Limiting the Postmortem Right of Publicity to Not More Than 50 Years</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="66" id="pa66">One of the overarching policy concerns in enforcing intellectual property rights is the balance that must be struck between protecting an individual's right to reap the benefits of his creative endeavors and the public's freedom of expression. <i>See </i> <i>White v. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc.,</i> <a href="/case/white-v-samsung-electronics-america-inc-2#p1519" class="raw-ref">989 F.2d 1512, 1519</a> (9th Cir.1993) (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (&ldquo;[I]ntellectual property law is full of careful balances between what's set aside for the owner and what's left in the public domain ....&rdquo;). This policy concern extends to the right of publicity. <i>See id.;</i> <i>Hart,</i> <a href="/case/hart-v-electronic-arts#p774" class="raw-ref">808 F.Supp.2d at 774</a> (noting that &ldquo;it is clear that the right of publicity may encroach upon First Amendment rights&rdquo; and discussing the various balancing tests used by courts to weigh those rights); Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &sect; 47 cmt. c (&ldquo;The right of publicity as recognized by statute and common law is fundamentally constrained by the public and constitutional interest in freedom of expression.&rdquo;). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="67" id="pa67">An open-ended right of publicity, or even a postmortem duration longer than 50 years, raises considerable First Amendment concerns and creates a potentially infinite curb on expression. <i>See </i> <i>White,</i> <a href="/case/white-v-samsung-electronics-america-inc-2#p1513" class="raw-ref">989 F.2d at 1513</a> (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (&ldquo;Overprotecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it.

Additionally, as the Ninth <span page-number="941" pagination-id="903 F. Supp. 2d 932" id="p941"></span>Circuit recently noted, an extended right of publicity may interfere with or decrease the value of copyrighted works, such as photographs, thereby pitting one form of protected property against another. <i>See </i> <i>Milton H. Greene Archives,</i> <a href="/case/milton-h-greene-archives-inc-v-marilyn-monroe-llc#p1000" class="raw-ref">692 F.3d at 1000</a>. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="68" id="pa68">New Jersey courts' treatment of the First Amendment implications of the right of publicity is indicative of how that state's highest court might decide the issue of the right's duration. Many of those courts have applied a balancing test in their efforts to protect First Amendment values while determining the reach of the right of publicity. <i>See </i> <i>Hart,</i> <a href="/case/hart-v-electronic-arts#p767" class="raw-ref">808 F.Supp.2d at 767, 774&ndash;776</a> (collecting New Jersey cases, but noting, however, that &ldquo;the Supreme Court in <i>Zacchini,</i> the only Supreme Court case addressing a First Amendment defense to the right of publicity did <i>not</i> engage in a balancing of the competing interests&rdquo;); <i>Tellado,</i> <a href="/case/tellado-v-time-life-books-inc#p908" class="raw-ref">643 F.Supp. at 908&ndash;09</a> (collecting New Jersey cases); <i>see also </i> <i>G.D. v.

Goodman, et al., 49 N.J. Prac., Business Law Deskbook &sect; 16:3 (2011&ndash;2012 ed.) (&ldquo;New Jersey recognizes a robust First Amendment constitutional defense to right of publicity claims.&rdquo;). Given that lower New Jersey courts apply a balancing test to the treatment of the First Amendment interests implicated by the right of publicity, it is likely that the New Jersey Supreme Court would perceive pitfalls in allowing an unlimited or lengthy term to the right of publicity, and that it would be likely to strike a similar balance if confronted with the question of the postmortem duration of that right.  </p><div note-container="7" id="N197112"> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="69" id="pa69"> It is nevertheless indisputable that commercial speech&mdash;like GM's ad here&mdash;also is protected to some extent by the First Amendment. <i>See </i> <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of New York,</i> <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york#p561" class="raw-ref">447 U.S. 557, 561&ndash;62</a>, <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york" class="raw-ref">100 S.Ct. 2343</a>, <a href="/case/central-hudson-gas-electric-corporation-v-public-service-commission-of-new-york" class="raw-ref">65 L.Ed.2d 341</a> (1980).<br> <br> </p> </div> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="70" id="pa70">In addition to First Amendment implications, there is another consideration. In the 57 years since Albert Einstein died, the means of communication have increased and so has the proclivity of people to use them frequently. Journalists, academics and politicians frequently issue pronouncements about the impact on society, both in the United States and around the globe, of the dizzying explosion in the tools of communication. New devices and platforms have been developed, including smart phones, personal computers, social networks, email, Twitter, blogs, etc. These technologies have caused a swift and dramatic, but still developing, impact on ordinary life. It has become a truism that their speed, their accessibility, and their popularity appear to have changed social norms regarding privacy and public expression. But it is not yet clear what this should mean for the protection of such rights as the right of privacy, the right of expression and the right of publicity. For example, on balance should the law increasingly protect people's right of expression, now that we enjoy so many fora in which to broadcast our views? Similarly, should the law value the right of privacy <i>less</i> than before, given that many social media devotees, especially young people, are said to have little compunction about revealing intimate information about themselves? Conversely, should the law afford celebrities greater rights in controlling publicity about themselves, to protect against what appears to be a growing tendency of people to not just exalt but even to exploit the fame and celebrity of others?<span page-number="942" pagination-id="903 F. Supp. 2d 932" id="p942"></span> </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="71" id="pa71">The Court does not profess to have answers to these questions, but what is clear is that since the full impact of these rapid changes remains uncertain, it would be imprudent to issue any ruling that strengthens (or at least lengthens) one right&mdash;that of the right of publicity&mdash;to the potentially significant detriment of these other rights. </p> <h3></h3> <h3>V. Conclusion</h3> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="74" id="pa74">Absent a legislative directive to the contrary, to extend the right of publicity beyond a half century would be inconsistent with the Court's responsibility to balance all of the interests that are at stake. It also would risk having that right treated as an open-ended heredity right. <i>See </i> <i>McCarthy,</i> &sect; 9:16 (noting the need &ldquo;to avoid descendants or heirs unto the nth generation reaping the commercial rewards of a distant and famous ancestor, a &lsquo;favored bloodline&rsquo; concept out of step with a society that has abolished hereditary titles&rdquo; and that at some point, the interests of free speech outweigh the interests of the heirs and &ldquo;the person's identity should enter the public domain as a part of history and folklore&rdquo;). </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="75" id="pa75">A maximum duration of 50 years appropriately reflects the balance between meaningful enforcement of the right of publicity after a famous individual's death and the public's interest in free expression. It aligns with the majority of current state statutes limiting the right's postmortem duration. And it approximates the period evidently contemplated by the <i>Presley</i> court&mdash;the one court in New Jersey to have discussed the duration of the right&mdash;when it encouraged that state's legislature to consider the issue with guidance from the then-current Copyright Act. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="76" id="pa76">The Ninth Circuit recently noted that Marilyn Monroe considered herself to belong &ldquo;to the Public and to the world.&rdquo; <i>Milton H. Greene Archives,</i> <a href="/case/milton-h-greene-archives-inc-v-marilyn-monroe-llc#p1000" class="raw-ref">692 F.3d at 1000</a>. There is no evidence that Albert Einstein saw himself that way, but he did become the symbol and embodiment of genius. His persona has become thoroughly ingrained in our cultural heritage. Now, nearly 60 years after his death, that persona should be freely available to those who seek to appropriate it as part of their own expression, even in tasteless ads. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="77" id="pa77">Accordingly, the Court DENIES HUJ's motion and rules that under New Jersey law, 2005 was the last year during which HUJ could sue to enforce any right of publicity that it might have inherited from Albert Einstein. Because this case was not filed until 2010, HUJ is not entitled to pursue it further. There will be no trial. </p> <p class="paragraph" pa-id="78" id="pa78">By not later than October 22, 2012, GM must file a &ldquo;[Proposed] Judgment&rdquo; in accordance with this ruling.</p> </section><hr> </section></div></div></section><section class="pb-5 container-fluid d-none"><div class="row"><div class="content-header col-12 col-lg-5 offset-lg-2"><div class="slogan text-muted mt-4">Summaries of</div><div class="short-title"><h1 class="mt-2">Hebrew University v.

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

	background-image: url(../pics/chapter1a.JPG);
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

	      in the <em>Morning Post</em> (London) issue of 8 January 1913. The interviewer

	      and Wallace is quoted as saying &quot;The work did not suit me
	      well; in fact, I hated it.&quot; This is to say the least a bit surprising:
	      it has always been assumed that he liked his outdoor work from this
	      period. Perhaps, however, he more liked the &quot;outdoor&quot; part of
	      it than the surveying itself. (10/11/11) A communication (12/22/11)

          a Brazilian science centre in Rio de Janeiro linked to Oswaldo Cruz Foundation.
          The play, named &quot;Pergunte a Wallace&quot; in Portuguese, is
          an adaptation of the British performance &quot;You Should Ask Wallace,&quot;
          written and directed by Geinor Styles, artistic director of a theatre company
          in Wales. A monologue based in Wallace&acute;s biography <em>My Life</em>, &quot;You
          Should ask Wallace&quot; focuses on the aspects of Alfred Wallace's
          inspirational character. It shows how a young adventurer, fascinated by the
          nature, undertook the journey that led him to the idea of evolution by natural
          selection and turned him into one of the most respected naturalists of history.
          Performances are at 10:30 am and 1:30 pm Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays
          in  June and July, and at 2:00 pm Saturdays
          through the same period. At the Museum of Life, Wallace is also featured
          in the exhibition &quot;Evolution
          and Tropical Nature,&quot; which shows how the tropics inspired both
          Wallace and Darwin in the formulation of the theory of evolution by natural
          selection, particularly the Brazilian biodiversity, one of the richest in
          the world. 
          The play and the exhibition integrate the celebration of the International
          Year of Biodiversity in Brazil.&quot; For more information: <a href="http://www.museudavida.fiocruz.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?UserActiveTemplate=mvida&amp;infoid=1447&amp;sid=22">http://www.museudavida.fiocruz.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?UserActiveTemplate=mvida&amp;infoid=1447&amp;sid=22</a> &nbsp;(6/17/10)</font><br />

        </li><li><font size="-1">George Beccaloni at the Natural History Museum, London,
            reports &quot;I have just learnt the sad news that the Linnean Society
            has decided to change the date it awards its Darwin-Wallace medal:--from
            1st July 2008 (i.e. the 150th anniversary of the reading of the Darwin-Wallace
            papers first proposing natural selection) to (you guessed it!) 12th
            February 2009--Darwin's 200th birthday... The reason this is sad
            is because the medal was specifically created to mark the anniversary
            of the reading of the Darwin-Wallace papers. It is (or was!) the
            only award in the world to do so. Wallace was the first recipient
            of the medal (he was given the only gold example ever produced) on
            1st July 1908, the 50th anniversary of the reading of the Darwin-Wallace
            papers. (<a href="S656.htm">read 
            his acceptance speech here</a>). The medal was next awarded on the
            100th anniversary in 1958 and it was due to be awarded again this
            year. From 2009 onwards the award will be presented annually on Darwin's
            birthday. Given that the reading of the Darwin-Wallace paper is without
            doubt the most famous and historically important event which has
            taken place at the Society in its history, it seems extraordinary
            that they have taken this decision.&quot; Beyond George's consternation
            I can only add that I wonder whether the Linnean Society has considered
            that from now on the majority of people who stop to think about the
            date commemorated will wonder why a Darwin-Wallace medal is given
            out in honor of Abraham Lincoln's birthday... (6/7/08)</font><br />

          Batesian mimicry, where females are mimetic and males are non-mimetic, 
          and with the deviation of female wing colour patterns from the ancestral 
          patterns conserved in males. Thus, Wallace's model largely explains

          population? One indirect way of measuring this is to look at how misspellings 
          of his name have decreased over recent years. Using the search engine 
          <i>AlltheWeb</i>, I first checked the total number of sites containing 
          his name as spelled with one 'l' and with two 'l's (going all the way 
          back to their starting point, 1/1/80), and found 129000 sites containing 
          the former, and 27600 sites containing the latter, a proportion of the 
          latter to the former of about .214--a bit more than one to five (<i>Google</i> 
          produces totals of 286000 and 56000, respectively, a proportion of about 
          .196). I then kept changing the starting date upward toward the present, 
          the effect being to focus in on those sites that had been changed or 
          begun only more and more recently. The trend was fairly obvious. By 
          the point I set the search for those sites new or altered since 1/1/07, 
          the numbers were 97900 and 8890, respectively, a proportion of about 
          .091. Those sites that were new or altered since 6/1/07 produced figures 
          of 72800 and 1400, respectively, a proportion of about .019--a more 
          than tenfold improvement overall. Apparently, people are getting more 
          and more used to the name--both as to its unusual spelling, and, one 
          surmises, in general. (6/24/07)</font><br />

          presidential anniversary address to the Geological Society of London,

          with the same subject, I must direct your attention to a paper published
          by Mr. Alfred Wallace on the law which has regulated the introduction
          of new species. Mr. Wallace is a naturalist of no ordinary calibre.
          His travels in South America and elsewhere are a sufficient guarantee
          of his high merits; he now writes from Sarawak, Borneo. From a careful
          examination of the actual distribution of existing forms of animal
          life, and the gradual but complete renewal of the forms of life in
          successive geological epochs, he has deduced the following law:--<i>Every species 
            has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing 
            closely allied species</i>. The question is one of great importance,
            and deserving the careful investigation of every geologist; but I
            think it may be doubted whether this assumed law can be maintained

            in the past to Charles Lyell's and Edward Blyth's notice of the paper
            (and its subsequent reading by Charles Darwin), but here is recognition
            that found its way into print (in the Society's <i>Quarterly Journal</i> series). Was this on 
          Hamilton's own initiative, or did Lyell (who certainly must have known 
          him fairly well) alert him as he did Darwin? (6/20/07)</font><br />

          Beaufort worked from photographs of Wallace, completing the painting

          May 20th 2006, Wallace's grandson, Richard, unveiled a monument to his 
          illustrious grandfather near Usk, Wales, outside the church where Wallace 
          was baptised and close to the cottage where he was born. The 1.5 x 1.0 
          x 1.0 m monument is made from 350 million year old limestone with fossils 
          on its surface. The rock was donated by Hanson Aggregates from one of 
          their quarries near Bridgend, southern Wales, and the two black granite 
          plaques were produced by the Welsh company Mossfords. The monument was 
          paid for by the A. R. Wallace Memorial Fund, which biologists George 
          and Janet Beccaloni from the Natural History Museum, London, originally 
          set up in 1999 in order to restore and preserve Wallace's neglected 
          grave in Broadstone, Dorset. John Barrow of the Usk Civic Society and 
          the poet Anne Cluysenaar were instrumental in organising the project. 
          About 100 people attended the unveiling ceremony, including local civic 
          dignitaries and representatives of the three local groups who were involved 
          with the project i.e. the Usk Civic Society, the Usk Conservation &amp; 
          Environmental Group, and the Friends of Usk Rural Life Museum. Before 
          the unveiling Dr George Beccaloni gave a talk entitled 'Alfred Russel

          Volume 1 of the set consists of a selection of over sixty of Wallace's 
          periodical writings on the subject, while Volume 2 represents a facsimile 
          reprint of Wallace's book <i>Darwinism</i>, (S724) and Volume 3, his 
          book <i>Natural Selection and Tropical Nature</i> (S725). Over 1500

          Well, if the searches I just did on the two services <i>AlltheWeb</i> 
          and <i>Google</i> are any indication, pretty well--at least as compared
          with other Victorian period naturalist noteworthies. His name receives
          far fewer hits than Darwin, of course, and he still trails Alexander
          von Humboldt and Herbert Spencer by over two to one, but he is closing
          in on Thomas Huxley and Gregor Mendel, and actually has gone ahead
          of Francis Galton, Asa Gray, Charles Lyell, Georges Cuvier, Richard
          Owen, and Louis Agassiz--if we're thinking of this in &quot;competition&quot; 
          terms, that is... I have also determined that there now are, relatively
          speaking, fewer spelling errors on his name ('Russell' instead of 'Russel')
          than there used to be--another sign he is getting better known. (1/11/04)</font><br />

            London, for sending the following report: &quot;On Saturday 14 September 
          2002 a cast aluminium plaque was unveiled by Wallace's grandson Richard, 
          on a house which Wallace built in 1872 in Grays, Essex, UK. Wallace 
          named the house &quot;The Dell&quot; and it is the only one of the three houses
          which he built for himself and his family which has survived destruction
          by modern development. The 'A. R. Wallace Memorial Fund' (Chairman
          George Beccaloni) designed and paid for the plaque, which forms part
          of a commemorative plaques scheme being run by Thurrock Local History
          Society, the Heritage Forum and Thurrock Council. Wallace lived in
          The Dell from March 1872 until July 1876 and he wrote his books <i>The Geographical Distribution 
            of Animals</i> and <i>On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism</i> whilst
            he was there. The house is also notable in being one of the earliest
            surviving shuttered concrete houses in Britain. The Dell is situated
            at 25 College Avenue and it is currently used as a convent by the
            La Sainte Union Order of nuns. Although the property is not open
            to the public, the plaque can be seen from the road (take binoculars!).&quot;

          way back from the Amazon in 1852. Published by the Editora da Universidade 
          de S&atilde;o Paulo, Imprensa Oficial do Estado, this is a large work
          (dimensions 23 x 26 cm., 517 pages) that features plates of all two
          hundred plus drawings (accompanied by Wallace's original notes), with
          all auxiliary text, introductory comments, tables, appendices, etc.,
          etc.--offered in both Portuguese and English--by Dr. Toledo-Piza Ragazzo.
          Apart from the value of the work as a historical document and contribution

            posted 4 February: &quot;The Library and the Development Office are pleased to announce 
          that they have successfully completed their campaign to secure funds 
          for the acquisition of the personal library and collections of Alfred 
          Russel Wallace. Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) was a traveller and 
          naturalist, who together with Charles Darwin, identified Natural Selection 
          as the key to evolutionary change. The collection was exclusively offered 
          to The Natural History Museum at the beginning of 2001 as the owners, 
          Wallace's two grandsons, wanted to ensure the collections which have 
          always been kept together went to a permanent home where they would 
          remain that way. The collection was independently valued at &#163;162,500, 
          and The Natural History Museum agreed to this purchase price. Some of 
          the books and manuscripts in the collection relate to specimens held 
          in the Museum's collections. The acquisition also augments the Museum's 
          existing Wallace holdings, for instance the new material reveals Wallace's 
          post publication thought and reaction to the work of others, notably 
          Darwin. The acquisition makes a major research resource accessible to 
          scholars. Due to the current interest in Wallace and the large amount 
          of quality manuscript material in this acquisition, it is highly probable 
          that The Natural History Museum will use items from the acquisition 
          in future exhibitions and publications.&quot; (2/18/02)</font><br />

          have been put up in full text online: <i><a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/wallace/7.html" target="_top">Forty-five 
            Years of Registration Statistics, Proving Vaccination to be both Useless 
            and Dangerous</a></i> (S374, second edition of 1889), and <i><a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/wallace/book.html" target="_top">Vaccination

        </li><li><font size="-1">The word is starting to get out about Wallace! As 
          of this writing (July 2001) at least seven persons have books on Wallace 
          either in press or in preparation: Andrew Berry, Jane Camerini, Martin 
          Fichman, James Moore, Stephan Pickering, Michael Shermer, and Charles 
          Smith.</font><br />
          <br />
        </li><li><font size="-1">A story in the November 2000 number of <i>Geographical 
          </i>indicates that a Brazilian biologist shortly will publish the more 
          than 200 pencil drawings that Wallace made of Amazonian fish. These 
          drawings were among the few things that Wallace saved from the shipwreck 
          on his way back to England in 1852.</font><br />

        </li><li><font size="-1">A Wallace &quot;event&quot; took place on 15 April 2000 coinciding 
          with the unveiling of Wallace's restored gravesite in Broadstone Cemetery, 
          Dorset. This was the culmination of a project that had been underway 
          for a good number of months under the auspices of The A. R. Wallace 
          Memorial Fund (Dr. George W. Beccaloni, Chairman) and the Linnean Society 
          of London. The program included a series of lectures presented at the 
          nearby University of Bournemouth. A correspondent writes: &quot;It was a
          rainy, blowy day but the graveside was crowded with 80 or more, including
          Wallace biographers Sandra Knapp, John Wilson, and Peter Raby. The
          Wallace family was represented by grandsons Richard and John, several
          great-grandchildren, and even a tiny great-great-grandson. Appropriately,
          a Darwin great-grandson was present to be inducted into the Linnean
          Society, the retired banker Stephen Keynes. The grave itself had been
          handsomely restored except for the fossilized tree trunk, which was
          declared to be in excellent condition after several hundred thousand
          or million years. Look for photos in an early edition of <i>The Linnean</i>&quot; [my
          thanks to J.R.M.!]. The project attracted worldwide attention; among
          other places stories appeared in <i>American Scientist</i> (Volume 87(5), September/October 
          1999, pp. 407-8), <i>British Journal for the History of Science</i> 
          (Volume 32(115), December 1999, pp. 483-4), and <i>Nature</i> (Volume 
          400(6744), 5 August 1999, p. 489).</font><br />

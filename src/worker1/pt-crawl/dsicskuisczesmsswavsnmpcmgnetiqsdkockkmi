It was January 2010 and she was about to meet a woman she’d been chatting with online for a few weeks.</p><p id="4" data-element-id="4" class="cp-text">She took her time getting ready, choosing to wear a pair of jeans and a button-down shirt to look casual yet, hopefully, impressive.</p><p id="5" data-element-id="5" class="cp-text">Her date had been pestering her to meet for some time, she remembered, but she had wanted to wait. “I was happy we were finally meeting physically,” Izzy recalled.</p><p id="6" data-element-id="6" class="cp-text">The two women had initially planned to meet in a public place, but her date changed the venue at the last minute, saying it would be more comfortable and safer to meet in her home in the Ogba neighborhood of Nigeria’s commercial capital, Lagos.</p><div id="7" data-element-id="7" class="r-component" data-component="kito-video-scroller" data-data="{&quot;src&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/interactive/2024/01/africa/nigeria-gay-women-online-dangers-as-equals-intl-cmd/media/images/frame1_0110.mp4&quot;,&quot;thumb&quot;:&quot;./media/images/thumbs/frame1_0110.mp4&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;frame1_0110.mp4&quot;,&quot;poster&quot;:&quot;./media/images/frame1_0110.mp4.jpg&quot;}},&quot;webmSrc&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;webm&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/interactive/2024/01/africa/nigeria-gay-women-online-dangers-as-equals-intl-cmd/media/images/frame1_0110.webm&quot;,&quot;thumb&quot;:&quot;./media/images/thumbs/frame1_0110.webm&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;frame1_0110.webm&quot;}},&quot;slides&quot;:[&quot;When the then-20-year-old arrived, she was welcomed in and told to relax. Her date, Izzy remembered, made some food, and served drinks and the women began to connect. But something felt off.&quot;,&quot;Izzy – whose name has been changed to protect her identity – told CNN that not long after the pair had moved into the bedroom, there was an unexpected knock on the door – and her excitement soon turned to terror.&quot;,&quot;“That knock alone changed everything,” said Izzy, now 33.&quot;,&quot;Two men – whom she now assumes were already hiding in the apartment – walked into the bedroom and started to hurl abuse at her. They tied her down, stripped her naked, punched and stabbed her and, as she described it, began “playing with my private parts”.&quot;,&quot;At first, she said, she was confused and she resisted, but her attackers threatened to pour acid on her. As Izzy was raped, she said she was told that she was wasting her body on women, and that this taste of men would change her sexuality.&quot;]}"></div><p id="8" data-element-id="8" class="cp-text">Even during the chaos of her assault, Izzy said she had a moment of realization that this had been planned all along.</p><p id="9" data-element-id="9" class="cp-text">Referring to her date, she said: “They were doing all this to me, and they weren&#39;t doing the same thing to her.”</p><h2 id="10" data-element-id="10" class="cp-header cp-header--title">‘In Nigeria, we call it kito’</h2><p id="11" data-element-id="11" class="cp-text">Izzy is one of thousands of queer Nigerian women, men, and non-binary people subjected to a practice known locally as “kito,” according to data shared by multiple organizations with CNN. It involves someone pretending to be interested in a relationship with a target, usually through social media or on dating apps, and luring that person into a meet up where they are then physically and verbally assaulted, and often extorted. Sometimes, the perpetrators film the attack.</p><p id="12" data-element-id="12" class="cp-text">“This type of harm exists everywhere, but in Nigeria we call it kito. Kito is anything done to harm a member of the LGBT+ community due to their online activity,” explained Akudo Oguaghamba, founder and executive director of Women&#39;s Health and Equal Rights (WHER).</p><p id="13" data-element-id="13" class="cp-text">When it comes to women, multiple experts told CNN that these attacks are typically more severe and sexual in nature and, sometimes more prolonged, with the victim only being kitoed once a more serious relationship has formed.</p><p id="14" data-element-id="14" class="cp-text">Remi Makinde, interim executive director of The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERs), an organization working with the LGBTQ community in Nigeria, explained that bisexual women and lesbians may also be victims of “corrective rape”: when sexual assault is committed specifically because of the victim’s sexual orientation and with the intention of making them heterosexual. Makinde reported that during the assault, the attackers may say things like, “we will teach you how to enjoy a man.”</p><p id="15" data-element-id="15" class="cp-text">Makinde said kito attacks against queer Nigerians have been happening for more than a decade, due to high levels of homophobia, fuelled by conservative and deeply religious societal views in the country. But the activist thinks these attacks became more prevalent after the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act was signed into law in 2014. The act prohibits same-sex marriage, the witnessing or administering of same-sex marriages, publicly being in a same-sex relationship and the registration, support of, or participation in gay clubs or societies, all of which is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p id="16" data-element-id="16" class="cp-text">“Attacks against members of the (LGBTQ) community have always happened but were not as rampant as they are now,” Makinde told CNN.

Local nonprofit WHER told CNN they helped 1,871 victims of kito from 2018 to 2022, including 590 people identifying as women, while Nigeria-based online media advocacy group Pride TV shared that they have helped 1,253 people since 2020, ranging from 180 to almost 500 people per year, of which around half (524) identified as women.</p><p id="19" data-element-id="19" class="cp-text">In 2023 alone, TIERs shared that they helped 65 men, women, intersex and trans people in Nigeria who were targets of kito attacks in which they were physically abused. Two of them identified as women. The nonprofit also shared that more than 550 people were blackmailed and extorted, many of whom were first targeted online.</p><p id="20" data-element-id="20" class="cp-text">Damola Bolaji, TIERs’ advocacy and communications officer, told CNN that these numbers reflect just a fraction of attacks that have happened during these timeframes, because, as she pointed out, the data only reflects attacks in Lagos – and only attacks that have been reported. Figures will be higher across Nigeria, Bolaji explained, and among queer women, who are less likely to report them or share their experiences because they face more stigma than gay or bisexual men due to having not met the expectations placed on them by society to get married and have children. Those with children fear losing them if their sexuality is revealed.</p><div id="21" data-element-id="21" class="cp-pullquote container"><img src="./static/assets/images/Quote.svg" alt="Quote Icon" class="quote-icon"><blockquote><p>Attacks against members of the (LGBTQ) community have always happened but were not as rampant as they are now.</p></blockquote><cite>Remi Makinde</cite></div><p id="22" data-element-id="22" class="cp-text">Kito attacks have eroded trust in digital platforms that once offered a way to find community and intimacy in a society still deeply hostile toward homosexuality.</p><p id="23" data-element-id="23" class="cp-text">“You are trying to reach out to someone that is like you, someone that you can have a relationship with, someone that you know you can relate to, and then you fall prey (to) people who are either camouflaging as queer or who are queer and just nefarious,” said Makinde.</p><p id="24" data-element-id="24" class="cp-text">CNN interviewed 16 women who said they were kitoed by people they met on social media platforms or dating apps between 2010 and 2023.

She said both men then used the footage and photos to force her to stay in the marriage, while her husband now readily has affairs.&quot;],&quot;audioSrc&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;audio&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/interactive/2024/01/africa/nigeria-gay-women-online-dangers-as-equals-intl-cmd/media/images/240112-alozie.mp3&quot;,&quot;thumb&quot;:&quot;./media/images/thumbs/240112-alozie.mp3&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;240112-alozie.mp3&quot;}},&quot;srtFile&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;srt&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/interactive/2024/01/africa/nigeria-gay-women-online-dangers-as-equals-intl-cmd/media/images/240112-alozie-edited-3.srt&quot;,&quot;thumb&quot;:&quot;./media/images/thumbs/240112-alozie-edited-3.srt&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;240112-alozie-edited-3.srt&quot;}}},{&quot;heading&quot;:&quot;Queen&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:&quot;32&quot;,&quot;copy&quot;:[&quot;Queen had always felt pressured by her parents to hide her sexuality.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Review by Mark Dujsik</b> | April 18, 2024</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"></o:p></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"></o:p></o:p>
</span></p>

<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Cliff (Scoot McNairy) is in a dying profession,
but he just doesn't know it yet. He's a traveling salesman, who works on and
lives off the road, hocking whatever wares his current employer has to sell,
eating at whatever place is along the way, sleeping in motels, and using a
payphone to check in with his wife whenever he reaches his next destination. <i>Blood
for Dust</i> recalls this lonely occupation of a time of simpler technology for
a low-key thriller about desperation and, once guns and drugs become involved,
its inevitable consequences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The movie, written by David Ebeltoft and
directed by Rod Blackhurst, is one that's admirable for how restrained it is in
terms of its plotting and restraining it feels in terms of its protagonist's
isolated despair. Here's a seemingly ordinary man, just trying to make a living
to support his struggling family, who also has some dark, sordid secrets in his
past. They catch up to him early in this story, and once he decides to embrace
the seedier potential of his job and side of his personality, that hidden part
of Cliff eventually comes to define him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">&quot;Eventually&quot; is doing a lot of heavy
lifting in that description of this narrative. While the plot—as is the case
with a neo-noir like this—does contain some violence and a couple of betrayals
and a build-up toward how the excessive greed of its characters will pay off,
it's mostly about Cliff losing his agency and taking a few rides that will
result in doom for assorted parties. That's kind of how Cliff likes it—reaping
the benefits of unethical money-making practices and illegal schemes without
having to get his hands dirty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">He did it once, more than a year before the
plot proper begins in the early 1990s, and only stood by to watch as his best
friend took the blame and his own life as a result. All it got him was some
money that went to paying for his sick son's medical bills, a guilty conscience,
and a bad reputation among anyone who knows or finds out about his association
with the scheme.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">McNairy, a solid character actor, is full of
quiet anxiety and reflexive defensiveness in this role, playing a man who's
convinced he'll be found out at any given moment and ready to do just about
anything to protect himself from the consequences. When we first meet him (after
a quick prologue of him and a colleague, who'll show up again later, discovering
his dead friend), he's selling defibrillators to offices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The boss at one business recognizes his face
and remembers that he worked for the company that had all those problems of
money going missing. Cliff attempts to assure the guy that he's mistaken, but he
tells Cliff's current employer anyway. Before accepting being fired, Cliff tries
to blackmail his soon-to-be former boss with his knowledge of some cooked books.
It doesn't go well, so now, Cliff has to find a new company for which to sell
things, lest he, his wife Amy (Nora Zehetner), and their hospitalized son lose
everything.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">An answer comes from Ricky (Kit Harington), who
was involved in the past financial malfeasance and now is arms and drug dealer
for a shady organization. It's run by John (Josh Lucas), who sells Cliff on how
easy the job of transporting guns and drug across the Midwest will be—before
telling him that any mistake or betrayal will result in his death and the end of
everything and everyone he holds dear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The beats of this story are entirely familiar,
which isn't an inherent issue with the material. What does become a major one,
though, is how Blackhurst's restraint with the melodrama and plotting,
dedication to maintaining that quiet mood of worry and hopelessness, and efforts
to establish a relaxed rhythm to the proceedings overshadow the story and
characters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Much of this does feel completely ordinary, as
if we're watching a traveling salesman just going about his business, even as
his life is in shambles, one of John's goons (played by Ethan Suplee) joins him
on his first drug-running gig, and a stranger in a truck seems to be following
them. The benefit to this pacing is that, when the violence does erupt, it comes
as a genuine shock, such as when Ricky shows up to reveal to Cliff what his
actual plan for getting him involved in this illegal activity is. From that
point, there's more driving, more of Cliff being miserable and conscience-laden
(He also has guilt about his friend's widow, played by Amber Rose Mason, for
more than her husband's suicide), and more waiting for the shock of the
otherwise predictable plot points to arrive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">On one level, it is admirable that <i>Blood for
Dust</i> focuses on the atmosphere, the characters, and the sense that this
slow, soft series of road trips are a wrong turn or two away from disaster. On
another, though, it becomes clear that each of these elements is striking the
same note, and the repetition of that tone, combined with the routine of the
plot, is little more than a matter of hollow style.</font>

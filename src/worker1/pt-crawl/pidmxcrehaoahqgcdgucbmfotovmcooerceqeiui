<P> <I>This little chronicle was probably composed in Greek in about 500 A.D., and was later translated into Latin by the eponymous "barbarian", who unfortunately had only a rudimentary knowledge of both languages.  As a result the meaning of some passages remains obscure, and the spelling of proper names is erratic - some of the more obvious mis-spellings have been corrected here.</I>

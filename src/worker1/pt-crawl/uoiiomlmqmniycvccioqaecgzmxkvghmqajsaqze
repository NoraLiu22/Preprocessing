I would like to say you my BIG THANK YOU for your product.
We are using Gallery 2 at NASA/GSFC/IXO to store our mission design figures and we found it very helpful.
Before we implemented Gallery 2, I did a research, but I did not anything comparable with Gallery 2.

Thank you very much!

the photos of our outdoor activities and mountaineering among our friends. Then, our site began to be visited by other people, some of whom e-mailed us. After five years I have 3 really very good friends and adventure companions that I've met in this way!

Besides that, several times we met people in the mountains that greeted us with "your website helped us to discover new amazing trails and canyons!".

We thank the Gallery team not just for this great software, but especially for these unexpected interactions with new people that are now our friends!"<br /><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matteo (09/05/2010)</b></p></td> </tr>

I have really explored and pushed the boundaries of what can be done with this software, hosting over 3,000 original images in our gallery as well smaller, more screen friendly versions. Make no mistake, this gallery can handle whatever you throw at it.

I judged the program like " no it probably sucks" but I have to say I was so happy after installing it..

Thank you for making the best photo sharing/ gallery program anywhere.
In my opinion, Gallery beats all comparable open-source and commercial products around.

The embassy obtained from the senate a pardon for them.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Rewards were then bestowed on the princes who had given aid against Aristonicus; to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mithridates.html#5">Mithridates</A> of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pontus.html#1">Pontus</A> was allotted Greater <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/phrygia.html#1">Phrygia</A>; to the sons of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ariarathes.html#5">Ariarathes</A>, king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cappadocia.html#1">Cappadocia</A>, who had fallen in that war, were assigned <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lycaonia.html#1">Lycaonia</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cilicia.html#1">Cilicia</A>;  <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> and the Roman people were more faithful to the sons of their ally, than their mother was to her children, since by the one the kingdom of the young princes was increased, by the other they were deprived of life.  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> For <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/laodice.html#6">Laodice</A>, out of six children, all boys, whom she had by king Ariarathes (fearing that, when some of them were grown up, she would not long enjoy the administration of the kingdom), killed five by poison;  <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> but the care of their relatives rescued from the barbarous hands of their mother one infant, who, after the death of Laodice (for the people killed her for her cruelty), became sole king.
<P> 	 <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Mithridates also, being cut off by sudden death, left a son, who was likewise named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mithridates.html#6">Mithridates</A>,  <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> and whose greatness was afterwards such that he surpassed all kings, not only of his own but of preceding ages, in glory, and carried on war against the Romans, with various success, for forty-six years,  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> during which, though the most eminent generals, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sulla.html#5">Sulla</A>, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/lucullus.html#4">Lucullus</A>, and others, and at last, Cnaeus <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/pompeius.html#22">Pompeius</A>, overcame him, yet it was only so that he rose greater and more glorious to renew the contest, and was rendered even more formidable by his defeats.  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> And he died at last, not from being overpowered by his enemies, but by a voluntary death, full of years and on the throne of his ancestors, and leaving his son his heir.

He accustomed himself to escape from the wild beasts, or pursue them, by speed of foot,  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> and by this means, while he avoided the plots laid for him, he inured himself to endure all manner of bodily exertion.

<P> 	 <A CLASS="ref" NAME="38.3">[38.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte38.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> The king of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/armenia.html#2">Armenia</A>, at this time, was <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/tigranes.html#1">Tigranes</A>, who had long before been committed as a hostage to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/parthia.html#1">Parthians</A>, but had subsequently been sent back to take possession of his father's throne. This prince <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/mithridates.html#6">Mithridates</A> was extremely desirous to engage as an ally in the war, which he had long meditated, against the Romans.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> By the agency of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gordius.html#1">Gordius</A>, accordingly, he prevailed upon him to make war, having not the least thought of offending the Romans by the act, on <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/ariobarzanes.html#1">Ariobarzanes</A>, a prince of inactive disposition; and, that no deceit might seem to be intended, gave him his daughter <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_of_Pontus">Cleopatra</A> in marriage.  <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> On the first approach of Tigranes, Ariobarzanes packed up his baggage and went off to Rome. Thus, through the instrumentality of Tigranes, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cappadocia.html#1">Cappadocia</A> was destined to fall again under the power of Mithridates.  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicomedes.html#3">Nicomedes</A>, too, dying at the same time, his son, who was also named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/nicomedes.html#4">Nicomedes</A>, was driven from his dominions by Mithridates, and, having gone as a suppliant to Rome, it was decreed by the senate that "both the kings should be restored to their thrones;" and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aquillius.html#2">Aquilius</A> and Manlius <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/maltinus.html#1">Maltinus</A> were commissioned to see the decree executed.  <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> On being informed of this proceeding, Mithridates formed an alliance with Tigranes, with a resolution at once to go to war with the Romans; and they agreed that the cities and territory that should be taken from the enemy should be the share of Mithridates, and that the prisoners, and all booty that could be carried off, should belong to Tigranes.  <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> In the next place, well understanding what a war be was provoking, he sent ambassadors to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cimbri.html#1">Cimbri</A>, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/galatia.html#1">Gallograecians</A>, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sarmatians.html#1">Sarmatians</A>, and the Bastarnians, to request aid;  <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> for all the time that he had been meditating war with the Romans, he had been gaining over all these nations by acts of kindness and liberality. He sent also for an army from <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythia</A>, and armed the whole eastern world against the Romans.  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Accordingly, without much difficulty, he defeated Aquilius and Maltinus, who had an army wholly composed of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#1">Asiatic</A> troops, and having put them to flight, as well as Nicomedes, he was received with great joy by the various cities,  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> in which he found a great quantity of gold and silver, and vast warlike stores, laid up by the care of former princes. Taking possession of these, he remitted the cities all sorts of debts, public and private, and granted them an immunity from tribute for five years.
<P> 	 <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> He then assembled his troops, and animated them, by various exhortations, to pursue the war with the Romans, or in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#1">Asia</A>.  <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> His speech, on this occasion, I have thought of such importance that I insert a copy of it in this brief work. <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/trogus.html#3">Trogus</A> Pompeius has given it in the oblique form, as he finds fault with <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/livius.html#1">Livius</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sallustius.html#1">Sallustius</A> for having exceeded the proper limits of history, by inserting direct speeches in their works only to display their own eloquence.

 <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> he had heard that the people of Transalpine <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gaul.html#1">Gaul</A> had invaded Italy, and founded many great cities in it, and that the same <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gaul.html#1">Gauls</A> had possessed themselves of a larger territory there than in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#1">Asia</A>, though Asia was considered by no means a warlike country;  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> he had been informed that Rome was not only taken but conquered by the Gauls, the top of one hill only being left in possession of the inhabitants, and that the enemy was not made to retire by the sword, but by gold.  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> But that the power of the Gauls, which had always so much alarmed the Romans, he himself numbered among his own forces; for that these <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/galatia.html#1">Gauls</A>, who inhabited Asia, differed only in situation from the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/gaul.html#1">Gauls</A> who had settled themselves in Italy;

 <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> and that, by many states of Italy, armies of the Romans had been cut off by the sword, and by others, with a new species of insult, sent under the yoke.  <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> But that, not to dwell on past instances, all Italy, at the present time, was in arms in the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/marsi.html#1">Marsian</A> war, demanding, not liberty, but a participation in the government and the rights of citizenship.  <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> Nor was the city more grievously harassed by war from its neighbours in Italy, than by intestine broils among its leading men;

<P> 	 <A CLASS="ref" NAME="39.2">[39.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte39.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp;</A> But <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/alexander.html#26">Alexander</A>, having secured the throne of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/syria.html#1">Syria</A> and being puffed up with success, began, with insolent haughtiness to show disrespect even to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/ptolemy.html#8">Ptolemy</A> himself, by whom he had been artfully advanced to royal dignity.  <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Ptolemy, in consequence, effecting a reconciliation with his sister, prepared, with his utmost effort to overthrow that power which, from hatred to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/demetrius.html#4">Demetrius</A> he had procured for Alexander by supplying him with troops.  <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> He therefore sent a large force to the aid of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#8">Grypus</A> and his daughter <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cleopatra.html#11">Tryphaena</A> to marry him, that he might induce the people to support his nephew, not only by sharing in the war with him, but by contracting with him this affinity.  <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Nor were his endeavours without effect; for when the people saw Grypus upheld by the strength of Egypt, they began by degree to fall away from Alexander.  <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> A battle then took place between the kings, in which Alexander was defeated, and fled to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antioch.html#1">Antioch</A>. Here, being without money, and pay being wanted for his soldiers, he ordered a statue of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/v/victoria.html#1">Victory</A> of solid gold, which was in the temple of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/j/jupiter.html#1">Jupiter</A>, to be removed, palliating the sacrilege with jests, and saying that "Victory was lent him by Jupiter."  <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Some days after, having ordered a golden statue of Jupiter himself, of great weight, to be taken away secretly, and being caught in the sacrilegious act, he was forced to flee by a rising of the people, and being overtaken by a violent storm, and deserted by his men, he fell into the hands of robbers, and being brought before Grypus, was put to death.
<P> 	 <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Grypus, having thus recovered his father's throne, and being freed from foreign perils, found his life endangered by a plot of his own mother; who, after betraying, from desire of power, her husband Demetrius, and putting to death her other son, was discontented at her dignity being eclipsed by the victory of Grypus, and presented him with a cup of poison as he was returning home from taking exercise.  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> But Grypus, having received notice of her treacherous intention, desired her (as if to show as much respect for his mother as she showed for him) to drink herself first, and, when she refused, pressed her earnestly, and at last, producing his informant, charged her with the fact, telling her, "that the only way left to clear herself from guilt, was, that she should drink what she had offered to her son." The queen, being thus disconcerted, and her wickedness turned upon herself, was killed with the poison which she had prepared for another.  <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> Grypus, accordingly, having securely established his throne, had peace himself, and secured it for his people, for eight years.  <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> At the end of that time a rival for the throne arose, named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#9">Cyzicenus</A>, a brother of his own by the same mother, and son of his uncle <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antiochus.html#7">Antiochus</A>. Grypus having tried to take him off by poison, provoked him the sooner to contend for the throne with him by force of arms.

Summoning some soldiers herself, therefore, she despatched a party to kill her sister.  <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> They, going into the temple, and not being able to drag her away, cut off her hands while she was embracing the statue of the goddess. Soon after Cleopatra expired, uttering imprecations on her unnatural murderers, and commending the avenging of her fate to the outraged deities.  <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> And not long after, another battle being fought, Cyzicenus, being victorious, took Tryphaena, the wife of Grypus, who had just before killed her sister, prisoner, and by putting her to death made atonement to the manes of his wife.

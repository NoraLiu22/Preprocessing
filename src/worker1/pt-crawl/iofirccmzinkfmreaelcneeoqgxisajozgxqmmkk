<H2>Dancing At Lughnasa (1998)</H2>

<P>D: Pat O'Connor<BR>
S: Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, Sophie Thompson</P>

<P>Watchable but instantly forgettable film of Brian Friel's award-winning
play which provides its greatest pleasures through the strong performances
of its ensemble cast. Five independent-minded sisters living in Donegal
in the mid 1930s face the possibility of change when economic and emotional
circumstances conspire against them. The return of their brother from religious
missions in Africa signals the beginning, and as the pagan festival of Lughnasa,
which celebrates the harvest and forebodes the coming of winter, is celebrated
around them, they must come to terms with changes in their own relatively
comfortable middle class world. The ten year old son of one of them views
events with a nostalgic eye which nonetheless sees the hardship and heartbreak
which occurs around him.</P>

<P>Despite director Pat O'Connor's valiant attempts to 'open out' the play,
the film is still extremely theatrical. The inclusion of landscape shots
and the restaging of certain scenes in outdoor locations unavailable in
the theatre does not really make the film cinematic. It merely adds visuals
to what is still a complex series of linguistic exchanges which delineate
and explore character. Authentic production design and costuming and the
persistent presence of a traditional-themed score by Bill Whelan contribute
to the feeling of the film, and with the help of good accent work by the
cast, it manages to successfully evoke a feeling of time and place. However
it remains an extremely well produced stage play on film, and is still bound
by blocking and staging conventions which allow the actors to meet and greet
one another to exchange their thoughts and feelings. The closest the film
comes to a visual symbolic system is the use of dance and ritual to underscore
the social and emotional tensions. The undercurrent of paganism which defines
the relationships between people and their sense of the cosmos is constantly
evoked (as it was in the play), and the film begins with a credit sequence
featuring images of African tribes people in traditional costumes. But other
than the climactic dance scene where the sisters celebrate their sisterhood
to the strains of ceili music, the film rarely manages to escape the enclosed
and cerebral world of the stage version.</P>

<P>But paradoxically, the reliance on actors plying their trade on well
written words (rather than visuals) is the thing which saves the film from
itself. Meryl Streep gives a convincing performance (and manages a creditable
accent) as the repressed, authoritarian schoolteacher who heads the female
clan, and she is more than matched by Michael Gambon's endearing performance
as the slightly baffled priest whose exposure to the customs and rituals
of Africa have coloured his perceptions of home. The rest of the cast (the
non-stars, so to speak) are equally good, particularly Sophie Thompson as
the simple minded Rose and Kathy Burke as the chain smoking Maggie. Catherine
McCormack and Brid Brennan (the latter a veteran of the Abbey Theatre production)
have less showy roles, but work distinctive characterisations in with those
of the others with ease and skill. Supporting male performances from Rhys
Ifans and young Darrell Johnston are also good, and the film also comes
with a rich voice over provided by Gerard McSorley (who played the part
of the the child at an adult remembering in the stage version).</P>

<P>This aspect of the film alone is probably worth the time and attention
required to view it, but on the whole it is a less rewarding experience
than the play itself. While an unfair basis upon which to criticise a work
of adaptation, the material was perhaps fundamentally unsuited to cinematic
treatment. Though Frank McGuinness has done his best to translate the themes
and character issues, and has successfully done so insofar as it applies
to theme and character, this is not so much a film version as a film of
the play with some additional settings and scenes which prevent it from
becoming completely unwatchable. What power it has comes from the power
of the play, and it is mostly evinced at the level of verbal discourse.
Theatrical adaptation is a minefield for film makers and has produced varying
results in the past. <I>Dancing at Lughnasa</I> does not distinguish itself
in the annals of this sub-section of film history, but for those patient
enough with its lack of genuine cinematic interest, it offers certain pleasures
which should pass the time painlessly enough.</P>

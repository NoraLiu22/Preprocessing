<H2>The Last Bus Home (1997)</H2>

<P>D: Johnny Gogan<BR>
S: Annie Ryan, Brian F. O'Byrne</P>

<P>Much-vaunted ultra low budget Irish feature, a sort of indigenous rejoinder
to Alan Parker's adaptation of <I>The Commitments</I>. It charts the short,
turbulent life of a Dublin punk band in 1979, formed the same day a Papal
visit by Pope John Paul II holds the rest of the nation entranced in a haze
of old-fashioned values (a day which also, historically, marked a resurgence
of conservatism for some years). An angry, rebellious group of youths express
their disenchantment through this unconventional music, barely realising
their individual personal motivations. As they achieve moderate success
they begin to learn more about themselves, and it tears them apart.</P>

<P>There are some good scenes in this film, particularly the surrealistic
opening where punkette Annie Ryan wanders around the eerie, empty spaces
of suburban Dublin while her family and most of her neighbours attend Mass
in the Phoenix Park, and the clever climax where a funeral is intercut with
the takeoff of an Aer Lingus jet, neither of which turns out to be what
they seem to represent. It is authentically grungy, dramatically quite satisfying,
and relatively coherent as a vision of Irish society from the fringes. Writer/Director
Johnny Gogan does a good job with obviously limited resources, and the film
makes a virtue of the confined, poorly-lit spaces where most of the action
takes place.</P>

<P>The main problems are in the performances, which tend towards the amateur.
While this is inevitable, and indeed possibly appropriate, there is something
irritating about Ryan's wild-eyed determination and Brian F. O'Byrne's relentless
sulking, especially when there is not a lot of variety to their characterisations
until the well-judged coda where the characters meet over a decade later.
The film derives some strength from the fact that the actors perform the
music themselves (as in <I>The Commitments</I>). This gives the concert
scenes a ring of authenticity (further enhanced by featuring members of
Dublin's actual, still existing punk scene in the crowds), despite the generic
'band struggling to get started' clich&eacute;s which surface from time
to time (a cynical record company exec., finding an unusual venue to play
in, semi-comic 'disasters' during performances; things which happen, granted,
but overly familiar from films of this type).</P>

<P>The film is also not quite forceful enough in its treatment of the issue
of homosexuality which informs one of its sub-plots. Without wanting to
spoil the film for potential viewers, one of the band's fate is partly determined
by his sexuality. Despite the suggestion early on that homophobic thugs
roam the streets along with the rest of the alternative lifestyle characters
who are part of the scene, the film lets itself off the hook by refusing
to take this to its logical conclusion. The same applies elsewhere in the
story. Gogan seems unwilling to fully explore the darker side of his characters
and the setting, though he does not deny them entirely. There are various
suggestions of a bleaker underworld, and there are some scenes of confrontation
and conflict, but there is never a sense that the script has plumbed the
depths of what is going on.</P>

<P>The film does locate its events within a particular moral, social, and
economic climate which defines how the characters live, and it is notable
as a cynical evocation of that moment in recent Irish history. There is
not quite enough anger though, especially for a film set in the punk scene.
It harbours a certain affection for traditionalism embodied in the regard
shown for the character of Ryan's grandmother, and, in fact, by the film's
end, punk is itself shown to be a form of hypocritical, futile rebellion
masking a neo-conservative desire for success. This is appropriate. It is,
after all, a 1990s film which looks back at that era from the vantage point
of the so-called 'Celtic Tiger' economy where politics are in decline, money
seems to be everywhere, and Irish society prides itself on being more open
and progressive. Gogan's vision of the punk scene in 1979 can be read as
a satire of Irish society on the whole, and there are clever and subtle
jabs at those who attempt to criticise or deny the effects of a culture
which ultimately informs everything that they do, especially when they try
to reject it. </P>

<P><I>The Last Bus Home</I> is certainly an interesting film for an Irish
audience. There is much to think about both in the film itself and in terms
of the issues it raises. It is not the crowd-pleaser that Parker's film
was, but it is worthwhile as a product of the recent renaissance in filmmaking
in Ireland which <I>The Commitments</I> marked part of the beginning of.
It is not as polished and accomplished as it might have been, but then,
as noted, this does match the setting, and thus allows Gogan to get away
with a certain amount of amateurism. On the whole, it is good to see this
type of film emerging, as, along with the likes of <I><A HREF="cheat.htm">How
to Cheat in the Leaving Certificate</A></I>, <I><A HREF="nov.htm">November
Afternoon</A></I>, and even <I><A HREF="iwd.htm">I Went Down</A></I>, it
contributes to a climate of edgier, riskier pictures of Irish culture in
the late twentieth century. It won't appeal to everyone, mind, and is unlikely
to make it very far beyond these shores (though it won Best Film at the
British and Irish Film Festival in Cherbourg), but it is worth a look.</P>

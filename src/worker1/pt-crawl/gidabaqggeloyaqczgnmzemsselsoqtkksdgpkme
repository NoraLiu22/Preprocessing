        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the 
          youth sports training industry grows and more professional conditioning 
          coaches begin working with younger athletes, the undeniable reality 
          is that the quality of this section of the athletic training world is 
          becoming watered-down. That is not intended to be an insult or negative 
          comment towards the truly well educated and passionate professionals, 
          in fact, to any conditioning coach or trainer who engages in work with 
          younger athletes, I should be serving as a beacon of sorts, calling 
          out the &#8216;gurus&#8217; and &#8216;experts&#8217; who apply little 
          more than adult-based prescription and program design to kids. There 
          are several wonderful youth conditioning coaches to be sure, but the 
          trick to any young athlete, soccer coach or parent is how to find them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
          of the issues that I feel needs to be addressed is the lack of preparation 
          that goes into producing an athletic development or training program. 
          As is often the case, the first session between the coach and athlete 
          is simply a &#8216;jumping in with both feet&#8217; kind of endeavor. 
          The training program is either a group of exercises that the coach has 
          a preference for, or a replica of a program that the coach has employed 
          in the past. As I have outlined in previous articles, the concepts of 
          multilateral development indicate that various measures of athletic 
          diversification pertain to young athletes as a whole. Sporting interests 
          and associated training programs can be largely determined for the majority 
          of young athletes based on factors such as chronological and biological 
          age, emotional maturity and past sporting experience. Even the specific 
          exercises associated with a young athlete&#8217;s development program 
          can be the same or similar across the board, but exercise volume, intensity 
          and subsequent progressions or regressions are determined exclusively 
          by the individual young athlete. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Push-ups, 
          for example, have long been determined to be a quality exercise for 
          young athletes. Kids either love or hate to bring home stories about 
          their physical education teacher and his or her daily ritual of handing 
          out gross numbers of push-ups, typically, in the interest of developing 
          better fitness in the youngsters. Push-ups have always been considered 
          a wonderful and functional upper body activity; while that is true, 
          push-ups can also serve to improve core strength or, unfortunately in 
          many cases, lead to various spinal or pelvic dysfunctions. It is with 
          this latter scenario that the need for assessments of young athletes 
          prior to developing a training program is so blatantly obvious. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          a push-up position, the body can tell you many things about itself (this, 
          by the way, holds true for nearly any bodily position). For example, 
          if one or both feet are externally rotated (opposite of pigeon-toed) 
          that can be a very strong indication of tightness through some of the 
          major external rotator muscles in and around the hip (biceps femoris 
          for example). If there is an extension or hyper-extension present through 
          the lumbar spine (a &#8216;dip&#8217; in the body at the lower back), 
          that likely indicates a tightness through some of the major muscles 
          on the front of the thigh (psoas specifically), a decreased ability 
          of the gluteal muscles to contract properly, or even a decreased amount 
          of neuromuscular control over the deep muscles towards to the front 
          of the &#8216;ab&#8217; area. It should be clear that while push-ups, 
          or any other functional body weight exercise remain terrific strengthening 
          activities, the individual physiology and structure of each young athlete 
          will dictate whether or not the exercise has a positive application 
          to them. It is only after an assessment that a functional and optimally 
          useful training program can be developed. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
          example is the overhead squat (squat with feet shoulder width apart 
          and arms straight up over head and out to a rough 45 degree angle). 
          By watching a young athlete actively performing a few squats slowly, 
          you can assess several areas of concern for potential dysfunction. Watch 
          the feet for example. Do they either pronate (the arch of the foot caves 
          down towards the ground) or supinate (the opposite)? If so, the indication 
          is tightness along either the medial or lateral musculature of the lower 
          leg. Does the athlete come off his or her heels and balance entirely 
          on the toes during the squat? If so, you can conclude that the soleus 
          (lower leg) muscle may be tight. Watch the knees. Do they either collapse 
          inward or angle outward during the squat? Tightness along the medial 
          or lateral musculature of the upper leg could be prevalent. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          hope that you have been able to see the concerns that these imbalances 
          will have from both a developmental and athletic standpoint. If dysfunction 
          resides within the pelvis of young athlete, for example, then any exercise 
          is bound to exacerbate the situation. The body has a natural ability 
          to compensate for dysfunction, but long-term athletic proficiency and 
          injury avoidance with undoubtedly be compromised. Every time an exercise 
          is performed through a dysfunctional movement pattern, the dysfunction 
          becomes more pronounced and more difficult to correct. Make no mistake, 
          however, if the dysfunction is not corrected, then performance will 
          suffer. Better to take the time to PREVENT the dysfunction than to correct 
          it once it has become a problem. Look at it in simple terms... If you 
          can&#8217;t perform a squat motion properly, without holding or carrying 
          any weight at all, why than would a trainer suggest that you perform 
          the same squat with a significant load on your back. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          above ideas are not meant to serve as a diagnosis in anyway. Ultimately, 
          a parent or coach is best served to take their young athlete to see 
          a qualified SPORTS medicine professional in order to receive a full 
          structural work-up. Having said that, the day to day care of these young 
          athletes falls into the hands of the countless trainers and coaches 
          throughout North America. By not understanding the principal of preventing 
          dysfunction or by blindly prescribing exercises absently regardless 
          of the individual nature of the athlete, you are contributing to the 
          gross negligence that has and continues to plague this industry. </font></p>

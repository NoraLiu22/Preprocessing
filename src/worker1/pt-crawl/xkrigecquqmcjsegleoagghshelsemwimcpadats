<h3>Passage Illustrated</h3>

<p class="one">Caleb sat next his daughter; Dot and her old schoolfellow were side by 
side; the good Carrier took care of the bottom of the table. Miss Slowboy was isolated, 
for the time being, from every article of furniture but the chair she sat on, that she 
might have nothing else to knock the Baby’s head against.</p>

<p>As Tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys, they stared at her and at the 
company. ["Chirp the Second," 89-90]</p>

<h3>Various Notions of Tilly Slowboy, 1845-1912</h3>
 
<p class="one">Leech's illustration of Tilly rocking the Peerybingles' baby in the 
nursing chair suggests that she is merely the Comic Woman of melodrama, a caricature and 
nothing more. Later illustrators such as <a href="../barnard/index.html">Fred Barnard</a> 
(1878) and Luigi Rossi (1912) attempt to distinguish her from a simple-minded "natural" 
(a person of low intellect) or "cony" (a country bumpkin), and individualise her in a 
realistic manner so different from the cartoon figure of the 1845 first edition of the 
novella. While <a href="../abbey/index.html">E. A. Abbey</a> in the American Household 
Edition (1876) communicated the odd-looking adolescent's fascination with the "precious" 
infant, Barnard extended his sympathy to the young nurse from the foundling home, making 
her gangly and awkward but also animated by utter devotion to her charge. Rossi, on the 
other hand, features the aptly named Tilly Slowly only once, in a simple thumbnail 
illustration; however, he treats her realistically rather than as a grotesque.</p>

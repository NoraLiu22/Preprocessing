<H2>Bloody Sunday (2002)</H2>

<P>D: Paul Greengrass<BR>
S: James Nesbitt, Kathy Kiera Clarke</P>

<P>It has taken more than thirty years for Irish cinema to follow the lead
of Gillo Pontecorvo in depicting the political conflict on the island in
terms more of documentary than melodrama, thirty years during which its
subject matter has remained as live as the history depicted only shortly
after it happened in <I>The Battle of Algiers</I>. <I>Bloody Sunday</I>
is not a documentary (nor was <I>The Battle of Algiers</I>), nor is it the
first or the last treatment of its subject, but that moment in time is still
an open wound in Irish history and the film is as timely now as Pontecorvo's
was then.</P>

<P>On 30 January 1972 thirteen people participating in a civil rights demonstration
in Derry city, Northern Ireland were killed amid a blaze of gunfire from
British Army troops who claimed to be under attack by Republican paramilitaries.
Many more people were injured, one further person died some time later,
but more importantly the experiment in nonviolent protest and peaceful people
power was essentially at an end. Thirty years later the facts of what happened
are still in dispute, with investigations, tribunals, testimonial biographies,
television documentaries and even poetry ensuring that questions are still
being asked about what happened that day and what it means for those whose
answers remain in contestation.</P>

<P><I>Bloody Sunday</I> was one of two television dramas produced to mark
the thirtieth anniversary of the events, but the only one released theatrically
in the US and Europe. It is still a television film, favouring a less expansive
visual canvas and emulating the style of observational camerawork currently
in favour on so much of what is sometimes termed 'video verite'. What might
seem a restriction turns out to be an asset. It becomes, in fact, the defining
feature of the film. Its visual style works on two levels. Firstly, employing
the signifiers of documentary makes the events seem more immediate and more
shocking, giving greater force to the action once the violence begins. Secondly,
on a deeper level, the sense of spontaneity and confusion upon which the
climactic scenes rely for both authenticity and a polemical position provide
a certain ambiguity which the suggestion of on-the-spot filming allows.
The fact that the film has used a consistent style throughout prevents the
use of this kind of filming seem less like an affectation. The climax is
stylistically consistent with the body of the film, and the cumulative effect
is of a powerful sense of realism.</P>

<P>Reality is a tricky thing though, realism even trickier. The facts of
the case are still in dispute, with each side hotly maintaining that the
experience of the other is based upon a prejudicial point of view. There
are defectors on both sides who argue contrary positions, and the evidence
continues to mount. The film attempts to steer a relatively neutral course
through what is known and what is presumed, and though it has a definite
leaning towards the distrust of institutional and colonial power that one
would expect, it is not nearly as hard on the British authorities as it
could have been under the circumstances.</P>

<P>Part of the reason for its relatively moderate position is the refusal
of conventional identification. The film primarily follows the events from
the perspective of real-life Northern Ireland MP Ivan Cooper, a civil rights
campaigner. Cooper is followed through the entire process from planning
to aftermath more in the manner of a documentary about his day-to-day activities
than a more conventional character-based historical drama. Scenes of him
organising the demonstration and trying to ensure that the presence of paramilitaries
will not interfere with the peaceful intentions of the Civil Rights Movement
are intercut with the preparations of British forces to contain and control
the march should it become a riot. Though portrayed as insensitive to the
cultural and political subtleties of the situation, by and large the military
characters behave as any soldiers would, responding to a tactical scenario
with the expectation of threat. Larger questions as to whether or not the
Army should have been involved at all are left to the audience to ask, and
the debate will of course continue. At any rate, the sense of matter-of-fact
planning is stronger than any suggestion or presumption of conspiracy, though
the film is not above pointing out failures of foresight on both sides.</P>

<P>The film proceeds with this cutaway and cutback structure throughout,
also taking in the stories of various youths who become involved with the
more militant end of things, and following a number of subsidiary threads
of narrative and characterisation as they are needed. The overriding style
remains observational though, building to a powerful climax with the rioting
and killings and ending with a devastating press conference where a shaken
and shattered Cooper addresses the media and the world with the warning
that everything has changed forever.</P>

<P><I>Bloody Sunday</I> is a powerful piece of work, though it is not without
its slow patches, points of contention, and challenges for casual viewers
without a vested interest in the story. Greengrass has delivered an undoubted
stylistic <I>tour-de-force</I>, and has managed elements such as sound and
cinematography with skill. The seemingly effortless style has obviously
been achieved only as a result of a great deal of co-ordination, and kudos
to him for pulling it off. He is not breaking any cinematic boundaries with
this, mind you. It has been a long time since <I>The Battle of Algiers</I>,
not to mention <I>Z</I>, <I>Medium Cool</I>, or even <I>Salvador</I>. This
does not take away from what he has accomplished in context, but it is necessary
to be aware of the heritage of the style before we can understand the value
of its use in this circumstance. What larger place the film will now take
in the annals of representational and actual history remains to be seen,
but it at least has the benefit of being interesting on more than just the
obvious level.</P>

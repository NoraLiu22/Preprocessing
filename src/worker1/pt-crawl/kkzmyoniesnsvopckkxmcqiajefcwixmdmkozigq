<P>Margaret of Denmark is perhaps the most underrated monarch 
Denmark has ever had.&nbsp; To call Margaret of Denmark the Queen of Denmark, 
Sweden, and Norway is inaccurate because with the exception of Sweden, where she 
was married to Swedish King Haakon VI in 1363, she was only a regent to these 
countries.&nbsp; She in effect, ruled under her son’s name, Olaf, until his 
death at the age of 17 in 1387.&nbsp; Although being a regent to these countries 
her accomplishments were many, first she continued the reconstruction of the 
country, which her father Valdemar IV had stated, she strengthened the 
unification between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and lastly she took an active 
role in shaping Denmark’s future in European politics.&nbsp; With so many 
accomplishments, Margaret is over shadowed by the unfortunate timing of her 
death in Flensburg, Germany on October, 1412.&nbsp; Her death is significant 
because it is listed as unknown; it could have been accidental, natural causes, 
or even murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Margaret’s rule started in 1375, after her Valdemar IV’s 
death in 1375.&nbsp; Her first political act was to install her son as the 
elected king of Denmark in 1375.&nbsp; Having ruled in her father’s name, then 
later in her son’s name, Margaret was granted title of Regent of Norway and 
Denmark in 1380.&nbsp; Although her son died seven years later in 1387, Margaret 
through her superior statesmanship, political power, and sheer likeability, 
remained the ruler of all three nations.&nbsp; As a testament to her great 
political power, Margaret was able to bring the Swedish crown under her rule 
when she convinced the Swedes to expel King Albert in 1386 and elect Margaret’s 
son Olaf to the throne.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Under Margaret’s reign Norway, Denmark, and Sweden all 
enjoyed new levels of political, social, and military peace.&nbsp; Margaret exercised her power to end wars in her 
countries.&nbsp; During her reign Margaret order the destruction of private 
castles, prohibited private warfare, strengthened the royal through using the 
royal court system.&nbsp; Margaret also strengthened relations with the Catholic 
Church by donating large grants of money to the institution after she came to 
power.&nbsp; Margaret could not rule in her own power for long, because of her 
gender, so she appointed her 8 year old nephew, Eric of Pomerania king of 
Norway, Sweden and Denmark in 1389.&nbsp; This was a smart move because picking 
such a young king allowed her to rule in his name until he came of age in 
1401.&nbsp; Despite Eric age, Margaret continued to rule these three countries 
until her own death.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The reforms and social programs which Valdemar IV started in 
the late fourteenth century carried over to prosper during Margaret’s 
reign.&nbsp; Margaret did much to improve Denmark’s social, economic, and 
political standing in Europe.&nbsp; At her death, however, the importance of her 
rule would wear off when Norway and Sweden break away from the crown.&nbsp; 
Sweden would leave the arraignment in 1439 and Norway would leave in 1442 over 
political and social disagreements as well as a weak King, Margaret's son.&nbsp; 
Although Margaret was a very astute ruler, able to get her children elected king 
in three countries, she is often overshadowed in importance in Danish 
history.&nbsp; Furthermore, controversy surrounds her death aboard a ship 
traveling to Flensburg, Germany.&nbsp; Her death could have been of natural 
causes, but that would have been unlikely because she was physically active up 
till her death.&nbsp; Furthermore, much is written about her political career, 
but almost nothing is known about her personal life.&nbsp; The most significant 
controversy surrounding Margaret's life was her death.&nbsp; It is yet to be 
proven that she was not murdered by political enemies or zealots.&nbsp; </P>

<P><B>Birch, J. H. S.&nbsp; <I>Denmark in History.</I>&nbsp; London:&nbsp; 
Butler and Tanner Ltd., 1938.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><BR>Broken into twenty three 
sections, this work, focuses on the the political and social history of Denmark 
from prehistory to the 1920's.&nbsp; Although this book was written in the 
1930's, it still has an amazing amount of literature devoted to the rule of 
Margaret.&nbsp; More than most resources currently available, this work devotes 
much attention to her foreign policy, domestic policy, and her importance as a 
great leader of Denmark.&nbsp; The controversy of how Margaret died is not 
examined in this work, but enough information is written about her to make this 
a good source of information.&nbsp; Although written in the 1930's this remains 
a good source compared to some of the more recent internet sources.&nbsp;

<P><B>Dahmus, Joseph.&nbsp; <I>Seven Medieval Queens.</I>&nbsp; Garden City, New 
York:&nbsp; Doubleday and Company, 1972.<BR></B>This work concentrates on the 
biographers of seven medieval queens.&nbsp; The person who are discussed in this 
short but informative biographies are Theodora a Byzantine Empress, Brunhild a 
Merovingian Queen, Theophano a Queen of Germany, Zoe a Byzantine Empress, 
Eleanor of Aquitaine a Queen of England, Margaret a Queen of Denmark, Norway, 
and Sweden, and Margaret of Anjou a Queen of England.&nbsp; In Margaret's 
biography the author discusses how she came to power, what she accomplished 
during her reign, and what affects she had on her country.&nbsp; In addition to 
this, Dahmus does an in-depth analysis on what the social and political state of 
Denmark both before and after her reign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Lauring, Palle.&nbsp; <I>A History of The Kingdom of Denmark.</I>&nbsp; 
Forlag, Copenhagen:&nbsp; Host and Son, 1960.<BR></B>Concentrating in twelve 
different time periods in the history of Denmark, this work provides powerful 
insight into the formation and growth of the kingdom of Denmark.&nbsp; Like many 
comprehensive history books written about Denmark, Queen Margaret only gets a 
marginal role in history.&nbsp; With about ten pages written about her in the 
entire text, Margaret's role in Denmark's history seems to have been 
limited.&nbsp; What is written about her in this work is important because it 
brings up the challenges she face both during and after her reign.&nbsp; This 
work also stresses that Margaret was never the real queen of Denmark, but rather 
she ruled as regent in her son's name.</P>

son.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

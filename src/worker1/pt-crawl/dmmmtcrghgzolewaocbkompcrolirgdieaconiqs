<h3>Original Editorial Accompanying "Cartoon, No. I"</h3>

<p class="lq">There are many silly, dissatisfied people in this country, who are
continually urging upon Ministers the propriety of considering the wants of the pauper
population, under the impression that it is as laudable to feed men as to shelter
horses.</p>

<p class="lq">To meet the views of such unreasonable people, the Government would have to
put its hand into the money-box. We would ask how the Chancellor of the Exchequer can be
required to commit such an act of folly, knowing, as we do, that the balance of the budget
was triflingly against him, and that he has such righteous and paramount claims upon him
as the Duke of Cumberland's income, the Duchess of Mecklenburg Strelitz's pin-money, and
the builder's little account for the Royal Stables.</p>

<p class="lq">We conceive that the Ministers have adopted the very best means to silence
this unwarrantable outcry. They have considerably determined that as they cannot afford
to give hungry nakedness the <em>substance</em> which it covets, at least it shall have
the <em>shadow</em>.</p>

<p class="lq">The poor ask for bread, and the philanthropy of the State accords —
an exhibition. [22]</p>

<p>The editorial contains a number of contemporary allusions to fiscally irresponsible
public policies, such as Parliament's maintaining a foreign prince — Ernest August,
Duke of Cumberland and fifth son of George the Third — at an annual pension of
twenty-one thousand pounds, and agreeing to Cumberland request that the Government
contribute some two thousand pounds towards the marriage of his twenty-one-year-old
daughter (Princess Augusta of Cambridge) to her elderly first cousin, Friedrich Wilhelm,
later Grand Duke of Mecklenburg Strelitz (1860-1904), at Buckingham Palace on 28 June
1843. [15 July 1843, p. 22]</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p class="one">Published on Saturdays, the only recreational day of the week for the
labouring classes, <span class="book">Punch; or, The London Charivari</span> in the early
1840s under the editorship of dramatist and journalist Mark Lemon was a force for social
change — and critique of government policy. Through editorial comment and the
weekly <span class="drawing">Mr. Punch's Big Cut</span>, inaugurated on 15 July 1843 with
John Leech's <span class="drawing">Cartoon, No. 1 — Substance and Shadow</span>, the
magazine of political and social satire excoriated heartless employers and socially
irresponsible politicians. It was outspoken on issues that even other liberal journals
such as <a href="../../periodicals/iln/intro.html"><span class="book">The Illustrated London
News</span></a> were reluctant to examine, such as the issue of "Teetotalism," which it
advocated in Kenny Meadows' satirical cartoons on the consequences of too much gin and
too little water in the companion pieces <span class="drawing">The Water Drop</span> and
<span class="drawing">The Gin Drop</span> (1843). In its 23 December 1843 issue Lemon
published anonymously the scathing indictment of shoddy labour-management practices,
Thomas Hood's "The Song of the Shirt," in a full-page spread with elaborate Christmas
border. Similar exposes of the dire consequences of unbridled capitalism were cartoons
such as R. J. Hammerton's <a href="../../periodicals/punch/106.html"><span class="drawing">Capital and Labour</span></a>, and others like <span
class="drawing">Cheap Clothing</span> in which the journal's leading cartoonist, John
Leech, highlighted the growth of social and economic inequality in the Great Britain
of the Hungry Forties. The magazine also targetted for reform the Corn Laws, the 1834
Poor Law, and parliamentary reform. In sympathy with the Moral Force Chartists, Lemon
nevertheless savagely satirized those public figures such as Feargus O'Connor who
advocated the use of force to obtain the vote for the disenfranchised. Later it would
champion the cause of the North in the American Civil War and Italian reunification under
the leadership of Garibaldi.</p>

<p>Half of those attending the Westminster Hall Exhibition in Leech's cartoon are street
children. The artist's focal character is the urchin in the cast-off, oversized adult cast-off
coat (left of centre) who is curiously examining a portrait of an aristocratic boy of
about his own age — the "shadow" of the poor boy's "substance." While the urchin
is barefoot, the foppish aristocrat rides a hobbyhorse; while the effeminate boy in the
portrait wears a large, eighteenth-century hat with a decorative plume, the street boy
who anticipates Leech's <a href="../carol/6.html">Ignorance</a> in Dickens's <span
class="book">A Christmas Carol</span> (19 December 1843) has only tousled hair. The
picture, aimed at the middle-class purchaser of <span classclass="book">Punch; or, The
London Charivari</span>, involves the consumer of the illustration seeing him- or herself
as the viewer of the cartoons in the gallery, and therefore identifying himself with the
legion of urban poor in the Hungry Forties.</p>

<p>John Leech's <span class="drawing">Cartoon, No. I — Substance and Shadow"</span>
(15 July 1843) focuses on the reactions of the male and female waifs in the Parliamentary
Picture-Gallery. The anti-establish cartoonist vigorously satirizes the insensitivity of
the British government at the height of the Hungry Forties. Paupers in rags, many of them
disabled and all of them apparently starving, bemusedly inspect the picture-gallery in
Westminster Hall opened by the government so that it could showcase the "high society"
cartoons (large-scale sketches for murals) with which it intended to decorate a foyer in
the reconstructed Parliament Buildings. The commentary on the facing page underscores the
irony of the governmental competition and the crowds who have paid a shilling each to
enter the gallery: "The poor ask for bread, and the philanthropy of the State accords
— an exhibition" (22). The poor, of course, will never have the opportunity,
implies Leech, to scrutinize these paintings since they cannot not possibly afford the
price of admission.</p>

<p>In fact, the exhibition to which the Leech political cartoon alludes was a
government-sponsored competition involving one hundred and fifty painters vying for ten
prizes. Paintings exhibited (unlike the fatuous society compositions in Leech's full-page
graphic satire) had to be on subjects associated with British history, Spenser,
Shakespeare, or Milton. Crowds attending the exhibition from 3 July through 15 July 1843
averaged 1,800 per day, each person paying an entrance fee of a shilling. Even larger
crowds occurred when the entrance fee was waived, but on Saturdays (the only day on which
the working-class might have attended the exhibit) the fee was maintained. Basing his
inset paintings upon pictures that were exhibited at the Royal Academy earlier in 1843,
Leech has omitted serious subjects and shown smaller-scale paintings than were actually
allowed by the rules of competition: "no less than ten and no more than fifteen feet in
their longest dimension," and the figures life-sized. The savage satire involves the halt,
the lame, and the young uncomprehendingly confronting establishmentarian images that 
have little or no meaning for them.</p>

<p>In satirising the meaningless of such "upper crust" art to the common man Leech and
<span class="book">Punch</span> have coined a new term, "cartoon," by changing the
meaning of an existing word, for until this moment in the summer of 1843 a "cartoon"
meant a large-scale line sketch that would be transferred to the plaster on a wall or
ceiling as the initial part of the painting of a fresco mural. After the disastrous fire
of 16 October 1834, the government created the Pictorial Arts Competition to encourage
artists to submit preliminary studies so that a panel of experts could select the
historical and literary subjects for the new murals to decorate the corridors of
<a href="../../../architecture/parliament/eastlake.html">Westminster Hall</a>. Thus,
after the appearance of the series in <span class="book">Punch</span> in 1843, the term
"cartoon" came to imply pictorial satire, and ultimately any sort of humorous drawing.</p>​ 

​<h3>"Substance and Shadow" (15 July 1843): The Predecessor of "Ignorance and Want."</h3>
 
<p class="one">A significant percentage of John Leech's drawings for London periodicals dealt 
with political issues. Like the editors of <span class="book">Punch</span>, Mark Lemon and Henry Mayhew, Leech held 
fairly radical views. Between 1842 and 1845 he produced a series of cartoons such as "Cheap Clothing," and "The Agricultural Question," all of which question the
 morality of the capitalist system. In the cartoon "Substance and Shadow" (15 July 1843), the first
 "cartoon" (a full-page satirical commentary in graphic form that leads off the weekly issue as "Mr. 
Punch's Big Cut") John Leech criticised artists for ignoring social issues such as poverty. It can be compared to Hammerton's "Capital 
and Labour," mentioned above, which pillories the unthinking leisure classes for enjoying the warmth of their coal fires in 
England's damp winter without giving a thought to the sufferings of the miners who made such fires 
and such ease possible.​​</p>​

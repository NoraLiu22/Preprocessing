</span></p>

<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Cycling is more than a sport in <i>Hard Miles</i>,
just as its nearly 800-mile bike trek from Colorado to the Grand Canyon is more
than a sightseeing tour. Co-writer/director RJ Daniel Hanna's movie wears its
metaphors and parallels on its sleeve but never really gets at the human story
beneath them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">It definitely doesn't in terms of the
characters who matter. They're a quartet of students—or inmates, depending on
whom one asks—at a correctional school. Basically, they're teenagers who have
committed and been convicted of some kind of crime but are given a second chance
to prove being reformed without being sent to a juvenile prison. We get the
basics about the personalities and backgrounds of the four teens who decide to
make that lengthy bicycle ride, but it's obvious that Hanna and co-screenwriter
Christian Sander mainly see them as the means to the movie's feel-good ends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The real protagonist here is Greg Townsend
(Matthew Modine), the shop teacher at the school and an amateur cyclist. He's a
man who rides for exercise, since he has health problems involving his ligaments
and heart, and to clear his mind of the remnants of a terrible childhood. His
father, currently in hospice care at a facility near the route, didn't want his
son to appear &quot;weak,&quot; and in the process of forcing a young Greg to
participate in a strict exercise regiment, he was more directly abusive, too. As
an adult, Greg won't talk about it with anyone, and despite repeated calls from
his incarcerated brother, he has no plans of visiting his dying father, either.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The story sets up all of this and hints at the
teacher having a more direct connection to his students than they think
possible, but it's really about the bike ride. Initially, Greg has his shop
class—made up of Smink (Jackson Kelly), Woolbright (Jahking Guillory), Atencio
(Damien Diaz), and Rice (Zachary T. Robbins), who are only referred to by their
surnames in an impersonal touch—build their own bikes. He wants to teach them
something about hard work paying off with a tangible thing that's theirs and
only theirs, and some lessons about the makeup and particular roles of a riding
team come in handy quickly, too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">The school is in financial trouble, having to
do with state funding being redirected toward a more incarceration-focused
model, so the principal (played by Leslie David Baker) asks Greg to take a group
of students on a camping trip that will look good to the government and other
potential donors. Since Greg already had his bike ride planned and the four
teens understand some basics of riding, he suggests the students, as well as the
school's social worker Haddie (Cynthia Kaye McWilliams), tag along on his ride.
That way, they'll learn more important lessons about working hard, pushing
beyond one's real or perceived limitations, and life in general.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">On the surface, the movie gives us exactly what
it promises: an inspirational sports story about the grueling activity and
satisfying rewards of getting on a bike and riding to a set destination. As
such, there are training and riding montages, as the filmmakers follow the
ragtag team of cyclists through cities and small towns, up and down mountainous
roads, and across grand stretches of desert highway. They have to deal with the
heat, exhaustion, and some in-fighting, since most of the members of the group
are trying to prove how tough they are to the others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">Mostly, though, all of this is an excuse for
Greg to repeatedly vocalize the story's assorted points about the importance of
hard work, having a goal, working together as a team, using frustration and
anger in beneficially productive way, and not letting assorted obstacles get in
the way of goal. We expect the coaches in movies such as this to have a Big
Speech or two, summarizing every lesson that has been or needs to be learned, at
some point or points in this kind of story. The majority of Greg's dialogue
feels as if it's made up of supportive clichés or just part of an extended,
drawn-out monologue about the movie's lessons. Modine comes across as
down-to-earth enough that the realization takes some time, but regardless,
that's his character's primary characteristic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Cambria" size="3">That leaves the teens to bicker, gradually
figure out how to more or less work together, and vaguely offer some personal
history that lets us know how they ended up in the school and what struggles
they're facing. Smink, for example, is dealing with an eating disorder, while
Atencio became caught up in gang activity through a cousin. Woolbright's the one
holdout for taking riding seriously, leading to the one scene that comes closet
to the teacher and one of his students having a connection that goes deeper than
the superficial elements of cycling as a practice and a metaphor.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Cambria" size="3">Hard Miles</font></i><font face="Cambria" size="3">
sticks to the broad strokes of its characters and story. For something like this
to be genuinely inspiring, it has to get at something more specific about both
of those elements.</font>

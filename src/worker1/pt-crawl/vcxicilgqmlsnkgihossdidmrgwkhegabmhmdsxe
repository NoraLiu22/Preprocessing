When the controlled system consists  of texts in some language <i>L</i>, the language used to make their  representations in the controlling system -- let it be <i>L'</i> --  is referred to as a <em>metalanguage</em>. Creation of a metalanguage  is a <a href="MST.html">metasystem transition</a> (MST), in which we ignore  the controlling subsystem by abstraction. However, control is  still there when the languages are used. Typically, it is a human  being, both on the level of <i>L</i> and <i>L'</i>.  The <i>L'</i> person uses the rules expressed in <i>L'</i>, in order to guide and correct the manipulation of texts in <i>L</i> by the <i>L</i> person.<p>An example: algebraic notation is a metalanguage <i>L'</i> with respect to the language <i>L</i> of arithmetic. <i>L</i> includes a notation of numbers and the four arithmetic operations which can be executed by the <i>L</i> person. Representation of numbers in <i>L'</i> is the same as in <i>L</i>, but <i>L'</i> also includes  letters as many-to-one representation of unspecified numbers. The algebraic person <i>L'</i> can do more than the arithmetic person <i>L</i>: he manipulates algebraic formulas and, in particular, knows how to solve equations. High school algebra is a <em>metatheory</em> with respect to arithmetic. But it is not the top of the hierarchy. Modern algebra is a metatheory with respect to high school algebra,  as well as with respect to many other theories. For example, consider the following 3-level hierarchy. On the ground level (level 0) we have a finite set of symbols and strings of (this is comparable with countable objects of arithmetic). On the next level (control level 1) there is a device that performs various operations on strings: concatenation, permutation, etc. (compare it to arithmetic operations). Then on the level 2 we put group theory (which is a part of modern  algebra) in its application to permutations  on the level 1.<p>Apparently, David Hilbert was the first to use the prefix <em> meta</em> (from the Greek <em> over</em>) in the sense we use it in <em> metalanguage</em>, <em>metatheory</em>,  and now <em>metasystem</em>. He introduced the term <em>metamathematics</em> to denote a mathematical theory of mathematical proof. In terms of our control scheme, Hilbert's MST has a non-trivial representation: a mapping of proofs in the form of usual mathematical texts (in a natural language with formulas) on the set of texts in a formal logical language which makes it possible to treat proofs as precisely defined mathematical objects. This done, the rest is  as usual: the controlled system is a mathematician who proves theorems;  the controlling person is a metamathematician who translates texts into the formal logical language and controls the work of the mathematician by checking the validity of his proofs and,  possibly mechanically generating proofs in a computer. The emergence of the metamathematician is an MST.<p>We create a metalanguage and a metatheory in order to describe and examine some class of languages and theories. A metatheory <b>M</b> includes a <em>representation</em> of the examined theory <b>T</b>, and it can be seen as the <em>perception</em> in a control system where <b>T</b> is controlled by <b>M</b>.The result of the examination of the theories like <b>T</b> would, typically,be classification, modification and creation anew of the theories from the class to which <b>T</b> belongs. This is the action part of the control relation between <b>T</b> and <b>M</b>. This part, though, does notenter the meaning of the terms `metalanguage' and `metatheory': it may be absent. Hence we deal here with the case of a control system devoid of action.<p></nodetxt><p><p><p><HR WIDTH=420><font size=-1><a href="/COPYR.html">Copyright&copy; 1999 Principia Cybernetica</a> - <a href="REFERPCP.html">Referencing this page</a></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=140 BGCOLOR=DED6A5><TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=15 BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR=FFF5CB><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>      <BR>   <B> <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>Author</FONT></B><br>  <FONT SIZE=-1> <author>V. <a rev=made href="TURCHIN.html">Turchin</a>, </author></FONT><p>   <B> <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>Date</FONT></B>   <BR><FONT SIZE=-1><update>Jul 19, 1999</update> (modified)<br><create>Oct 21, 1996</create> (created)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>   <TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=0><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>      <CENTER>   <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF " SIZE=-1>    <a href=/DEFAULT.html>Home</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><FONT SIZE=-1><a href=/MSTT.html>Metasystem Transition Theory</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><a href=/CYBERN.html>Cybernetics</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><a href=/CONTROL.html>Control</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><parent><a href=/SPECCTRL.html>Special Cases of Control</a> / <a href=/MST.html>The Metasystem Transition</a></parent></FONT>      </FONT>      <P><B>    <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>     Up      <BR>      <A HREF="/SPECCTRL.html">Prev.</A>      <img src="/Images/4arrows.gif" width="37" height="36" align="middle">      <a HREF="/HARMOSCL.html">Next</A>      <BR>   Down   </FONT>   </B>       </CENTER><HR><P>     <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>      </FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=140 BGCOLOR=DED6A5>   <CENTER><P><HR align="left" noshade><a href="/MAKANNOT.html">Discussion</a><HR></CENTER>              <FONT SIZE=-1>   <P>   </FONT>   <CENTER>   <P><FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"><a TARGET=_blank href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/hypercard.acgi$annotform?">Add comment...</a></FONT><p>         <img src="/Images/space.gif" width="7" height="7" align="middle">   </CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 41 http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be:80/METALARE.html responseCode 3 200

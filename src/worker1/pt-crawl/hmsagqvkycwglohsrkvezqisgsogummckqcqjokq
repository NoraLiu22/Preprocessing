When he had defeated the enemy by his gallant conduct, he went into the assembly and gave an account of his achievements as general: the expenses of the war, the times, arms, horses and ships.  After great praise had been bestowed on him for all of this, he removed his armour, and advanced unarmed into the midst of them.  "Thus unarmed," he said, "I present myself to you, so that, if I have ever injured or oppressed any individual amongst you, I may now feel the just resentment of your weapons."  He was answered by the applause of all present, who acclaimed him as the most gallant, the best of all generals.  To this he replied, "Then for the future, always take care to choose a similar leader."  But they answered, "We do not have any other such leader."  He was therefore elected general for a second time; which paved the way for him to become tyrant of the Syracusans.

Instead he put his own clothes on Pediarchus, who was commander of the archers, and very much resembled him in appearance, and ordered Pediarchus to march out of the camp in order to attend a sacrifice on the altars.  The band of archers followed him, dressed in white clothes, and carrying myrtle branches in their hands, but with bows secretly concealed under them.  They had been ordered to use the bows against Himilco, as soon as they saw him advancing to sacrifice in a similar manner.  When Himilco, not suspecting any trickery, came forward to make a sacrifice, a shower of arrows suddenly cut him down, while he was performing the ceremonies and offering libations.

At the same time, he imposed an enormous fine on Diognetus, the ruler of Megara.  When Diognetus attempted to raise the money for the fine from his citizens, they refused and joined the colonists at Syracuse, submitting to the power of Gelon.

</FONT><P> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../greek/polyaenus1B.html#28.1"> G</A> &nbsp; Theron, in a battle against the Carthaginians, put the enemy to flight.  But the Sicilians immediately fell to plundering the tents in the enemy's camp, and while they were thus distracted, they were overwhelmed by the Iberians, who had come to the assistance of the Carthaginians.  Theron, perceiving the carnage that was likely to follow, dispatched a body of men to wheel behind the camp and set fire to the farthest tents.  The enemy, who had lost their tents and now saw the camp on fire, hurried back to their ships; but the Sicilians pursued them closely, and killed most of them before they could board the ships.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="28.2">2</A> &nbsp; <FONT SIZE="+1">Theron, the son of Miltiades.
</FONT><P> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../greek/polyaenus1B.html#28.1"> G</A> &nbsp; The inhabitants of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/selinus.html#1">Selinus</A> had been defeated by the Carthaginians, and the battlefield was covered with their dead.  The enemy pursued them so closely, that they did not dare to return to bury the dead, but they were appalled to leave them neglected and unburied.  In this emergency, Theron promised that, if they would provide him with three hundred servants who could cut wood, he would march out with them, burn the dead and erect a tomb for them.  "If we fail in our attempt," he continued, "and fall victim to the enemy, the city will not suffer much from the death of one citizen, and three hundred slaves."  The inhabitants of Selinus agreed to his proposal, and allowed him to choose the slaves whom he wanted.  Accordingly, he chose those whom he judged to be to most active and sturdy, and led them forth, armed with bill-hooks, hatchets, and axes, under pretence of cutting wood for the funeral pyre.  But after they had advanced a little distance from the city, Theron persuaded them to revolt against their masters, and late in the evening marched them back to the city.  When they made themselves known to the guards, they were readily admitted, but as soon as they had entered, he cut down the guards.  Then, having slain in their beds those citizens who were most likely to thwart his designs, he seized the city and made himself tyrant of Selinus.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="29.1">[29]</A> &nbsp; <FONT SIZE="+1"><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hieron.html#1">Hieron</A>.
</FONT><P> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../greek/polyaenus1B.html#29.1"> G</A> &nbsp; When the enemy prepared to dispute his passage over a river, Hieron posted his <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplites">hoplites</A> at the place where he intended to ford it; and ordered the cavalry and light infantry to advance further up, under pretence of crossing it at another point.  When the enemy observed this, they similarly marched their troops further up, in order to thwart his supposed intention.  Meanwhile Hieron effected a crossing with his <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplites">hoplites</A>, easily overwhelming the small force which the enemy had left to oppose them.  As soon as he had crossed to the other side, he raised a signal to the cavalry and light infantry, who immediately returned and crossed the river at the first point, where Hieron and his <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplites">hoplites</A> were able to  repel the enemy's attacks.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="29.2">2</A> &nbsp; Whenever Hieron, during his wars with the Italians, took any prisoners who were particularly eminent or wealthy, he would not permit them to be immediately ransomed, but always retained them for some time with him, treating them politely and with every mark of honour.  Afterwards, when he had received a ransom, he would courteously dismiss them.  As a result of these clear signs of favour, they were suspected from that time onwards of secretly supporting the cause of Hieron.

</FONT><P> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../greek/polyaenus1B.html#30.1"> G</A> &nbsp; The Athenians were disheartened by receiving the following oracle:
<BR> &nbsp; <I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/salamis.html#1">Salamis</A> divine, you will cause the death of many women's children.</I>
<BR> But Themistocles cleverly interpreted it as referring to their enemies.  "The oracle," he said, "could never refer to Salamis as divine, if it were to prove the cause of destruction to the youth of Greece."  This explanation revived the courage and resolution of the Athenians, and their victory proved its veracity.  [<I>see also:</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+7.142.1">Herodotus, 7.142-143</A>]


<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="30.2">2</A> &nbsp; The people were convinced by Themistocles' explanation of another, equally obscure oracle:
<BR> &nbsp; <I><A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/z/zeus.html#1">Zeus</A> will give a wall of wood to Tritogeneia.</I>
<BR> When most of the Athenians thought they had been instructed to fortify their towers, Themistocles told them to man their <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme">triremes</A>.  "For these," he said, "O Athenians, are your wooden walls."  His words had their effect.   The Athenians embarked, engaged with the enemy, and overcame them.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="30.3">3</A> &nbsp; While the fleet was stationed near Salamis, the Greeks were almost unanimous in favour of retreating, but Themistocles urged them to stay and risk a battle in the narrow seas.  As he was unable to convince them, he secretly sent Sicinnus, a eunuch who was tutor to his sons, by night to inform the king that the Greek intended to withdraw; "but", he added, "you should pre-empt them by forcing a battle."  The king followed the eunuch's advice, and attacked the Greek fleet; but the narrowness of the strait rendered the vast number of his ships a hindrance, rather than a help to him.  Thus by a clever stratagem of their commander, the Greeks obtained a victory, even against their own inclinations.  [<I>see also:</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+8.75.1">Herodotus, 8.75</A>]

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="30.4">4</A> &nbsp; The Greeks, after their victory at Salamis, decided to sail to the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hellespont.html#1">Hellespont</A>, in order to destroy the bridge, and cut off the king's retreat.  Themistocles opposed this plan, saying that if the king was prevented from retreating, he would be forced to renew the battle; and despair is often found to effect what courage has failed to achieve.  Therefore he sent Arsaces, another eunuch, to inform the king that unless he retreated quickly, he would find that the bridge over the Hellespont had been demolished.   Alarmed at this information, the king promptly marched to the Hellespont, and crossed the bridge before the Greeks could carry out their plan.  In this way Themistocles allowed the Greeks to enjoy their victory, without risking a second battle.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="30.5">5</A> &nbsp; When the Athenians first began to fortify their city with walls, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/laconia.html#1">Laconians</A> were greatly annoyed, but Themistocles found a means to deceive them by a clever stratagem.  He was sent as an envoy to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/sparta.html#1">Sparta</A>, and there he confidently denied that the walls were being constructed.  "But," he added, "if you are not convinced by my words, send your best men to find out the truth, and in the meantime keep me here as your prisoner."  The Spartans agreed to do this; but Themistocles secretly sent a messenger to the Athenians, with strict instructions to detain any investigators who came to Athens, while the walls were being constructed; and after that, not to allow them to depart until the Spartans had released him.  Accordingly, the walls were completed; Themistocles then returned home, the investigators were released, and Athens was fortified, against the will of the Lacedaemonians.

If the people were satisfied with the way that the money was spent, then it should be reckoned as coming out of the public account; but if not, then the contributions should be returned to the city.  This proposal was accepted; and the hundred citizens without delay each fitted out a splendid <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme">trireme</A>.

This message caused the king to distrust the loyalty of the Ionians.  [<I>see also:</I> <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+8.22.1">Herodotus, 8.22</A>]

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="30.8">8</A> &nbsp; Themistocles, when he was escaping from the resentment of the Athenians, embarked for Ionia, without making himself known to the master of the ship.  But the vessel was forced by a storm to <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/n/naxos.html#1">Naxos</A>, which was at that time being attacked by the Athenians.  Themistocles in alarm went to the master, and revealed who he was.  At the same time, he threatened that, if the master allowed him to be captured, he would accuse him to the Athenians of having been bribed to transport him to Ionia.  For the common safety of both of them, he therefore proposed that no-one should be permitted to set foot on shore.  Terrified by these menaces, the master insisted that everyone remained on board; and put out again to sea as quickly as was possible.

</FONT><P> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../greek/polyaenus1B.html#31.1"> G</A> &nbsp; Aristeides and Themistocles, who were inveterate enemies, were at the head of opposing factions in the state; but when the Persians marched against the Athenians, they went out of the city together, and grasping each other's hand, announced, "Here we leave our former disputes, and lay aside our mutual animosity, until we have put an end to the war in which we are engaged against Persia."  After this solemn declaration, loosing their hands, they filled up the ditch nearby, as if they had buried their enmity there; and they continued to co-operate throughout the whole course of the war.  This harmony in the conduct of the generals did great damage to the enemy, and secured the victory for themselves.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="32.2">2</A> &nbsp; Shortly before a battle, Leonidas noticed that the clouds looked thick and lowering.  He turned about to his officers, and told them not to be surprised at the thunder and lightning, which he observed from the appearance of the sky must be expected very soon.  The army of Leonidas, thus forewarned of the phenomenon before it occurred, advanced confidently to battle.  But the enemy, terrified and dispirited by the menaces of the elements, were easily defeated.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="32.3">3</A> &nbsp; Leonidas, who had made a raid into the enemy's territory, dispatched small groups in different directions, with orders, upon a given signal, to fell trees and set fire to the villages. At sight of this, those who were in the city imagined that the enemy's forces were much more numerous than they really were, and did not venture out to confront them, but allowed them to carry off the spoil unmolested.

He pretended that a dispatch had arrived, with information of a victory obtained by the Greeks over the Persians at <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/plataea.html#1">Plataea</A>.

The Cyprians, deceived by the barbarian clothes, readily received the fleet as friends and allies.

He assigned the captives, stripped of their possessions, to be one part of the spoils; the other was made up of trousers, cloaks, bracelets and other such things. The allies then chose to take the ornaments, and the Athenians contented themselves with the naked captives.  Cimon was ridiculed for having made, as was thought, so unequal a division, and allowing the allies to choose much the better portion.

After he had led them for a short time in the charge, he suddenly advanced to the right wing, calling out, "We are victorious in the left."  When they heard the word "victorious", the Athenian took fresh courage, and charged the enemy with redoubled fury.

In his public speeches, he severely reprimanded the plotters, but promised the citizens that he would strive to secure their liberty, and to protect them in it.  The people, not doubting his sincerity, readily accepted his offers, and put themselves under his protection.  Then, at a given signal, his friends fell upon the unsuspecting citizens, who were unprepared for such an attack; and after the leaders of the opposition had been slain, they established themselves as rulers of Miletus.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="45.2">2</A> &nbsp; At <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/aegospotami.html#1">Aegospotami</A> the Athenians several times put out to sea, and bearing down upon the enemy offered them battle, which Lysander the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/l/laconia.html#1">Laconian</A> always declined; whereupon they returned to their camp, exulting in their success and singing <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paean#Ancient_Greek_Paean">paeans</A>.  Lysander at last sent two <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme">triremes</A> to observe them; and their captains, as soon as they observed the enemy landing, hoisted a brazen shield as a signal to Lysander, who immediately advanced with the rest of the fleet.  The Laconians rowed across as fast as possible, and reached the Athenians just after their forces had been landed.  Some of the Athenians had gone to rest, while others were employed, some on one task and some on another.  Then the Lacedaemonians suddenly attacked them, and as a regular force against a confused rabble, obtained an easy victory.  They captured the whole fleet, both men and <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme">triremes</A>, except only the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/paralus.html#1">Paralus</A>, which escaped to carry the news of the defeat to Athens.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="45.4">4</A> &nbsp; After Lysander had seized control of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thasos.html#1">Thasos</A>, knowing that many of the citizens, who supported the Athenians, had concealed themselves through fear of the Laconian, he assembled the Thasians in the temple of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/heracles.html#1">Heracles</A>.  There, in a gracious and conciliating speech, he indicated to them how readily he forgave all those who might have concealed themselves as a result of this revolution in the state; and hoped that they would dismiss all fear of his resentment.  The Thasians trusted in the assurance he gave them, in so sacred a place as the temple, and that too in the city of his ancestor Heracles.  Those, who had before concealed themselves, began to venture out and appear in public.  But Lysander, after forbearing two or three days to take any notice of them, so that they might become less cautious, suddenly ordered them to be seized and executed.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="45.5">5</A> &nbsp; When the Lacedaemonians and their allies were debating, whether they should entirely destroy the city of Athens, Lysander urged many arguments against doing so.   He particularly emphasised that <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/t/thebes.html#1">Thebes</A>, which was a neighbouring state, would thereby be rendered more powerful, and a more formidable enemy to Sparta.  Whereas, if they could preserve the loyalty of Athens, under the government of tyrants, they might watch over the actions of the Thebans from nearby, and keep them from growing too great.  Lysander's advice was approved, and they were prevailed upon to give up the plan of destroying Athens.

Agis gave orders that the oxen should be kept from feeding for one whole day; and to conceal from the enemy their distress, he sent some deserters to inform them, that the next day large reinforcements were expected in the Laconian camp.  Throughout the day the mouths of the cattle were kept muzzled; and they were loosed as soon as night came on.  The hungry oxen, when they thus set free and turned loose into the pastures, leaped about and bellowed, raising a terrible noise, which the cavities between the hills increased yet more.  Agis ordered the soldiers at the same time to spread around, and kindle several fires.  The Peloponnesians, alarmed at the bellowing of the oxen and the shouting, as well as by the fires that they observed, assumed that the enemy had been strongly reinforced.  They immediately struck camp, and fled away.

</FONT><P> <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="../greek/polyaenus1B.html#48.1"> G</A> &nbsp; Conon, who was in danger of being abandoned by his allies, dispatched a deserter to the enemy, with information of their intended retreat, of the time when they intended to depart, and of their route.  The enemy took measures accordingly, and placed an ambush to intercept them.  Conon then told the allied army that he had received intelligence, that an ambush had been planted to intercept them; but he was happy to be able to inform them, so that they might be on their guard, and thus make their retreat more safely.  The allies took his advice, and discovered the ambush; then, won over by his generosity, they returned to the camp, and remained with him until he had put a successful end to the war.

His ships immediately stood to, and forming a line, furiously attacked the Lacedaemonian fleet.  The enemy were thrown into confusion by this sudden about-turn, and most of their ships were either damaged or sunk.  Thus Conon obtained a complete victory.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="48.4">4</A> &nbsp; Conon, when he was blocked up in Mytilene by the Lacedaemonians, wished to inform the Athenians of the situation, but realised that it was difficult to do so without being intercepted.  Therefore he manned two of his swiftest sailing ships with able seamen, and after providing them with everything necessary, he ordered them to lie still until evening.  As soon as day closed, he observed that the guards were straggling around the shore, and employed in various tasks: some dressing their wounds, some piling up wood, and others lighting fires.  Then he ordered the ships to set sail, and to steer on different courses, so that if one was captured, the other might escape.  The ships both arrived safely, because the enemy were too preoccupied to pursue them in time.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="48.5">5</A> &nbsp; Just before a naval battle, Conon, who had been informed by a deserter that a picked detachment of the enemy's fleet intended, as their principal aim, to capture the ship in which he sailed, fitted out a <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme">trireme</A> exactly like his own, and dressed the captain in an admiral's uniform.  He ordered the ship to take its position on the right wing, and also commanded that the whole fleet should receive their signals from it.  When the enemy observed this, they formed a line of their best ships, and immediately advanced against the supposed flagship.  But Conon, vigorously attacking them with the rest of his fleet, sank some of the ships, and put the rest to flight.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="49.2">2</A> &nbsp; As the enemy kept on harassing his rear, Xenophon formed his little army into two lines, placing his baggage in a hollow square in the middle.

<P><A CLASS="ref" NAME="49.3">3</A> &nbsp; Xenophon observed that the barbarians had occupied a narrow defile, through which he had to march.  Looking around from a high mountain with a wide view of the countryside, he spotted a hill, that was accessible, but defended by a group of the enemy.  He took a detachment, which he judged sufficient for the purpose, and led them towards the hill.  After dislodging the forces who were posted there, he showed himself to the enemy below.  When they saw the advantageous position of the Greeks, they took to flight; and thus provided a safe way through for the Greek army.

Xenophon selected a thousand men, whom he sent to ford the river a little upstream, while he himself, to distract the attention of the enemy, made a feint as if to cross it directly opposite their forces.  When the detachment reached the opposite side of the river, they attacked the enemy from above and inflicted many casualties, so that Xenophon was able to cross over safely with the remaining part of his army.

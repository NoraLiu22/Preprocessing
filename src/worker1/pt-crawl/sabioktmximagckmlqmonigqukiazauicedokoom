<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> The Parthians, being forced to quit Scythia by discord at home, gradually settled in the deserts betwixt <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcania.html#1">Hyrcania</A>, the Dahae, the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arei.html#1">Arei</A>, the Sparni and <A CLASS="help" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margu">Margiani</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> They then advanced their borders, though their neighbours, who at first made no opposition, at length endeavoured to prevent them, to such an extent, that they not only got possession of the vast level plains, but also of steep hills, and heights of the mountains; <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> and hence it is that an excess of heat or cold prevails in most parts of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/parthia.html#1">Parthian</A> territories; since the snow is troublesome on the higher grounds, and the heat in the plains.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="41.2">[41.2]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte41.html#2"> L</A>&nbsp;</A>  The government of the nation, after their revolt from the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/macedonia.html#1">Macedonian</A> power, was in the hands of kings. <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> Next to the royal authority is the order of the people, from which they take generals in war and magistrates in peace. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> Their language is something between those of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythians</A> and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/m/media.html#1">Medes</A>, being a compound of both. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> Their dress was formerly of a fashion peculiar to themselves; afterwards, when their power had increased, it was like that of the Medes, light and full flowing. The fashion of their arms is that of their own country and of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/s/scythia.html#1">Scythia</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> They have an army, not like other nations, of free men, but chiefly consisting of slaves, the numbers of whom daily increase, the power of manumission being allowed to none, and all their offspring, in consequence, being born slaves. These bondmen they bring up as carefully as their own children, and teach them, with great pains, the arts of riding and shooting with the bow. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> As any one is eminent in wealth, so he furnishes the king with a proportionate number of horsemen for war. Indeed when fifty thousand cavalry encountered <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/antonius.html#12">Antonius</A>, as he was making war upon <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/parthia.html#1">Parthia</A>, only four hundred of them were free men.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> Of engaging with the enemy in close fight, and of taking cities by siege, they know nothing. They fight on horseback, either galloping forward or turning their backs. Often, too, they counterfeit flight, that they may throw their pursuers off their guard against being wounded by their arrows. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> The signal for battle among them is given, not by trumpet, but by drum. Nor are they able to fight long: but they would be irresistible, if their vigour and perseverance were equal to the fury of their onset. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> In general they retire before the enemy in the very heat of the engagement, and, soon after their retreat, return to the battle afresh; so that, when you feel most certain that you have conquered them, you have still to meet the greatest danger from them. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> Their armour, and that of their horses, is formed of plates, lapping over one another like the feathers of a bird, and covers both man and horse entirely. Of gold and silver, except for adorning their arms, they make no use.

<P> <A CLASS="ref" NAME="41.3">[41.3]</A> &nbsp; <A CLASS="Latin" HREF="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte41.html#3"> L</A>&nbsp;</A>  Each man has several wives, for the sake of gratifying desire with different objects. They punish no crime more severely than adultery, <FONT CLASS="verse">2</FONT> and accordingly they not only exclude their women from entertainments, but forbid them the very sight of men. <FONT CLASS="verse">3</FONT> They eat no flesh but that which they take in hunting. <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> They ride on horseback on all occasions; on horses they go to war, and to feasts; on horses they discharge public and private duties; on horses they go abroad, meet together, traffic, and converse. Indeed the difference between slaves and freemen is, that slaves go on foot, but freemen only on horseback. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> They dispose of bodies by leaving them to be torn apart by birds or dogs; the bare bones they at last bury in the ground.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> In their superstitions and worship of the gods, the principal veneration is paid to rivers. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> The disposition of the people is proud, quarrelsome, faithless, and insolent; for a certain roughness of behaviour they think becoming to men, and gentleness only to women. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> They are always restless, and ready for any commotion, at home or abroad; taciturn by nature; more ready to act than speak, and consequently shrouding both their successes and failures in silence. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> They obey their princes, not from humility, but from fear. They are libidinous, but frugal in diet. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> To their word or promise they have no regard, except as far as suits their interest.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> At the same period, also, <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/diodotus.html#1">Theodotus</A>, governor of the thousand cities of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/bactria.html#1">Bactria</A>, revolted, and assumed the title of king; and all the other people of the east, influenced by his example, fell away from the Macedonians. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> One <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/arsaces.html#1">Arsaces</A>, a man of uncertain origin, but of undisputed bravery, happened to arise at this time; <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> and he, who was accustomed to live by plunder and depredations, hearing a report that Seleucus was overcome by the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/g/galatia.html#1">Gauls</A> in <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/a/asia.html#1">Asia</A>, and being consequently freed from dread of that prince, invaded Parthia with a band of marauders, overthrew Andragoras the governor, and, after putting him to death, took upon himself the government of the country. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Not long after, too, he made himself master of <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/h/hyrcania.html#1">Hyrcania</A>, and thus, invested with authority over two nations, raised a large army, through fear of Seleucus and Theodotus, king of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/b/bactria.html#1">Bactrians</A>. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> But being soon relieved of his fears by the death of Theodotus, he made peace and an alliance with his son, who was also named <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/d/diodotus.html#2">Theodotus</A>; and not long after, engaging with king Seleucus, who came to take vengeance on the rebels, he obtained a victory; <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> and the Parthians observe the day on which it was gained with great solemnity, as the date of the commencement of their liberty.

<P> <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> The Phocaeans, compelled by the smallness and infertility of their territory, had applied themselves more to the sea than to the culture of the ground, supporting themselves by fishing, merchandise, and above all by piracy, which in those days was thought an honourable occupation. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Venturing accordingly to visit the remotest shores of the ocean, they came into the gulf of Gaul and to the mouth of the river <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/r/rhone.html#1">Rhone</A>; <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> and, charmed with the pleasantness of the country, and relating, on their return home, what they had seen, they tempted others to go to the same parts. <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> Of the fleet Simos and Protis were the captains, who applied to the king of the Segobrigii, named Nannus, in whose territory they were anxious to build a city, desiring his friendship. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> On that day, as it happened, the king was engaged in preparing for the nuptials of his daughter Gyptis, whom, after the custom of that people, he intended to give in marriage to a son-in-law to be chosen at the feast. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> The suitors having been all invited to the wedding, the Greek visitors were also requested to join the festival. <FONT CLASS="verse">11</FONT> The maiden was then introduced, and being desired by her father to give water to him whom she chose for her husband, she overlooked all the rest, and turning to the Greeks, held out water to Protis, who, from the king's guest becoming his son-in-law, was presented by his father-in-law with the ground for building a city. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> Massilia was accordingly built near the mouth of the river Rhone, in a remote bay, and as it were in a corner of the sea. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> The Ligurians, jealous of the growing greatness of the city, harassed the Greeks with continual war; but they, repelling their attacks, rose to such a degree of strength, that they conquered their enemies and planted several colonies in the lands which they captured.

It is smaller than either of these countries, but more fruitful than either; <FONT CLASS="verse">4</FONT> for it is neither scorched, like Africa, by a burning sun, nor disturbed, like Gaul, by incessant winds, but, being situated betwixt both, it is rendered, by moderate heat on the one hand, and genial and seasonable showers on the other, fertile in all kinds of fruits of the earth, so that it supplies abundance of everything, not only for its own inhabitants, but for Italy and the city of Rome. <FONT CLASS="verse">5</FONT> From hence, indeed, comes not only great plenty of corn, but of wine, honey, and oil. Its iron is excellent, and its breed of horses swift. <FONT CLASS="verse">6</FONT> Not only is the produce of the surface to be admired, but the abundant riches of the metals hidden beneath it. There is great plenty, too, of flax and hemp, and certainly no country is more productive of vermilion. <FONT CLASS="verse">7</FONT> The courses of the rivers are not violent and rapid, so as to be hurtful, but gentle, watering the vineyards and the plains; they are also well stocked with fish from the estuaries of the sea, and most of them are rich in gold, which they carry down with their waters.  <FONT CLASS="verse">8</FONT> It is joined to Gaul by one unbroken ridge of the Pyrenees; on every other side it is surrounded by sea. <FONT CLASS="verse">9</FONT> The shape of the country is almost square, except that it grows narrower towards the Pyrenees, the shores contracting in that quarter. The length of the Pyrenees is six hundred miles. <FONT CLASS="verse">10</FONT> The salubrity of the air is the same through the whole of Spain, for its atmosphere is infected with no unwholesome mists from fens. Besides, there are constant breezes from the sea on every side, by which, as they penetrate the whole country, the exhalations from the earth are dispersed, and the greatest health is secured to the inhabitants.

He united the barbarous people by laws; he was the first that taught them to break oxen for the plough, and to raise corn from tillage; and he obliged them, instead of food procured from the wilds, to adopt a better diet, perhaps through dislike of what he had eaten in his childhood. <FONT CLASS="verse">12</FONT> The adventures of this prince might seem fabulous, were not the founders of Rome said to have been suckled by a wolf, and <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/c/cyrus.html#1">Cyrus</A>, king of the <A CLASS="help" HREF="../names/p/persia.html#1">Persians</A>, to have been brought up by a dog. <FONT CLASS="verse">13</FONT> He ordered that the people should not carry out servile duties, and he divided the population among seven cities. <FONT CLASS="verse">14</FONT> After Habis was dead, the sovereignty was retained for many generations by his successors.

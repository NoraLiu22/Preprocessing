<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p class="one">Like the illustrators of the Household Edition, Sol Eytinge, Jr., was
composing within a pictorial tradition established by Dickens and his original graphic
artists, so that, for example, in drawing "Want and Ignorance" in <span class="book">A
Christmas Carol in Prose: being a Ghost Story of Christmas</span> he did not have an
entirely free hand since even many of his American readers in the Christmas season of
1868 would have been thoroughly aware of Leech's 1843 small but radical woodcut
<a href="../carol/6.html">"Ignorance and Want"</a>. Since Dickens's prophetic Christmas
Present warns mankind about the graver dangers represented by the shivering, ragged,
diminutive, pock-marked male figure, Ignorance in Leech's illustration —

<p class="lq">Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy,
for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. [Stave
3]</p>

<p>— Eytinge has chosen to reverse the order of their names in the title and render
them squatting rather than standing, for their power drives humanity to the condition of
animals. Leech's  figures, though ill-clad, are markedly human, and the girl even seems 
to turn towards her ill-clothed brother in concern; in contrast, Eytinge's quasi-naked, 
dark figures, who have qualities of "The Boy" in Dickens's last Christmas Book, <span 
class="book">The Haunted Man</span> (1848), more closely realize Dickens's description of
these factory children as cowed animals rather than embryonic adult human beings: 
"meager, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility." Whereas Leech's 
Spirit of Christmas Present reprovingly points a chastising finger at Scrooge for assisting in 
the creation of such social ills, Eytinge's melancholy figure points downward as the text 
describes, with the small slum children kneeling at his feet as the spirit cries, "Oh, Man! 
look here. Look, look, down here!"</p>

<p>In neither illustration, curiously, do the allegorical children cling to the spirit's 
garments; however, at least in Eytinge's there is an urban as opposed to the factory 
backdrop that Leech substituted. In place of Leech's blighted tree, emblematic of the
consequences of the callous capitalistic and factory systems, Eytinge has a bird of 
ill-omen haloed by the setting moon. In keeping with the serious subject of the
illustration, Eytinge has given us a sombre Druid rather than "a jolly
Giant, glorious to see." The implied movement of the 1868 "dark" plate is
entirely upward and downward, with the pillar-like tenement blocks in
the background complementing the pillar-like figures of Scrooge and his
spirit-guide. Finally, as the chimes strike midnight, Leech's Spirit of
Christmas Present is fading, even though the text does not so specify;
rather, he vanishes utterly at the moment the bell strikes twelve, presumably
on the night of the last of twelve days of Christmas. In contrast, Eytinge's
leaden spirit clasps his collar with his left hand against the chill; his
holly and berry head-dress, however, seems to have wilted if we compare it to
its rendering in Eytinge's "The Spirit of Christmas Present" five plates
earlier, and in the frontispiece, in which the crown is more luxuriant and the
figure both more nimble, youthful, jolly, vigorous, and benign.</p>

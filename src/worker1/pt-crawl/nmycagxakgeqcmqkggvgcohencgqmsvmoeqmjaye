		<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Chief Executive Officer<br />
</b></span><span class="s2"><b>FOX News Media</b></span></p>
<p>Suzanne Scott currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of FOX News Media, which encompasses the two linear networks FOX News Channel (FNC) and FOX Business Network (FBN), as well as FOX News Digital, FOX News Audio, FOX News Books, the direct-to-consumer subscription streaming services FOX Nation and FOX News International, as well as the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channel, FOX Weather. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, <em>Forbes </em>named Ms. Scott one of the world’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Media and Entertainment.</p>
<p>In this capacity, Scott oversees the most successful news organization in television, reaching nearly 200 million people each month across all platforms. Throughout her tenure, all of FOX News Media’s business units have either broken company or industry records while also delivering sustained growth with FOX News Media’s flagship network FOX News Channel concluding 2023 as the highest rated network in all of cable for the eighth consecutive year.</p>
<p>As the first female CEO at the network, installed in May of 2018, Scott has taken numerous steps to develop and mentor the next generation of leaders while imparting meaningful change across the FOX News Media landscape. She has spearheaded several workplace initiatives, including the launch of a new state of the art newsroom, Women @ FOX networking events, employee mentoring and career development programs along with instituting quarterly meetings with all employees. Her efforts have fostered a more open, collaborative and transparent environment across FOX News Media, which was recently recognized as a <a href="https://press.foxnews.com/2020/09/fox-news-media-earns-designation-as-a-2020-great-place-to-work-certified-company/">Great Place to Work</a>, marking the first time the news organization was bestowed the accolade since its 1996 inception.</p>
<p>Since Scott took over as CEO, she has created three new streaming offerings — the subscription-based FOX Nation in 2018 and FOX News International in 2020, and the FAST channel FOX Weather in 2021. As part of this signature multiplatform brand extension strategy, she also launched FOX News Books in 2020, a new publishing imprint which has sold nearly 2 million books with each title debuting as a <em>New York Times</em> number one bestseller and number one on Amazon. She also oversaw the brand refresh of FOX Digital, FOX News Audio and FOX Business, ushering in unprecedented growth and revenue.</p>
<p>Notably, under Scott’s leadership, 2020 marked FOX News Media’s highest-rated year in history. According to Nielsen Media Research, FNC shattered previous ratings highs as the first cable news channel to surpass 3.5 million viewers in primetime for an entire year, while FBN and FOX News Digital delivered record years. Additionally, for the first time in its history, FNC finished number one in all of cable in total day in the 25-54 demo. For the full year, FNC ranked among the top three networks in all of television in weekday primetime behind only broadcast networks CBS and NBC and beat every broadcast and cable network from Memorial Day 2020 through the end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>In 2023 she named Lawrence Jones co-host of FNC’s morning show franchise <em>FOX &amp; Friends</em>, the youngest Black co-host in cable news and in 2022, Scott appointed Shannon Bream to the role of <em>Fox News Sunday</em> moderator, the first woman to anchor the program in its then 26-year history. Over the last several years, Scott spearheaded a new programming lineup across daytime and primetime which included a hit late-night comedy show, <em>Gutfeld! </em>which routinely beats all established late-night shows on the broadcast networks, a live newscast <em>FOX News @ Night </em>at 11 PM/ET and adding Laura Ingraham to primetime with the launch of <em>The Ingraham Angle</em>. She also paired Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer as co-anchors of a refreshed <em>America’s Newsroom</em> (9-11 AM/ET) and launched <em>America Reports</em> with John Roberts &amp; Sandra Smith from 1-3 PM/ET. These moves experienced growth across all dayparts.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming the company’s first female CEO in May 2018, Scott served as the president of programming for both FNC and FBN. In this role, she oversaw all network programming and talent management, which included significantly altering FNC’s primetime lineup in 2017. She also expanded the network’s schedule to provide more hours of live programming and is responsible for having more women anchoring and hosting shows on FNC’s lineup than any other cable news network. Collectively, Scott’s programming moves have helped FNC remain number one in cable news for 22 consecutive years.</p>
<p>Since joining the network in 1996, Scott has risen through the ranks in several programming, production and creative positions including: executive vice president of programming (2016); senior vice president of programming and development (2009); vice president of programming (2007); network executive producer (2005); as well as associate producer, producer, and senior producer of <em>On the Record with Greta Van Susteren</em> (2002-2005). She began her career at FNC in April of 1996 on the launch team as a programming assistant and previously served in the same capacity at CNBC.</p>
<p>Scott has been widely recognized for her contributions in cable television. In late 2023, she was named to the NCTA – The Internet and Television Association’s Board of Directors. She was also honored as one of Crain’s Most Powerful Women in 2019 and was also named one of <em>The Hollywood Reporter’s</em> Most Powerful People in New York Media in 2018, 2019 and 2022 as well as one of <em>Variety</em>’s 2020 New York Women of Impact for her leadership during the pandemic. In 2018, she was chosen for <em>Variety’s</em> “New Power of New York” list and has been featured in the <em>Variety 500 </em>issue for the last six years, an index of the 500 most influential business leaders shaping the media industry.</p>
<p>Additionally, Scott was honored by the Tunnel to Towers Foundation in 2021 with the “Let Us Do Good” award for her extraordinary dedication and positive impact in the lives of veterans and first responders. The Police Athletic League of New York City also honored her in 2019 with their Women of the Year award.</p>
<p>She was also named one of <em>Cablefax Magazine</em>’s Most Powerful Women in Cable from 2017 through 2023 and was selected as one of the magazine’s 100 Top Power Players in Cable in the same years. In 2006, she was named one of <em>Multichannel News</em>’ Wonder Women.</p>
<p>Scott is a graduate of American University with a degree in political science.</p>

	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>General elections had previously been held in September 1989. On 3 September 1993, the normally due poll resulted in an even split of support in Parliament for and against incumbent Prime Minister Bikenibeu Paeniu, his opponents backing Mr. Paeniu&rsquo;s predecessor Tomasi Puapua. As a consequence, the Governor-General dissolved the legislature on 22 September and general elections took place again two months later, in November. Its outcome led Mr. Puapua to yield his challenge to Mr. Kamuta Laatasi, who was ultimately elected Prime Minister by Parliament on 10 December, defeating Mr. Paeniu by seven votes to five. Mr. Laatasi heads a five-member Cabinet.
		<p>
		While there are no formal parties in Tuvalu, the political system is based on a web of alliances and loyalties derived from clan and family roots.</td>

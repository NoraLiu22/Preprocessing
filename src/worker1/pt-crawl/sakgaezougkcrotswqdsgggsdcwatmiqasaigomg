<h3>Passage Illustrated</h3>

<p class="one">There was a dance in the evening. With which general mention of that 
recreation, I should have left it alone, if I had not some reason to suppose that it was 
quite an original dance, and one of a most uncommon figure.  It was formed in an odd way; 
in this way.</p>

<p>Edward, that sailor - fellow — a good free dashing sort of a fellow he was—had been 
telling them various marvels concerning parrots, and mines, and Mexicans, and gold dust, 
when all at once he took it in his head to jump up from his seat and propose a dance; for 
Bertha’s harp was there, and she had such a hand upon it as you seldom hear. Dot (sly 
little piece of affectation when she chose) said her dancing days were over; I think 
because the Carrier was smoking his pipe, and she liked sitting by him, best. Mrs. 
Fielding had no choice, of course, but to say her dancing days were over, after that; and 
everybody said the same, except May; May was ready.</p>

<p>So, May and Edward got up, amid great applause, to dance alone; and Bertha plays her 
liveliest tune.</p>

<p>Well! if you’ll believe me, they have not been dancing five minutes, when suddenly the 
Carrier flings his pipe away, takes Dot round the waist, dashes out into the room, and 
starts off with her, toe and heel, quite wonderfully. Tackleton no sooner sees this, 
than he skims across to Mrs. Fielding, takes her round the waist, and follows suit. Old 
Dot no sooner sees this, than up he is, all alive, whisks off Mrs. Dot in the middle of 
the dance, and is the foremost there.  Caleb no sooner sees this, than he clutches Tilly 
Slowboy by both hands and goes off at score; Miss Slowboy, firm in the belief that diving 
hotly in among the other couples, and effecting any number of concussions with them, is 
your only principle of footing it.</p>

<p>Hark! how the Cricket joins the music with its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp; and how the kettle 
hums! ["Chirp the Third," 172-74]</p>

<P align=left>In the twelfth century, Salerno Italy was the epicenter of 
medieval medicine in Europe. Salerno was famous for having the first medical 
school and its hospitals had world- wide reputation for excellence. During this 
time, many women were trained as physicians and also taught at the medical 
schools. Generally at this time in Europe, women were denied education. At the 
School of Salerno, women were welcomed as students and instructors. Trotula was 
a physician and an instructor at the School of Salerno.<BR><BR>Trotula was one 
of the most famous physicians of the time. She is considered the world's first 
gynecologist. Trotula di Ruggiero came from a wealthy family. Her birth and 
childhood remain a mystery. Trotula was a pioneer in women's health. She 
specialized in obstetrics, gynecology, cosmetics and skin disease. She wrote 
many medical works. Her most famous was <I>Passionibus Mulierum Curandorum (The 
Diseases of Women)</I>, also known as <I>Trotula Major</I>. This work was 
comprised of sixty three chapters pertaining to the special health issues of 
women. The purpose of this work was to educate male physicians about the female 
body because male physicians knew little at that time. Another work <I>Practica 
Secundum Trotam</I> was a larger work of a general nature. <BR><BR>Trotula's 
works are a collection of medical advice. She advised women on conception, 
menstruation, pregnancy, caesarian sections and childbirth. She also gives 
general medical advice for treating snakebites, curing bad breath and lightening 
freckles. Her radical ideas on conception shocked the medical and social 
community. Trotula believed that men and women both have physiological defects 
that cause conception difficulties. The woman may have a defect of the womb and 
the man may have a defect in the seed or his delivery. In her time, it was 
unusual to claim that failure to conceive was due to a physical defect in men. 
<BR><BR>She also believed that women should not suffer unrelenting pain during 
childbirth. During childbirth, she advocated the use of opiates produced by 
plants to dull the pain of labor. This contradicted Christian beliefs that a 
woman should suffer the pain of childbirth, because of the sin of Eve. Women 
were seen as weak, inferior and more susceptible to disease. For this reason, 
Trotula believed that women have special medical needs that can only be 
investigated and treated by a woman.<BR><BR>Trotula's work was used for 
centuries to come. She trained her students to observe their patients and to 
examine them thoroughly in order to prescribe them proper treatment. She taught 
her students to listen to their patients and ask questions about their ailments. 
Trotula recommended that her patients take herbal remedies, soak in warm baths 
and rest to aid the healing process. Trotula also believed that people should 
eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly. Live a low stress lifestyle and she 
advocated cleanliness.<BR><BR>Many historians debate whether Trotula was a woman 
or if she even existed. By the mid 1500's, women were no longer allowed to study 
at universities. Without concrete biographical evidence that Trotula existed, 
her manuscripts were attributed to a man and the name Trotula was a pseudonym. 
More research from her manuscripts lead scholars to believe that indeed she was 
a woman and did exist. Trotula was a pioneer in women's gynecological health and 
obstetrics. She offered a great deal of advice for childbirth. She gave 
instructions on normal delivery, breech birth and stillbirth. Also she advises 
how to sew tears a woman may experience during childbirth. </P>

<P align=left>Scholar&nbsp; Monica Green offers these suggestions and 
corrections:&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>&quot;There is much that has changed in our scholarly understanding of 
this group of texts and the question of authorship that has surrounded them for 
many centuries. Equally importantly, there is much that we understand now about 
why the historical tradition about these texts has been so garbled, leading many 
a helpless undergraduate into confusion.<br><br>For example:<br>• There was 
never any sound reason to suppose that the female practitioner in question lived 
in the 11th century. All evidence points to the 12th century.<br>• The proper 
woman’s name is “Trota,” a form well-attested in Salernitan documents from the 
period. “Trotula”, in contrast, is never attested as a woman’s name. It is, as 
has been demonstrated, a title that was later misunderstood (by scribes and 
other scholars not familiar with southern Italian naming practices) to be an 
author’s name.<br>• The Trotula (as the texts properly should be called) is a 
combination of three different texts, each of separate authorship. As a 
compilation, it can never be described as representing any single author’s 
perspectives, whether that author be male or female.<br>• The Trotula received a 
proper scholarly edition in 2001.&quot;<br> </P>

<H2 align=center><B>Annotated Bibliography</B></H2>
<P><B>Amundsen, Darrel. <I>Medicine, Society and Faith in the Ancient and 
Medieval Worlds</I>. Baltimore and London: John Hopkins Press Ltd., 
1996.<BR></B>This source is good for studying life in medieval times. Although 
very little is mentioned of Trotula, it does give an in depth look of medicine, 
society and faith intermingling in medieval Europe. The book it a bit lengthy 
and would not recommend this book for high school reading.</P>
<P><B>Bois, Danuta. "Distinguished Women of Past and Present: Trotula of
Salerno.&quot; 1996 &lt;<a href="http://www.distinguishedwomen.com/biographies/trotula.html" target="_blank">http://www.distinguishedwomen.com/biographies/trotula.html</a>&gt;
(18 December 2005).<BR></B>This website was an excellent source although the 
biography of Trotula is brief. The site also has many remarkable women from the 
past to the present day who have helped shaped our culture and history. The site 
is easy to navigate and is well planned. I would recommend this site as a 
starting point to anyone conducting research on women's 
studies.<BR><BR><B>Cadden, Joan. <I>Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle 
Ages</I>. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993.<BR></B>This source was 
excellent in studying Trotula of Salerno. It also mentions Hildegard of Bingen 
among many others. The book explains where the notions of sex difference 
originated and how it affected women of the Middle Ages. The chapters and 
readings are clearly defined. The book was easy to read and would suggest this 
book for upper high school and college students. <BR><BR><B>Green, Monica. From 
<I>"Diseases of Women" to "Secrets of Women": <BR>The Transformation of 
Gynecological Literature in the Later Middle Ages.</I>  <i>Journal of Medieval 
and Early Modern Studies</i> 30.1 (2000) 5-39. &lt;<a href="http://libraryaccess.kings.edu:2250/journals/journal_of_medieval_and_early_modern_studies/v030/30.1green.html" target="_blank">http://libraryaccess.kings.edu:2250/journals/journal_of_medieval_and_early_modern_studies/v030/30.1green.html</a>&gt;
(18 December 2005).<BR></B>This journal article was interesting 
because it is about the "secrets" of women, the secret meanings of the different 
body parts of women. Many feel that using the actual terms of the woman's body 
to be taboo. The author discusses the terminology used in the Middle Ages and 
how those terms have changed. It is an excellent journal although it is quite 
lengthy at 34 pages.</P>
<P><B>McNeil PhD., Russell. "Trotula of Salerno.&quot; 1995 &lt;<a href="http://www.malaspina.org/home.asp?topic=./search/details&amp;lastpage=./search/results&amp;ID=340" target="_blank">http://www.malaspina.org/home.asp?topic=./search/details&amp;lastpage=./search/results&amp;ID=340</a>&gt;
(18 December 2005).<BR></B>This is a good site. The biography of Trotula is very 
detailed and somewhat difficult to read. The site is part of a biographical 
database, Great Ideas. The site offers information on under-represented and 
historical women in music, literature, art, science, theater and many other 
areas. I would suggest this site for upper level readers. This site is useful 
because it gives suggestions for further readings, journal articles and website 
links to information on Trotula and many other historically important women.</P>
<P><B>Reese, Lyn. "Notable Women.&quot; 1996 &lt;<a href="http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/notables.html" target="_blank">http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/notables.html</a>&gt;
(18 December 2005).<BR></B>The website is an excellent source. It gives 
biographies of women from Western Europe to the Far East circa 1000 C.E. This 
site would be useful for educators because of the wealth of information and the 
lesson plans offered on the site. It is also useful for students in middle 
school and high school.<BR><BR><B>Riddle, John. <I>Contraception and Abortion 
from the Ancient World to the Renaissance</I>. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 
Press, 1992.<BR></B>This source is a very detailed account of the history of 
contraception and abortion. A short biography of Trotula is given in this book. 
It focuses on her work in gynecology and her remedies for contraception and 
abortion. Although it is an excellent book for a college student, I would not 
recommend this book for a younger reader because it is of an explicit nature.

<P><B>Schied, Troy and Toon, Laura. "Dominion and Domination of the Gentle Sex: 
The Lives of Medieval Women.&quot; ThinkQuest &lt;<a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/12834/text/bios.html#Sci" target="_blank">http://library.thinkquest.org/12834/text/bios.html#Sci</a>&gt;
(18 December 2005).<BR></B>This is an excellent site and is appropriate for all 
ages. This site is dedicated to medieval women who have been forgotten in 
history. The website has short biographies of many notable women in war, trade, 
medicine, politics and religion. Also, the site includes a short quiz to test 
one's knowledge of medieval women. I would recommend this site to anyone 
interested in the study of women of medieval times.<BR><BR><B>Whitney, Elspeth. 
<I>Medieval Science and Technology.</I>  Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 
2004.<BR></B>This was an excellent source for researching Trotula. The book uses 
primary sources such as excerpts from her work On the Diseases of Women. This 
source gives short biographies of many notable people who influenced science, 
technology and medicine from the medieval ages. The book is well planned out and 
is easy to read. I would recommend this book to any level reader. </P>

	<P CLASS="a0 justify">
Plutarch's essay on the <I>Fortune of the Romans</I>, like the following essays, is very plainly an epideictic oration. Where and when it was delivered, or whether it was ever delivered at all, we have no means of ascertaining. Hartman feels very sure that it was delivered to a Roman audience in the early days of Plutarch's sojourn at Rome, and was intended to commend the speaker to other Romans besides his personal friends there.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
The thesis that Fortune was responsible for the great Roman empire would hardly be pleasing to Romans, but Plutarch is careful to point out that the high character of many individual Romans also contributed to the Roman success. In fact the essay might well bear the double title of <I>Fortune or Virtues</I>,&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref1" HREF="
E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Fortuna_Romanorum*.html#note1
"onMouseOver="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)"
onMouseOut="nd();">1</A> as does the essay on Alexander. Plutarch was thoroughly familiar with the interpretations of Roman history then fashionable, and in this essay he gives a colourful sketch of as much as will serve his purpose. Much that is here may also be found elsewhere in Plutarch's writings.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
The essay comes to a somewhat abrupt conclusion, and many have thought it unfinished; the same is true of the essays immediately following. One may


<A ID="p321"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p321 </SPAN></A>wonder whether a time limit was set for these orations, as in the courts at Athens where the time allowed was measured by the water-clock or clepsydra. We may note, however, that these orations are of quite unequal length.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
The text is fairly good, and the majority of the <SPAN CLASS="small">MS.</SPAN> mistakes have been corrected by the various editors and commentators. The essay is No. 175 in Lamprias's list of Plutarch's works.

Virtue and Fortune, who have often engaged in many great contests, are now engaging each other in the present contest, which is the greatest of all; for in this they are striving for a decision regarding the hegemony of Rome, to determine whose work it is and which of them created such a mighty power. For to her who is victorious this will be no slight testimonial, but rather a defence against accusation. For Virtue is accused of being a fair thing, but unprofitable; Fortune of being a thing inconstant, but good. Virtue's labours, they say, are fruitless, Fortune's gifts untrustworthy. Who, then, will not declare, when Rome shall have been added to the achievements of one of the contestants, either that Virtue is a most profitable thing <A CLASS="Tsubsec" NAME="T316d">d</A>if she has done such good to good men, or that Good Fortune is a thing most steadfast if she has already preserved for so long a time that which she has bestowed?

What need to be tedious by enumerating the many examples? Even Nature herself, who creates and


<A ID="p325"><SPAN CLASS="pagenum"> p325 </SPAN></A>produces all things for us, some think to be Fortune, others Wisdom. <A CLASS="Tsubsec" NAME="T316e">e</A>Wherefore our present discourse does, in a measure, bestow a fair and enviable dignity upon Rome, if we raise the question over her, even as we do over earth and sea, heaven and stars, whether she has come to her present state by Fortune or by Forethought.<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref3" HREF="

Even as Plato&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref4" HREF="

But even now they have no temple of Wisdom or Prudence or Constancy or Magnanimity. But of Fortune there are very many ancient and splendid temples built with every honour, one might say, and interspersed throughout the most conspicuous districts and localities of the City. The shrine of the Men's Fortune was built by Ancus Marcius, the fourth king, and so named because Fortune has the largest share with Manly Fortitude for winning the victory. And again, that the shrine of the Women's Fortune was dedicated by the women who turned back Marcius Coriolanus when he was leading enemies against Rome, there is no one who does not know."

Something is wrong here, either in Plutarch or his sources that the eclipse fell on the Capratine Nones; or in Plutarch's statement that the Nones Capratinae were those of Quintilis/July

(<I>Life of Numa</I>, 2.1)</A>: there was, at any rate, no eclipse of the sun visible in Rome on or near July 5 at any time during the 8th (or 7th) centuries <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN> — this according to Oppolzer's <I>Canon der Finsternisse</I>, the standard authority on eclipses thru most of the 20c and until very recently.
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
There were, however, two (and only two) total solar eclipses visible at Rome in the 8c <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN>, in Feb 765 and Mar 711; if there is any truth at all to the tradition of Romulus's life being bracketed by eclipses, they are very attractive candidates: for details, see

my note on Cassius Dio <SPAN CLASS="small">I</SPAN>.5.12</A>; but remember also that the Roman calendar was not fully set in order until the reign of Augustus, so that we may owe the Capratine Nones date to some unknown traditional source, and the detailed eclipse stories and the 54 years to Varro's astrologer — see that same note of mine.

	<P CLASS="justify">
The maximum duration of the total phase of an eclipse, by the way, when the earth would be dark, is something less than 8 minutes: unlike Hercules, and in keeping with his own temperament, of which there are many other indications in ancient literature, Mars made quick work of it.

	<P CLASS="a0 justify">
An alternate solution, which I owe to the kindness of Alberto Monteiro, for the eclipse during which Romulus was conceived is the partial eclipse of the Sun of June 24, 772 <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN> (<I>i.e.</I>, -771 astronomical). This would have put his birth in March, 771 <SPAN CLASS="small">B.C.</SPAN>, "one of the dates that the ancient writers assigned to the birth of Romulus".
	<P CLASS="i1 b0 a0 justify">
At Rome mind you the disk of the Moon just barely touched that of the Sun, so that the eclipse would hardly qualify as "night", and was very short; Mars would <I>really</I> have to have been zippy about it. The June date, on the other hand, doesn't invalidate anything: the disorder in the Roman calendar was such that what was felt at the time to be July 5 could very well have been June 24.

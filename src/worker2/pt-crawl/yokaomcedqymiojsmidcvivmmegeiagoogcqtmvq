/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

          (S733), <u>The Revolt of Democracy</u> was Wallace's final book, published 
          just weeks before he died on 7 November 1913 at the age of 90. It was 
          also his shortest monographic work, being little more than a lengthy 
          essay. Reproduced below is the text of the original 1913 Cassell and 
          Company edition, minus its Title Page and Table of Contents, a long 
          introductory biographical sketch of Wallace provided by James Marchant,

      <p align="center"><br /><font color="#990000" size="-1">[[p. 1]] </font><b>Chapter I. Introductory</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As President of the Land Nationalisation Society 
          for thirty years, I have given much attention to the various inquiries 
          by Royal Commissions, by Parliamentary Committees, or by private philanthropists, 
          into Irish evictions and Highland clearances, sweating, unemployment, 
          low wages, unhealthy trades, bad and overcrowded dwellings, and the 
          depopulation of the rural districts. These inquiries have succeeded 
          each other in a melancholy procession during the last sixty years; they 
          have made known the almost incredible conditions of life of great numbers 
          of our workers; <font color="#990000" size="-1">[[p. 2]]</font><font color="#990000"> 
          </font>and they have suggested more or less ineffective remedies, but 
          their proposals have been followed by even less effective legislation 
          when any palliative has been attempted. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the whole of the nineteenth century there 
          was a continuous advance in the application of scientific discovery 
          to the arts, and especially in the invention and application of labour-saving 
          machinery; and our wealth has increased to an equally marvellous extent. 
          Various estimates which have been made of the increase in our wealth-producing 
          power show that, roughly speaking, the use of mechanical power has increased 
          more than a hundredfold during the century; yet the result has been 
          to create a limited upper class, living in unexampled luxury, while 
          about one-fourth of our whole population exists in a state of fluctuating 
          penury, often sinking below what has been termed <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          3]]</font> &quot;the margin of poverty.&quot; Of these, many thousands are annually 
          drawn into the gulf of absolute destitution, dying either from direct 
          starvation, or from diseases produced by their employment, and rendered 
          fatal by want of the necessaries and comforts of a healthy existence. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But during this long period, while wealth and want 
          were alike increasing side by side, public opinion was not sufficiently 
          educated to permit of any effectual remedy being applied for the extirpation 
          of this terrible social disease. The workers themselves had not visualised 
          its fundamental causes--land monopoly and the competitive system of 
          industry, giving rise to an ever-increasing private capitalism which, 
          to a very large extent, controlled the legislature. This rapid growth 
          of wealth through the increase of the various kinds of manufacturing 
          industry led to a still greater increase of middlemen engaged in the 
          distribution of <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 4]]</font> its 
          products, from wealthy merchants, through various grades of tradesmen 
          and petty shopkeepers who supplied the daily wants of the whole community. 
          To these must be added the innumerable parasites of the ever-increasing 
          wealthy classes; the builders of their mansions and their factories; 
          the makers of their furniture and clothing, of their costly ornaments 
          and their children's toys; the vast body of their immediate dependents, 
          from their managers, their agents, commercial travellers and clerks, 
          through various grades of domestic servants, grooms and game-keepers, 
          butlers and housekeepers, down to stable-boys and kitchen-maids, all 
          deriving their means of existence from the wealth daily produced in 
          mines, factories and workshops. This was apparently due primarily, if 
          not exclusively, to the capitalists themselves as the employers of labour, 
          without whose agency and <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 5]]</font> 
          supervision it was believed that all productive labour would cease, 
          bringing ruin and starvation to the whole population. Thus, a vast mass 
          of public opinion was created, all in favour of the capitalists as the 
          employers of labour and the true source of the creation of wealth. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who lived in the midst of this vast industrial 
          system, or were a part of it, it seemed natural and inevitable that 
          there should be rich and poor; and this belief was enforced on the one 
          hand by the clergy, and on the other by the political economists, so 
          that religion and science agreed in upholding the competitive and capitalistic 
          system of society as being the only rational and possible one. Hence, 
          till quite recently, it was believed that the abolition of poverty was 
          entirely outside the true sphere of governmental action. It was, in 
          fact, openly declared and believed that poverty was due to <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          6]]</font> economic causes over which governments had no power; that 
          wages were kept down by the &quot;iron law&quot; of supply and demand; and that 
          any attempts to find a remedy by Acts of Parliament only aggravated 
          the disease. This was the doctrine held, even by such great men as W. 
          E. Gladstone and Sir William Harcourt, together with the dogma that 
          it was a government's duty to buy in the cheapest market, in order to 
          protect the taxpayer. It was the doctrine also which converted the misnamed 
          &quot;guardians&quot; of the poor into guardians of the ratepayers' interests, 
          and led to that rigid and unsympathetic treatment of the very poor which 
          made the workhouse more dreaded than the jail, and which to this very 
          day leads many of the most destitute to die of lingering starvation, 
          or to commit suicide, rather than apply for relief or enter the gloomy 
          portals of the workhouse.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was, I believe, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, 
          when he became Prime Minister in 1905, who changed this attitude of 
          negation of all his predecessors. He boldly declared in numerous speeches, 
          both in and out of Parliament, that he held it to be the duty of a government 
          to deal with the great problems of unemployment and poverty, and especially 
          to attack the increasingly injurious land-monopoly, and so to legislate 
          as to make our native soil ever more and more &quot;a treasure-house for 
          the poor rather than a mere pleasure-house for the rich.&quot; And as an 
          earnest of his determination to carry out these views, he brought into 
          his <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 8]]</font> Ministry John Burns 
          and David Lloyd George, the former for his knowledge of the conditions 
          and aspirations of skilled labour, and his administrative experience 
          both in the County Council and in Parliament, and the latter for his 
          energy as an advanced thinker, his powers of public speaking, and his 
          enthusiasm for social reform. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mr. Asquith became Prime Minister in 1908, 
          he made Mr. Lloyd George his successor as Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
          and never was the wisdom of an appointment more fully justified. The 
          new Chancellor, in the memorable Budget thrown out by the House of Lords, 
          made provision not only for our ever-increasing Navy, but also for Old-Age 
          Pensions and for far-reaching measures calculated to benefit the working 
          classes. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, in my opinion, largely due to this attitude 
          of Liberal Governments, without <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          9]]</font> adequate remedial legislation, during the last seven years, 
          with a corresponding change in public opinion, that has led to the recent 
          effort of the workers to bring about better conditions by means of combined 
          strikes. The three great strikes in rapid succession, of the Railway 
          and other transport Unions, of the Miners, and of the London Dock Labourers, 
          must have brought home to the middle and upper classes and to the Government 
          how completely they are all dependent on the often despised working 
          classes, not only for every comfort and luxury which they enjoy, for 
          the means of rapid locomotion and of carrying on their respective businesses 
          and pleasures, but also for obtaining the daily food essential for life 
          itself. The experience now gained shows us that when the organisation 
          of the trade unions is rendered more complete, and the accumulated funds 
          of a dozen or twenty years <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 10]]</font> 
          are devoted to this one purpose, the bulk of the inhabitants of London, 
          or of any other of our great cities, could be made to suffer a degree 
          of famine comparable with that of Paris when besieged by the German 
          army in 1870. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be hoped that such a disaster will not 
          happen, but it can only be prevented by much more effective action than 
          has yet been taken to improve the social status of the great body of 
          industrial and other workers, and to abolish completely the conditions 
          which compel a large proportion of those workers to exist on or below 
          the margin of poverty, often culminating in actual death from want of 
          the bare necessaries of existence.</p>

            The Lesson of the Strikes</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The serious position which these successive strikes 
          have brought about has led to much discussion in the newspapers and 
          other periodicals, in which a number of well-known literary men have 
          taken part, and, what is much more important, in which several of the 
          most able and intelligent of the workers themselves have clearly stated 
          their determination to obtain certain fundamental reforms. Month by 
          month it has become more clear and certain that what has been termed 
          &quot;The Labour Unrest&quot; will certainly continue with ever-increasing determination 
          and effective power till some such reforms as they demand are conceded 
          by the Government.

          </font>A careful study of the more important of these various pronouncements 
          shows us that two things stand out clearly, as to which there is almost 
          universal agreement. These are, first, that the condition of the workers 
          as a whole is absolutely unbearable, is a disgrace to civilisation, 
          and fully justifies the most extreme demands of the workers; and, secondly, 
          that among the whole of the writers--whether statesmen or thinkers, 
          capitalists or workmen--there is not one who has proposed any definite 
          and workable plan by which the desired change of conditions will be 
          brought about. Yet one such plan was carefully worked out more than 
          twenty years ago, and though the book had a considerable sale and a 
          cheap edition of it was issued, not the slightest effect was produced 
          on public opinion or on the Government.<a href="#1">*</a> The time had 
          not yet come for such radical reforms <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          13]]</font> to be seriously considered. But conditions have changed, 
          and some definite action is now imperatively demanded if this &quot;unrest&quot; 
          is to cease, and if the reasonable claims of the workers are to be satisfied. 
          Let us see, then, what these claims are, and why none of the various 
          palliatives hinted at by a few of those who have taken part in the discussion 
          can do any real good, while they will certainly not satisfy the workers 
          or allay their quite justifiable &quot;unrest.&quot;</p>

          <p><font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 14]] </font><b>Chapter IV. What 
            the Workers Claim and Must Have</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workers' claim is put forward by Mr. Vernon 
          Hartshorn in the following clear and terse statement: &quot;What is that 
          demand? It is, that the community shall guarantee to the men and women 
          who perform services essential to the existence or happiness of the 
          community, a reasonably comfortable and civilised livelihood--a decent 
          <i>minimum </i>of food and clothing, leisure and recreation, and houses 
          fit for human beings.&quot; Then he proceeds to ask: &quot;How do the workers 
          propose that the community shall give them that guarantee? By the establishment 
          of a legally guaranteed eight-hours day. By the establishment of a national 
          housing standard at a rent within the reach of the workers. <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          15]]</font> And also by the power of the trade unions to check the exploitation 
          of Labour by competitive methods which tend to force down the average 
          standard of living among the working classes.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, after a reference to the recent claim of the 
          doctors to what <i>they</i> consider a living wage under the National 
          Insurance Act, and also to the many luxuries of the rich which the workers 
          do <i>not</i> want, he again states the workers' claim thus: &quot;It is 
          not an extravagant demand. It is just the plain blunt demand that might 
          be expected from British working-men . . . It is a demand by those who, 
          either by hand or brain, make the wealth of the nation, that the first 
          charge upon that wealth shall be the maintenance of themselves in reasonable 
          comfort.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he concludes with this important declaration 
          of policy:-- 
        </p><blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;Democracy must be its own emancipator. But 
          institutions like the Church, Parliament, and the Press, and even the 
          rich, have to make up their minds <font color="#990000">[[p. 16]]</font> 
          as to what shall be their attitude toward it. They must decide for themselves 
          whether the demand of the workers for a fairer share of the good things 
          of life is just or unjust. The working classes have already made up 
          their minds. They are convinced that their demand is just, and with 
          a highly intelligent, vigorous working class, stung by a sense of injustice, 
          the future of this country will be full of danger. The stupid attitude 
          of hostility or superior patronage which has been adopted towards the 
          working classes in the past by powerful elements in society has helped 
          to generate the present revolutionary upheaval . . . The worker does 
          not want charity to redress the balance. He knows that charity robs 
          him of his manhood. He feels that he is entitled to a man's share of 
          the wealth he has produced, and he wants it assured to him, not as a 
          charity, but as a citizen's right.&quot;</font></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, after describing how neither Parliament nor the 
        present Government can or will secure this for him, and that their methods 
        of &quot;conciliation&quot; or &quot;arbitration&quot; are useless or inadequate, he concludes: 
        <blockquote><font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 17]] </font><font size="-1">&quot;There 
          is only one way to industrial peace. There is only one way to stave 
          off a class war which may shake civilisation to its foundations. It 
          is by a full and frank acknowledgement by society that the claim of 
          the worker to a sufficiency of food and clothing and a fuller life is 
          just, and that it must be made the first charge upon the wealth produced 
          . . . It is the present order of society which is upon its trial. Can 
          it do justice to the worker? If it can, and if it does, then it will 
          have justified its existence. But if it cannot, then its ultimate doom 
          is sealed.&quot;</font></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quotations from other Labour leaders could be made 
        to the same effect, showing that the workers now<i> know</i> their rights 
        and are determined to obtain them. But they do <i>not </i>see exactly 
        how that is to be done, and it is for their friends and well-wishers to 
        assist them in finding out a way. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few useful indications of how we must approach 
          the problem may be quoted. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Seebohm Rowntree, one of the <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          18]]</font> best and most sympathetic employers of labour in the country, 
          tells us that--&quot;The capitalists should entirely shake off the idea that 
          wage-earners are inferior beings to themselves, and should learn to 
          regard them as valued and necessary partners in the great work of wealth-production--partners 
          with whose accredited representatives they may honourably discuss the 
          proportions in which the wealth jointly produced should be divided.&quot; 
          He also sees clearly, and declares that--&quot;The poverty at one end of 
          the social scale will not be removed except by encroaching heavily upon 
          the great riches at the other end.&quot; But this, apparently, is the last 
          thing capitalist employers want or will submit to. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Frederic Harrison urges that labour cannot be 
          in a settled and healthy state &quot;till seven hours is made the normal 
          standard of a day's labour,&quot; <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 19]]</font> 
          and that--&quot;a fixed living wage is merely the irreducible part of the 
          remuneration, the rest being proportioned to the profits on the work 
          done.&quot; And he concludes his most interesting and suggestive article 
          with the dictum that--&quot;The unrest is come to stay, and will not be ended 
          by petty devices.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sidney Low tells us that there are many young 
          men among the workers who read Carlyle and Ruskin, and believe that 
          if our society were rightly organised the life of cultivated leisure 
          would not be the privilege of the Few, but the possession of the Many. 
          Mr. Geoffrey Drage confirms this statement, and declares that--&quot;the 
          worker sees that the time for cries is past, the time for action is 
          come.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he, too, like all the others, gives <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          20]]</font> no clue as to how the great change is to be brought about, 
          not sporadically here and there, but universally--not by slightly improving 
          the condition of skilled labour only, but by such means as will immediately 
          begin to act upon the lowest stratum of the social fabric, and in a 
          measurable space of time abolish want, culminating in actual starvation, 
          in this land of ever-increasing wealth, and ever more and more extravagant 
          luxury. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before laying before my readers what I conceive 
          to be, at the present juncture, the best and, indeed, the <i>only</i> 
          mode of successfully attacking this great and pressing problem, I will 
          give the statement of Mr. Anderson, the Chairman of the Conference of 
          the Independent Labour Party, in the autumn of 1912. In reply to a Press 
          representative, he said: &quot;The whole upheaval is a revolt against poverty; 
          against, that is, Social Injustice; and it involves <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          21]]</font> the Right to Live . . . Strikes are disintegrating . . . 
          they are no real and permanent remedy. We have to find the solution 
          in some new basis for industrial reform, and my view is, that if reform 
          is to do any good <i>it must contain in itself the germ of a better 
          social organisation</i>. Palliatives are no cure.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, when he was urged to say, &quot;What do you 
          actually propose?&quot; his reply was: &quot;We are determined that <i>destitution 
          must be stamped out;</i> and our remedy resolves itself into this: <i>A 
          national minimum of Wages, Housing, Leisure, and Education. That is 
          Labour's battle-cry for the future.&quot;</i></p>

          <p><font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 22]] </font><b>Chapter V. A 
            Government's Duty</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in all the foregoing views of the leaders and 
          the friends of Labour, there is a very close agreement as to the present 
          position of the whole body of workers, and as to the nature and amount 
          of the reforms they insist upon, without which they will not be satisfied, 
          and will not cease from agitation, culminating in more extensive and 
          more determined and better-organised strikes. This will be the only 
          method left open to them if their admittedly moderate and just claims 
          are not fully and honestly recognised by the party in power, and at 
          once translated into adequate <i>direct action.</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a very strange thing to me, and <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          23]]</font> must be so to many others, that in this most wealthy country 
          a powerful Government, long pledged to social reform, <i>cannot</i> 
          or <i>will not </i>take any immediate and direct steps to abolish the 
          pitiable extremes of destitution which are ever present in all its great 
          cities, its towns, and even its villages! The old, complex and harsh 
          machinery of its Poor Laws has become less and less efficient. Enormous 
          sums spent in various forms of charity do not prevent starvation, do 
          not appear to diminish it. The cause of this almost universal apathy 
          is the very persistence of destitution and its obscurity. The various 
          forms of charity are more conspicuous and more obtrusive, so that most 
          people are quite unable to realise that starvation is still rampant 
          to a most terrible and most disgraceful extent all over our land. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1898 I published in my volume on <i>The Wonderful 
          Century</i> an appendix on <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 24]]</font> 
          &quot;The Remedy for Want in the Midst of Wealth,&quot; but, thinking that the 
          general scheme I proposed was too advanced for immediate adoption, I 
          also gave a plan, headed &quot;How to Stop Starvation,&quot; which began with 
          these words: &quot;But till some such method is demanded by public opinion, 
          and its adoption forced upon our legislators, the horrible scandal and 
          crime of men, women, and little children, by thousands and millions, 
          living in the most wretched want, dying of actual starvation, or driven 
          to suicide by the dread of it, <i>must be stopped!</i>&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman of the Independent Labour Party now 
          also declares that &quot;Destitution must be stamped out.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the above passage was written nothing effective 
          has been done, the horrors of our slums are as bad as ever, our cumbrous 
          and unsympathetic systems of poor relief are utter failures. I, therefore, 
          again submit my simple and <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 25]]</font> 
          practical suggestion, which is as much needed to-day as it was then. 
          It is as follows: 
        </p><blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;The only certain way to abolish starvation, 
          not when it is too late, but in its very earliest stages, is <i>free 
          bread</i>. I imagine the outcry against this: 'Fraud! Loafing! Pauperisation!' 
          etc., etc. Perhaps so; perhaps not. But even if it <i>must</i> be so, 
          better give bread to a hundred loafers than refuse it to a hundred who 
          are starving. <i>All </i>who want it, <i>all</i> who have not money 
          enough to buy wholesome food and other necessaries, must be able to 
          get this bread with the minimum of trouble. There must be no <i>tests</i> 
          like those for Poor Law relief. A decent home, with good furniture and 
          good clothes, must be no bar; neither must the possession of money if 
          that money is needed for rent, for coals, or for other absolute necessaries 
          of life. The bread must be given to <i>prevent </i>injurious destitution, 
          not merely to alleviate it. The bread is <i>not</i> to be charity, <i>not</i> 
          poor relief, but a rightful claim upon society for its neglect to organise 
          itself so that <i>all,</i> without exception, who have worked, and are 
          willing to work, or are unable to work, may at the very least have food 
          to support life.</font><font size="-1" color="#990000"> </font> 
          <p><font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 26]]</font><font size="-1"> &quot;Now 
            for the mode of obtaining this bread. All local authorities shall 
            be required to prepare bread-tickets duly stamped and numbered with 
            coupons to be detached, each representing a 2-lb. or 4-lb. loaf. These 
            tickets to be issued in suitable quantities to every policeman, to 
            all the clergy of every denomination, and to all medical men. Any 
            person in want of food, by applying to any of these distributors is 
            to be given a coupon for one loaf, <i>without any question whatever.</i></font> 
          </p><p><font size="-1">&quot;If the person wants more than one loaf, or wishes 
            to have one or more such loaves for a week, a name and address must 
            be given. The distributor, or some deputy, will then pay a visit during 
            the day, ascertain the bare facts, give a suitable number of tickets, 
            and, as in cases of sickness or of young children, obtain such other 
            relief as may be needed.&quot;</font>
        </p></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of dealing with this widespread destitution 
        should be borne by the National Exchequer, both because it is due to deep-seated 
        causes in our social economy, and also because its distribution is very 
        unequal, so that the cost would <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 27]]</font> 
        be heaviest in the poorer and lightest in the richer areas. It must, however, 
        be treated as essentially of a temporary nature, only needed till the 
        fundamental causes of poverty are properly dealt with by some such method 
        as that to be explained later on, when any such expedient will become 
        a thing of the past. 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we consider that during the last fourteen years 
          our national expenditure has increased by about 80,000,000, and that 
          it has now reached the vast amount of&nbsp; 185,000,000, it is almost 
          incredible that we should have made no serious attempt to discover the 
          causes and apply the remedy to this terrible social canker in our civilisation. 
          Now, however, that the Labour Party insists upon an immediate remedy 
          being applied, and also claims for the sufferers and for the whole body 
          of workers full social equality with all other citizens--a claim recognised 
          by many <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 28]]</font> of our best 
          and greatest writers to be a just one--perennial starvation of our very 
          poor must no longer be ignored, and our Government must grapple with 
          it without further delay. 
        </p><p><i>Government and Its Employees</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will now proceed to consider how the Government 
          can itself lead the way towards that new organisation of society which 
          will afford a permanent remedy for labour unrest, and satisfy the just 
          demands of some considerable portion of the workers of our country. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prime Minister has quite recently declared his 
          invincible objection to fixing even a minimum wage by Act of Parliament, 
          but no positive objection has been made to raising the wages of all 
          Government employees above such a minimum. This has been asked for again 
          and again by the workers themselves, as well as by their representatives 
          in Parliament, but <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 29]]</font> 
          has only been acted upon partially, and any proposal for giving higher 
          wages than are paid by private capitalists has been objected to for 
          various reasons. It is said to be unfair to thus compete with private 
          enterprise; that more men at present wages can always be had than are 
          required; and other reasons of the usual type of the old school of economists. 
          These objections are also upheld for political reasons, since the large 
          number of capitalists and wealthy employers of labour in the House of 
          Commons would violently oppose any such unprecedented expenditure, and 
          endanger the very existence of the Government. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all these objections may now, perhaps, be much 
          weakened, or even disregarded, in view of the recent strikes and the 
          future possibilities they suggest. The workers are now steadily becoming 
          better organised and more conscious of their own <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          30]]</font> power at the polls, and they will no longer support a Government 
          which confesses itself impotent to lift them out of the terrible quagmire 
          of misery and degradation into which the present <i>economic system</i> 
          is steadily forcing them. The time for conferences and discussions and 
          for petty alleviations which are wholly useless is gone by. What the 
          workers now demand is that the Government shall begin to act so far 
          as it possesses the power to act; that it must raise the wages, provide 
          decent houses, establish shorter hours of work, give suitable holidays, 
          and establish liberal retiring pensions, <i>for every one of its own 
          employees.</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that something has been done in this 
          direction, but many Government workers are still said to be as badly 
          off as under the lower class of private capitalists. Whether or not 
          this is due to the old idea that the taxpayers <i>must </i><font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          31]]</font> be protected though the children of the workers suffer want, 
          I do not know; but unless this economy in the wrong place is changed, 
          and the very reverse principle acted upon, the present Government will 
          bring upon itself the united opposition of the workers. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What then must our rulers do in the present crisis? 
          To use the forcible expression of the late W. T. Stead, what we insist 
          upon now is, <i>that we declare war against every form of want, poverty, 
          and industrial discontent, and that the Government must lead the way 
          and set the pace.</i> It must do this because it is the greatest employer 
          of labour in the kingdom: its Civil Service alone--the receivers of 
          annual salaries instead of weekly wages--comprising 136,000 persons; 
          and because it has the power of influencing all other employers of labour 
          through the force of its example, as well as by the action of economic 
          laws. <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 32]]</font>
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to give confidence to the Labour Party, 
          a proclamation should be at once issued establishing for the entire 
          Government Service a liberal scale of wages, based upon the inquiries 
          of Mr. C. Booth, Mr. S. Rowntree and others, so that adult workers shall 
          receive at next pay-day an ample &quot;living wage,&quot; to be increased each 
          year by (say) 2s. a week till it reaches the estimate of these disinterested 
          and capable inquirers. Let it be declared also that, except for <i>gross 
          bad conduct,</i> no man shall be dismissed [from] the public service 
          till he reaches the age when he will receive a liberal retiring pension. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the avowed object <i>must be</i> to make Government 
          employment at once an honour and an advantage, and also that it may 
          serve as a model for all other employers of labour, everything must 
          be done to promote the health and contentment of the whole body of public 
          workers. In <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 33]]</font> order to 
          give effect to this declared purpose, a considerable proportion of them 
          should be gradually trained in some alternative employment, especially 
          in those that give healthy outdoor occupation, such as the various building 
          trades, and, pre-eminently, in some kind of agricultural work. It will 
          thus be rendered possible, whenever we cease to expend so many millions 
          annually on purely destructive ships and weapons, that the surplus men 
          engaged in our dockyards and various factories of war-material need 
          not be discharged and create a new army of the unemployed, but be gradually 
          drafted into an army of true <i>wealth-producers.</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important feature of this new departure 
          in the organisation of the extended Civil Service would be the gradual 
          removal of all factories and workshops from towns and cities into the 
          open and healthy country, where large areas of land <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          34]]</font> can be obtained sufficient to produce most of the food and 
          clothing for its inhabitants. Large estates of several thousand acres 
          are constantly in the market, and are often sold at from &pound;10 to 
          &pound;20 an acre. An additional means of obtaining such estates would 
          be a short Act giving the Government power to take death-duties and 
          land-taxes in land at the taxation value whenever it is suitable for 
          the purpose. Of course, acting on the general principle of making its 
          own employees and labourers the best and most contented of all the working 
          classes, the Government must at once make arrangements for giving up 
          its contract work, especially in the clothing and provision departments, 
          replacing it by farms and factories of its own.</p>

            Objections, and Replies to Them</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme of improved Government employment now 
          briefly explained will, of course, give rise to a host of objections 
          of various degrees of futility, but I know of none of the least real 
          weight. The first of these objections will, of course, be the great 
          expense; and that it will necessitate more taxes, which will ruin those 
          who only just manage to live now. To this I reply, that the cost to 
          the poor need really be almost <i>nothing</i>; first, because every 
          pound paid extra in wages is a pound more expended in food, clothing, 
          furniture, houses, and other necessaries of life. It will, therefore, 
          benefit the makers, growers and retailers of those commodities <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          36]]</font> by the increase of their trade, and it is a maxim of political 
          economy that the home trade is the best trade for the prosperity of 
          a country. In the second place, even with our present system of taxation 
          the workers will largely benefit, because, though they will secure almost 
          all the immediate good results of the expenditure, they will pay less 
          than half the increased taxation. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, fortunately, we have a Chancellor of the Exchequer 
          who will know how to raise the money required for the salvation of the 
          destitute from the excessive and harmful accumulations of the very rich. 
          The lower and middle classes, therefore, will ultimately pay either 
          nothing at all or a very small fraction of the amount required for the 
          increased wages, while they are the classes which will most largely 
          benefit by the general prosperity caused by its expenditure. It must 
          surely be <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 37]]</font> better for 
          the country to preserve the very poor in health and strength, and to 
          give them the training which will enable them to do productive work 
          as soon as we provide it for them, than to allow them to die and want, 
          and its resulting diseases, as we do now. It is simply irrational to 
          say, as many do, that these people are constitutionally unable to support 
          themselves. They belong to the very same class as those who, both here 
          and in the Colonies, and throughout the whole civilised world, not only 
          <i>do</i> support themselves, but, in addition, support everybody else, 
          and at the same time produce <i>all the luxuries and costly amusements 
          of the wealthy.</i> It is clear, therefore, that it is not the fault 
          of the poor that so many of them are compulsorily idle or starving, 
          but of the Government which proclaims itself unable to give them productive 
          work. There cannot possibly be such a difference in nature <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          38]]</font> between the same class when employed and when unemployed. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another objection, a little less obviously irrational, 
          is, that if the Government itself were to provide all its Army and Navy 
          clothing and other necessary stores, weapons, etc., some of the former 
          contractors will be ruined. But they will only suffer if they have hitherto 
          sweated their workers, and you cannot abolish sweating without some 
          temporary suffering to the sweaters. But even such employers will get 
          compensation. The high wages paid for all Government work will be almost 
          wholly spent in the neighbourhood of the public factories and offices, 
          and benefit everybody by the increase of trade. A further benefit will 
          accrue through the increased expenditure of the many thousands of Custom 
          House, Excise, Post Office, and other employees, whose higher wages 
          and salaries would be immediately distributed among the various <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          39]]</font> producers and retailers of the necessaries and comforts 
          of life--that is, among those constituting what we term generally &quot;the 
          middle classes,&quot; who may be said to constitute the very backbone of 
          the country.</p>

            The Problem of Wages</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p><i>High Wages Are Good for Everybody</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we look at the great problem of wages, as affecting 
          the entire life and well-being of about three-fourths of the whole population, 
          and try and divest ourselves of our ideas of what wages a particular 
          kind of worker is worth, without any regard to the material and mental 
          well-being of his wife and children, we shall be forced to the conclusion 
          that nothing is so <i>hurtful</i> to the community at large, especially 
          to the middle classes, as for the wages or earnings of all kinds of 
          workers to be low; and nothing is so <i>beneficial</i> as for them to 
          be high. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 41]]</font> 
          A Government cannot benefit its people at large more surely than by 
          establishing a very high <i>minimum wage</i> for really necessary or 
          useful work. Every thinker agrees (as they did at the Industrial Remuneration 
          Conference held twenty-five years ago) that our aim and object should 
          be &quot;<i>to cause wealth to be more equally distributed.&quot;</i> Yet, during 
          the whole period that has elapsed since that Conference was held, successive 
          Governments have acted as if their object was the <i>very reverse;</i> 
          with the natural result of increasing the number both of millionaires 
          at one end of the scale, and of the excessively poor and destitute at 
          the other. And they actually claim this as a merit; for their supporters 
          always refer to the increase of great fortunes made mostly by foreign 
          trade as a proof of general prosperity, and have always resisted giving 
          their own employees more than a bare competition wage, on the <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          42]]</font> ground that it was their chief duty to save the pockets 
          of the taxpayers! 
        </p><p><i>The Just Basis of Taxation</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till quite recently our various Governments, whatever 
          party has been in power, have claimed it as a merit that they have distributed 
          taxation as equally as possible over the whole community, on the ground 
          that the very poorest ought to contribute something towards the Government 
          of which they are said to receive the benefits of law and order at home, 
          and protection from invasion by foreign armies. We are now seeing the 
          results of this policy in labour unrest, chronic strikes, and terrible 
          destitution. The beginning of a juster and wiser policy has been made 
          in the differential taxation of very large incomes, but only a very 
          small beginning. Justice and humanity alike should lead us to see that 
          those who, by their hard and life-long toil, have created and still 
          create the whole of <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 43]]</font> 
          the national wealth, should not be taxed on the very small portion of 
          that wealth which they have been allowed to retain--a bare sufficiency 
          to support life. Justice and public policy alike demand that every penny 
          of taxation should be taken from the superfluously wealthy at or near 
          the other end of the scale. Thus, and thus only, could we cause the 
          present insufficient <i>minimum</i> wage to rise, first above the bare 
          subsistence rate, and then by a steady increase to an amount sufficient 
          to procure for all our workers the essentials for a full and enjoyable 
          existence. Thus, and thus only, can we solve the crucial problem of 
          our day, that of the long expected and perfectly justifiable revolt 
          of the workers, euphemistically termed the &quot;Labour Unrest.&quot; 
        </p><p><i>The Class-Prejudice Against High Wages</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps more difficult to overcome than <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          44]]</font> the supposed economical dangers of high wages is the class-prejudice. 
          This is really due to differences of education, of forms of speech and 
          of manners, rather than to any real difference either in physical or 
          mental powers. As human beings the workers with their hands, commonly 
          called the &quot;working class,&quot; know themselves to be fully equal to those 
          who look down upon them as inferiors; and they are beginning to resent 
          this claim to superiority. They know, too, that their work is really 
          more important than that of many professional men, such as lawyers and 
          the mass of Government officials, and that the scale of remuneration 
          of the two classes should be more nearly alike. The idea that the work 
          of a carpenter or engineer, of a bricklayer or of a ploughman is intrinsically 
          <i>worth</i> less than that of a Member of Parliament, an officer in 
          the Army, or the owner of a cotton-mill they no longer accept. <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          45]]</font> They have read history, and they know that these class-ideas 
          are derived from feudal times, when all manual labour was done by serfs, 
          or by peasants only one degree higher in the scale. They see many of 
          their own class becoming rich, and then being received as equals by 
          those who term themselves &quot;Society&quot;; and they see, too, that these upstarts, 
          as they are sometimes termed, are often not even the best examples of 
          their own class. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this widespread belief in there being a &quot;lower 
          class&quot; among us--hewers of wood and drawers of water--whose <i>intrinsic 
          worth</i> as human beings is measured by the small wages they receive, 
          that causes the proposal to raise their earnings to what we now term 
          &quot;a living wage&quot; to be widely resented, as if it were something dangerous, 
          unnecessary, or even immoral. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most liberal thinkers now agree that wages<i> ought 
          </i>to be much higher than they <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          46]]</font> are; but unless they rise automatically in obedience to 
          some mysterious economic law, not even the most advanced Government 
          in the most advanced country in the world has yet dared to make the 
          attempt to improve the condition of its vast army of employees by raising 
          them, on principle, well above &quot;the margin of poverty.&quot; So great and 
          so widespread is this objection that there are, perhaps, not more than 
          two or three members of our present Government who would welcome with 
          any approach to enthusiasm such a proposal as I have outlined here. 
          When it was recently stated that certain classes of men in the Navy 
          were to receive an increase of pay it was at first denied, as if it 
          were too extravagant to be thought of by an economical Liberal Government. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, however, certain that we have now reached 
          a point in our political history <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          47]]</font> which will necessitate much more direct and radical measures 
          than have yet been taken to ensure the immediate abolition of that disgrace 
          of our civilisation--starvation, and suicide from dread of starvation. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is for this reason that I have now placed before 
          the public the simplest and most direct method of doing this, without 
          any <i>special</i> legislation; and I most earnestly urge the Labour 
          Party, as well as advanced thinkers of all parties in Parliament, to 
          use their influence with the present Government to give it effect. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wages of the lower classes of Government clerks, 
          etc., are, I believe, being frequently modified by the various heads 
          of departments without any special sanction from Parliament; and as 
          I have now shown how every step of the process of more equal wealth-distribution 
          by a steady rise of wages will injure few or none, but will in various 
          ways benefit us <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 48]]</font> all, 
          there can be no sufficiently serious objection to its being immediately 
          begun. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also with equal earnestness urge upon the 
          Government <i>itself</i> to press forward this matter--the abolition 
          of destitution--without a single day's further delay. Every day sees 
          numerous deaths by starvation at our very doors. Yet these have come 
          to be looked upon as due to &quot;natural causes,&quot; implying that it is quite 
          a natural and inevitable thing that, in this super-wealthy country, 
          thousands of men, women, and children should be continually starving! 
          Were not the position so terribly, so disgracefully pathetic, it would 
          be ludicrous. It reminds one of David Copperfield's arrival at his aunt's 
          house at Dover in a dreadfully dilapidated condition after a six days' 
          walk from London, having slept every night in the fields. Mr. Dick was 
          called to hear his story; and on being asked by Miss Betsy Trotwood 
          what she <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 49]]</font> should do 
          with him, looked him all over very carefully, and said without hesitation: 
          &quot;If I were you, I should wash him.&quot; On which Miss Betsy ordered a hot 
          bath to be got ready, declaring that Mr. Dick sets us all right! 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the most advanced and Liberal Government we 
          have ever had, has for the last seven years looked on tens of thousands 
          of destitute humanity far worse off than was David Copperfield, without 
          arriving at the practical wisdom of <i>first </i>feeding and clothing 
          them, and <i>afterwards</i> inquiring and discussing how to prevent 
          them from getting into the same trouble again. I, therefore, take the 
          place of poor Mr. Dick as an adviser, and venture to assure them that 
          the problem is <i>not</i> really insoluble, and that the common idea, 
          that the pitiable condition of the starving population is &quot;<i>their 
          own fault,&quot;</i> is <i>not</i> the correct diagnosis of this social disease. 
        </p><p><font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 50]] </font><i>Popular Errors 
          as to the Effects of High Wages on Prices</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most common objections to a general increase 
          of wages, and one of the most difficult to reply to, is, that it would 
          inevitably lead to a general rise of prices, equal to, and sometimes 
          greater than, the increase of wages. The reason why it is difficult 
          to reply to this supposed fact is because the retail prices of the necessaries 
          of life depend upon a variety of causes, of which a rise or fall in 
          the wages of those who produce them is sometimes an important and at 
          other times a very unimportant item; and also because, as a matter of 
          fact, wages and prices have, sometimes, risen or fallen together as 
          if they were directly connected. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This whole question of the well-being of the wage-receiving 
          classes is often obscured by considering wages alone, or hours of working, 
          or prices of food, which <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 51]]</font> 
          may all vary in different degrees, and be due to quite different causes. 
          The result thus reached is often largely modified by an increase of 
          rents, of rates, or in the price of such a necessary as coals, while 
          a still further complication is introduced by local causes, such as 
          the time, labour, or cost of reaching his place of work, which may seriously 
          reduce a workman's net earnings, as well as his hours of actual labour. 
          Personal observation during the last fifty years leads me to conclude 
          that, amid constant fluctuations in wages and in food prices, and constant 
          rise in the rental of houses and of land, the average wage-earner has 
          continued to live in much the same low condition as regards the necessaries 
          and comforts of life. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But during this whole period there has been a continuous 
          increase in the numbers of the very poor, the destitute, and the actually

            Self-Supporting Work the Remedy for Unemployment</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of public policy, no less than of common 
          humanity, it is essential that all Government and municipal employees, 
          including labourers of all kinds, be paid a full and sufficient living 
          wage as a <i>minimum,</i> rising to at least the highest trades union 
          wages at the time. To prevent any lowering of the latter, by increase 
          of population, fluctuations in trade, new labour-saving machinery and 
          other causes of unemployment, it is equally essential that those who 
          have hitherto been discharged when no longer wanted should be provided 
          with self-supporting work. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can best be done in connection <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          54]]</font> with the re-occupation of the land, which is now seen to 
          be of vital importance by most social reformers. No more blind and disastrous 
          policy has ever been pursued by a civilised community than that of our 
          wealthy and money-making classes, who have during half-a-century, in 
          pursuit of wealth, discouraged the cultivation of land, and forced the 
          inhabitants of our once numerous self-supporting villages, and especially 
          our half-starved agricultural labourers, into the cities and towns, 
          to be exploited by manufacturers and landlords. The result to-day is 
          a vast mass of unemployed, keeping down wages to the starving point, 
          together with an infant mortality that is a disgrace to a civilised 
          community. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having thus destroyed the old rural populations 
          which were for centuries the pride and strength of Britain, it now becomes 
          the duty of the Government to build up a new and a better form of rural 
          <font color="#990000"> <font size="-1">[[p. 55]]</font></font> society 
          to replace it. To do this we require far stronger measures than the 
          miserable red-tapism of our Small Holdings Acts, which are ludicrously 
          ineffective and even harmful. We have examples in Denmark, in Italy, 
          and even in Ireland, of admirable results of co-operative cultivation, 
          where extensive areas of land are dealt with, and either private or 
          municipal associations help on the work. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this purpose a large portion of the agricultural 
          land of England, which has been so misused by its owners, must be acquired 
          by the Government in trust for the nation. This can be best done by 
          a further increase of the death duties and land taxes; to be paid in 
          land itself instead of in money: while, wherever there are no direct 
          heirs who may have a sentimental affection for their ancestral home, 
          large landed estates of suitable character and position should be purchased 
          <font color="#990000"> <font size="-1">[[p. 56]]</font></font> at the 
          official valuation and utilised at once either by the State, the municipality, 
          trade unions, or co-operative societies, to establish self-supporting 
          colonies, on the plan first clearly described by Mr. Herbert V. Mills 
          in his <i>Poverty and the State</i>, and further developed by myself 
          in the second volume of my <i>Studies, Scientific and Social.</i> 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great essentials in starting such methods of 
          dealing with the problems of poverty and unemployment are <i>liberality 
          </i>and <i>sympathy.</i> Ample funds should be provided for supporting 
          each colony for the first two or three years; the land should be rent-free 
          for at least the same period; and the greatest amount of liberty should 
          be given to all the workers compatible with the success of the experiments. 
          No expense can be too great to establish a system of land re-occupation 
          which will abolish poverty; and just as certainly as a continuous rise 
          in wages will <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 57]]</font> repay 
          its cost in the general well-being of the lower and middle classes, 
          so, with equal certainty, will the still greater expenditure necessary 
          for the productive re-occupation of our uncultivated or half-cultivated 
          soil complete the regeneration, the power, and the safety of the British 
          nation. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone interested in the subject here discussed 
          should read <i>Our National Food Supply</i>, by James Lumsden: perhaps 
          the most original, suggestive, and vitally important work on the subject 
          that has yet appeared. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the injurious results of our competitive 
          system, having its roots, however, in the valuable &quot;guilds&quot; of a past 
          epoch, is the almost universal restriction of our workers to one kind 
          of labour only. The result is a dreadful monotony in almost all kinds 
          of work, the extreme unhealthiness of many, and a much larger amount 
          <font color="#990000"> <font size="-1">[[p. 58]]</font></font> of unemployment 
          than if each man or woman were regularly trained in two or more occupations. 
          In addition to two of what are commonly called trades, every youth should 
          be trained for one day a week or one week in a month, according to demand 
          for labour, in some of the various operations of farming or gardening. 
          Not only would this improve the general health of the workers, but also 
          add much to the interest and enjoyment of their lives. This is a matter 
          of great national importance, because it would supply in every locality 
          a body of trained workers ready to assist the farmers at all critical 
          periods, and thus save valuable crops from almost total loss during 
          unfavourable seasons. The gain to the whole nation by such a supply 
          of labour, whenever needed, would be enormous, and it would also lead 
          to pleasant social meetings like those of the &quot;bees&quot; in the early years 
          <font color="#990000"> <font size="-1">[[p. 59]]</font></font> of American 
          colonisation. Such gatherings would combine a holiday with national 
          service, when the whole strength of the population would be put forth 
          to save the national food. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This form of multiple industrial training should 
          be commenced at once in connection with all Government employment; and 
          it should be further developed as a part of our system of education, 
          in the various colonies or villages established for the absorption of 
          the unemployed. Its advantages would be so great both to the workers 
          and to the nation, that the various trade unions may be expected to 
          adopt it; and they should be assisted to do so by ample Government grants, 
          or by the free provision of the land and buildings required, so long 
          as they were used for this great national service.</p>

          <p><font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 60]] </font><b>Chapter IX. The 
            Economies of Co-Ordinated Labour</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be well here to consider what would be the 
          economic result if the labour of the whole country were completely organised 
          and its various departments co-ordinated, so that production and consumption 
          should be as nearly as possible balanced in the various local communities. 
          This local co-ordination of production and distribution has never, hitherto, 
          been attempted on an adequate scale, yet it is through such co-ordination 
          alone that co-operative labour can produce its most beneficial results, 
          by means of a number of hitherto unknown and apparently almost unsuspected 
          economies, to the enormous gain of the whole community. The more <font color="#990000" size="-1">[[p. 
          61]]</font> important <font color="#990000"> </font> of these may be 
          briefly enumerated. The first of these great economies would arise from 
          the absence of surplus crops or manufactured goods beyond the ascertained 
          monthly or yearly amount required for the use of the local population. 
          From this approximate balance of production with consumption the proportional 
          cost of each article in labour-power would be calculated, and their 
          several exchange-values or true economic prices be ascertained. The 
          use of a more expensive article when a less costly one would be equally 
          serviceable would then be easily checked, and the great loss incurred 
          by the forced sale of such articles would cease. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far more important than this, however, would be 
          the entire abolition of every form of advertisement, such as those in 
          our newspapers and placards, in costly shop-windows, in high rents, 
          and in the employment of a whole army of agents <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          62]]</font> and commercial travellers, whose business is to puff and 
          exaggerate the qualities of their respective goods, so as to induce 
          retailers and private purchasers to buy things that are of little or 
          no use to them, and often, as in the case of foods and medicines, positively 
          injurious. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been estimated that, on the average, these 
          costly processes of competitive sale lead to the consumer paying about 
          double, and in some cases much more than double, the real cost of production. 
          Here, then, we have an economy which would enable wages to be largely 
          increased, and sometimes even doubled, without adding to the retail 
          price of the various necessaries or comforts of life. But even this 
          would not be the whole of the economy that would follow such a mode 
          of truly co-ordinated production for use and not for profit. It is well 
          known that in all manufactured goods a large economy results <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          63]]</font> from an increased demand, enabling the whole of the machinery 
          to be almost continuously employed at its full power. In addition to 
          this, another economy of the same nature, but perhaps of still greater 
          extent, would arise from there being no such necessity for the manufacture 
          of <i>new articles</i> or new patterns or colours every year, as the 
          competition of numerous manufacturers now compels them to seek for. 
          These new things or patterns are often very inferior to the older ones, 
          which the purchaser is assured &quot;are quite gone out now.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a concomitant of the competitive system, two 
          almost world-wide immoralities are created: one is the universal practice 
          of adulteration and the accompanying false descriptions of things sold; 
          the other is the equally vast system of false weights and measures, 
          which, though of small amount to each purchaser, secures an unfair profit 
          <font color="#990000"> <font size="-1">[[p. 64]]</font></font> at his 
          expense. Our present competitive social system is, therefore, necessarily 
          immoral, as well as extremely wasteful; yet, strange to say, it is almost 
          universally held to be a necessary and a right system, founded on natural 
          and unchangeable laws of social life. Those who see most clearly its 
          evil results, and trace them to their root causes, monopoly and competition, 
          are almost always condemned as unpractical idealists or dangerous revolutionists. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another proof of the fundamental error of this system 
          of society which is held to be so good and sacred as to be essentially 
          unalterable is equally conducive. For more than a century this system 
          has been slowly elaborated by a body of able men who are so admired 
          by us, that we term them our &quot;Merchant princes&quot; and our &quot;Captains of 
          industry.&quot; Many of them are enormously wealthy and are supposed to be 
          especially qualified as Members of Parliament, and <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          65]]</font> they possess great influence in directing the course of 
          legislation. Yet this wealth and power were obtained by means of a system 
          of industry which soon became a byword for all that was vile and degrading 
          to the workers who were employed. Everything was arranged so as to get 
          the most profit out of the &quot;hands,&quot; as the factory-workers were termed. 
          The mills were unhealthy, the wages low, and the hours of labour long. 
          In the early part of the nineteenth century, children of five or six 
          years old were kept in the mills thirteen or fourteen hours a day, and 
          were often flogged by the overseers to keep them awake; and it needed 
          a long succession of Factory Laws, all bitterly opposed by the employers, 
          to mitigate the evils which till recently existed, and which were only 
          got rid of by the continued efforts of a few determined humanitarians. 
          An army of inspectors had to be appointed to see that these laws <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          66]]</font> were obeyed. Yet even now the net result of our strictly 
          supervised manufacturing system is that whole districts are defaced 
          by dense palls of smoke, and the vegetation is often destroyed by poisonous 
          vapours; that our great cities are disfigured by hideous and filthy 
          slums; that a large proportion of our manufactures are carried on under 
          such conditions as to produce painful disabling or fatal diseases; while 
          the infant mortality in all these areas of wealth-production, of which 
          we are so proud, is about double what it is in other parts of the same 
          towns or cities. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various facts and considerations now adduced 
          demonstrate that a well-arranged system of co-operative production and 
          co-ordinated distribution, whether carried out by the Government, municipality, 
          or private associations of the workers, which the trade unions <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          67]]</font> themselves might combine to establish, would result in so 
          many economies in various directions as to render it possible in a few 
          years to double, or more than double, the effective wages the workers 
          now receive, but which, under existing conditions, they can only hope 
          to raise by the slow and costly process of recurrent strikes. This sketch 
          of the economics of the problem is now brought before the Labour Party 
          in order that it may have a definite programme to work for, and may 
          be able to enforce its claims upon the Government with all the weight 
          of its combined and determined action.</p>

            Effect of High Wages Upon Foreign Trade</b> 
        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now shown that an increase in the rate of 
          wages does not necessarily raise prices in a proportionate degree, but, 
          on the contrary, that, under conditions not difficult to obtain, such 
          enormous economies both in production and distribution may be effected 
          as to result in a very large balance in favour both of the producer 
          and the consumer. This, however, relates to our home trade only, and 
          it will be said, and has often been said, that as regards our foreign 
          trade the case is quite different. In such goods as minerals, metal-work, 
          and most textile fabrics, wages form a large portion of the cost, and 
          it is argued that a <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 69]]</font> 
          considerable rise will render us quite unable to compete with Germany, 
          France, or America in the chief markets of the world. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, it is a remarkable circumstance that the Labour 
          Party and their friends in and out of Parliament seem to be quite unaware 
          of the fallacy of this statement. It is quite true that if wages rose 
          in one industry only, our foreign trade might be injured or even ruined 
          in those special goods. But if, as is here supposed to be the case, 
          there was a general rise of wages in all industries, such as would be 
          caused by bringing about a high &quot;living wage,&quot; sufficient at its lowest 
          to keep every workman and his family in health and comfort with a reasonable 
          amount of the enjoyments of life, then our foreign trade in the markets 
          of the world would not in any way be diminished or become less profitable. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This results from the fact admitted by <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          70]]</font> all political economists, that foreign trade is essentially 
          barter, since we send abroad those goods which we produce at the lowest 
          cost proportionately, and import those only which no other country produces 
          at a lower proportionate cost than we do. In this set of transactions, 
          as a whole, the part played by money is merely to enable both parties 
          to keep their accounts and determine what goods it is advantageous to 
          them to export and what to import. Hence money has been defined as the 
          &quot;tool of exchange.&quot; If, therefore, our wages bill were doubled by the 
          adoption of a high &quot;minimum wage,&quot; that would not make any alteration 
          (or very little) in the <i>proportionate cost</i> of the things we export 
          and those we import. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This question is discussed with great care and thoroughness 
          by J. S. Mill, in his great work, <i>The Principles of Political Economy</i>; 
          but as the subject is referred <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          71]]</font> to more than once, and for different purposes, it requires 
          very close attention to realise its full importance. It is discussed 
          most fully in his Book III., Chap. XVII., &quot;Of International Trade,&quot; 
          where he says: &quot;It is not a difference in the <i>absolute</i> cost of 
          production which determines the interchange, but a difference in the 
          comparative cost&quot;; and this is illustrated by an account of many actual 
          cases of our dealings with other countries, in which he shows that--&quot;We 
          may often by trading with foreigners obtain their commodities at a smaller 
          expense of labour and capital than they cost to the foreigners themselves. 
          The bargain is still advantageous to the foreigner, because the commodity 
          which he receives in exchange, though it has cost us less, would have 
          cost him more.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, later on, in Chap. XXV. of the same Book, 
          dealing with &quot;Competition of Countries in the same Market&quot; (page 414 
          of The People's Edition), he says, as a <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          72]]</font> terse summary of the facts and arguments he has set forth: 
          &quot;General low wages never caused any country to undersell its rivals, 
          nor did general high wages ever hinder it from doing so.&quot; 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I venture to hope that, in future, the speakers 
          among the Labour Party in Parliament will not allow the bugbear of &quot;ruin 
          to our foreign trade&quot; to deter them from claiming their admitted right 
          to a &quot;living wage&quot; throughout the whole country. Such wage must be determined 
          by what is needed to supply an average working-man's family with all 
          the necessaries of life in ample abundance, together with all such modest 
          comforts as are beneficial to health of mind and body. It must be estimated 
          as payment for five or five and a half days of eight hours each at the 
          utmost, any overtime necessitated by the nature of the employment <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 
          73]]</font> or by exceptional events to be paid at double the normal 
          rates. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now shown that a general rise of wages, if 
          accompanied by the absorption of all the unemployed in duly co-ordinated 
          <i>productive labour</i>, so far from raising prices in the open market, 
          will result in so many and such great economies as to allow of a considerable 
          lowering of price of the chief necessaries and comforts of life, and 
          will, therefore, add still further to the well-being of the whole of 
          the workers, whether skilled or unskilled, whether receiving wages from 
          capitalist employers, or working in co-operative and self-supporting 
          village communities.</p>

        </p></center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now endeavoured to place before my readers, 
          and especially before the Labour Party, the series of economic fallacies 
          which alone prevent them from claiming and obtaining, for the workers 
          of the whole country, a continuously increasing share of the entire 
          product of their labour. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief of these fallacies is, that there is any 
          <i>necessary</i> connection between wages and prices, so that the former 
          cannot be raised without the latter increasing also to an equal amount. 
          Of course, in such a fundamentally unjust social system as that in which 
          we live, we cannot abolish <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 75]]</font><i> 
          all</i> the wrongs and evils of low wages, unemployment, and starvation, 
          by a more just and rational system without partial and temporary losses 
          to a few individuals; but by adopting the course here advocated, these 
          losses will be small in amount and quickly remedied. This will be especially 
          the case with our foreign trade, as to which it has been again and again 
          asserted that higher wages will lead to ruin. But, as has been clearly 
          shown in the preceding chapter, no such loss would occur if high wages 
          were universal, such as would result from a general minimum of 30s. 
          or &pound;2 a week for every adult worker in the kingdom, while a large 
          majority would receive much more than this. Even in such an extreme 
          case as this our merchants might continue to export and import the same 
          products in the same quantities as before, and with the same average 
          amount of profit. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 76]]</font> 
          Recurring to the statements of Mr. Vernon Hartshorn and Mr. Anderson 
          as to what the workers insist upon as the very lowest living wage, but 
          which it is clear they will <i>never</i> obtain by negotiation with 
          their employers, I again urge upon them to concentrate their rapidly 
          increasing influence and voting power upon the Government, compelling 
          it to use the full resources of the National Credit to abolish starvation 
          at once, and simultaneously to organise the vast body of Government 
          employees in such a manner as to be able to absorb into its ranks the 
          whole of the unemployed workers as they arise. These may be looked upon 
          as the waste product of our disorganised and inhuman competitive system, 
          indicating the fermentation and disease ever going on in its lower depths. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle of competition--a life and death struggle 
          for bare existence-- <font size="-1" color="#990000">[[p. 77]]</font> 
          has had more than a century's unbroken trial under conditions created 
          by its upholders, <i>and it has absolutely failed.</i> The workers, 
          now for the first time, know <i>why</i> it is that with ever-increasing 
          production of wealth so many of them still suffer the most terrible 
          extremes of want and of preventable disease. There must, therefore, 
          be no further compromise, no mere talking. To allow the present state 
          of things to continue is a crime against humanity. Any Government that 
          <i>will</i> not abolish starvation in this land of superfluous wealth 
          must be driven from power. The forces of Labour, if united in the demand 
          for this one <i>primary</i> object, must and will succeed. Then will 
          easily follow the general rise of wages at the cost of our unprecedented 
          individual wealth, and the absorption of the unemployed in self-supporting 
          communities, re-occupying our deserted land, and bringing about a more 
          <font color="#990000"> <font size="-1">[[p. 78]]</font></font> general 
          and more beneficial prosperity than our country has ever before enjoyed. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be the great and noble work of our statesmen 
          of to-day and of to-morrow. May they prove themselves equal to the great 
          opportunity which the justifiable revolt of Labour has now afforded 
          them.</p>

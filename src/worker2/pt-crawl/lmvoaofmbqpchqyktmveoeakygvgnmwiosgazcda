      Yellowstone Wildland Fire Dispatch Office</a> and fire monitors are sent 
      to investigate.&nbsp; First, monitors determine the cause of the fire 
      (human-caused or lightning strike).&nbsp; Fires caused by human activity are 
      suppressed but natural fires are allowed to burn as long as they do not 
      threaten people, property or resource values.&nbsp;After determining that a 
      fire start, or ignition, is natural, monitors

      information that will allow the Fire Management Office to decide what 
      management action should be taken.&nbsp; If management criteria are met, 
      the fire may be left to burn as a natural ecosystem process.&nbsp; Such fires 
      are called wildland fires for resource benefit (WFRB) or fire-use fires.&nbsp; 
      Once a fire is designated as a fire-use fire it must be managed.&nbsp; Fire 
      Management requires information on weather, fuels, and values at risk 
      which fire monitors provide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitors record the fire location, hourly 
      weather, site

      vegetation</a>, slope-aspect, fuel loading, flame length, and rate of 
      spread.&nbsp; Digital images are taken depicting fire behavior and the fuels 
      that are carrying the fire.&nbsp; Fire monitors also map the perimeter of the 
      fire daily to help measure the fire’s progression. This information is 
      relayed to the Fire Dispatch Office.&nbsp; Monitors also collect samples of 
      fuels for moisture<img border="0" src="/web/20070206135523im_/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/fanfx.jpg" align="right" alt="Fire monitors record fuel loading and weather information.  2003 Fan Creek Fire." width="153" height="400"> 
      analysis.&nbsp; Fuels may include tree foliage, herbaceous vegetation, forest 
      floor litter, and dead logs in various size classes.&nbsp; The fuel samples are 
      weighed, dried in an oven, and re-weighed.&nbsp; The resulting fuel moisture 
      figures allow fire managers to anticipate how intensely and quickly a fire 
      will spread.&nbsp; Fire monitors may observe small, smoldering fires for a 
      short time every few days. They may also camp out on large, remote fires 
      for days or weeks at a time, continuing to collect information on fire 
      behavior, fuels, and weather.&nbsp; Often fire monitors will deploy 
      weather instruments such as a remote automated weather station. On larger 
      fires, fire behavior analysts and long-term fire analysts are often 
      utilized to help assess the fire conditions. They also use information 
      provided by fire monitors to predict fire&nbsp;intensity and spread rate.</p>

      temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, dew point, winds, fuel 
      moisture, and lightning occurrence which are used to determine current and 
      expected fire danger.&nbsp; This large volume of weather and fuel moisture data 
      from all parts of the park is processed to identify areas of potentially 
      problematic fire behavior in the event of an ignition.</p>

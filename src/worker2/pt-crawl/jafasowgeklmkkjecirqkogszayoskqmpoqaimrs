&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>&#167; 5-7.5  "<b><font color ="#600502">Aloha</font></b> Spirit".</b>
(a)
"<b><font color ="#600502">Aloha</font></b> Spirit" is the coordination of mind and
heart within
each person. It brings each person to the self. Each person must think and emote good feelings to
others. In the contemplation and presence of the life force, "<b><font color
="#600502">Aloha</font></b>", the following <b><font color ="#600502">unuhi laul&#257;
loa</font></b>
may be used:<BR> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          "<b><font color ="#600502">Akahai</font></b>", meaning kindness to be expressed with
tenderness; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         "<b><font color ="#600502">L&#333;kahi</font></b>", meaning unity, to be expressed with
harmony;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         "<b><font color ="#600502">&#699;Olu&#699;olu</font></b>" meaning agreeable, to be expressed with
pleasantness;<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        "<b><font color ="#600502">Ha&#699;aha&#699;a</font></b>", meaning humility, to be expressed with
modesty;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        "<b><font color ="#600502">Ahonui</font></b>", meaning patience, to be expressed with
perseverance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These are traits of character that express the charm, warmth and sincerity of
Hawaii's people.
It was the working philosophy of native Hawaiians and was presented as a gift to the people of
Hawai&#699;i. ''<b><font color ="#600502">Aloha</font></b>'' is more than a word of greeting or
farewell or a
salutation. ''<b><font color ="#600502">Aloha</font></b>'' means
mutual regard and affection and extends warmth in caring with no obligation in return.
"<b><font color ="#600502">Aloha</font></b>"
is the essence of relationships in which each person is important to every other person for
collective existence. ''<b><font color ="#600502">Aloha</font></b>'' means to hear what is not
said, to
see what cannot be seen and to
know the unknowable.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) In exercising their power on behalf of the people and in fulfillment of their
responsibilities, obligations and service to the people, the legislature, governor, lieutenant
governor, executive officers of each department, the chief justice, associate justices, and judges
of the appellate, circuit, and district courts may contemplate and reside with the life force and
give consideration to the "<b><font color ="#600502">Aloha</font></b> Spirit". [L 1986, c

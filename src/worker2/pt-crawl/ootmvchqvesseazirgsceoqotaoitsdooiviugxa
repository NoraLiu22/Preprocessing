<h2>Herbivore Defenses of Senecio viscosus L.</h2>
<p>

Sticky groundsel, Senecio viscosus, is rare in the Ottawa area. According to Gray's
Manual of Botany, a major environmental niche for it on this continent is railway ballast, and
that's where I almost always find it here. Its fine roots wind over stone surfaces, apparently to
scavenge moisture that condenses between the stones most nights. Its leaves are succulent to
store water. A specimen that I collected had no visible soil at all on its roots. Yet, after planting
in my garden, it continued to develop buds, bloom, and set seed as if nothing had ever disturbed
it.
<p>
The compound that makes its leaves sticky (and scented; people who don't like plants call it
stinking groundsel!) is a pesticide - it helps to defend the plant against herbivores. Grazing
animals are pests to plants, after all, and the leaves of most Senecio species contain
chemicals which can kill most insects and grazing animals in a single meal. However, caterpillars
of the genus Tyria actually seek out Senecio. They store the chemicals
in their bodies, presumably to make them in turn unpalatable to their own predators. The hairs of
sticky groundsel, however, exude an additional compound, which specifically deters
Tyria caterpillars. The strategy seems to be successful here, for there was no visible
insect damage to any of the plants I found.
<p>
Sticky groundsel seems to require something very specific (and obscure) to produce its defensive
chemicals. My specimen produced 43 blooms, with an average of 52 seeds per seed head. Each
seed has a gossamer-fine cone of 6mm hairs that catches the slightest breeze. There is nothing I
can discern about the roadbed where it grew that differs from other parts of the adjacent 10km of
groundsel-free roadbed that I have walked. The same puzzlement was expressed by Cole, who
reported the first known occurrence of this plant in the Ottawa District (Trail &amp; Landscape
4:16-17;1970).
<p>
Senecio viscosus is a fascinating little plant, that raises all sorts of natural
questions. Are pesticides such as it produces really as much less common in land plants than in
coral reefs as literature indicates? Or, perhaps, have people had blinkers on with regard to such
questions? Nature may be green in 'tooth and claw' too, not just red!

S.viscosus contains only senecionine. S. poisoning is 'Pictou disease' in Nova Scotia. The LD50
of S.alkaloids ranges from 58 to 830mg/kg, 44 references.

The sticky hairs of S.viscosus contain something additional which can be dissolved off in methyl
alcohol, making the S.viscosus appetizing for T.j., and transferred to another plant, making it
unappetizing.
<li>von Borstel 1986 Plant Cell Reports 5:39-42 Alkaloids, particularly N-oxides of
pyrrolizadine are produced in all S.sp., resulting in liver carcinomas in livestock. S.viscosus
contains a specific membrane carrier for this alkaloid. It is believed to inhibit insect herbivores,
but few experiments have been done.

<li>Lambert 1979 Physiologia Plantarum 46:194-202 There are 3 oxygen-using mechanisms in
roots, one for synthesis of shoots, a cyanide-resistant alternative electron-transport chain
(Solomos 1977), and a third one of unknown origin; the latter two are 'wasteful'. S.viscosus has a
high oxygen requirement for shoot synthesis. Excess sugar in root cells decreases their
permeability to water. S.viscosus is intolerant of flooding (ibid 43:277-281 &amp; 42:163-166).
<li>Sheldon 1973 New Phytologist 72:665-675 The terminal velocity of Cirsium arvense seeds

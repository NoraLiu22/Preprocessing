<h2>Three Volcanic Cycles of Yellowstone</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Three extraordinarily large explosive eruptions in the past 2.1 
million years each created a giant caldera within or west of 
Yellowstone National Park with the spread of enormous volumes of hot, 
fragmented volcanic rocks as pyroclastic flows over vast areas within 
times as short as a few days or weeks. The accumulated hot ash, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070318093739/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/pumice.html">pumice</a>, 
and other rock fragments welded together from their heat and the weight 
of overlying material to form extensive sheets of hard lava-like rock. 
In some sections, these welded ash-flow tuffs are more than 400 m thick! 
These ash-flow sheets&#151;from oldest to youngest, the Huckleberry Ridge, 
Mesa Falls, and Lava Creek Tuffs&#151;account for more than half the 
material erupted from Yellowstone. The enormous outpouring of magma, 
280 to 2,450 km<sup>3</sup> during each explosive event, led to the 
collapse of magma-chamber roofs, causing the ground above to subside 
by many hundreds of meters to form the calderas.</p>


<p>Before and after these caldera-forming events, eruptions in the Yellowstone
area produced rhyolitic and basaltic rocks&#151;large rhyolite lava flows and some 
smaller pyroclastic flows in and near where the calderas collapsed and 
basalt lava flows around the margins of the calderas.</p>

<p>A general sequence of events was repeated in the evolution of each of 
Yellowstone's three volcanic cycles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A broad area, larger than that which will become the caldera is slowly 
    uplifted. This uplift reflects the development and rise of large volumes of 
    rhyolite to form a magma chamber at shallow depths in the Earth's crust. 
    Stretching of the crust above the inflating magma chamber leads to concentric and
    radial fracturing and faulting at the surface, typically accompanied by the 
    extrusion of lava flows from these fractures.<br>
  </li><br>
  <li>At a critical stage in the evolution of the magma chamber, enormous
    volumes of the overpressurized rhyolite magma erupt explosively through 
    the ring-fracture zone created above the magma chamber during inflation 
    and uplift, producing extensive ash-flow sheets. As the eruptions partly 
    empty the chamber of its magma, the roof of the magma chamber collapses 
    along the same ring fractures to produce a large caldera.<br>
  </li><br>
  <li>Postcollapse volcanism includes the extrusion of rhyolite lavas and
    smaller explosive eruptions of pyroclastic flows within or adjacent to the
    the caldera. In the present-day Yellowstone caldera, lakes formed where streams 
    draining into or along the margin of the caldera were dammed by these thick 
    intracaldera rhyolite flows, including Shoshone, Lewis, Heart, and Yellowstone 
    Lakes. Shortly following collapse, the caldera floor may be uplifted by hundreds 
    of meters in a process known as resurgent doming; this uplift reflects 
    renewed pressure as magma rises again into the magma chamber. Hydrothermal 
    activity (such as hot springs and geysers) occurs during all three stages but, 
    in the third stage, it becomes the dominant or only visible sign at the 
    surface of magmatic activity below.</li>

<h3>Overall Stratigraphy: major volcanic units of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field</h3>

<p>The recognition of the three volcanic cycles provides a natural basis for
dividing the volcanic rock layers in the Yellowstone area. The
major ash-flow tuffs that erupted at the climax of each cycle are the
primary rock units of Yellowstone in areas beyond the caldera complex. 
The table below represents the work of geologists who identified, described, 
and mapped the different volcanic rock deposits in the Yellowstone area and 
determined the order in which they erupted during each of the three 
cycles of activity. The units are shown in stratigraphic sequence 
(the youngest at the top of the table, oldest at the bottom). Table is
from <a href="#christiansen2001">Christiansen</a> (2001).</p>


<br/><div align="left">
  <table border="1" cellpadding="3" width="100%" summary="This table 
  shows the main volcanic rock units for each of three volcanic 
  cyles, including precaldera rhyolite flows, the caldera-forming 
  ash-flow tuffs, postcaldera rhyolite flows, and the contemporaneous

<p><sup><b>1</b></sup>  <font size="2">Plateau-marginal basaltic volcanism has
been intermittently active throughout the history of the Yellowstone area. The

more than 20 individual flows ranging

<h2>Who is pollinating <em>Pr humiflora</em></h2>

<hr>

<p><img src="logo2.gif" alt="Protea Atlas Logo" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="109">Trish Fleming and Sue
Nicholson, University of Pretoria</p>

<p>In 1978 John Rourke (from the National Botanical Institute) and Del Wiens (from the
USA) published their idea that some <i>Protea</i> species did not rely on the birds and
the bees, and that mammals (of the non-flying variety) could be pollinators too! In
studies carried out at Jonaskop in the western Riviersonderend Mountains in the late
1970&#146;s, they demonstrated that small mammals carried <i>Protea</i> pollen on their
noses, presumably dusted there when they visited flowers for nectar. The source of the
pollen was the <a href="sugar5.htm#prhumi">Patent-leaf Sugarbush <i>Pr&nbsp;humiflora</a>,</i>
pinkish grey bushes about 1m high, growing in dense stands on the rocky slopes.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pr humiflora </i>and its relatives lack the large, obvious, colourful
inflorescences that are held high in the air to attract bird or insect pollinators.
Instead, their inflorescences are cryptic and dull-coloured, often dark brown or peachy
maroon, and hidden under foliage, on or near the ground. Another feature of these flowers
is their sweet nectar, which is between 30 and 60% sugar by weight and rich in sucrose,
sometimes having the texture of syrup. This sweet nectar probably contributes to the musky
smell of the inflorescences. Tony Rebelo has dubbed <i>Pr</i> <i>humiflora</i>,<i>
amplexicaulis</i>,<i> subulifolia</i>, <i>decurrens</i> and <i>cordata</i> the
&quot;Rodent Sugarbushes&quot; (although not all their pollinators are of the
large-incisored variety &#150; see below), while John Rourke classifies them in the
section &quot;Hypocephalae&quot; (meaning &#145;under-head&#146;). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our recent study, also in the Jonaskop area, was designed to determine
how important the nectar and pollen of <i>Pr&nbsp;humiflora</i> are to the animals that
visit these flowers. To keep certain botanists happy, we also asked how important the
mammals were for the plants. This was done by examining seed set in inflorescences at
various heights on Pr&nbsp;humi bushes: it declined with increasing height above ground
(presumably since the mice don&#146;t climb too high). We also placed wire cages around
other inflorescences, preventing animals larger than insects from foraging on the
inflorescences. And seed set was reduced by half! That makes the larger pollinators,
presumably mammals, <i>pretty</i> important for these plants. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To find out which mammals were visiting these inflorescences was a
little more work. We set up permanent trapping grids on two slopes where Pr&nbsp;humi is
abundant. At each site we had two grids, and removed all the inflorescences from bushes on
one of them. The other grid served as a control, allowing us to determine how the numbers
of mammals change with season, without removing the flower resources. Then we trapped
every month, from winter when Pr&nbsp;humi was flowering, through the mammal breeding
seasons to summer.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most common mammal in our traps was the Namaqua Rock Mouse (<i>Aethomys
namaquensis</i>). There were substantial numbers of <i>Protea</i> pollen grains on the
noses of these guys, so they are definitely visiting Pr&nbsp;humi. Unfortunately, <i>Aethomys
</i>also have an appetite for the flowers themselves, and given their less than adequate
tongue for the delicate business of nectar-lapping, these animals probably resort to
chewing the flower styles to the base in order to gain access to nectar. Such destruction
is hardly aiding the plants&#146; reproductive cause. Interestingly, <i>Aethomys</i> were
oblivious to our removing inflorescences, and were probably more interested in their own
social problems (mates and housing in particular).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The smallest mammals in our traps were Cape Spiny Mice (<i>Acomys
subspinosus</i>). These little mice are not common, and were only found at one of our
sites, but here their numbers were significantly reduced after removal of inflorescences.
Spiny Mice appeared in traps near the most profusely flowering bushes. During winter,
these mice fed almost exclusively in Sugarbush inflorescences, with an average of 30% of
the volume of their scats being <i>Protea</i> pollen grains - for some individuals this
figure reached 80%. We have no idea how much nectar they consume, since nectar is so
easily digested (unlike pollen), but we guess that it would be a significant amount.
Interestingly, <i>Acomys</i> appears to be an opportunistic breeder, and was breeding
during flowering of Pr humi, presumably utilising the extra resources provided by the
flowers. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most surprising candidate for pollination of Pr&nbsp;humi<i> </i>was
the Cape Rock Elephant Shrew (<i>Elephantulus edwardii</i>). Why surprising? Well, this
isn&#146;t even a rodent; elephant shrews are insectivorous and belong to a totally
different order, the Macroscelididae. And yet these shrews were hopping around the Fynbos
with large <i>Protea</i> pollen loads on their delicate little trunks (noses, that is).
Because of less fastidious grooming, they have more pollen on their faces and less in
their faeces than <i>Aethomys</i> and <i>Acomys</i>. They may even be better pollinators,
since they don&#146;t eat plant material. In fact, they may not even be after the nectar:
we suspect that they are foraging in inflorescences for ants and other insects. They also
have massive home ranges, far greater than those of the rodents, benefiting the plants by
increasing genetic flow <i>via</i> pollen transfer.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So much for who IS pollinating Pr&nbsp;humi. We also caught a few other
species that did not appear to be strong candidates for pollinators in the 2000 flowering
season. Low numbers of Striped Mice (<i>Rhabdomys pumilio</i>) were trapped (although they
were around half of Rourke&#146;s and Wiens&#146; captures), and most were caught after
flowering. The Vlei Rat <i>Otomys</i> we captured had few pollen grains on noses or in
scats, and are more likely to eat the flowers than pollinate them.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have seen Pr humi, then you will surely recall the harsh and
inhospitable conditions it lives in, preferring the hot, dry, north slopes of mountains.
The next time you are there, think about the mammals that live there too, and what a treat
those nectar-rich inflorescences must be. Although the plants have a patchy range and a
limited flowering season, for the mammals, the carbohydrate-laden nectar and protein-rich
pollen make these cryptic, hidden inflorescences well worth the search. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Readers may recall that a few years ago the Cape Spiny Mouse made our
cover of PAN 26 as the first (and still only) known cacher or hoarder of Conebush seeds. <br>
So when it is not busy sowing Conebush seeds it is pollinating Proteas. Perhaps we should
rename it <br>
the Cape Protea Mouse?</i></p>

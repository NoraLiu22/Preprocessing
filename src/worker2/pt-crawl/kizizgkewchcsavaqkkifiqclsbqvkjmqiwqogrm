/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 325]]</font> In one of 
          my latest conversations with Darwin he expressed himself very gloomily
 on the future of humanity, on the ground that in our modern civilisation 
          natural selection had no play, and the fittest did not survive. Those
 who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most 
          intelligent, and it is notorious that our population is more largely
 renewed in each generation from the lower than from the middle and upper 
          classes. As a recent American writer well puts it, &quot;We behold
          the melancholy spectacle of the renewal  of the great mass of society
          from the lowest classes, the highest classes to a great extent either
          not marrying or not having children. The floating population is always
          the scum, and yet the stream of life is largely  renewed from this
          source. Such a state of affairs, sufficiently dangerous in any society,
        is simply suicidal in the democratic civilisation of  our day.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That
          the check to progress here indicated is a real  one few will deny,
          and the problem is evidently felt to be one of vital importance, since
          it has attracted the attention of some of our most thoughtful writers,
          and has quite recently furnished the theme for a perfect flood of articles
          in our best periodicals. I propose here to consider very briefly the
          various suggestions made by these writers; and afterwards shall endeavour
          to show that when the course of social evolution shall have led to
          a more rational organization of society, the problem will receive its
          final solution by the action of physiological and social agencies,
          and in perfect harmony with the highest interests of humanity. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before discussing the question itself it will be 
          well to consider whether there are in fact any other agencies than some 
          form of selection to be relied on. It has been generally accepted hitherto 
          that such beneficial influences as education, hygiene, and social refinement 
          had a cumulative action, and would of themselves lead to a steady improvement 
          of all civilised races. This view rested on the belief that whatever 
          improvement was effected in individuals was transmitted to their progeny, 
          and that it would be thus possible to effect a continuous advance in 
          physical, moral, and intellectual qualities without any selection of 
          the better or elimination of the inferior types. But of late years grave 
          doubts have been thrown on this view, owing chiefly to the researches 
          of Galton and Weismann as to the fundamental causes to which heredity 
          is due. The balance of opinion amongst physiologists now seems to be 
          against the heredity <font color="#990000">[[p. 326]]</font> of any 
          qualities acquired by the individual after birth, in which case the 
          question we are discussing will be much simplified, since we shall be 
          limited to some form of selection as the only possible means of improving 
          the race. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make the difference between the two 
          theories clear to those who may not have followed the recent discussions 
          on the subject an illustration may be useful. Let us suppose two persons, 
          each striving to produce two distinct types of horse--the cart-horse 
          and the racer--from the wild prairie horses of America, and that one 
          of them believes in the influence of food and training, the other in 
          selection. Each has a lot of a hundred horses to begin with, as nearly 
          as possible alike in quality. The one who trusts to selection at once 
          divides his horses into two lots, the one stronger and heavier, the 
          other lighter and more active, and, breeding from these, continually 
          selects, for the parents of the succeeding generation, those which most 
          nearly approach the two types required. In this way it is perfectly 
          certain that in a comparatively short period--thirty or forty years 
          perhaps--he would be able to produce two very distinct forms, the one 
          a very fair racehorse, the other an equally good specimen of a cart-horse; 
          and he could do this without subjecting the two strains to any difference 
          of food or training, since it <i>is</i> by selection alone that our 
          various breeds of domestic animals have in most cases been produced.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the person who undertook to produce 
          similar results by food and training alone, without allowing selection 
          to have any part in the process, would have to act in a very different 
          manner. He would first divide his horses into two lots as nearly as 
          possible identical in all points, and thereafter subject the one lot 
          to daily exercise in drawing loads at a slow pace, the other lot to 
          equally constant exercise in running, and he might also supply them 
          with different kinds of food if he thought it calculated to aid in producing 
          the required effect. In each successive generation he must make no selection 
          of the swiftest or the strongest, but must either keep the whole progeny 
          of each lot, or carefully choose an average sample of each to be again 
          subjected to the same discipline. It is quite certain that the very 
          different kinds of exercise would have some effect on the individuals 
          so trained, enlarging and strengthening a different set of muscles in 
          each, and if this effect were transmitted to the offspring then there 
          ought to be in this case also a steady advance towards the racer and 
          the cart-horse type. Such an experiment, however, has never been tried, 
          and we cannot therefore say positively what would be the result; but 
          those who accept the theory of the non-heredity of acquired characters 
          would predict with confidence that after thirty or forty generations 
          of training without selection, the last two lots <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          327]]</font> of colts would have made little or no advance towards the 
          two types required but would be practically indistinguishable. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is exceedingly difficult to find any actual cases 
          to illustrate this point, since either natural or artificial selection 
          has almost always been present. The apparent effects of disuse in causing 
          the diminution of certain organs, such as the reduced wings of some 
          birds in oceanic islands and the very small or aborted eyes of some 
          of the animals inhabiting extensive caverns, can be as well explained 
          by the withdrawal of the cumulative agency of natural selection and 
          by economy of growth, as by the direct effects of disuse. The following 
          facts, however, seem to show that special skill derived from practice, 
          when continued for several generations, is not inherited, and does not 
          therefore tend to increase. The wonderful skill of most of the North 
          American Indians in following a trail by indications quite imperceptible 
          to the ordinary European has been dwelt upon by many writers, but it 
          is now admitted that the white trappers equal and often excel them, 
          though these trappers have in almost every case acquired their skill 
          in a comparatively short period, without any of the inherited experience 
          which might belong to the Indian. Again, for many generations a considerable 
          portion of the male population of Switzerland have practised rifle-shooting 
          as a national sport, yet in international contests they show no marked 
          superiority over our riflemen, who are, in a large proportion, the sons 
          of men who never handled a gun. Another case is afforded by the upper 
          classes of this country who for many generations have been educated 
          at the universities, and have had their classical and mathematical abilities 
          developed to the fullest extent by rivalry for honours. Yet now, that 
          for some years these institutions have been opened to dissenters whose 
          parents usually for many generations have had no such training, it is 
          found that these dissenters carry off their full share or even more 
          than their share of honours. We thus see that the theory of the non-heredity 
          of acquired characters, whether physical or mental, is supported by 
          a considerable number of facts, while few if any are directly opposed 
          to it. We therefore propose to neglect the influence of education and 
          habit as possible factors in the improvement of our race, and to confine 
          our argument entirely to the possibility of improvement by some form 
          of selection.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the modern writers who have dealt with this 
          question the opinions of Mr. Galton<sup><a href="#a1">a</a></sup> are 
          entitled to be first considered, because he has studied the whole subject 
          of human faculty in the most thorough manner, and has perhaps thrown 
          more light upon it than any other writer. The method of selection by 
          which he has suggested that <font color="#990000">[[p. 328]]</font> 
          our race may be improved is to be brought into action by means of a 
          system of marks for family merit, both as to health, intellect, and 
          morals, those individuals who stand high in these respects being encouraged 
          to marry early by state endowments sufficient to enable the young couples 
          to make a start in life. Of all the proposals that have been made tending 
          to the systematic improvement of our race, this is one of the least 
          objectionable, but it is also I fear among the least effective. Its 
          tendency would undoubtedly be to increase the number and to raise the 
          standard of our highest and best men, but it would at the same time 
          leave the bulk of the population unaffected, and would but slightly 
          diminish the rate at which the lower types tend to supplant or to take 
          the place of the higher. What we want is, not a higher standard of perfection 
          in the few but a higher average, and this can best be produced by the 
          elimination of the lowest of all and a free intermingling of the rest. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something of this kind is proposed by Mr. Hiram 
          M. Stanley in his article on &quot;Our Civilisation and the Marriage Problem,&quot; 
          already referred to. This writer believes that civilisations perish 
          because, as wealth and art increase, corruption creeps in, and the new 
          generations fail in the work of progress because the renewal of individuals 
          is left chiefly to the unfit. The two great factors which secure perfection 
          in each animal race--sexual selection by which the fit are born, and 
          natural selection by which the fittest survive--both fail in the case 
          of mankind, among whom are hosts of individuals which in any other class 
          of beings would never have been born, or, if born would never survive. 
          He argues that, unless some effective measures are soon adopted and 
          strictly enforced, our case will be irremediable; and, since natural 
          selection fails so largely, recourse must be had to artificial selection. 
          &quot;The drunkard, the criminal, the diseased, the morally weak should never 
          come into society. Not reform but prevention should be the cry.&quot; The 
          method by which this is proposed to be done is hinted at in the following 
          passages: &quot;In the true golden age, which lies not behind but before 
          us, the privilege of parentage will be esteemed an honour for the comparatively 
          few, and no child will be born who is not only sound in body and mind, 
          but also above the average as to natural ability and moral force,&quot;--and 
          again--&quot;The most important matter in society, the inherent quality of 
          the members which compose it, should be regulated by trained specialists.&quot;
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this proposal and all of the same character we 
          may say, that nothing can possibly be more objectionable, even if we 
          admit that they might be effectual in securing the object aimed at. 
          But even this is more than doubtful; and it is quite certain that any 
          such interference with personal freedom in matters so deeply affecting 
          individual happiness will never be adopted by the majority of any <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          329]]</font> nation, or if adopted would never be submitted to by the 
          minority without a life-and-death struggle. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another popular writer of the greatest ability and 
          originality, who has recently given us his solution of the problem, 
          is Mr. Grant Allen. His suggestion is in some respects the very reverse 
          of the last, yet it is, if possible, even more objectionable. Instead 
          of any interference with personal freedom he proposes the entire abolition 
          of legal restrictions as to marriage, which is to be a free contract 
          to last only so long as either party desires. This alone, however, would 
          have no effect on race-improvement, except probably a prejudicial one. 
          The essential part of his method is, that girls should be taught both 
          by direct education and by the influence of public opinion, that the 
          duty of all healthy and intellectual women is to be the mothers of as 
          many and as perfect children as possible. For this purpose they are 
          recommended to choose as temporary husbands the finest, healthiest, 
          and most intellectual men, thus ensuring a variety of combinations of 
          parental qualities which would lead to the production of offspring of 
          the highest possible character and to the continual advancement of the 
          race.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have fairly summarized the essence of 
          Mr. Grant Allen's proposal, which, though enforced with all his literary 
          skill and piquancy of illustration, can, in my opinion, only be fitly 
          described by the term already applied to it by one of his reviewers, 
          &quot;detestable.&quot; It purports to be advanced in the interests of the children 
          and of the race; but it would necessarily impair that family life and 
          parental affection which are the prime essentials to the well-being 
          of children; while, though it need not necessarily produce, it would 
          certainly favour, the increase of pure sensualism, the most degrading 
          and most fatal of all the qualities that tend to the deterioration of 
          races and the downfall of nations. One of the modern American advocates 
          of greater liberty of divorce, in the interest of marriage itself, thus 
          admirably summarises the essential characteristics and purport of true 
          marriage. &quot;In a true relation, the chief object is the loving companionship 
          of man and woman, their capacity for mutual help and happiness, and 
          for the development of all that is noblest in each other. The second 
          object is the building up a home and family, a place of rest, peace, 
          security, in which child-life can bud and blossom like flowers in the 
          sunshine.&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
          For such rest, peace, and security, permanence is essential. This permanence 
          need not be attained by rigid law, but by the influence of public opinion, 
          and, more surely still, by those deep-seated feelings and emotions which, 
          under favourable conditions, render the marriage tie stronger <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          330]]</font> and its influence more beneficial the longer it endures. 
          To me it appears that no system of the relations of men and women could 
          be more fatal to the happiness of individuals, the well-being of children, 
          or the advancement of the race, than that proposed by Mr. Grant Allen. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before proceeding further with the main question 
          it is necessary to point out that, besides the special objections to 
          each of the proposals here noticed, there is a general and fundamental 
          objection. They all attempt to deal at once, and by direct legislative 
          enactment, with the most important and most vital of all human relations, 
          regardless of the fact that our present phase of social development 
          is not only extremely imperfect but vicious and rotten at the core. 
          How can it be possible to determine and settle the relations of women 
          to men which shall be best alike for individuals and for the race, in 
          a society in which a very large proportion of women are obliged to work 
          long hours daily for the barest subsistence, while another large proportion 
          are forced into more or less uncongenial marriages as the only means 
          of securing some amount of personal independence or physical well-being. 
          Let any one consider, on the one hand, the lives of the wealthy as portrayed 
          in the society newspapers and even in the advertisements of such papers 
          as <i>The Field</i> and <i>The Queen</i>, with their endless round of 
          pleasure and luxury, their almost inconceivable wastefulness and extravagance, 
          indicated by the cost of female dress and such facts as the expenditure 
          of a thousand pounds on the flowers for a single entertainment; and, 
          on the other hand, the terrible condition of millions of workers--men, 
          women, and children--as detailed in the <i>Report of the Lords Commission 
          on Sweating</i>, on absolutely incontestable evidence, and the still 
          more awful condition of those who seek work of any kind in vain and, 
          seeing their children slowly dying of starvation, are driven in utter 
          helplessness and despair to murder and suicide. Can any thoughtful person 
          admit for a moment that, in a society so constituted that these overwhelming 
          contrasts of luxury and privation are looked upon as necessities, and 
          are treated by the Legislature as matters with which it has practically 
          nothing to do, there is the smallest probability that we can deal successfully 
          with such tremendous social problems as those which involve the marriage 
          tie and the family relation as a means of promoting the physical and 
          moral advancement of the race? What a mockery to still further whiten 
          the sepulchre of modern society, in which is hidden &quot;all manner of corruption,&quot; 
          with schemes for the moral and physical advancement of the race!
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my firm conviction, for reasons which I shall 
          state presently, that, when we have cleansed the Augean stable of our 
          existing social <font color="#990000">[[p. 331]]</font> organization, 
          and have made such arrangements that <i>all</i> shall contribute their 
          share of either physical or mental labour, and that all workers shall 
          reap the <i>full</i> reward of their work, the future of the race will 
          be ensured by those laws of human development that have led to the slow 
          but continuous advance in the higher qualities of human nature. When 
          men and women are alike free to follow their best impulses; when idleness 
          and vicious or useless luxury on the one hand, oppressive labour and 
          starvation on the other, are alike unknown; when all receive the best 
          and most thorough education that the state of civilisation and knowledge 
          at the time will admit; when the standard of public opinion is set by 
          the wisest and the best, and that standard is systematically inculcated 
          on the young; then we shall find that a system of selection will come 
          spontaneously into action which will steadily tend to eliminate the 
          lower and more degraded types of man, and thus continuously raise the 
          average standard of the race. I therefore strongly protest against any 
          attempt to deal with this great question by legal enactments, or by 
          endeavouring to modify public opinion as to the beneficial character 
          of monogamy and permanence in marriage. That the existing popular opinion 
          is the true one is well and briefly shown by Miss Chapman in a recent 
          number of <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>; and as her statement of the 
          case expresses my own views, and will, I think, be approved by most 
          thinkers on the subject, I here give it: 
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;1. <i>Nature</i> plainly indicates permanent 
          marriage as the true human relation. The young of the human pair need 
          parental care and supervision for a great number of years.</font> 
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;2. <i>Instinct</i> is strongly on the side of indissoluble 
            marriage. In proportion as men leave brutedom behind and enter into 
            the fulness of their human heritage, they will cease to tolerate the 
            idea of two or more living partners.</font>
          </p><p><font size="-1">&quot;3. <i>History</i> shows conclusively that where divorce 
            has been easy, licentiousness, disorder, and often complete anarchy 
            have prevailed. The history of civilisation is the history of advance 
            in monogamy, of the fidelity of one man to one woman, and one woman 
            to one man.</font>
          </p><p><font size="-1">&quot;4. <i>Science</i> tells the same tale. Physiology 
            and Hygiene point to temperance, not riot. Sociology shows how man, 
            in spite of himself, is ever striving, through lower forms, upward, 
            to the monogamic relation.</font>
          </p><p><font size="-1">&quot;5. <i>Experience</i> demonstrates to every one of 
            us, individually, the superiority of the indissoluble marriage. We 
            know that, speaking broadly, marriages turn out well or ill in proportion 
            as husband and wife are--let me not say loving--but loyal, sinking 
            differences and even grievances for the sake of children and for the 
            sake of example.&quot;</font>
      </p></blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider what would be the probable 
        effect of a condition of social advancement, the essential characteristics 
        of which have been already hinted at, on the two great problems--the increase 
        of population, and the continuous improvement of the race by some form 
        of selection which we have reason to believe is the only method available. 
        In order to make this clear, however, and in order that we may fully realise 
        the forces that would come into play in a just and rational state of society, 
        such as may certainly be realised in the <font color="#990000">[[p. 332]]</font> 
        not distant future, it will be necessary to have a clear conception of 
        its main characteristics. For this purpose, and without committing myself 
        in any way to an approval of all the details of his scheme, I shall make 
        use of Mr. Bellamy's<sup><a href="#a2">b</a></sup> clear and forcible picture 
        of the society of the future, as he supposes it may exist in America in 
        little more than a century hence.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential principle on which society is supposed
           to be founded is that of a great family. As in a well-regulated modern
           family the elders, those who have experience of the labours, the duties,
           and the responsibilities of life, determine the general mode of living
           and working, with the fullest consideration for the convenience and
           real well-being of the younger members, and with a recognition of
          their  essential independence. As in a family, the same comforts and
          enjoyments  are secured to all, and the very idea of making any difference
          in this  respect to those who from mental or physical disability are
          unable to  do so much as others, never occurs to anyone, since it is
          opposed to  the essential principles on which a true society is held
          to rest. As  regards education all have the same advantages, and all
          receive the  fullest and best training, both intellectual and physical;
          every one  is encouraged to follow out those studies or pursuits for
          which they  are best fitted, or for which they exhibit the strongest
          inclination.  This education, the complete and thorough training for
          a life of usefulness  and enjoyment, continues in both sexes till the
          age of twenty-one (or  thereabouts) when all alike, men and women,
          take their place in the  ranks of the industrial army in which they
          serve for three years. During  the latter years of their education,
          and during the succeeding three  years of industrial service, every
          opportunity is given  them to see  and understand every kind of work
          that is carried on by the community,  so that at the end of the term
          of probation they can choose what department  of the public service
          they prefer to enter. As every one--men, women,  and children alike--receive
          the same amount of public credit--their  equal share of the products
          of the labour of the community, the attractiveness  of various pursuits
          is equalized by differences in the hours of labour,  in holidays, or
          in special privileges attached to the more disagreeable  kinds of necessary
          work, and these are so modified from time to time  that the volunteers
          for every occupation are always about equal to its  requirements. The
          only other essential feature that it is necessary  to notice for our
          present purpose is the system of grades, by which  good conduct, industry,
          and intelligence in every department of industry  and occupation are
          fully recognised, and lead to appointments as overseers,  superintendents,
          or general managers, and ultimately to the highest  offices of the
          state. Every one of these grades and appointments is  made public;
          and as they constitute the only honours and the only differences  of
          rank, with <font color="#990000">[[p. 333]]</font> corresponding 
          insignia and privileges, in an otherwise equal body of citizens, they
           are highly esteemed and serve as ample inducements to industry and
          zeal  in the public service. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first sight it may appear that in any state of 
          society whose essential features were at all like those here briefly 
          outlined, all the usual restraints to early marriage as they now exist 
          would be removed, and that a rate of increase of the population unexampled 
          in any previous era would be the result, leading in a few generations 
          to a difficulty in obtaining subsistence, which Malthus has shown to 
          be the inevitable result of the normal rate of increase of mankind when 
          all the positive as well as the preventive checks are removed. As the 
          positive checks--which may be briefly summarised as war, pestilence, 
          and famine--are supposed to be non-existent, what, it may be asked, 
          are the preventive checks which are suggested as being capable of reducing 
          the rate of increase within manageable limits? This very reasonable 
          question I will now endeavour to answer.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first and most important of the checks upon 
          a too rapid increase of population will be the comparatively late average 
          period of marriage, which will be the natural result of the very conditions 
          of society, and will besides be inculcated during the period of education, 
          and still further enforced by public opinion. As the period of systematic 
          education is supposed to extend to the age of twenty-one, up to which 
          time both the mental and physical powers will be trained and exercised 
          to their fullest capacity, the idea of marriage during this period will 
          rarely be entertained. During the last year of education, however, the 
          subject of marriage will be dwelt upon, in its bearing on individual 
          happiness and on social well-being, in relation to the welfare of the 
          next generation and to the continuous development of the race. The most 
          careful and deliberate choice of partners for life will be inculcated 
          as the highest social duty; while the young women will be so trained 
          as to look with scorn and loathing on all men who in any way wilfully 
          fail in their duty to society--on idlers and malingerers, on drunkards 
          and liars, on the selfish, the cruel, or the vicious. They will be taught 
          that the happiness of their whole lives will depend on the care and 
          deliberation with which they choose their husbands, and they will be 
          urged to accept no suitor till he has proved himself to be worthy of 
          respect by the place he holds and character he bears among his fellow-labourers 
          in the public service.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under social conditions which render every woman 
          absolutely independent, so far as the necessaries and comforts of existence 
          are concerned, surrounded by the charms of family life and the pleasures 
          of society, which will be far greater than anything we now realise when 
          all possess the refinements derived from the best possible education, 
          and all are relieved from sordid cares and the struggle <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          334]]</font> for mere existence, is it not in the highest degree probable 
          that marriage will rarely take place till the woman has had three or 
          four years' experience of the world after leaving college--that is, 
          till the age of 25, while it will very frequently be delayed till 30 
          or upwards? Now Mr. Galton has shown, from the best statistics available, 
          that if we compare women married at 20 with those married at 29, the 
          proportionate fertility is about as 8 to 5. But this difference, large 
          as it is, only represents a portion of the effect on the rate of increase 
          of population caused by a delay in the average period of marriage. For 
          when the age of marriage is delayed the time between successive generations 
          is correspondingly lengthened; while a still further effect is produced 
          by the fact that the greater the average age of marriage the fewer generations 
          are alive at the same time, and it is the combined effect of these three 
          factors that determines the actual rate of increase of the population.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is yet another factor tending to check 
          the increase of population that would come into play in a society such 
          as we have been considering. In a remarkable essay on the <i>Theory 
          of Population</i> Herbert Spencer has shown, by an elaborate discussion 
          of the phenomena presented by the whole animal kingdom, that the maintenance 
          of the individual and the propagation of the race vary inversely, those 
          species and groups which have the shortest and most uncertain lives 
          producing the greatest number of offspring; in other words, individuation 
          and reproduction are antagonistic. But individuation depends almost 
          entirely on the development and specialisation of the nervous system, 
          through which, not only are the several activities and co-ordinations 
          of the various organs carried on, but all advance in instinct, emotion, 
          and intellect is rendered possible. The actual rate of increase in man 
          has been determined by the necessities of the savage state, in which, 
          as in most animal species, it has usually been only just sufficient 
          to maintain a limited average population. But with civilisation the 
          average duration of life increases, and the possible increase of population 
          under favourable conditions becomes very great, because fertility is 
          greater than is needed under the new conditions. The advance in civilisation 
          as regards the preservation of life has in recent times become so rapid, 
          and the increased development of the nervous system has been limited 
          to so small a portion of the whole population, that no general diminution 
          in fertility has yet occurred. That the facts do, however, accord with 
          the theory is indicated by the common observation that highly intellectual 
          parents do not as a rule have large families, while the most rapid increase 
          occurs in those classes which are engaged in the simpler kinds of manual 
          labour. But in a state of <font color="#990000">[[p. 335]]</font> society 
          in which all have their higher faculties fully cultivated and fully 
          exercised throughout life, a slight general diminution of fertility 
          would at once arise, and this diminution, added to that caused by the 
          later average period of marriage, would at once bring the rate of increase 
          of population within manageable limits. The same general principle enables 
          us to look forward to that distant future when the world will be fully 
          peopled, in perfect confidence that an equilibrium between birth and 
          death rates will then be brought about by a combination of physical 
          and social agencies, and the bugbear of over-population become finally 
          extinct.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There now only remains for consideration the means 
          by which, in such a society, a continuous improvement of the race could 
          be brought about, on the assumption that for this purpose education 
          is powerless as a direct agency, since its effects are not hereditary, 
          and that some form of selection is an absolute necessity. This improvement 
          I believe will certainly be effected through the agency of female choice 
          in marriage. Let us, therefore, consider how this would probably act.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be generally admitted that, although many 
          women now remain unmarried from necessity rather than from choice, there 
          are always a considerable number who feel no strong inclination to marriage, 
          and who accept husbands to secure a subsistence or a home of their own 
          rather than from personal affection or sexual emotion. In a society 
          in which women were all pecuniarily independent, were all fully occupied 
          with public duties and intellectual or social enjoyments, and had nothing 
          to gain by marriage as regards material well-being, we may be sure that 
          the number of the unmarried from choice would largely increase. It would 
          probably come to be considered a degradation for any woman to marry 
          a man she could not both love and esteem, and this feeling would supply 
          ample reasons for either abstaining from marriage altogether or delaying 
          it till a worthy and sympathetic husband was encountered. In man, on 
          the other hand, the passion of love is more general, and usually stronger; 
          and as in such a society as is here postulated there would be no way 
          of gratifying this passion but by marriage, almost every woman would 
          receive offers, and thus a powerful selective agency would rest with 
          the female sex. Under the system of education and of public opinion 
          here suggested there can be no doubt how this selection would be exercised. 
          The idle and the selfish would be almost universally rejected. The diseased 
          or the weak in intellect would also usually remain unmarried; while 
          those who exhibited any tendency to insanity or to hereditary disease, 
          or who possessed any congenital deformity would in hardly any case find 
          partners, because it would <font color="#990000">[[p. 336]]</font> be 
          considered an offence against society to be the means of perpetuating 
          such diseases or imperfections. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also take into account a special factor
           hitherto, I believe, unnoticed in this connection, that would in all
           probability intensify the selection thus exercised. It is well known
           that females are largely in excess of males in our existing population,
           and this fact, if it were a necessary and permanent one, would tend
           to weaken the selective agency of women, as it undoubtedly does now.
           But there is good reason to believe that it will not be a permanent
           feature of our population. The births always give a larger proportion
           of males than females, varying from 3&frac12; to 4 per cent. But boys
            die so much more rapidly than girls that when we include all under
           the  age of five the numbers are nearly equal. For the next five years
           the  mortality is nearly the same in both sexes; then that of females
           preponderates  up to 30 years of age, then up to 60 that of men is
           the larger, while  for the rest of life female mortality is again
           greatest. The general  result is that at the ages of most frequent
           marriage--from 20 to 35--females  are between 8 and 9 per cent. in
           excess of males. But during the ages  5 to 35 we find a wonderful
           excess of male deaths from two preventible  causes--&quot;accident&quot; and &quot;violence.&quot; For
           the year 1888 the deaths from  these causes in England and Wales was
        as follows:--        
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Males (5 to 35 years)  4,158.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Females (5
          to 35 years) 1,100.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we have an excess of male over female deaths 
          in one year of 3,058, all between the ages of 5 and 35, a very large 
          portion of which is no doubt due to the greater risks run by men and 
          boys in various industrial occupations. In a state of society in which 
          the bulk of the population were engaged in industrial work it is quite 
          certain that almost all these deaths would be prevented, and thus bring 
          the male population more nearly to an equality with the female. But 
          there are also many unhealthy employments in which men are exclusively 
          engaged, such as the grinders of Sheffield, the white-lead manufacturers, 
          and many others; and many more men have their lives shortened by labour 
          in unventilated workshops, to say nothing of the loss of life in war. 
          When the lives of all its citizens are accounted of equal value to the 
          community, no one will be allowed to suffer from such preventible causes 
          as these; and this will still further reduce the mortality of men as 
          compared with that of women. On the whole, then, it seems highly probable 
          that in the society of the future the superior numbers of males at birth 
          will be maintained throughout life, or, at all events, during what may 
          be termed the marriageable period. This will greatly increase the influence 
          of women in the improvement of the race. Being a minority they will 
          be more sought after, and will have a real choice <font color="#990000">[[p. 
          337]]</font> in marriage, which is rarely the case now. This actual 
          minority being further increased by those who, from the various causes 
          already referred to, abstain from marriage, will cause considerable 
          numbers of men to remain permanently unmarried, and as these will consist 
          very largely, if not almost wholly, of those who are the least perfectly 
          developed either mentally or physically, the constant advance of the 
          race in every good quality will be ensured. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This method of improvement by elimination of the 
          worst has many advantages over that of securing the early marriages 
          of the best. In the first place it is the direct instead of the indirect 
          way, for it is more important and more beneficial to society to improve 
          the average of its members by getting rid of the lowest types than by 
          raising the highest a little higher. Exceptionally great and good men 
          are always produced in sufficient numbers, and have always been so produced 
          in every phase of civilisation. We do not need more of these so much 
          as we need less of the weak and the bad. This weeding-out system has 
          been the method of natural selection, by which the animal and vegetable 
          worlds have been improved and developed. The survival of the fittest 
          is really the extinction of the unfit. In nature this occurs perpetually 
          on an enormous scale, because, owing to the rapid increase of most organisms, 
          the unfit which are yearly destroyed form a large proportion of those 
          that are born. Under our hitherto imperfect civilisation this wholesome 
          process has been checked as regards mankind; but the check has been 
          the result of the development of the higher attributes of our nature. 
          Humanity--the essentially <i>human</i> emotion--has caused us to save 
          the lives of the weak and suffering, of the maimed or imperfect in mind 
          or body. This has to some extent been antagonistic to physical and even 
          intellectual race-improvement; but it has improved us morally by the 
          continuous development of the characteristic and crowning grace of our 
          human, as distinguished from our animal, nature.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the society of the future this defect will be 
          remedied, not by any diminution of our humanity, but by encouraging 
          the activity of a still higher human characteristic--admiration of all 
          that is beautiful and kindly and self-sacrificing, repugnance to all 
          that is selfish, base, or cruel. When we allow ourselves to be guided 
          by reason, justice, and public spirit in our dealings with our fellow-men, 
          and determine to abolish poverty by recognising the equal rights of 
          all the citizens of our common land to an equal share of the wealth 
          which all combine to produce,--when we have thus solved the lesser problem 
          of a rational social organisation adapted to secure the equal well-being 
          of all, then we may safely leave the far greater and deeper problem 
          of the improvement of the race to the cultivated minds and pure instincts 
          of the Women of the Future.

  <strong><em><font color="993366">Comment by Prof. Martin Fichman, York University, Ontario (pers. 
          commun. 3/00):</font></em></strong></p>
<p><em>Wallace considered this article his most important contribution 
          to the development of sociology. More pointedly, he considered it his 
          major statement on the much-debated question of &quot;human progress.&quot; A 
          number of late Victorian thinkers, including Darwin, expressed the opinion 
          that it was primarily the &quot;lower&quot; classes, rather than the middle or 
          upper classes, who were propelling population growth--and, by inference, 
          polluting the gene pool with their (allegedly) inferior heritable traits. 
          Wallace agreed that there were, indeed, checks on progress but argued 
          that these checks were sociopolitical, as well as biological, in nature. 
          Significantly, he dismissed as ineffective any proposals based solely 
          on beneficial environmental influences--such as education and public 
          hygiene--because he rejected the Lamarckian notion that traits acquired 
          by individuals during their lifetimes could be transmitted to their 
          offspring. He was adamant in his belief that &quot;some form of selection&quot; 
          was the only possible means of permanently improving the human condition. 
          But he also rejected the then popular doctrine of eugenics both on scientific 
          and ethical grounds. Instead, Wallace argued that a form of &quot;sexual 
          selection&quot;--within the context of socialist society--offered the best 
          means of effecting permanent human progress. Freed from the constraint 
          of marrying primarily on grounds of financial security (as Wallace believed 
          capitalist society demanded), women could now choose as marriage partners 
          only those men who possessed &quot;noble&quot; traits such as intelligence, compassion, 
          altruism, and physical health. Conversely, women would reject potential 
          mates men who were idle, selfish, violent, weak in intellect or who 
          possessed any overt hereditary disease. In Wallace's socialist utopia, 
          the general outlines of which he borrowed from the American writer Edward 
          Bellamy, educated female choice would become the biologically effective 
          agent of eliminating the worst human traits from society and ensuring 
          the propagation of the best traits. &quot;Human Selection,&quot; Wallace's first 
          public declaration of his socialism, displays that interplay of scientific 
          and cultural ideas that was central to his worldview. Though characterized 
          by a certain naivet&eacute; as to human motives and actions, it remains 
          a powerful indictment of any society which permits gross social and 
          economic inequities to persist. Indeed, Wallace's particular mixture 
          of evolutionary biology, socialist ideology, and certain feminist concerns 
          remains as provocative and controversial today as it was when first 
          presented in 1890. His views demand renewed attention in our present 
          age of potential genetic manipulation of the human species.</em></p>

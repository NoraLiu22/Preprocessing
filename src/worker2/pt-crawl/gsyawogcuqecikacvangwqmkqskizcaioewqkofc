<br/>
PRESS RELEASE FROM YVO PARTNER UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SEISMOGRAPH STATIONS<br/>
<br/>
Released: December 29, 2008 05:00 PM MST<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The University of Utah Seismograph Stations reports that a notable swarm of earthquakes has been underway since December 26 beneath Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park, three to six miles south-southeast of Fishing Bridge, Wyoming.  This energetic sequence of events was most intense on December 27, when the largest number of events of magnitude 3 and larger occurred.<br/>
<br/>
The largest of the earthquakes was a magnitude 3.9 (revised from magnitude 3.8) at 10:15 pm MST on Dec. 27.  The sequence has included nine events of magnitude 3 to 3.9 and approximately 24 of magnitude 2 to 3 at the time of this release. A total of more than 250 events large enough to be located have occurred in this swarm.  Reliable depths of the larger events are up to a few miles.  Visitors and National Park Service (NPS) employees in the Yellowstone Lake area reported feeling the largest of these earthquakes.<br/>
<br/>
Earthquakes are a common occurrence in the Yellowstone National Park area, an active volcanic-tectonic area averaging 1,000 to 2,000 earthquakes a year.  Yellowstone's 10,000 geysers and hot springs are the result of this geologic activity.  A summary of Yellowstone's volcanic history is available on the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory web site (listed below).  This December 2008 earthquake sequence is the most intense in this area for some years and is centered on the east side of the Yellowstone caldera.  Scientists cannot identify any causative fault or other feature without further analysis. Seismologists continue to monitor and analyze the data and will issue new information if the situation warrants it.<br/>
<br/>
The University of Utah operates a seismic network in Yellowstone National Park in conjunction with the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). These three institutions are partners in the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.<br/>
<br/>
Data are transmitted to the University in real-time by radio and satellite links from a network of 28 seismographs in the Yellowstone area and are available on the web.  Seismologists continue to analyze data from this swarm of earthquakes and provide updates to the NPS and USGS and to the public via the following web pages.<br/>
<br/>
Information on U.S. earthquake activity including Yellowstone can be viewed at the U.S. Geological Survey web site: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsus/<br/>

Persons who felt any of the earthquakes are encouraged to fill out a survey form on the USGS 'Did You Feel It?' web site:  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/dyfi/.<br/>

PRESS RELEASE FROM YVO PARTNER UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SEISMOGRAPH STATIONS<br/>
<br/>
Released: December 27, 2008 04:40 PM MST<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The University of Utah Seismograph Stations reports that a swarm of small earthquakes of magnitude 3.5 and smaller is occurring beneath Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park, five to nine miles south-southeast of Fishing Bridge, Wyoming.  The swarm began yesterday afternoon, Dec. 26, and has continued and intensified today.  The two largest earthquakes in this swarm have been shocks of magnitude 3.5 and 3.4 which occurred at 1:17 and 1:26 pm MST, respectively, today.  Many smaller earthquakes have also occurred, including three events this morning of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8 and a magnitude 3.2 event at 3:30 pm MST.  Some of the earthquakes in the swarm have been reported felt by people in the Yellowstone Lake area.  Swarms of this nature are relatively common in this part of Yellowstone Park.<br/>

NOVEMBER 2008 Yellowstone Seismicity Summary<br/>
<br/>
During the month of November 2008, 166 earthquakes were located in the Yellowstone region. The largest event was a magnitude 2.7 on November 23 at 11:41 PM MST, located about 21 miles south southeast of West Thumb, YNP, and near the southern caldera boundary. This event was part of a swarm of 77 events, Nov. 23 -29, with magnitudes -0.3 - 2.7.  Two smaller swarms were also recored in November.  One located about 9 miles northeast of West Yellowstone, MT.   The swarm included 17 events, Nov. 7 - 12, with magnitudes 0.0 - 1.4.  The second was located about 17 miles east northeast of West Yellowstone, MT.  The swarm included 21 events, Nov. 24 - 25, with magnitudes -0.1 - 1.6.<br/>
<br/>
Earthquake activity in the Yellowstone region is at relatively normal background levels.<br/>
<br/>
Ground Deformation Summary: Through November 2008, continuous GPS data show that much of the Yellowstone caldera continued moving upward, though at a lower rate than the past several years. The maximum measured ground uplift over the past 53 months is ~22 cm at the White Lake GPS station. An example can be found at: http://pboweb.unavco.org/shared/scripts/stations/checkkey=WLWY&amp;sec=timeseries_plots&amp;timeseries=raw<br/>
<br/>
The general uplift of the Yellowstone caldera is scientifically interesting and will continue to be monitored closely by YVO staff.<br/>

JUNE 2008 Yellowstone Seismicity Summary<br/>
<br/>
During the month of June 2008, 79 earthquakes were located in the Yellowstone region. The largest event was a magnitude 2.7 on June 4 at 9:02 PM MDT, located about 6 miles southwest of West Thumb, WY. There was a swarm of 27 events, June 4-8, with magnitudes 0.8 to 2.7, located about 6 miles southwest of West Yellowstone, MT. <br/>
<br/>
Earthquake activity in the Yellowstone region is at relatively low background levels.<br/>
<br/>
Ground Deformation Summary: Through June 2008, continuous GPS data show that most of the Yellowstone caldera continued moving upward, though at a lower rate than the past several years. The maximum measured ground uplift over the past 48 months is ~20 cm at the White Lake GPS station.

University of Utah PRESS RELEASE<br/>
<br/>
The University of Utah Seismograph Stations reports that a light earthquake of magnitude 4.10 occurred at 05:59 AM on March 25, 2008 (MDT) in Yellowstone National Park.  The epicenter of the shock was located 29.8 km (18.6 mi) NE of Fishing Bridge, WY.  Two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater have occurred within 25 km of the epicenter of this event since 1962.  The largest of these events was a magnitude 3.53 on July 20, 1992, 6.4 km (4.0 mi) NE of Fishing Bridge, WY.  No earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 or greater have occurred within 50 km of the epicenter of this event since 1962.  This event has been reported felt in Pahaska Tepee, outside the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park and in southwest Montana as well as in western Wyoming.<br/>
<br/>
The location of the earthquake has been analyzed by a seismologist.<br/>
<br/>
Persons who felt the earthquake are encouraged to fill out a survey form on the USGS Community Felt reports web site: http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/X13060_08/ciim_display.html.<br/>

The principal shock was followed by 123 later shocks of magnitude -0.8 to 2.9. An additional swarm occurred January 25 to 26 that was located about 4 miles north of Old Faithful, YNP.  This sequence had 32 events ranging from magnitude 0.7 to 2.4.<br/>

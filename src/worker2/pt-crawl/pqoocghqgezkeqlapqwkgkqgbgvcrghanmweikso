/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: Wallace's essay on 
          this subject first appeared in abbreviated form in French, but was printed 
          <u>in toto</u> in English a short time later on page 213 of the London 
          newspaper <u>The Clarion</u>, issue of 8 July 1899. To link directly 
          to this page, connect with: http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S567.htm</i></center>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to a request from the Editor of <i>L'Humanit&eacute; 
          Nouvelle</i>, I here give my views, briefly, on the questions submitted 
          to me. <i>[These were: &quot;(1) Is war among civilised nations still necessary 
          on the grounds of history, right, and progress? (2) What are the effects 
          of militarism--intellectual, moral, physical, economic, and political? 
          (3) What is the best solution of the problems of war and militarism 
          in the interests of the future civilisation of the world? (4) What are 
          the most rapid means of arriving at this solution?&quot; --Ed.]</i>
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Under the existing conditions of society in 
          all civilised communities, and as a consequence of the principles and 
          methods of government which prevail in them, war cannot cease to be 
          more or less prevalent among them.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conditions which almost inevitably lead to war 
          are the existence of specialised ruling and military classes, to whom 
          the possession of power and the excitements and rewards of successful 
          war are the great interests of life. So long as the people permit these 
          distinct and independent classes to exist, and--more than this--continue 
          to look up to them as superiors and as necessary for the proper government 
          of the country and for the effective protection of individual and national 
          freedom, so long will these rulers continue to make wars.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All civilised governments, whatever may be their 
          professions, <i>act</i> on the principle that extension of territory 
          and the absorption of adjacent or remote lands, so as to increase both 
          the extent of country and the population over which they have sway, 
          is a good in itself, quite irrespective of the consent of the peoples 
          so absorbed and governed, and even when the peoples are alien in race, 
          in language, and religion. Although they may not openly avow their acceptance 
          of this doctrine, yet they invariably <i>act</i> upon it, though in 
          some cases they think it necessary to make excuses for their action. 
          They declare that such conquest and absorption is necessary for the 
          national safety, for the increase of trade, and for many other reasons. 
          The majority of the workers, and of educated people who do not belong 
          to the ruling or the military classes, however, do not accept this principle. 
          They more or less decisively hold the opinion that governments can only 
          justly derive their power from the consent of the governed, and that 
          all wars for territory and all conquests of alien peoples are wrong.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason of this difference of opinion is very 
          simple. Every addition of territory, every fresh conquest even of barbarous 
          nations or of savages, provides outlets and additional places of power 
          and profit for the ever-increasing numbers of the ruling classes, while 
          it also provides employment and advancement for an increased military 
          class in first subduing and then coercing the subject populations, and 
          in preparing for the inevitable frontier disputes and the resulting 
          further extensions of territory. Wars and conquests and ever-expanding 
          territories are thus found to be essential to their existence and continued 
          power as superior classes. But the people outside these classes derive 
          little, if any, benefit from such extensions, while they invariably 
          suffer from increased taxation, either temporarily or permanently, due 
          to increased armaments, which the protection of the enlarged territory 
          requires. Almost without exception every war of modern times has been 
          a dynastic war--a war conceived and carried out in the interests of 
          the two great governing classes, but having no relation whatever to 
          the well-being of the peoples who have been forced to fight each other. 
          In every case the people suffer by the loss or disablement of sons, 
          husbands, and fathers, by the destruction of crops, houses, and other 
          property, and by increased taxation, due to the increase of armaments 
          that always follows such wars even in the case of the victors. Hence 
          the material and moral interests of the mass of the people of every 
          country are wholly opposed to war, except in the one case of defending 
          their country against invasion and conquest. They are therefore more 
          open to the influence of moral and humane considerations, while they 
          alone feel the numberless evils which war brings upon them. Except in 
          very rare cases, a plebiscite fairly taken would decide against any 
          other than a defensive war. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) To discuss the effects of militarism under the 
          various heads suggested in the question would require much space and 
          some special knowledge which I do not possess. That these effects have 
          both good and evil aspects may be admitted. The evil effects have been 
          often set forth and are sufficiently known, both in their vast extent 
          and far-reaching consequences, while the greatest of them--the perpetuation 
          of war and the desire for military glory--has already been alluded to. 
          I will, therefore, confine my remarks to the partial good that undoubtedly 
          exists in this fundamentally evil thing, chiefly for the purpose of 
          showing that whatever good there is in it may be obtained in other ways 
          which are as essentially humane, moral, and beneficial as war is essentially 
          cruel, immoral, and hurtful.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The good that results from militarism arises wholly 
          from the perfection of its organisation, of its training, of the habits 
          of order, cleanliness, and obedience which the soldier soon learns are 
          essentials to efficiency, from the social and brotherly life of the 
          soldier, whether in camp or in the field, from the <i>esprit de corps</i> 
          which grows out of its systematic organisation and companionship, leading 
          to generous rivalry and to those deeds of heroism and self-sacrifice 
          which are universally admired. And, further, every soldier learns by 
          experience the marvellous power of organised labour under skilled direction 
          to overcome what to the ordinary man seem insurmountable difficulties. 
          He sees how foaming torrents or broad rivers can be rapidly bridged; 
          how roads can be made over morasses or across mountains; how the most 
          formidable and apparently impregnable defences are attacked and taken; 
          and how a few bold men in a &quot;forlorn hope,&quot; by the sacrifice of their 
          lives, often insure the success of the army to which they belong. Many 
          of the finest qualities of our nature are thus called into action by 
          the soldier's training and during his struggle against the enemy; and 
          so greatly has humanity developed among us that it may be fairly argued 
          that these good effects more than balance the evil passions of cruelty, 
          lust, and plunder which even now are to some extent manifested in every 
          great war, though to a far less degree than even 50 years back.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But every one of these good results of militarism 
          could certainly be obtained by any equally extensive and equally skilful 
          organisation for wholly beneficial purposes. If labour, where organised 
          for military ends, is so effective in results and so beneficial as a 
          training, it would be equally effective and equally beneficial when 
          devoted to overcoming the obstacles to man's progress presented by nature 
          to the production of the necessaries of civil life, to sanitary works 
          for the preservation of health, and to everything that facilitates communication 
          and benefits humanity. If the same amount of knowledge, the same amount 
          of energy, and the same lavish expenditure, where absolutely required, 
          were devoted to the training of great industrial armies, to their maintenance 
          in the most perfect health and efficiency, and to their employment in 
          that great war which man is ever waging against Nature, subduing her 
          myriad forces to his service, guarding against those sudden attacks 
          by storm and flood, by violence and earthquake, which he cannot altogether 
          avoid, and in the production of all the essentials of human life and 
          of a true and beneficent civilisation, the good effects on character 
          would surely be much greater than those produced by mere military training, 
          as the objects aimed at and the results achieved would be more beneficial 
          and more calculated to promote the higher interests of man. And if these 
          industrial armies were allowed to reap the full advantages, material 
          as well as moral, which they created, the results would be so striking 
          that almost the entire population, male and female alike, would claim 
          to be so trained and organised for their own physical, moral, and economic 
          benefit. And the enjoyment of life under such a system of voluntary 
          organised labour would be so enhanced that few indeed would wish to 
          escape from it. Labour in companionship for the common good almost ceases 
          to be labour at all. Friendly emulation takes the place of unfriendly 
          competition, and <i>esprit de corps</i> urges each local organisation 
          to surpass other local organisations in efficiency. In such a grand 
          industrial organisation, with equal opportunities of education and training 
          for all, there would necessarily be numbers of inventors and students 
          whose aim and delight would be to so improve the machinery and the methods 
          of work as to continually diminish all the less pleasant forms of labour, 
          and thus proportionately increase the amount of leisure and the higher 
          enjoyments of social life.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been objected to all such proposals for the 
          organisation of industry that it would deteriorate character by destroying 
          individuality; but no such objection is made to the military organisation, 
          while under its best forms the reverse is found to occur. In point of 
          fact, <i>all</i> organisation is beneficial to character just in proportion 
          as it rises above slavery. And when it shall have reached the point 
          of being the organisation of social equals, for the equal benefit of 
          all, it will attain to its most beneficial influence. Then, character 
          and merit will alone give authority, and the highest and best will inevitably 
          rise to the highest positions. And, just in proportion as the rank and 
          file became educated, and felt the inspiring influences of comradeship 
          and emulation, they could be left more and more to their own initiative; 
          each one's individuality would have the fullest play, controlled only 
          by the influence and opinion of his immediate fellow-workers, and the 
          whole great organisation would become almost automatic in its harmonious 
          working.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is found to be the case in the best military 
          organisations, in which the intelligence and individual action of both 
          commissioned and non-commissioned officers, and even of privates, is 
          cultivated, and becomes of the greatest value, giving to the army in 
          which it most generally exists an undoubted superiority. In any army 
          thus intelligently and sympathetically trained and organised none of 
          the results so dreaded in industrial organisation are found to occur. 
          Men are <i>not</i> brought to a dull level of mediocrity; interest in 
          the work they have to do is <i>not</i> lost; skulkers, malingerers, 
          and deserters do <i>not</i> abound in any appreciable or hurtful proportion; 
          nor is there any indication that men of superior abilities refuse to 
          exercise their talents for the common good because the money rewards 
          of such ability are small as compared with those often obtained in civil 
          life; and lastly, the fact that all are provided with food and clothing, 
          and are thus removed from the influence of economic competition, is 
          not found to have any injurious effect on their effectiveness as workers, 
          fighters, or organisers. And that these effects are not caused by compulsion 
          and the severe penalties of military law is shown by the fact that during 
          the civil war in America, where compulsion and punishment were rarely 
          used, the whole of the opposing armies being practically volunteers, 
          cheerfully submitting to military drill and organisation for the common 
          good, these high qualities were equally manifested.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet objections of this class are held to be fatal 
          to any proposal for national industrial organisation for the benefit 
          of all, and the very system of training and co-operation which in the 
          one case is admitted to have beneficial effects on character, and is 
          undoubtedly, even under very unfavourable conditions, attractive in 
          its comradeship and freedom from care, is condemned as being injurious 
          and unworkable when applied industrially. Oh! that some great ruler 
          of men would arise to benefit humanity by organising industrial armies, 
          leading to the elevation and happiness of a whole people, and thus proving 
          that peace may have its victories, far greater and more glorious than 
          those of war!
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3-4) The two last questions--as to the solution 
          of the problems of war and militarism, and the means of arriving as 
          rapidly as possible at such a solution--have already been partly answered 
          in the preceding discussion of the problem itself, but a few words may 
          here be added.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, I think, clear that no hope of a complete 
          solution--hardly even of amelioration--is to be expected from the ruling 
          classes, urged on as they are on the one hand by those who are ever 
          seeking for place and power, or for official appointments in newly-acquired 
          territories, and on the other hand by the military class, who ever seek 
          to justify their existence and the enormous burden they are to the nation 
          by obtaining for it extensions of territory or military glory, and with 
          either of these an extension of their own influence. It is, therefore, 
          the <i>people</i>, and the people alone, that must be relied upon to 
          banish militarism and war, and for this end every possible effort must 
          be made to educate and enlighten them, not only as to the horrors and 
          iniquity of war, but as to the utter inadequacy and worthlessness of 
          almost all the causes for which wars are waged. They must be shown that 
          all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, 
          the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of 
          their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which 
          have power and influence over their rulers; and that the results of 
          war are <i>never</i> good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of this education of the people there 
          are certain points that should be specially advocated. For example, 
          nothing is more inconsistent, more foolish, and more wicked than the 
          universal practice of civilised and Christian nations in selling all 
          the most improved weapons and instruments of destruction to semi-civilised, 
          barbarous, or savage rulers, thereby rendering it more difficult--more 
          costly in blood and treasure--to deal with such rulers when their crimes 
          against their own peoples or against humanity become too great to be 
          borne. This practice also renders it ever more and more difficult for 
          advanced nations to disarm, and thus gives to militarism an additional 
          reason for its existence. From every point of view, whether of Christianity, 
          humanity, or human progress, the supply of modern instruments of war 
          to barbarous rulers, for the coercion of their own subjects, and as 
          a standing menace to civilisation, should be absolutely forbidden. For 
          this purpose, and in order that legal enactments to this end may be 
          effective, we must try and create a sentiment of horror against those 
          who continue thus to betray the cause of civilisation, as being not 
          only traitors to their country, but enemies to the human race. In my 
          opinion, men who, after due notice, and in spite of its declared illegality, 
          continue to supply these weapons to the possible enemies of their country 
          should be declared outlaws in every Christian or civilised community. 
          Hardly less foolish and wicked is the free trade in these instruments 
          and armaments of war, so that directly one or more of the civilised 
          nations are preparing for war the workshops of all the other civilised 
          nations are at once engaged in supplying every kind of destructive appliance, 
          even though they may in a year or two be used against themselves. The 
          time will surely soon come when this conduct will be looked upon as 
          the very culminating point of combined folly and wickedness that the 
          world has seen. The only rational mode of procedure would be to forbid 
          altogether the private manufacture or sale of war material. War is a 
          national act, and so long as it exists all preparation for it should 
          be kept strictly in the hands of national governments.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This supply of the implements of war is the work 
          of capitalists in their own interests; but even worse, if that be possible, 
          is the action of the great civilised governments themselves in allowing 
          their trained officers to engage in the organisation of the armies of 
          semi-barbarous rulers, thus rendering it more difficult to coerce these 
          rulers in the interests of civilisation, and indirectly, yet most certainly, 
          leading to a vast extension of the horrors of war. The entire absence 
          of ethical principle created by militarism is especially shown in the 
          fact that no effective protest has been raised against this most pernicious 
          and suicidal practice. Here, again, the people alone can take effective 
          action, and the people want educating. Common justice, common humanity, 
          even common sense, alike demand that this practice be absolutely forbidden, 
          and that any officer engaging in the organisation of the armies of semi-barbarous 
          or alien rulers should be declared an outlaw by the Government in whose 
          army he was trained, be demanded from the employing Government as a 
          traitor to his country, and the refusal to give him up be followed by 
          an instant declaration of war from <i>all</i> the civilised governments.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another point on which the people should be 
          educated is, that they should claim and exercise the right to refuse, 
          as soldiers, to act against their fellow-countrymen or against other 
          countries with whose people they have no quarrel. Accepting the principle 
          that the only just rights of governments rest upon the consent of the 
          governed, what is termed rebellion is not a crime, but is usually the 
          just demand of a community for self-government, a demand which, instead 
          of being repressed by force, should be tested by a plebiscite. And smaller 
          disturbances, termed riots, always arise from some injustice or supposed 
          injustice, and are not proper subjects for massacre by armed soldiers. 
          To use fire-arms against a crowd, and kill or maim innocent persons, 
          women and children, as almost always happens, is to authorise murder. 
          Whenever it may be necessary to prevent violence by a mob, and the available 
          force of police is not sufficient, special constables should be enrolled. 
          But a far better plan would be to organise the fire-brigades as coadjutors 
          of the police, since it is certain that no unarmed (or even armed) mob 
          can stand against the jet of a fire-engine or of several fire-engines. 
          The mob would instantly disperse, and be rendered ridiculous without 
          endangering life.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, any proposed system of arbitration to 
          settle disputes between nations should be strongly supported; but the 
          existing condition of all the great civilised governments renders it 
          certain that, so long as the ruling and military classes exist, and 
          are allowed to possess the almost absolute powers they now exercise, 
          war, as the ultimate mode of settling national disputes, will not cease.</p>

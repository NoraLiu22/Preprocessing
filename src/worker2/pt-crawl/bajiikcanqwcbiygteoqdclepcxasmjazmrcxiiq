<h2> Smell - The Nose Knows </h2>
<p>
<img src="gif/nose2.gif" class="fl" alt="" />

The smells of a rose, perfume, freshly baked bread and cookies...these
smells are all made possible because of your nose and brain.  The sense of
smell, called olfaction, involves the detection and perception of
chemicals floating in the air.  Chemical molecules enter the nose and
dissolve in mucous within a membrane called the olfactory epithelium.  In
humans, the olfactory epithelium is located about 7 cm up and into the
nose from the nostrils.</p>

<p class="don"><strong>The Olfactory System</strong><br />

<p>Hair cells are the receptors in the olfactory epithelium that respond
to particular chemicals.  These cells have small hairs called cilia on one
side and an axon on the other side.  In humans, there are about 40 million
olfactory receptors; in the German Shepherd dog, there are about 2 billion
olfactory receptors.</p>

<p>
<img src="./gif/smell1.gif" class="flr" alt="" />
No one knows what actually causes olfactory receptors to react - it
could be a chemical molecule's shape or size or electrical charge.  The
electrical activity produced in these hair cells is transmitted to the
olfactory bulb.  The information is then passed on to mitral cells in the 
olfactory bulb.</p> 

<p>The olfactory tract transmits the signals to the brain to areas such as
the olfactory cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus.  Many of
these brain areas are part of the limbic system.  The limbic system is
involved with emotional behavior and memory.  That's why when you smell
something, it often brings back memories associated with the object.</p> 

<p>As
you probably know, when you have a cold and your nose is stuffed up, you
cannot smell very well.  This is because the molecules that carry smell
cannot reach the olfactory receptors.</p>

<td><ul>
<li>About 2 million people in the United States have NO sense of smell.
This disorder is called anosmia. A serious head
injury can cause anosmia.  Most likely this results in damage to the
olfactory nerves as they enter the olfactory bulb.  It is also possible
that damage of the frontal lobes caused by a tumor or surgery can cause
anosmia.  Elderly people often have a reduced sense of smell.</li>

<li>People are very sensitive to the smell of green bell pepper.  This 
smell can be detected when it is mixed with air at only 0.5 parts per 
trillion!</li>
<li>Natural gas, which many people use to heat their homes and to cook, is
odorless.  Because natural gas is dangerous to breathe and is explosive,
it is important for people to be able to detect a gas leak.  That is why
gas companies add a smelly ("rotten egg smell") chemical called mercaptan
to natural gas.</li>
<li>1 in 1,000 people are insensitive to butyl mercaptan, the stinky smell 
of skunks.</li></ul>

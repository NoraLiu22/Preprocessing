<P><font face="Times New Roman">STEPHEN JAY  GOULD, called</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">as a witness, having been first duly sworn by the Notary Public, was examined and testified 
as follows:</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">EXAMINATION BY MR. WILLIAMS:</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you state your name, please?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Stephen Jay Gould.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Bruce J. Ennis, appearing for Dr. Gould. Steve Barnes also appearing for Dr. Gould.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you brought any documents with you today?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Yes we have. In addition to the 3 books we have produced, ONTOGENY and 
PHYLOGENY, THE PANDA'S THUMB and THE ORIGIN, A VIEW OF LIFE, we are also producing several documents.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">You previously received a curriculum vitae for Dr. Gould, but I would like to give you an updated 
current version of that CV, together with a complete scientific bibliography of the many articles written by 
Dr. Gould. We are also producing various file
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">5</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">folders which break down by categories relevant to your request for production of documents, 
additional correspondence, and documents that were in Dr. Gould's possession.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">And we are in addition producing articles written by Dr. Gould which bear specifically on the subject 
of creationism or creation-science and subjects directly relevant to this lawsuit.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, I would like to state for the record that we would like to at least mention to you that there is 
one article written in the Creation Research Society Quarterly, which Dr. Gould may have occasion to refer 
to in the course of his testimony, but for which I do not have a copy. It's called THE CEPHALOPODS 
IN THE CREATION and THE UNIVERSAL CREATION, and it's written by John Woodmorappe.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">In the Creation Research Society Quarterly, volume 15, September 1978. I will give you this copy 
now, but I do not have an extra. If you would like to make one, I would appreciate if you will return 
the original.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: Yes, I would like to
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">6</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">have a copy made of this.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I would also like to state for the record that we made a diligent effort at Harvard 
Wednesday to try and find our Creation Society literature on which Dr. Gould might rely in his testimony. 
We have not been able to determine for certain which things he will be relying on, but he has read 
many books by creationists, and if you would like we can state them for the record because he may -</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. The main ones would be Gish's EVOLUTION THE FOSSILS SAY NO. THE GENESIS FLOOD 
by Whitcomb and Morris: FOSSILS KEYED TO THE PRESENT, by Bliss, Parker and Gish. 
SCIENTIFIC CREATIONISM, by Henry Morris.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">I am not saying I won't read some others before the trial, but these are the ones I have read so far. 
In fact, the only major creations works I own.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I would like to say for the record that I now understand that you have a copy of 
another book written by Dr. Gould entitled EVER SINCE DARWIN. And that will complete our document 
production in response to your request.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">7</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to state for the record that Dr. Gould has written literally hundreds of articles in his 
professional career and all of them to some extent or another have something to do with evolution. We have 
not produced all of those articles because he does not have copies of most of them, and had reprints of 
virtually none of them. But we have made an effort to reproduce all articles that deal with creation-science 
or anything related to this case.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">We have also produced a list of publications, and if on looking at that list there appear to be any 
additional publications in that list which you think might be relevant, we will be happy to try and get 
copies of those as well. We made an effort to screen through and I think we complied in good faith with 
your request.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: Thank you.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: We are going to have the standard stipulation reserving all objections except as to 
form until the trial. We will not waive the signing of the deposition, however. Anything else you would like 
to add, David?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: No. Its my
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">8</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">understanding though, concerning the details, that the original will be forwarded directly to Dr. Gould; 
is that right? For his signature.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: We will have to figure out. what's the quicker way to do that since he's going to be out of 
the country.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: Off the record.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(Discussion off the record.)</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: In our off the record discussion, I think we have agreed that the original of the 
deposition transcript will be sent to Dr. Gould either tomorrow or Sunday by Federal Express or some 
other overnight delivery service. He will then read it and make any necessary corrections before he leaves 
the country on Wednesday of next week. Will return it by Express Mail or some other overnight means 
of delivery to Skadden, Arps, who will conform their copy to any changes made. They will in turn send 
the original signed and corrected to the Attorney General's Office, Justice Building, Little Rock, Arkansas, 
to my attention.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Dr. Gould, where are you currently employed?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">9</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Harvard University.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And your position at Harvard?</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you tenured?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When did you receive your tenure?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> 1971, July 1 - sorry, July 1, 1973.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your attorneys - the attorneys for the plaintiff, have they explained to you the purposes of a 
deposition?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you testified before in any case?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Never.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Ever had a deposition taken before?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you married?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you have any children?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Two boys.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">10</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Ages, please?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> One 8 and one is going to be 12 next Thursday.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where are they in school?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My youngest son is in the local public school called the Agassiz School, my older boy is 
seriously learning disabled is in a special school called League School in Newton</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your 8-year old will be in the second grade?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Third grade</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would he have any courses yet in which they discuss the subject of origins?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I wish he did, but the state of public education in Massachusetts is such that there is no science at 
all in public schools now, which is a scandal or other reasons.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Why is there no science in the public schools of Massachusetts?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There is in some schools. There was a science specialist, but he was released for lack of funds. I 
don't say the teacher doesn't occasionally discuss some scientific subjects.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> To your knowledge, has the subject of
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">11</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">evolution ever been discussed in your son's class?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I am it wasn't.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you a member of any organized religious faith?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not a formal member.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Informal member?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I identify myself as Jewish faith. Not a paying member of any temple or synagogue.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you observe any Jewish holidays?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In my own way. I fast on Yom Kippur, and that's difficult for a fatso like me.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you ever been a member of a synagogue?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you ever studied what the Jewish faith says about the origins of man and life in the world?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where did you study that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Informally, personally.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is your understanding of their position on the origin of the world?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As with virtually all matters among Jews there are as many opinions as there are
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">12</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">individuals.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are there some individuals, if not viable groups, within the Jewish faith who subscribe to 
literal interpretation of Genesis?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There are, but it's definitely a minority position.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is your personal belief as to the existence of a God?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Difficult question because it depends so much on a matter of definition. If you ask me whether I 
think there's a male figure with a beard sitting in the clouds, I certainly don't. But if one were to define God 
as the source of order in the universe, I might be tempted to say yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You might be tempted to. Is that your -</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I reserve judgment, because that's an issue far too difficult for the human mind to answer.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So to the extent that you would consider the possibility of a God, you would define it as a source 
of order in the universe?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. I didn't quite say that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I just want to understand what your
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">13</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">position is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I said if one were to define God that way, I might be willing to give my assent.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is your present opinion as to the existence of a God?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's again a definitional question. If one chooses to -</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Define God.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: If you can. If the witness has a definition.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, I really don't. It means too many different things to too many people.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's why I am trying to ask you what it means to you, because I understand that it can be 
given different meanings.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, I really can't. Mysteries have no definitions.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would you characterize yourself as an agnostic, an atheist, deist, sir, or any of the other labels 
which have arisen to put people in nice pigeon holes?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The problem with academics is we tend to perhaps traversely and certainly ardently to value 
our personal approaches so much that we
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">14</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">really decline to impose any label upon ourselves, and therefore I have always resisted such 
characterizations. As the literal meaning of the word, and agnostic is one of them, is unsure. In the literal meaning 
of course I am, in the vernacular agnostic, and have done many things. Let us say I regard the issues 
too difficult for either my mind or anyone else's to solve.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> To the extent that any of those are a label concerning your position on the existence or lack of 
existence on a God, would agnostic be the closest that you are aware of?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> When something is close it's not necessarily good enough. I will certainly admit that agnostic 
is certainly a closer word than creationist. But any word is so far from my personal beliefs that I decline 
to be labeled by the terms.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You say that mysteries have no definition. What do you mean by that, that the existence of God is 
a mystery?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> However we define it, we know so little that the subject is beyond our comprehension.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Beyond our intellectual comprehension?
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">15</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's the only way I know to comprehend. To comprehend literally, that doesn't mean that we 
don't have other sources of feeling, et cetera.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that a religious person can be a competent scientist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Of course. The empirical record proves it. There are thousands upon thousands of religious people 
who are competent scientists.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that a religious person who might be characterized as a fundamentalist can be a 
competent scientist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Depends on what they do. If the science that they do has no bearing upon their belief in the 
literal interpretation of scripture, then the answer might be yes. If, for example, they worked on the 
mechanism of the heart, and were only interested in how it functions as a machine, never ask questions about how 
it got there, how it arose, I imagine that one could.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that a person who might be characterized as a fundamentalist on religious issues 
could be an adequate scientist in studying evolution and the subject of origins generally?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">16</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Insofar as at least in my understanding the basis of creationism is a belief that God or some 
supernatural force placed creatures on earth by an act of miraculous creation, and insofar as a 
miraculous creation is a suspension of natural laws and insofar as science deals with natural laws only, the 
answer would be no. Except with one qualification. If for example a creation scientist can find himself in 
my profession, for example, merely to describing fossils, I suspect since that's a purely empirical endeavor, 
it could be done.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> My question, though, I am not sure if I was perhaps as clear as I might be, is if someone is a 
&quot;religious fundamentalist&quot; and is a scientist studying origins, if they look at all the scientific data and attempt 
to analyze it, in the most competent scientific manner that they know, would they be any less a 
competent scientist because of their religious beliefs?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Could you define fundamentalist for me?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I admit the term does not admit of an easy definition for me. It is a term bandied about in this 
lawsuit, more by the plaintiffs than
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">17</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">the defendants, I might say. Let's take one step back and just replace the term fundamentalist with 
one who has an article of faith, believes in the literal account of Genesis, his article of faith I said.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Science of course by definition doesn't deal in articles of faith. So insofar as articles of faith 
involve empirical claims, as a literal belief in Genesis does, such a person could not be by the usual definitions 
a scientist.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How does Genesis necessarily involve an article of faith as empirical data, is that what you said?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That was your definition.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am saying as an article of faith &#151; let me rephrase the question. If a scientist believes in 
Genesis literally as an article of faith and then studies it, studies not it, but the subject of origins generally as 
a scientist, can he not believe in one as an article of faith, Genesis as an article of faith and then study 
the scientific evidence without being biased or tainted in your own mind?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You mean of course the literal
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">18</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">interpretation of Genesis. I believe that Genesis is an inspired account in a different way, and very 
great literature as well. Sorry, I missed the thread of your question.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What I heard you say earlier indicated to me that you understand that a scientist who believed as 
an article of faith in the literal account of Genesis could not be a competent scientist to study the subject 
of origins and theories of origins.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> If they insisted a priori and an unreviseable belief that the literal story of Genesis had to be true, 
then since the empirical evidence is so overwhelmingly against certain aspects of the Genesis story, 
particularly the creation of all life in 6 days and 24 hours, that could not be because that belief has been 
falsified.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That is the key, isn't it, as to whether they will try to establish or come to their work with a 
priori conviction?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That could not be altered.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If they had this religious belief but they were able to put that aside and look at the
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">19</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">data as a scientist there is no reason why they &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's a contradiction in terms, they couldn't. If they really are biblical literalists committed to it, 
then the scientific data puts to the contrary.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware that even among biblical literalists that they don't necessarily believe that week 
of Genesis was a week of 24-hour days?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The bill as I understand it, demands that they are not 24-hour day, then the creation of the earth is 
so recent then it is equally falsified by the evidence that we have.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> We will get into the bill in a moment. I have been handed this morning either revised or 
updated curriculum vitae. Does this vitae include all of your employment since you received your 
Bachelor's Degree?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes, it does. It's been a dull life. I have just been at Harvard since I got my Ph.D.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What courses do you teach in geology at Harvard?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I teach several courses. I teach either year a large course in the core curriculum, which is the 
general education program for the
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">20</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">college which is called science B-16, which is an overview of the history of the earth and life. In 
addition, I teach, though not every year and in varying intervals, a number of more technical courses in 
paleontology, evolutionary theory, and the history of evolutionary and geological thought.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You received your Bachelor's Degree in geology at Antioch in 1963?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Correct.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Did you have any subspecialty in your study of geology?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Antioch is a strange school. It doesn't really recognize formal majors. I took a fair number of courses 
in biology as well, with a major in geology.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Did you bypass the Master's Degree? I don't see that listed.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. It's customary. At least many schools that are Ph.D. oriented to either have an honorary 
master's that you really get after having taken a certain number of courses or to dispense with it all together. 
I may even have it, I don't remember.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And your Ph.D. was in what?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">21</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In geology, with a specialty in paleontology, 1967, Columbia University.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Describe for me briefly how you would define paleontology?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Paleontology is the study of fossils. Simple as that, all aspects thereof.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Who was your major advisor at Columbia?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My major advisor was Norman Newell, a curator of fossil invertebrates at the Museum of 
Natural History.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you ever taught a course on creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I couldn't. There is no such thing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you ever discussed the subject of creation-science in your classroom?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Only in brief allusions in my science B-16 course.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you recall what your brief allusions would consist of?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They were negative.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I would expect that, but do you recall the content?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I in fact will give &#151; come up to Harvard next week. I am going to give 2 lectures
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">22</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">on Monday and Wednesday, which is the first lecture I will give on the subject. They mainly consisted 
on attempts to show that by the definitions of science, creationism did not qualify.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware of any schools where the subject of creation-science - I am talking about schools 
which are post secondary schools, colleges, universities, where creation-science has been taught?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I know that it is in the abstract, but have never talked with anyone who teaches such a course. I did 
in Dayton, Tennessee, meet the president of Bryan College, and I believe, though I am not certain, that 
they teach creationism there.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you know if it's being taught in any other colleges or universities say on the east coast, what 
would be some of the more major colleges?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I'm not aware that it is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would you be surprised if it is?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes &#151; depending on how it's taught, I would not be surprised if it were considered in sociology 
courses an issue of the day. I simply
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">23</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where did you graduate from high school?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Jamaica High School. It's a public high school in New York, in Queens. Not on the island of.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What science courses did you take there?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The standard very poor offerings that existed before the Sputnik went up. I had in junior high 
school, a year of general science, and then a year of biology, a year of physics, and a year of chemistry, 
plus mathematics of course. No calculus.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Did you study theories of origins in high school?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Ever so briefly.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What do you recall about your study?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Virtually nothing. Evolution was treated in a week or so at the end of the course. That being, by 
the way, a legacy of the Scopes trial and the textbooks which still exist not many years later.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How did you arrive at the conclusion that that was a legacy of the Scopes trial?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Because the book we used was Moon,
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">24</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Mann, and Otto. And we know since that book was around since 1920 that, although the early 
editions included much evolution, the post-Scopes trial ones did not.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware that there were other texts which were available which perhaps had a more 
thorough discussion of evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No idea. I was a little child.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Was the creation model or any symbols there of origins treated in your high school courses?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. But there was very little evolution either.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In undergraduate school at Antioch, what courses on theories of origins would you have taken?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Theories of origins is a bad term, because we don't really deal with origins in the study of evolution. 
If you ask me in evolution, the answer is a fair number. I guess I only had one formal course 
entitled &quot;Evolution,&quot; but I had since age ten or 11 made a personal study of the subject.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What books had you read from age ten
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">25</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">and 11 that you can recall and that would have been influential?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The first book and most influential one was George Simpson's, THE MEANING of EVOLUTION.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When did you read that book?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Let us say I attempted to read it at age 11. I doubt in rereading it later that I understood much of 
it then.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Any other particular influential books in this area?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I like Roy Chapman Andrews' ALL ABOUT DINOSAURS, but I doubt very much that it said 
much about processes of change.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In undergraduate school, did you receive any instruction in creation-science, model of origins 
or anything similar thereto?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Only from personal study. I always had an interest In the subject.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And in your postgraduate studies, did you have any study of the creation-science model of origins, 
or anything similar to it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not formally, again.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What was the subject of your Ph.D. dissertation that you wrote?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">26</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> THE EVOLUTION FOSSIL LAND SNAILS FROM BERMUDA.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Was that published?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes, it was. It's item 20 on that list if I remember correctly, a very long and complex title.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When was the first time you heard the term creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I just don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Approximately?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The problem is I don't know whether &#151; I certainly am aware of literal beliefs in Genesis. I have read 
a lot about the Scopes trial as a teenager. I just don't know whether the term was used then. I don't 
think so, but I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In response to our request for documents you brought with you this morning some various 
documents I want to ask you some questions about.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">First of all, labeled in a folder entitled American Society of Naturalists, Committee on Creationism, 
there is a memo and two or three letters. Do you recall what the occasion was that you received this?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">27</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. I became president of the American Society of Naturalists by the death of the man who 
should have served. I was not so elected. I was vice president. And one of the items of business was the 
establishment of a committee within the society to study the creationist challenge, and I as president 
participated in the setting up of such a committee asking Bruce Wallace to be its chairman. That 
committee functioned sporadically, made the report that you have, and more or less merged with a still 
ongoing committee for which you have a folder of documents and of which I am a member of the Society for 
the Study of Evolution. I might say that the Society for the Study of Evolution of the American Society 
of Naturalists are the two major professional societies of evolutionists.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So you appointed Bruce Wallace to chair the committee; is that correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Bruce Wallace is too eminent a man. One doesn't appoint him, one begs him to do it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You were responsible?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I asked him, yes.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">28</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When did the American Society of Naturalists decide to set up a committee on creationism?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My memory for dates is terrible.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Approximately?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It was 1978 or '79 or 1980. It was at the annual meeting.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is there any resolution or any other written documentation concerning the reasons why this 
committee was set up?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> If so, I don't have them. As I remember, Walter Bock, was a professor of biology at Columbia, wrote 
to the president of the society asking or recommending that such a committee be established. I had 
that letter at one time. I don't now, because I passed on my entire files. As I said, I was only president 
pro tem.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What do you recall as the reasons motivating this committee being established?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> We evolutionists believe that what you call creation-science is a contradiction in terms and is 
not science. We were alarmed at its spread in various secondary schools across the nation and set up 
a committee to look into ways whereby
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">29</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">evolutionary biologists might raise questions and oppose this spread.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Was a charge given to this committee?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Only to report back the following year as to what they thought effective tactics might be. Let me 
not say that. What they thought the appropriate stands of professional evolutionary biologists might be.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> It was clear at the outset, was it not, that the overall purpose would be to symbol creationism?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, yes, indeed. I presume that's not an issue. Sorry if I was pussyfooting.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is the Voice of Reason?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The Voice of Reason about which I confess I know not a great deal, is an organization brought to 
my acquaintance by Morris Goodman, who is an evolutionary biologist at Wayne State University in 
Detroit, which has at least one of its charges combating creationism. Dr. Goodman asked if I would sign 
the statement of purpose and become a member of I don't know if it's the board of advisers or just a list 
of signatories. I read the list and signed them.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">30</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> These subscribe to this document entitled the Voice of Reason with several subtopics, the 
American Tradition and another subtopic of the Secular Stage.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Is your question did he by signing subscribe to the entire document or just the statement 
on creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: My question is, there is a two page document there which his name I think the 
fourth page is listed as on the national board of advisers.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As always in signing documents, I do not guarantee that I accede to every nuance of every word, 
but the resolution section which is the guts of the document I signed because I do indeed support it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What have been the functions or activities of the Voice of Reason to date?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When did you agree to sign on as a member of the National Advisory Board?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think it was last spring, spring of 1981 that is. But I would not commit myself to that. Plus or 
minus 8 months, which is the
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">31</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">academician's statistical fluctuation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Looking at the National Advisory Board I notice it includes people like Isaac Asimov, Francisco 
Ayala, Guy Bush, and there are people on the list. Would it be fair to say that all these people would be 
evolutionists?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I am sure they are all evolutionists. Yes, it would.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> These other documents that you have provided from the Voice of Reason which include some 
really outstanding works of art, have you read those before?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have glanced through them.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I notice on one page it says &quot;It is our heritage to continually construct a wall of separation 
between church and state.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The only thing wrong with that is the split infinitive.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But do you agree that's part of our heritage, to have a wall of separation between church and state?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I thought that's what the first amendment says, not in quite that graphic language. The best for 
the protection of religion, as well
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">32</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">as everything else.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Has this been published, to your knowledge, any of this information in any other form?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> It would appear to be perhaps the draft of some sort of pamphlet or something?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It did come in a bound pamphlet form. No, that art does not hold a shadow to Michelangelo. I 
think Michelangelo today would have been an evolutionist.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Does this group have any meetings that &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You have not attended any personally. By the way, did anybody ever ask you if you do this last 
Tuesday?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. I am sorry. I don't like being here either. I want to be with my family.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But you were never contacted to check and see if you could have done this Tuesday?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I couldn't have, I had to teach. I don't really remember if we did, since I had a class in the morning, 
I couldn't have in any case.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">33</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">As I understand it, I am here at your request, not at my personal desire.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that. What involvement have you had with the so-called Committees of Correspondence?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No personal involvement. I merely submitted those documents since they were sent to me. I tried 
to give you whatever literature I had from any formally constituted anti-creationist group.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware of the purpose of Committees of Correspondence?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In a loose sort of way, yes. I have spoken very briefly to Stanley Weinberg in the State of Iowa, whom 
I understand is their leader, and I know the head of Massachusetts branch, Laurie Godfrey, but have 
had no formal ties with them.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You haven't done any work or any writings yourself?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you know why you were sent this material?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I imagine they have a mailing list that
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">34</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Includes evolutionists of notoriety. I guess I classify - I qualify as such.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I think you said earlier that you are a member of the Society for the Study of Evolution's 
education committee. What is your understanding of the purpose of the education committee?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> To study the creationist challenge and devise means of meeting it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Again, the purpose is to oppose it, correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, yes, indeed.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Can I ask you to clarify your question by what you mean oppose it, do you mean oppose 
the teaching of it in public schools or oppose it more generally?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You can't oppose what parents do in their house or what churches do in their buildings. That's 
no concern of ours.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I notice in some of the correspondence on the committee, education committee of the Society for 
the Study of Evolution the term the anti-evolutionist is often used. Do you use that term in reference to 
the creation scientist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I usually call them creationists. They
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">35</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">are not creation scientists, because in my view they are not scientists, and they are people opposed 
to evolution. So I myself use the term creationist.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you use the term anti-evolutionist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I haven't, I don't think. But it would not be an inappropriate term.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What duties or activities have you undertaken on the education committee?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I attended a meeting at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Evolution held in Iowa 
this June or July, and beyond that I have been a fairly passive member, merely receiving documents, 
although I did send out one mailing in which I merely sent copies of the two of the articles that you have 
to all members of the committee in response to a request that we circulate among ourselves those 
writings that we have.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What articles did you send?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The piece from DISCOVER MAGAZINE, and the natural history column entitled a visit to 
Dayton, both of which you have.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> There is a file with some
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">36</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">correspondence in it titled the &quot;National Academy of Sciences.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The National Academy of Sciences has a committee. How active or how it's constituted I don't know. 
It was preparing a draft statement on creationism. I was contacted by Dr. Maxine Singer, and asked 
to check its wording and make any comments. I suggested a very few alterations, mainly stylistic.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Other than that, they did hold a meeting in Washington, I was invited to attend it but was unable 
to because I had classes that day. That is the extent of my involvement with them.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you had any other &#151; you may have said something on this, perhaps I didn't hear &#151; but 
other than this reviewing this draft of a statement on creationism, have you had any other involvement 
with the National Academy of Science's opposition to creation?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not other than being invited to this meeting and being unable to attend.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In the final folder that I have in front of me presently is a National Association of Biology 
Teachers, which contains apparently some
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">37</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">correspondence.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. I have had no official contact with them. That like the Committee of Correspondence 
information that came to me and knowing that the NABT is active in the anti- creationist front, I thought I 
would supply those documents. I should, however, mention that I did at the annual meeting of the 
National Association of Biology Teachers held in Boston and now again it's plus or minus a year, it was either 
this year's or last year's meeting, give an address on creationism.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is there a transcript of that address?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think there is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is it included in these materials?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't own it, but it could be, if such exists it would be a cassette tape and could be obtained 
by contacting Wayne Moyer, who is head of the national association.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Let me say for the record that in Boston on Wednesday we did ask Dr. Gould if there 
were any transcripts of any of the addresses or speeches he had given on the subjects covered by your 
request to produce documents which
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">38</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">were in his possession, and the answer is that there are not or to the extent there are, they are 
included in those document requests. There may have been other brief appearances on radio shows or 
other speaking engagements, but he does not have any transcripts of those in his possession.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> To the best of your recollection, would your talk or speech on creation-science given to the 
National Association of Biology Teachers contain any information different than what is included in your writings?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It was longer, so evidently there would be more words, but I think the content of it covered, 
particularly the article that you are holding now.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You're referencing the DISCOVER article?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have any of the other organizations that you are a member of or have been involved with besides 
the ones we have gone through taken an official position on creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not that I know of.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How about the AAAS, are you aware of it?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">39</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't think they have, but I don't know for certain. The AAAS, of course, is such a large 
organization. One is a member to receive the magazine SCIENCE and I am not aware of their official position.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you a fellow of &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's an honorary title.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What does it mean?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It means that with your document, and 75 cents you can take a ride on the New York subway.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you voted on?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. You get a little psuedo parchment document in the mail that says you're a fellow and you put it 
on your CV.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is that a mark of distinction within the scientific community?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It is said to be. I do not regard it as a particularly distinguishing mark thereof.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you recall making a remark previously in a speech or a presentation or perhaps at a 
so-called debate, I don't know if it was a debate or not, on creation-science, that creation-science was not an 
issue anywhere in the world except in the United States?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">40</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have said things like that but not quite in those terms.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is your position on that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That so far as I know, that in no other western nation - I don't know what's happening in China or 
Sri Lanka &#151; That in no other Western nation though. I know there are individual creationists and even 
in England a few societies, but that this is not a major political issue.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware of as to creation-science or some form of creation model is taught in Canada?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I guess I always consider chauvinistic, one tends to consider Canada as an extension of the 
United States. After all, Montreal almost got into the World Series this year. Yes, I think there's a 
creationist movement in Canada, and I guess I was lumping Canada with the United States.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware whether creation-science is taught in the public schools in Canada?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And you say this is really not an issue, as I understand it, anywhere but in the United States 
and Canada?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As far as I know it is not a major
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">41</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">political issue that commands media attention.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Now you have said not a political issue. Is it an issue in the scientific community?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware that the, if I have the term right, the Museum of Natural History in London had 
an exhibit in which creation-science or something similar thereto was presented as an alternative 
to Darwin's theory of evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I am afraid that's a misinterpretation of what was done at the British Museum of Natural 
History. There was a fairly cautionary put up in one of the exhibit halls that spoke about alternatives, but it 
was not an equal time exhibit.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But which said that creation-science, if we can use that term, in the general sense at this point, 
was an alternative theory to evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have the copy of the wording. I don't believe that that's an accurate representation of it. I don't 
have it with me.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you produce that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I could produce it insofar as it is an editorial in NATURE MAGAZINE that talks about this. I believe 
I have a copy of it and can produce it.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">42</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: If you can produce that, I would appreciate it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: However, it was an editorial in NATURE MAGAZINE, which is a fairly common 
magazine.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If I can have just have a cite.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I would like this marked as Defendants' Exhibit 1 to the Gould deposition an 
article from the May 1981 DISCOVER MAGAZINE entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.freethought-web.org/ctrl/gould_fact-and-theory.html">Evolution as Fact and
Theory</a>.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(Whereupon, document above referred to was marked as Defendants' Exhibit 1 for identification, as 
of this date.)</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In Exhibit 1, on page 34, the second paragraph you state that &quot;The arousal of dormant issues 
should reflect fresh data that give renewed life to abandoned notions.&quot; And then you go on to state that 
&quot;The creationists have not a single new fact or argument.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Upon what do you base your belief that the creationists do not have any new facts or arguments?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Reading their literature and being aware of what was used in the 1920's in the Scopes
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">43</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">trial, and the literature of that time, particularly by George McCready Price, who was the leader of 
the creationists in the 20's and 30's.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you describe for me the literature that you are talking about, particularly with reference 
to George McCready Price? I am talking about George McCready Price. What arguments did he forward?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I haven't read this material for a while, but they were mainly including what
Bryan and others 
presented at the Scopes trial, primarily arguments about the presumed young age of the earth and gaps 
in fossil record, et cetera.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Did he talk about the second law of thermodynamics?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Who remembers, but &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you recall that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't remember. It's a pseudo argument. When I say not a single new fact or argument, a 
literal meaning of argument to me is something that has, I suppose argument is anything that anyone 
says, there are new words that weren't used before. By &quot;argument,&quot; I mean something that has 
integral substance.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">44</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If your statement that the creationists have not a single new fact or argument, if that were not 
true would your opinion change any on the subject of creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I didn't understand that question.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: I didn't either.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> One of the first statements that you make in this article is that the creationist have not offered 
any new facts or new arguments, as I take it &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I mean arguments of substance.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that. But if there are in fact new facts since 1925 in the Scopes trial or new 
arguments, and arguments of substance as you term those, would your opinions be different?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: About what?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your opinions on creation-science as a science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I don't mean to be obstructive here, but I still don't understand it. It seems to me 
what you're asking is if in fact there were scientific evidence for creation would you then have a different view.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">45</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I think the witness' article begins on the premise that there are or there is no 
new evidence.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The main premise of the article is that &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I am sorry. If you can answer the question, I have no objection to your answering 
the question.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I still don't really understand it but the main premise of the article of course is that there is 
nothing going forth. The main point is not a historical one as to when arguments arose. Like any scientist, 
when an argument that we haven't heard arises we have to assess it. I am unaware, and I have read a 
fair amount of creationist literature, of anything that I find in the slightest persuasive.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You use the term creationist literature. What do you include within that term?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Here I am using the sentence of those who support the literal interpretation of Genesis as an 
infallible guide to interpreting the history of life in the earth.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I don't understand your definition or
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">46</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">characterization of creationist literature. You seem to be describing it with reference to the beliefs of 
the writers, rather than to the implications of the writings.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think that is what the creationist movement represents, and I think the bill specifies that when 
it talks about the age of the earth and the flood. So it's that body of literature by Gish, Henry Morris 
and others I regard as the main body of creationist literature.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you read Act 590?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I would like to ask you if you could to look at it again for a moment. And looking at section 4-A, 
which is the definition of creation-science, before asking you questions about that, from your other testimony 
I think it's fair to say that you view creation-science as nothing more than a literal interpretation 
of Genesis under the guise of science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Let me say that creation-science is to me a contradiction of terms. Because creation, in my 
understanding, refers to the suspension of natural law by some power to place creatures upon
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">47</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">this earth.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> First of all, let me ask you then, where in the act is creation-science or creation defined or described 
in such a way that it necessarily includes the suspension of natural laws?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Point one, sudden creation of the universe, energy and life from nothing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Now that is one part of what creation-science may include. It says, does it not, that creation-science 
is the scientific evidences for creation and inferences there from. Is that correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not exactly in those words. Creation-science includes the scientific evidence and related 
inferences that indicate, yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is there anything in that sentence which necessarily requires the suspension of natural laws?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In vernacular definition, the production of things from nothing is to me miraculous.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In that first sentence.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think so because to me the term
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">48</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">creation-science, defining creation as I do, implicitly refers to miraculous suspension. That's the way 
I define the miracle of creation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> A miraculous suspension of natural laws?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That is how you define creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's the core claim of creation-science as I understand it is the suspension of natural law to place 
on this earth by the fiat act of a supernatural Creator the kinds of life.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you feel like you are familiar with the account of creation given in Genesis?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have read Genesis. I don't know all the exogenical traditions, of course.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Looking at 4-A1, could you tell me if that language is in Genesis?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I read Genesis different from creationists. To me it's an allegorical tale of great literary power.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> My question is, I think according to your earlier statement that creation-science is derived from 
a literal reading of Genesis, is that right?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">49</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As I understand it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I want you to just look at 4-A1, which says, &quot;the sudden creation of the universe, energy and life 
from nothing.&quot; Is that in Genesis?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't think it is. Other people do. Remember, any part of the Bible can be read in many 
different ways.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> 2 says, &quot;the insufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about investment of all 
living kinds from a single organism,&quot; is that in Genesis?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I'm not aware of that Genesis speaks of mutation. I don't see how it could.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> 3 is, &quot;changes only within fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals&quot; does 
Genesis say that only the kinds have only fixed or &#151; does Genesis say that the living kinds changed only 
within fixed limits?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My answer is really the same to all of these.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Are you asking the witness what his interpretation of Genesis is, or are you asking 
the witness of his understanding of what the interpretation of Genesis advanced by creation
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">50</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">scientists is?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: From his earlier testimony I think he said that he had studied the Genesis account 
of creation. Genesis account of &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I believe his testimony was that he had read the Genesis account of creation, but I 
don't believe he said he had studied or studied it or read it recently.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: I said that I am aware that there are many exogenical traditions of it. I certainly 
know what the words say, but there are so many different interpretations. There is no book that has been 
more interpretive in a variety of ways than the Bible. There are 100 different interpretations, as you know. 
I don't quite see what you are getting at.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your statement I think earlier was that creation-science, besides the point that you think it's a 
contradiction in terms, that it is also merely a literal account of Genesis, is that correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It depends upon the claim that Genesis read literally represents the facts of nature. Specifically 
in points 5 and 6. And if you
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">51</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">allowed a little play, that wouldn't change very much.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where in Genesis, for example, does it state that there has been a relatively recent inception of 
the earth and living kinds?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again, I don't believe that it does.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I know, but if you interpret it literally, where does it say that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> One calculates the genealogies, starting with Adam, and gets an age.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is that in Genesis, to your knowledge?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's not all in Genesis. You might have to proceed through some of the begat sections of Chronicles 
and some of the other books, but that's how it's been done.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where in Genesis is separate ancestry from man and apes?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My answer is going to be the same to every one of these questions. That represents one 
possible interpretation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's an interpretation, but it is not necessarily in there, is it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It can't necessarily be in there since so many people who regard Genesis as an</font>
<P>&nbsp;<P><font face="Times New Roman">[<i>Page 52 is missing - </i>MvADP Editor.]
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">53</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">which is a widely circulated publication which would support the theory of creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Could you define the theory of creation-science for me in this context?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Creation-science, let's at this point confine ourselves to the definition given in Act 590, since that's 
the issue at hand.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> But you see it's an odd definition. One of the points it makes under definition I regard as 
inappropriate there. It says 2 kinds. That's a caricature of what evolutionists say. I don't believe the mutation 
and natural selection is sufficient, but that is surely not part of creation-science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">So If you confine the definition to this set of 6 points, then the answer is yes, but only because the 
definitions are so poor. Of course there's literature that says mutation and natural selection is insufficient. 
I forget what its called in logic, but to say that the acceptance of what anybody says is the definition of 
any one part of it commits one to the definition is false.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(Recess taken.)
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">54</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your statements concerning your position and conclusion that creation-science cannot be 
science, could you tell me again why you believe that creation-science is not?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Because its core belief requires that natural law be suspended for the sudden or flat introduction 
of basic kinds onto the earth, and science is defined as an enterprise based on natural law. The 
suspension there of not being science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Does the role or the definition and use of the term &quot;kinds,&quot; is that precluded from being science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> What I said doesn't apply to the word kind. I mean kind to me is a very vague term, the likes of 
which I don't know. But the fiat introduction of any kind of life, be it a species a genesis or kingdom.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you feel that we know all that there is to know about the natural law?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Goodness, if we knew everything that there was about the world I guess we would pack up and 
play golf for the rest of our lives.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So there is more to learn?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">55</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> By definition in science, there is always more to learn. What a dull world if there weren't.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that it would be scientific for a scientist to look at the origin of life or some organism 
and try to determine whether the origination of that life or organism was possible under the laws of nature?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Science, like any other enterprise, has boundaries. Science is that enterprise that attempts to 
describe and interpret the facts of the world under natural law, therefore attempts to study the origins of 
things under the laws of nature, and part of science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So the study of the limits of the laws of nature would be part of science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The limits are not &#151; the limits are not &#151; limits have to do more with definitions of the enterprise, 
not with the facts of nature. Therefore, nothing about morality is part of science. Natural law doesn't 
deal with morality. But anything about the facts of nature come under the heading of natural law as 
we understand it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What was the last statement? I didn't
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">56</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">hear it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That the fact of nature as we understand it comes under the province of natural law.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You use the term as we understand them.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Science is always tentative.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If a scientist might resort to some scientific method and concluded that the origin of the first life 
could not have been by chance or by just the laws of nature operating, could that be scientific?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> First of all, let me say that I have no professional opinion on the question of the origin of life is 
not what evolution deals with. So I am not going to be able to go very deeply into technical questions. 
But domain of science does not include things that don't have to do with natural law. I don't know what 
else one can say. And therefore, for instance, does not allow one to speak on questions of morality.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Define evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Evolution is the study of changes at several levels, either within local populations or from species 
to species that occur once life is on
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">57</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">earth.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you restate that? I really want your precise definition of what you consider evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The science of evolutionary biology, that's really what I will call it, is the science that studies history 
of changes that life has undergone, both within populations and between species once it arose.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Between species and what that arose?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Within populations. That's not a very elegant definition. The substance is there.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> According to your understanding of creation-science, does it deny the presence of evolution or 
the occurrence?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It denies the sufficiency of it to account for the living world as we know it. What literature I have 
read does not deny that a limited amount of evolution can occur.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The evolution, these are common layman's terms, I mean the evolution of, for example deposition &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I am happy to let the witness answer that question but in view of your
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">58</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">earlier questions when you ask him his understanding of creation-science, does it allow some evolution 
to occur, are you talking about creation-science literature or as defined in Act 590?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I want to talk about it in terms of the act unless otherwise specified.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: That's why I wanted to clarify that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The act says you've got to believe in changes only within fixed limits of originally created kinds.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That could be fairly characterized as evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, yes, but the theory of evolution maintains that the whole pattern of life as we see it is a process 
of change by natural law. Evolution would not be satisfied by any means by the statement that only 
poodles and chihuahuas can be derived from the basic dog.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But the creation science definition in Act 590 does include evolution to a degree.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> But that's not evolution as we understand it. It's only a little bit of a change.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">59</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">That's not what the theory of evolution is fundamentally about. Just as, for example &#151; never mind.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You were going to say as for example. You make statements like in negotiations lawyers can't let 
them try?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Nineteenth Century creationists believed in a certain amount of natural selection but they used 
it only as a device for getting rid of extremely deformed individuals. But they weren't Darwinians. 
Quite the opposite. So in other words, it's not being an evolutionist to believe point 3.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you define evolution and discuss the changes that life has undergone between species, is it 
a necessary part of evolutionary theory that all species are related in some fashion?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Genealogically, yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And that if you go back far enough there will be a common ancestor?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes, there are common ancestors. It's not impossible that if life arose from chemical constituents of 
the earth's atmosphere and oceans,
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">60</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">that it might have done so twice, but yes, it's a claim of common ancestry, sure.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So it is part of the theory of evolution, scientific theory of evolution as opposed to social evolution, 
that all organisms do have a common ancestor?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again I qualify that. It's a claim of theory of evolution that all evolution are connected by ties 
of genealogy. It is not inconceivable, that life, if it arose from nonlife, could have made that transition a 
few times. However, it is probable that all life actually had a single common ancestry. In any case, even 
if there were say a few origins of the lowest level, changes only within fixed limits of originally 
created kinds of plants and animals I think would be excluded. By no stretching of the term kind could a 
bacterium and human be placed as the same kind.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So while it is not inconceivable that there were more than one &#151; that there was more than 
one instance of life from nonlife, is it the prevailing view in the theory of evolution that life evolved 
from nonlife only once from that
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">61</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">organism?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's a very unimportant issue. I don't even know whether it's the prevailing view or not. It's 
not what we deal with. We have in the fossil record going back to 3 and a half billion years forms that 
we believe are the ancestor of all others. Those are the forms of very simple bacteria.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where do you believe those forms of life came from?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again, I have to reiterate what I said, that is as an evolutionary biologist we do not deal &#151; I do 
not have expertise at all on the issue of origins. It's curious, if I may make aside comments, how in a way 
the professional evolutionary biologists are within the linguistic limits of the debate placed counter to 
what is called creationism.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">An evolutionary biologists as professionals deal with changes in life once life arises. One would have 
to know a lot more chemistry, for example, than I know to talk about the origins of life from nonlife. I 
just don't have a professional opinion in that area.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">62</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am not trying to have you explain to me exactly how life emerged from nonlife, but is that not part 
of the general theory of evolution that life did emerge from nonlife?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's not what evolutionary biologists study.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You're limiting it to evolutionary biologists?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The theory of evolution as I studied it is a biological discipline that talks about the evolution of 
life once it arises. The term evolution has been around &#151; the word evolution has been around in 
many usages for a very long time. Spencer applied it to the evolution of societies. Evolution was a 
vernacular word, and I don't deal with all those other meanings.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But it does have other meanings, doesn't it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> All sorts of words have vernacular meanings that are wider than their technical ones, and 
people engaged in the technical studies don't necessarily know. Significance has a definition in statistics, but 
a statistician needn't know whether things &#151;
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">63</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your study then as an evolutionary biologist, how far back would you say &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I go back 3 and a half billion years to the first life on earth.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What's that first evidence that you are aware of?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The first evidence is bacteria from the fig tree Zimbabwe. And maybe somewhere else in Africa.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And while perhaps not from that precise bit of bacteria that you are aware of, is it not true 
that bacteria are the oldest life is according to evolutionary thought presumed to be the ancestors for 
all subsequent life?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's correct: Yes, the later life arose from.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What within the scientific community, not necessarily within evolutionary biology, who would take 
us back farther, as a group or a subdiscipline?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Those biochemists that were interested. That's not all biochemists.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is there such a thing as an evolution biochemist?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">64</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That are biochemists who study how life may have arisen from nonlife. I don't know what they 
call themselves.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is the theory as to how life arose from nonlife?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again, I didn't even take organic chemistry in college, so I am speaking largely as a layman here. 
But the general feeling as I understand it &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: You can answer the question the extent that you have knowledge or opinion.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Is that life arose by natural processes and natural law.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> From nonlife?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is it correct to say it was essentially a chemical reaction?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Awfully complex set of chemical reactions. As you know we can make from the constituents of 
the earth's atmosphere a lot of fairly complex organics, including amino acids. That's not life.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Then within the, if I could refer to it, as the school of evolutionary thought, as opposed
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">65</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">to just evolutionary biology or paleontology?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again, I don't mean to be instructional early. But professional boundaries are very guarded 
in academia and it's not regarded happily when, people make pronouncements in areas they don't 
really understand. I don't know what you mean. If it includes the evolution of society, then I disclaim. 
Darwinian theory, for example, is not the only biological evolutionary theory &#151; there is about genetic change 
in DNA and its consequences.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, when we talk about the evolution of society one can only speak by analogy. When we 
talk about those biochemical changes before the development of DNA, it again can only be by analogy. I 
don't really know what else to say.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you consider yourself an evolutionary biologist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Perhaps I am being hampered by semantics here. But as a paleontologist you study fossils?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">66</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you study the molecules of DNA and genetics as a paleontologist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Only on very rare occasions when you get soft parts preserved.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you made the study of the &#151; I am just curious, sir as to what your area of expertise is?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My area of expertise is fossils. When I said DNA and consequences? No. I need to study DNA when 
I study the symmetry of the hand.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I think we have established that within the general framework of evolution, and we are talking 
only about evolution of life here, not society and that sort of thing, that it is believed that life emerged 
from nonlife, these complex chemical reactions?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. I didn't say that. I said that that is not what my profession of evolutionary biology deals with.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that. You're a professor of &#151; you have a Ph. D. in a field which is obviously in 
geology and I am sure that you are aware of what are the other parts &#151;
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">67</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I said that. I have to insist that it's not part of evolutionary biology. As I said to you.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> A part of evolution generally.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It is not part of what I define as the field of evolution. It is a part of science, to be sure. It's not my 
part of science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that. I can appreciate that, that you would prefer to limit yourself to the area where 
you are really concentrated. But my question is, as you understand it, where did the matter, the nonlife 
come from?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, that's not even a scientific question. If you want to go back that far. Science itself doesn't deal 
in ultimate origins. I am sorry, I thought you were giving me the chemical constituents of the earth. 
You asked me where matter came from, how can science deals with that question. I have no opinion on 
that. That is the mystery of mysteries.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If I asked you where the matter on this planet came from, does science say anything about that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Science has theories of how solar
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">68</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">systems form, sure. That's a very different issue from ultimately where the matter of universe 
came from.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What are some of the theories of where the matter on this planet came from?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again, I disclaim any formal expertise. I am not unaware of the scientific American level of 
what people say. But as I understand it the most popular view refers to the origin of planets along with the 
sun from the condensation of a primordial cloud of dust and gas. I have a very rudimentary knowledge 
of physics and chemistry.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's commonly referred to as the big bang; is that correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, no. The big bang refers to again. As I said it, to a time when all the matter of the visible 
universe may have been together in a single place and there is dispersion after an explosion from that place, 
the condensation of the solar system is a later event. You have to talk to the cosmologists if you want 
the latest word on those issues.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Let me see if I understand you. So you feel natural origin of the first matter is not a
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">69</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">scientific question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> How could one answer a question like that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is the origin of the first matter then necessarily a religious question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That again depends on definitions of religion. I don't think all unanswerable questions are by 
definition part of religion. From the parts of our own mental structure, I at least could only conceive of 
two answers. Either that matter &#151; both of which involve a concept of eternity with which our poor 
minds can't deal. One is that matter was around forever, and two, that some other force was around forever 
that made matter at some point. We have no answers. I don't know how we get them. To me it is not 
necessarily a religious question. It's just a question unanswerable.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But it's a nonscientific question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And you can think &#151; you can't think of any other alternatives to either that matter always existed 
or that something always existed which created the matter?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">70</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I can't think of any other alternative. There may be. Certainly not in my subdivision.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think it is inappropriate to discuss in a public science classroom, for example, where 
that matter came from?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know how you could. I defer to my attorney here.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Just when you ask him if he thinks it's inappropriate, do you mean inappropriate asking 
for a legal conclusion whether it's unlawful?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: No; personally, in his opinion as a science professor.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: I would never include it in a curriculum, because we have nothing to say about 
it. Suppose a student asked me a question about it, I would give my personal opinion as in any other 
subject.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So if the student asked a question about it, you would give your honest opinion?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I would basically say why I didn't think it was science, a question that science can answer, it 
doesn't mean that he wouldn't have a discussion about it.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">71</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you tell me in kind of a nontechnical sense since I am a layman to science, upon what you 
base your opinion that the bacteria which we know of to be 3 and a half billion years old or something 
similar is the ancestor for all subsequent forces of life?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's primary, based on the biochemical similarities that you create all forms of life. DNA of 
modern, bacteria which seem to be not significantly different from the old ones is the same stuff that of which 
we are made.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is there anything about the similarities which necessarily dictates that there is a common ancestry?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The only sensible story I can tell based on it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> - It's the only sensible story.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I could tell another tale that isn't science. But I wouldn't be able to falsify it. I couldn't think of 
an observation that could run against it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But in trying to view the origin or the evolution of life 3 and a half billion years ago, can you think 
of an observation which would run
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">72</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">against?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That in principle would run against?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Yes. Run against this concept that &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Do you mean an actual observation that does run against or an observation in principle that might?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> First of all, are there any, to your knowledge?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Observations that run against?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There may be some that people have claimed have. But I know of none that in my interpretation 
does. If you ask me can I conceive of one, sure.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would you give me one?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Species it turned out, which I didn't, but it could have, when people started studying 
biochemical similarities, that based on DNA sequences or amino acid sequences, that humans were as closely 
related to bacteria and yeast as to chimpanzees. I have a real hard time reconciling that with notions of 
descent. It didn't work out that way. Biochemical taxonomies bear a marked resemblance to conventional ones.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">73</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So what you are saying is because biochemically we are closer to a chimpanzee than to a 
bacteria, then and I assume is the chimpanzee closer to the bacteria than we are?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, no. We are both so far, it's hard to say.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But because we are closer to the chimpanzee than we are to a bacteria that there has been 
this common ancestry at some point?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's not what I said. Your question was there any statement that can falsify evolution and I 
gave you which the converse doesn't necessarily hold. I can think of no other reasonable interpretation of 
that fact.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that all scientific evidence on theories of origin should be taught in the classroom?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> One of these is a question of definition. What do you mean by theories of origin?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am talking about theories of origin of man, of life, and of the universe.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> See, because again, we talked about theories of the origin of matter. I already said
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">74</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">that that kind of ultimate question really isn't a scientific one. We don't teach that. If you confine 
your questions about origins to those subjects with which science deals, then it's almost tautological. If 
you confine it to the objects, subjects with which science deals, then yes, all scientific evidence should 
be taught. Let me back-track. I don't mean that any claim ever made in history that is testable, after 
all there are testable claims that have been made, that have been falsified, and those needn't be taught. 
One need not teach that the earth might be flat. One need not teach that the sun goes around the 
earth. Those are scientific claims in the sense that they are testable. They were tested and found wanting.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If there is scientific evidence which would &#151; if there is scientific evidence for creation, do you think 
it should be taught?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There can't be. No, I can't because it's a definitional point again insofar as creation deals with 
miraculous suspension of law as we were discussing before. And that isn't science. There cannot be such.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">75</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> For example, under Act 590, one of the portions of the definition of creation-science indicates a 
relatively recent inception of the earth. Now, would you agree that, first of all there is evidence as to the 
age of the earth?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. And it all points to the falsity of part 6.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But if there should be evidence which points to a relatively recent inception of the earth, do you 
think that should be discussed? Scientifically, that is?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. If there were real evidence, yes. If there were real evidence that the sun went around the earth, 
it should be taught. The fact that some people claim it, which some people do, the very fact empirically 
that some people have that claim doesn't mean it should be taught. I am aware that people make that 
claim, but that doesn't mean it should be taught.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am not asking you to adopt that as being necessarily scientific. I am really asking if there is 
scientific evidence for that statement, or that contention of a relatively recent inception of the earth &#151;
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">76</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> But it has to be real evidence, it can't just someone's say so. Yes, that's a testable claim, and it's 
been tested and found false. If any new evidence came around, one would discuss it. But I am aware of none.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If there is scientific evidence on the insufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about 
I think you said something to the effect of all living kinds from a single organism, do you think that 
should be discussed in a public school science classroom?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That to me is one of the ways in which the bill is very poorly written, because to me it is not part 
of creation-science to claim the insufficiency of mutation and natural selection. I think most 
evolutionists think that mutation and natural selection are insufficient. I happen in my own personal views think 
they are a little more insufficient than other people. But even the most orthodox Darwinians, Mr. 
Ayala, would argue that genetic drift plays some role. To me that's an example of how the bill is badly 
written. For purposes of convenience, I think that we can refer to it as creation-science, and
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">77</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">that's what the bill speaks of. I think it might be a bit clearer.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your article in DISCOVER MAGAZINE, you discuss or differentiate between a theory and a fact.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What do you consider a theory to be?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> To me a theory is a set of ideas that attempts to interpret and explain the facts of the world.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If you take facts from the facts you derive or you get or hypothesize theories; is that correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a little more complicated than that. Because not all theories that anyone has ever tried arise 
as mere inductions from facts. Theories are tested by studying the facts of the world.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would you say that the fact that the earth is not flat is a theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. It's a fact.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> At one point it was a theory, wasn't it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, no, it was always a fact. We just didn't always know it.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">78</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But it was offered as a theory, and then in some way that was measured?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Indeed, it was offered as a fact. No. It was offered as a fact and people were wrong. No. Theories 
are not facts. Theories are structures of ideas that interpret and explain facts. I am aware that in the 
American vernacular the theory is used differently to mean imperfect fact. It is not what it means to a scientist.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you use the term American vernacular, are you talking exclusive of the scientific communities?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Since scientists always use the vernacular they mix the two on occasion also.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So this concept at the present time of differentiating between a theory and facts is one which may 
not be commonly held by the scientific community?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I am not saying it's never transgressed. I think it is commonly held.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When is the difference between a theory and a scientific theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That really has to do with incommensurate things, namely again vernacular and scientific
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">79</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">usages. A scientist shouldn't use the term accept to mean scientific theory. In the vernacular we say 
I have a theory about why the Yankees lost last month. That's not the way a scientist would use the term.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you talk about evolution as being both a fact and a theory, as I understand what you are 
saying, and let me see if I can briefly summarize it, what you're talking about there is the concept on the 
first hand that evolution is a fact because we can observe certain changes, and it's a theory in the sense &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Can I stop you?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> It's a theory in the sense that from these observed changes we can try to extrapolate the 
larger changes which have occurred over time which we cannot observe?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, that is not a correct characterization.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Correct it for me.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Sure. The facts of evolution of which we by no means know all of them, are merely the path ways 
of evolution, the ones we know and the ones we don't know. The ones we don't know are
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">80</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">not yet in our vocabulary, but when we know them they will be the facts. The theory of evolution is 
how you interpret the causes of those connections. The processes, the ways by which those connections 
were established, whether by natural selection, whether by some other mechanism. The distinction is 
not between those genealogical connections we know and those we don't know. It's rather between the 
mere information which is the tree of life, and the modes of explanation for why that came about. The 
second being the theory. Darwin made that distinction all the time.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Also on the first page of your article, there is, I think an aside concerning President Reagan's 
remark that you devoutly hope that his remark was campaign rhetoric. I thought you didn't use devout in 
a religious sense?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, no. Just meaning very much hope.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Devout to some people it does have a religious connotation?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. But you will admit it also has a vernacular connotation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I have a hard problem trying to really differentiate between a fact and theory. You
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">81</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">define fact to be confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional 
assent. Now, if that is what a fact is &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's all it can be because science doesn't deal in certainty.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Can a theory then not rise to the level of being a fact?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. It doesn't mean it can't be right, but that's just not what a fact is. Theories are ideas that 
interpret and explain facts. They are just something else, they don't arise to the level.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your definition of the fact you kind of describe it without saying what it is. It has been confirmed 
to such a degree?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a piece of the world. This is a cup, I can describe what it's made out of. There is not a theory 
about cups. Facts are data, what the world is made out of. Theories are ways in which we interpret and 
explain how they operate, why they are here, et cetera. How they got here. Their ultimate why's we don't 
deal with.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are creation-science and to use Bill's term evolution science incompatible?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">82</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If there were, assuming arguendo, there were a creator at some point, which created that first &#151; 
that bacteria on the fig tree, and from there life evolves, would they not be compatible?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's not what the bill says.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that. I am asking if there are incompatible?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. There is a part of it that is incompatible.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is that part?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The fiat creation of the bacterium. Because that also involves the suspension of law. If you 
take Newton's law view of God that God is a clockwinder who sets up the laws of the universe, then let it 
run, is the universe. But again, I point out this act does not permit that version of creation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But again, you have to look at the definition, and if you look at that definition it says that &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> But it says separate ancestor man and apes. And if you have a bacterium there would not be 
separate ancestry.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I take it that you read those A, B &#151; 1
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">83</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">through 6 under 4-A there to be an all, inclusive definition of creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It doesn't have to be all inclusive, but I take it they at least include these or it wouldn't be law.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am just asking how you are reading it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My vernacular as a nonlawyer reading is that if it says these 6 are there, they are certainly part of 
it, and several of them are directly contradicted by the scenario that you just gave me.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That would be nonetheless an act of creation?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> What would?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> A creator, whatever that might be.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Making the bacteria.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Are you asking the witness if there are other religious interpretations of Genesis that 
are not inconsistent with evolutionary theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: No. I never asked that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: It sounded like what you are asking.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I think it presupposes
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">84</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">your whole theory of the case.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: If you would like to ask the witness that, we would be happy to answer.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware of any scientific alternatives to the theory of evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> How do you define the theory of evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I want to take it in its broad scientific sense. Including not only what you have described as 
the change within populations or between species, but also going back to that emergence of life from nonlife.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't define it that way.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But are you aware of any scientific alternatives to all, or a portion of the theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again, I don't understand that. Scientific alternatives, any one of the particular proposals, there is 
a proposal called Darwin's or the strict version of Darwin's theory argues that natural selection is about 
all there is as an agent of evolutionary change. There are scientific alternatives to that. There have 
been others historically&#151; Lamarckism was the most prominent&#151; but those are all within science.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">85</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But those are not different than evolution, they are simply &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They are different mechanisms of evolution. But they all accept the facts.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are there any scientific alternatives to evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> But that' s what scientific alternative is. Lamarckism is a scientific alternative as an explanation 
of evolution. Scientific &#151; oh, you mean to evolution itself. Again &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Do you understand the question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: I think half of it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I would rather you not answer the question unless you're sure you understand what it is. 
I am happy to have you answer the question that you understand.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are there any scientific alternatives to evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: You mean to the fact of evolution, theories of different mechanisms to explain it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The theory aspects of evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You see, that's where the problems are.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">86</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Insofar as evolution is a fact, there are no known alternatives. It's just a fact of the world. We could 
be wrong, of course. We can always be wrong. Whether there are alternative theories, of course there 
are, but they are all evolutionary theories. I don't know how else to answer.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. BARNES: You're asking if there is a scientific theory that incorporates a view of the world 
that excludes evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I think &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: I don't see how there could be. If that's what you are asking, the answer has to be 
no. There can't be scientific theory that denies the facts of the world.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware of any scientific alternatives to the evolutionary view of the emergence of life 
from nonlife?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I object to the question because it assumes that the emergence of life from nonlife is part 
of evolutionary theory and the witness has testified that it is not.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: He has testified that under the general umbrella of evolutionary theory that is part 
of it.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">87</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: No, I denied that. I thought I said that there are vernacular usages that to me 
more middle things than clarify. I would not, for instance, allow views on the evolution of society to be 
encased within evolutionary theory.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am talking about the evolution of organisms. Is part of the theory of evolution of organisms a 
theory that life did emerge from nonlife?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's not what I studied.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am not asking what you studied.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I said that it was a common opinion of my colleagues that that was so.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware of any scientific alternatives to that aspects.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> People have made other proposals and it doesn't make them scientific.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your opinion that are scientific.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's not my area. I can't testify to it any more than I can about different theories about the 
evolution of society about which I know nothing and am dubious in any case.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> One of the criticisms that I have read
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">88</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">and heard leveled at creation-science has been that it essentially is anti-evolution, that it seeks to 
criticize evolution. Do you agree with that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As I define evolution, indeed. The claim for a separate ancestry for man and apes contradict 
evolutionary theory as I understand it, as to do many of the other statements in these six points.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you quote &#151; was it one of Darwin's basic objectives to try to disprove or not to disprove but 
to criticize the theory that species had been separately created?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes, of course.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. KLASFELD: I think the point that Mr. Williams is making is that there has been criticism of 
creation-science that as a science is limited only to criticizing evolution and not offering alternative 
theories of its own, and I think his question was are you aware of that &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: Yes. It has offered no alternative scientific theories.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I want to ask that one attorney handle the objections or questions or
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">89</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">statements or whatever they might be, all right.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: That's fair.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I think you have answered my question in the affirmative that one of the main purposes of Darwin 
in his writings and research was to show that these &#151; to criticize, if you will, the theory that each 
species had been separately created.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So he started out in a sense trying to criticize a previously-held theory, correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In the history of scientific theories and scientific thought, have theories arisen or began as 
merely criticizing an existing theory, do you understand that question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Certainly, and I also see exactly where you are driving. But remember that Darwin not only 
criticized what came before, but offered a whole mode of explanation that was scientific as to why he proposed 
an alternative. No, in fact Darwin looked at it historically did not do that at all. He developed the theory 
of natural selection in 1838 largely before he developed most
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">90</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">of the criticisms of fact.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That was not my question. In the history of scientific thought have not many theories arisen at 
least in their genesis, if I can use that term, to criticism of other theories?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> But not without proposing some scientific alternative.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But you would agree with my &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, I wouldn't. Because the answer is not without proposing some scientific alternative.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What do you define as a scientific theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Whatever I said five minutes before.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> We were talking about &#151; you said a theory in your article is a structure of ideas that explain 
and interpret facts.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Right. I will stand by that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: Let's take a short break.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(Recess taken.)</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Look at section 4-B of Act 590 please, which is the definition of evolution science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Right.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Evolution science is defined in Act 590, Dr. Gould, to mean the scientific evidences for
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">91</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">evolution, and inferences from those scientific evidences in that it lists several things that it does 
include. As formulated in Act 590, would you say that evolution science is a theory or a fact?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> First of all, let me say that some of the statements in 4-B are absurd from the point of 
anybody's definition of evolution, whether it be fact or theory. For example, point 2, the sufficiency of mutation 
and natural selection in bringing about development of present living kinds from simple earlier kinds.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">As I testified before, I know of no evolutionist who regards mutation and natural selection as 
utterly efficient to do that. And five, &quot;Explanation of the earth's geology and the evolutionary sequence 
by uniformitarianism,&quot; which is in its strict definition is held by no geologist, so therefore I find it &#151; let 
me say for the record that I find it hard to answer that question because of the definitions here. But 
therefore I guess I can't. I can only reiterate what I said, that the fact of evolution is simply the bare 
bones statement that organisms are connected by ties of
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">92</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">descent and evolutionary theory &#151; and the theory of evolution are the proposals about mechanisms 
and processes that explain how the tree of life got to be where it is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is the theory of evolution as you have articulated it testable?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Sure. Theories of evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Right, theories.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They have to be, or they are not science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are they falsifiable?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's part of the definition of testable.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are they observable?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Depends on what you mean by observable. Very, very little of science deals in absolutely direct 
visual observation. I am looking at you now.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So is observability part of a definition of a science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not direct visual observation, because whoever saw an atom.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is meant by that term as you understand it?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">93</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know. You have to tell me what you mean by it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Did Popper use that term?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You know who Carl Popper is?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Sure.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you recall his writings on philosophy of science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In the distant past, one has read a lot of them. I am still vaguely aware of some of what he says. But 
I am not going to commit myself.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You don't know whether he used the observability as a criteria of science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Read me a quotation and I will tell you what I think it says.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What about predictability?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Are we talking about Popper or me now?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You will have to read me what Popper says. He is no God of course.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would you agree with Popper's definition of what is a scientific theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know. You have to read it to me.

<P><U><font face="Times New Roman">AFTERNOON SESSION</font></U>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">12:50 p.m.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">STEPHEN  JAY  GOULD, having been previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified 
further as follows:</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">EXAMINATION (cont'd.)</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">BY MR. WILLIAMS:</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware that Popper in his autobiography, which is entitled UNENDED QUEST, says, &quot;I 
have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical 
research program&#151; a possible framework for testable scientific theories&quot;?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Are you aware that he has modified that view since then?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> First of all, you are aware that he wrote that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is his modification as you understand it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I forgot the quotation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you paraphrase what you think he said?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That he now regards it as testable.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">96</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When did he modify that, roughly?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know the date of the statement, but it was published in SCIENCE MAGAZINE, Nature or 
THE SCIENCES. And it was last year, but I am not sure that was the original statement. It was quite recent.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is science concerned where theories come from?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Sociology is. Scientists are interested in it as human beings, but the distinction that scientists 
and that philosophers make between context and logic of theories are different things.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Scientists, as I understand it &#151; correct me if you think this is wrong &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I mean the theory could come to one in a dream, as long as it's testable.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The source of a theory is not really the important thing?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. Source is important. One wants to know about it, one wants to understand what kind of 
an activity science is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You said earlier you thought theory of evolution was testable.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">97</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There is no theory of evolution. There are a variety of theories. To be scientific theories they must 
be testable, they must be falsifiable.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> There are a variety of theories?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But if there is a thread which runs through all of those theories</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That thread being the common acceptance of the fact that what they are trying to explain is the fact 
of evolution, yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And can that commonalty itself be tested?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It has been. If the commonalty is merely the basis, the factual basis that they are trying to 
explain, yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I don't know if you answered this question or if I asked it before. Would the evolution or emergence 
of life from nonlife be testable?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You keep pushing me on that one. I am going to disclaim again. It's not my subject, I am not going 
to tell you about the evolution of science, I don't know anything about it. The
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">98</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">things I don't know about I can't tell you about.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Well, you are a historian of science, aren't you?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I mean, to be a historian of science, don't you have to have some knowledge of science generally 
and all of these concepts?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Do you mean as a historian of science do you have to know about all of science? No, I am a historian 
of parts of science. There are books on it, I have never read them, reviewed them, I couldn't. The work 
I have done on the history of science is on the history of evolutionary thought and the history of 
evolutionary theories.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Who are the most noted authorities, living or dead, on the origin of life?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I hardly even know that. I know some of the names. The grand old man is Oparin in Russia. And 
in this country I suppose the leading person is Leslie Orgel at the Saulk Institute in California.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What, to your knowledge &#151; is that a he or a she?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">99</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a he.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What does he say about the origin of life?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I haven't read the book in ages. I am really not up on the subject. I am sorry, I don't mean to 
be evasive. I do not have a strong interest in that subject because of my lack of chemical background.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What observations or experiments would disprove the theory regarding the evolution of life 
from nonlife?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Can't you ask me about subjects I know about?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your article you state &quot;that I cannot envision observations and experiments that would 
disprove any evolutionary theory that I know.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you using &quot;know&quot; in the authoritative sense?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. In my definition of evolutionary theory, namely that evolutionary theory deals with changes 
in organisms once they are around.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You stated in your article in DISCOVER that, &quot;Creationists pervert and caricature this
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">100</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">debate by conveniently neglecting the common conviction that underlies it.&quot; What is that 
common conviction that you refer to?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That evolution occurred, the fact of evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you normally given to calling things convictions?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, it's a permissible vernacular use, sure.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How do you define a conviction?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In that context of that sentence, a conviction is what we accept strongly. And we accept things 
strongly for good reasons and bad. The obvious ancillary in this case is that we have that conviction for 
good reasons. That's what the rest of the article is about.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You quote Duane Gish at the bottom of that page &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> 35?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Yes. &#151; where it is said he says, this is not you, &quot;We do not know how the Creator created, 
what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural 
universe.&quot; Does Act 590 necessarily
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">101</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">say that processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe were used in creation?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> This life now being created from nothing?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I didn't say that's what was happening, the processes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It seems that creation-science &#151; the operative line in that quotation is not that one. It's the next 
one. &quot;We cannot discover by scientific investigations anything about the creative processes used by the 
Creator.&quot; That's why that quote is there. It seems to me an admission that studying creation isn't 
science, plain as could be.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's what one person said about creation-science. Now you would agree&#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Leading light of the movement.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's a subjective judgment as to who is the leading light of any movement, isn't it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As you would include Darwin necessarily as a leading light of evolution, I don't see how you can 
have creationism without Mr. Gish.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But you would agree that there are
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">102</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">theories which have been espoused and supposedly based on evolution which &#151; for example, the 
superiority of certain races which are not necessarily supported by it, merely because one offers up a theory 
in the name of evolution doesn't make it a proper evolutionary theory, does it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Indeed, but the strictures of this act are such that most conceivable creationist theories are 
not included.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> From reading Act 590, what could you tell me about the creator?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That he suspends natural law to make things out of nothing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Anything beyond that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, that's enough to make it not science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I want to know just generally what &#151; if someone said read Act 590 and tell me everything that 
you can &#151; that Act 590 says about the Creator &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You would learn a lot more. You would learn that he made the earth fairly recently, therefore 
you learn something about his time scale.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">103</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am concerned as to exactly what he or she or it did, but what you would know about this creator.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> All you have to know is that this creator made things from nothing to make it not science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that, but I want to know what else you could know about the creator.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> What more do I need to know?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> For example, I mean, I think there is &#151; trying to look at the creator there would be a clear 
implication that the creator had some intelligence, would you agree with that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, I don't know. The creator certainly had some power.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Power and intelligence?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I didn't grant you intelligence.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Can we tell anything about the creator as to whether the creator has compassion?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's a question of ethics and morality, which is not &#151; we can't say one way or the other.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What about love?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> All we know is that he suspends natural
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">104</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">law to make things out of nothing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do we know that &#151; we don't know whether it's a he or she or it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. I just used the old sexist vernacular.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do we know whether the creator is still in existence?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't get the thread of the question.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where I am going is really not for you to determine. I am just asking from looking at it can you tell &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have to infer before I can answer.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> &#151; can you tell that creation-science requires that the creator is still in existence?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> If he ain't around any more, it was a very recent event, because he sure was doing a lot just a couple 
of thousand years ago. I suppose he could have died in 1500.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> To answer my question, does creation-science require that the creator still be in existence as is 
defined in Act 590?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> If he is not around his constraints still operate. That is, he created things according to fixed kinds 
and is not allowing
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">105</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">natural law to transcend those kinds. Again I repeat the one thing he did that isn't science is to 
suspend natural law by making things out of nothing and that's how life got here.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your article you state that, &quot;All historical sciences rest upon inference, and evolution is no 
different from geology, cosmology, or human history in this respect. In principle, we cannot observe processes 
that operated in the past.&quot; And you state above that that &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Where is that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am referring now to page 36 in the second full paragraph. Which begins &quot;The second and 
third arguments for evolution.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Got you.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You state that those second and third arguments &quot;do not involve direct observation of evolution 
in action. They rest upon inferences.&quot; So in terms of observability of evolution, there are some 
severe restraints and in interpretability?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Observability is not a criteria of science. You can't observe the fall of Rome either, but it fell. 
The ability to make an escapable inference is.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">106</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Pardon me?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The ability to make inferences, most of the major entities of science are unseen. You never saw 
gravity, but objects fall. You never saw an atom.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How much do you think we have been able to observe about evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As much as can really be expected in the time scale of 100 years, which is nothing, since the 
publication of THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But even well in recorded history &#151; let me rephrase that. One of the examples I think that you 
used was the peppered moths in England.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How is that an example of evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Evolution is defined as change of gene frequencies within natural populations. In the case of 
the peppered moth, the black allele, which was present at very low frequency before trees got blackened 
with industrial soot, rose rapidly to very high frequency after those trees were so blackened, and that 
is evolutionary change.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I read that but I did not really get that change from reading what you wrote here. Do
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">107</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">the tests and the data that we have confirm that that black allele changed or is it not possible 
that simply the black moths simply because they were more concealed, they were camouflaged, if you 
will, and they bred and produced more black moths and the black moths lived?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's evolution. Evolution is change of gene frequencies.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You're not saying then that the moths really in a sense &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Evolutions change within a population.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is that inconsistent, as you understand it, with the creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's not inconsistent with point 3, changes within fixed limits. But please understand that within 
100 years one would not expect to observe large scale changes under any version of evolutionary theory that 
I know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When were species first defined and divided?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The word? The word goes back to Aristotle.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> No, the modern definition of species?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Linnaeus in the 18th Century.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">108</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In the recorded history, how many new species have been observed?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, a fair number, but I don't know. You produce them in the laboratory often.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And by new species, what do you mean?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Species are populations that are reproductively isolated from others.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> For example, if you had two sets of flies which were distinguishable by some characteristic, but 
they bred or were sexually reproductive between each other, and then if you were able to make them 
somehow sexually isolated, it that would be a new species, would it not?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How many times has that been done, to your knowledge?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't really know, it's not my field. But ask Francisco Ayala.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> He said he's been trying to do it for eight years.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You see, you wouldn't be able to do it in eight years. The case of the peppered moth as a single 
gene change, it makes the population very different in its adaptive value. But to be able
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">109</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">to reproduce you have to &#151; you generally must accumulate many more genetic changes. To be unable 
to reproduce. But in asexual forms, for example, the evolution of disease resistance and bacteria, you 
can produce very new creatures right away.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The peppered moths, is that an example of natural selection?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Or is that an example of some sort of genetic change?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's natural change is genetic change.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are those two necessarily synonymous?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not all genetic change is by natural selection, but all natural selection involves genetic change.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> One thing I wanted to ask you about in this article where you talk about &quot;the etymology of 
September, October, November and December (seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth from the Latin),&quot; what does 
that have reference to? I just totally don't understand it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> If you read the first essay in THE PANDA'S THUMB about how the best proof of
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">110</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">evolution are imperfections of auditors that record constraints of past history, we know by looking 
at those words that they had a different function in the past and that there is rather historical 
continuity. Likewise, we know by looking at the impure and odd paths of organisms that they were present 
in different historical contexts that have evolved.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You have a statement in your article that perfection could be imposed by a wise creator or evolved 
by natural selection. What do you mean by that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That when you see an organ that is perfectly designed, that doesn't teach you a whole lot about how 
it arose. When you see a structure that is very imperfect, as almost all organic structures are, and 
when you can trace that Imperfection to an historical constraint based on a previous evolutionary stage, 
then you have evidence for evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You mention in here this idea about why do rats run and bats fly with the same order of 
structure, would it not also be possible that the creator who &#151; in the same &#151;
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">111</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's exactly the problem. It's always possible for the creator and therefore notions about the 
creator such as that are untestable, since there is no conceivable falsifying claim.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you consider Australopithecus to have been a human?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Australopithecus is an intermediate form, whether it's human not is a definitional question. I 
believe it to be a creator on the human side of the split between apes and humans, that is after the 
common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. Australopithecus is on the human side following that split, and 
is there either an ancestor or a close cousin of modern man.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I mean, and the fact that he would differ from human in some respects concerning the 1,000 
cubic centimeter difference, his cranial capacity, that could be explained by a sort of evolution in kind 
that would not violate the creationist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Object to the form of the question in that you're using the word &quot;kind.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I am not trying to get
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">112</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">him to adopt the term I am talking about within the context that it's used or mentioned.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You don't think so?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's exactly the problem with point number 3. I suppose any creationist could weasel out of 
any evolutionary claim by saying those are in kind. I think it violates any reasonable vernacular notion 
of kind to say that a creature with a cranial capacity no larger than that of an ape is within the human 
kind merely because it walked upright. But I find that notion of kind to be so ambiguous that it's undefinable.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You also state that transitional forms are generally looking at the species level but are 
abundant between larger groups.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Australopithecus is a lovely intermediate form.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware that there are other experts which do view Australopithecus as essentially a human?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I am aware that there are other human beings who say that. Let me backtrack, because the 
word human is ambiguous. Some people used the word human to simply mean anything after the split
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">113</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">between chimps and humans, so in part it's a definitional question. Those that say Australopithecus 
is human in the sense of having human intelligence at the level of modern human beings is not &#151; I know 
of no expert who says that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are there experts, to your knowledge, people who you consider to be experts, who say 
that Australopithecus is not a transitional form?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There are those who say, perhaps including myself, that Australopithecus is not the ones we know 
and is not a direct ancestor. Remember I said its either a directs ancestor or a cousin, we are not clear 
about that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">But, see, the notion of transitional form doesn't mean that you have to have every single stage in a 
final-graduated sequence. Evolution doesn't work that way anyway. It means that you have twigs that 
are lower down on the bush of human evolution than modern man and that's where Australopithecus is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How many years have you spent studying evolution? Since you were 11, I think you said.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, since I was five. Well, I saw my first dinosaur when I was five, but I don't think
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">114</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">I heard about evolution until I was ten or 11.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You think that you have invested a substantial amount of time in the study of evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think I see where this one is going. Yes, I have.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The transparencies of the arguments hopefully don't diminish &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, you're right, they are different. Just like the context of discovery and notion are different.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And until recently have you studied creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There is no creation-science. I have been aware ever since I was a little fellow that there is a 
fundamentalist movement in this country and I have on occasion read their literature all through that time.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If evolution were determined by the scientific community to be perhaps not a fact, what kind of 
an effect do you think that would have upon you personally?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's the kind of statement &#151; we have to take it as a hypothetical, you understand, that
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">115</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">I regard that as unlikely as the scientific community finding that the sun really does go around 
the earth. How would I take that? Well, I would be sad. But I was sad when the Yankees lost of the 
World Series.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think it would have any effect upon, for example, your own stature within the 
scientific community?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Only insofar as it had that effect upon all my colleagues who believe in evolution. I think it 
would depend very much on our reaction to it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would it be fair to say that since you have something of a vested interest in seeing that evolution &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Only in the sense that everybody has a personal stake in what they believe, no more, no less. 
Every human being does. That doesn't constitute bias. Bias or prejudice is unreasonable personal investment 
in a theory.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> From just that one article in DISCOVER I take it your opinions on creation-science are very strong?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I just have strong opinions. I don't
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">116</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">dislike the creationists any more than I dislike the Los Angeles Dodgers, but I live with them.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is this a case of trying to oppose creation-science, is it a cause with you?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> A cause? What's a cause?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Well, what do you consider a cause to be?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Something I believe in and work for. I don't know whether cause is the right word. I believe 
that creation-science is not science. And that's its claims are, insofar as testable, tested and incorrect. And 
in general that at its core not testable, and therefore not science and that therefore as a scientist when 
the issue comes up I oppose it. But I didn't bring up the issue. My stance is reactive.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you look down the road as much as we can, do you think 20 years from now our science 
knowledge will be the same as it is today?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Of course not. It wouldn't be science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When we look back at time in the history of science, were there ideas and theories offered which 
were at one time considered a science which today would be considered
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">117</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">essentially laughable?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They shouldn't be laughable, because when held by scientists there were reasons in the context 
of those times. There really were reasons in the context of the 14th Century to hold to the earth 
centered universe. So if one understands the context of the times, one would not laugh. But of course, I see 
the thread of your question. The fact that science is always tentative does not mean that there is 
entirely subjective knowledge in the world. I think science does obtain answers. They can never be 
absolutely certain. But again I would be very surprised if the earth did turn out to be flat after all.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Can you sit here today and say that there will never be any scientific evidence for creation?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In a way I can because it's not science, you see. It's really almost a definitional matter having 
less meaning than the question seems to hold. And if creation is about the suspension of natural law, then 
it's not part of science. If you ask me might we radically revise our ideas
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">118</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">about evolution, sure.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But as we learn more about science, can you say without qualification that some of the various 
parts of the definition of creation-science such as a relatively recent inception of the earth, even the 
occurrence of a worldwide flood, those sorts of things &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Those things are effectively falsified by what we know now. One is never say absolutely 
certain because one never can say that in science. To the best of our knowledge today they are effectively 
falsified to the extent that they cannot reasonably be held.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What about changes only within fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Insofar as that directly contradicts the facts of evolution, I regard that as equally falsified.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What you are saying when you say it's effectively falsified, there is an assumption there that 
the scientific data can be presented on those sorts of questions?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's not scientific that one can make
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">119</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">claims. Creationists sometimes make testable claims that is the core of the theory. The fiat creation 
out of nothing is unfalsifiable. That doesn't mean they don't occasionally in their support make 
testable claims that have been tested and found false.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you look back over the history of science, do you see that notions of science and 
scientific theories has been affected by kind of a society of the times?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Of course.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that's any less true today than it was then?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, but that just points to the difference between the sociology of knowledge or the psychology 
of knowledge, why do we believe what we believe, and the justification of knowledge, which is a 
different point. That is, ideas may arise within the social context. But their truth or falsity is a different matter.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You stated in the prologue to EVER SINCE DARWIN, at page 15 that &quot;Scientists as overt 
human beings unconsciously reflect that their theories are the social and political
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">120</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">constraints of their times.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Right.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What do you mean that they unconsciously reflect it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That the things we believe have complex sources and often we don't recognize our own 
culturally based preferences, but again I repeat that the source of our ideas is a different matter than their truth 
or falsity.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that evolution has been affected by this unconscious reflection of the social constraints 
of the times?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> All science is. Always has been, always will be.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Can you give me some examples of where you see this presently?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In any science or in evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The reason I am an historian is that it's very hard to identify present bias, but in my own career 
I have tried to show that much evolutionary thinking is biased by the presumptions that most people 
have in Western culture, that change tends to be slow and gradual.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">121</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How do you think that is a reflection of the social and political constraints?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's an old tradition of Western thought tied to ideas of progress in the chain of being as an old 
maxim that nature does not make leaps, for example. And I think that is a reflection of social thought in part.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that it would be correct to add to your statement there that scientists 
unconsciously reflect that their theories are social, political and religious constraints of their times?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: May I see that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Religious belief is part of that, it's implicit. But again, do make that separation between the source 
of our ideas and the testing of them. I mean, it may well be, as I said an idea might come to you in a 
dream, it might come to you in a mystic vision, it might come to you while you are driving your car to work 
one day, it may come to you because you were reading a textbook in economics and said hey, there is 
an interesting analogy. The testing of it, its true value is a
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">122</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">totally different matter.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And if a theory of evolution came from that individual who used it as &#151; let me rephrase that. 
Withdrawn. If a theory of evolution had its genesis in some individual's belief in atheism that he was going 
to try to really go out and prove, make sure there is not a creator, that wouldn't create any problems 
for science, would it, as long as the data fit the theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You know, there are people who have developed evolutionary ideas in order to affirm their 
religion. Truth value is a different subject and all I can do is keep saying that evolution preaches no moral 
doctrine. It cannot, no science can.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you familiar with a book entitled</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLUTION by Kerkut?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I thumbed through it about a decade ago. Not very familiar, no. I own it but I have not read it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you consider him to be a creation scientist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know even know who he is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I think he's from the University of
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">123</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Southampton.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you have an opinion about that book?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> How can I if I haven't read it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you recall what his general approach was in that book?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, I haven't read it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You haven't read it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. I have a lot of books I haven't read. Don't you?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your book EVER SINCE DARWIN, when you were writing about Velikovsky and collision in 
that essay, while &#151; you make some I think you will recall, some criticisms of Velikovsky. You state at the 
end &quot;I will continue for heresy preach by the nonprofessional.&quot; What do you mean by that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The most exciting thing in science is when widely held ideas are wrong. See, you have a root for 
Loch Ness monsters and ESP, insofar as they are potentially scientific. That doesn't mean you have a root 
for nonscience.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think we should study these ideas which are viewed by science, as heresy?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">124</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Scientific scientists should study scientific heresies. Whether scientists want to study things 
that aren't science that has to do with their interest as human beings. I do a lot of things that aren't 
science. We all have leisure time when we study those things outside science that interest us. But as scientists 
we are not compelled to look at heretical notions that have nothing to do with science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If we look at some of the facts say, for example, on the age of the earth, and some of those facts 
support a relatively recent age of the earth, and we devise a theory to explain those facts &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's an Interesting &quot;if&quot; so far.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I was going to object to the form of the question since it assumes that there are facts 
that support a young age of the earth. If you ask that as a hypothetical, I am happy to let the witness answer.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: Same thing I was going to say myself.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am saying &quot;if.&quot; So if they do exist. I am not asking you to tell me if they do,
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">125</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I want to make it clear in my judgment I think that they do not exist.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If there are facts which support a relatively recent age of the earth, and a theory is devised to try 
to explain those facts, would that be a scientific theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know. It depends on how it's formulated. If the theory formulated to explain those facts 
called upon fiat creation of things, as a result thereof, then it's not a scientific theory. If it was a theory 
that explained according to natural law how the earth might be that young, then it would be.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">But again I repeat, there are no such facts, to my knowledge. There are claims. That's different.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that the old Darwinian theory of evolution is axiomatic?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It can be axiomatized. Axiomatic at least in the vernacular means almost necessarily true. 
When people say things can be axiomatized that means that you can set up a formal structure, but I am not 
a philosopher and I don't fully understand what that means.

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you familiar with a book MATHEMATICAL CHALLENGES TO THE NEO-DARWINIAN 
INTERPRETATION OF EVOLUTION?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Vaguely. I own it. I have read parts of it, I have not read it all.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is your opinion of that work?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's got some interesting parts, got some wonderfully mistaken parts.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If the earth was not approximately four and a half to five billion years old, what impact would 
that have on the theory of evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Depends on how old you're going to let me make it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How old do you think the earth would have to be in order for &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I can't give you a figure, but it has to be more than 4,000. I can tell you that, and more than 10,000.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would one million he enough?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> To the nether realm, I decline.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you thought about that before?</font>

know claims.

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: Do you have a page number? Let's see what he says.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> He said in the article there &quot;our theory of evolution has become one which cannot be refuted by 
any possible observations. Every conceivable observation can be fitted into it. It is thus `outside of 
empirical science' but not necessarily false.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> He may have been &#151; I don't know the context of that quote. He may have been complaining 
about some particularly strict version of evolutionary theory. Which is different from the facts of evolution.

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> L. Harris Matthews is a man who must be in his 80's now who was a major zoo keeper somewhere

the pseudo penis of hyenas, in female hyenas.</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: I don't think we gave you that one.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you recall writing an article, since I don't have a copy of it, where you said that
Mayr's 
characterization of the synthetic theory of evolution, if accurate, then as a general proposition it is effectively 
dead despite its
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">130</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">persistence as textbook orthodoxy?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Remember, the phrase &quot;as a general proposition.&quot; That doesn't say that the so-called synthetic 
theory of evolution is false, it merely says it doesn't account for all the theory of evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You say it doesn't account for all the evolution. That seems to be quite a qualification from saying 
it's effectively dead.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Effectively dead as a general theory. That's what the quote says. Still very applicable to the 
understanding of small scale changes within populations.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If species or kinds, to the extent that word is used &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They are not the same thing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that &#151; were created, would you not expect to see their sudden appearance in the 
fossil record?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> See, again I haven't studied any logic for a long time, and I don't know the name of that fallacy. 
But the fact that species usually occur suddenly because it's consistent with a theory in their creation 
doesn't mean that in any sense it
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">131</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">favors that theory, because there are many other evolutionary explanations.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">For example, Velikovsky argued that the high surface temperature of Venus indicated that it was 
a comet and issued forth from Jupiter, and the surface temperature was high. That doesn't mean 
his explanation was correct. It wasn't. There is a name for that fallacy. But I don't remember.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You have, if I might use the term, revived to one degree or another some of the theories or 
concepts offered by Richard Goldschmidt; is that correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Only in a very minor way and I hope that you understand the theory of punctuated equilibrium 
has little to do with Goldschmidt.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You stated in an article in NATURAL HISTORY in 1977 that you predicted that during the 
next decade Goldschmidt will be largely vindicated while in the past he had been rebuked and derided.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. What I meant by that in the article is quite clear. Is that Goldschmidt's hierarchical 
perspective on evolutionary theory would be the path in which I believe there will be
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">132</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">major revisions of evolutionary theory, but I did not support some of the more spectacular 
of Goldschmldt's ideas, particularly the so-called idea of systemic mutation, which in fact I reject in 
that article.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What new data or fresh data gives life to some of Goldschmidt's previously abandoned notions?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Particularly the concept of hierarchy, which is what I am discussing there. Primarily, the notion 
that there are properties of species that cannot be reduced to natural selection operating upon 
individuals. For example, propensity to speciate, that is to make more species. The characteristics of species 
that make them more likely to produce daughter species are in general not properties of individual 
members of that species, but of the species as a whole.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">For example, population structure, how many there are and what kind of aggregates, and insofar 
as that's so, and insofar as major evolutionary trends may be powered by different speciation, then to 
that extent trends will have to be understood as a kind of higher order
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">133</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">selection upon speciation events themselves and not by conventional natural selection operating 
among individual organisms.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">To that extent, we need an expanded evolutionary theory that recognizes units higher than 
individual bodies as agents of selection.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is there an answer in there to my question as to what new data there is?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You want a specific example?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Okay, there's a group of snails called the volutes. If you go back into the Tertiary, some 60 
million years ago, about half the species have floating larvae, planktonic, and the other half brood their larvae 
as the young develop right in the mother or within the mother's body. Today, all volutes brood their 
young. So there is a substantial evolutionary trend.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Looks as though that trend, and we have numbers to back this up, it looks as though that trend 
occurred because the species that brood their young speciate more frequently and the reason for that 
presumably is that they are better able to become isolated and thereby evolve genetic
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">134</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">independence, of reproductive isolation. The ones that have floating larvae, they float all over the 
world. When a small population gets isolated that isolation is diluted by larvae coming in from the 
parental population. And if the trend is produced by different speciation, and if that propensity to speciate is not 
a property of individual volutes, then the trend must be understood as a higher order selection 
upon species.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When did this information become available on this particular piece?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> This particular study was published in science by a man named Hansen in the late 1970's. The 
theoretical basis has been established by people like Niles Eldredge and myself, and by Steve Stanley.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you familiar with Thomas Kuhn's book THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC EVOLUTION?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you see the debate that is going on now as to whether the modern synthesis theory or 
punctuated equilibria is the more correct, if that's the right word, as fitting into some of
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">135</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Kuhn's paradigm?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't like the Kuhn model that well. I think the book was an important one in getting us away 
from previous notion that the scientific progress was just a steady march to truth. But I I don't really accept 
in detail his theory of paradigms. I think punctuated equilibrium is a new idea that explains some 
things we didn't know before and proposes some new phenomenon.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Doesn't Kuhn's say that the paradigm or the model is no longer &#151; when the evidence no longer 
fits the model of the paradigm, this is a tendency to change or tinker with the model so it will fit?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: If the witness knows. Otherwise I prefer that you read a quote.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: The witness knows what Mr. Kuhn has to say. Sorry, I lost the question. Could you 
ask it again?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Does Kuhn say that when the evidence no longer fits the model, that the model or the paradigm as 
he calls it, is modified?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Remember that I don't subscribe to all aspects. What Kuhn says is that when anomalies
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">136</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">begin to accumulate that the initial attempt is usually to try and invent some ad hoc hypotheses. I 
do not, because I see where you are going of course, see punctuated equilibrium as ad hoc tinkering at all.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Because what it does is try to add new theory atop the old. It is not an attempt to revise the 
synthetic theory in terms of what it says about change in populations. It's rather an attempt to argue that 
you need different kinds of explanations when explaining change at higher levels. So it's really not within 
the context of Kuhn's model.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am not sure if I even understand the essentials, but as I understand it the modern synthesis 
theory is essentially one of slow gradual changes; is that correct?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I would say that the modern synthesis contains a preference for gradual change, but it does 
not require that all changes be gradual.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Again, you can ask the question any way you want, but for purposes of clarity it might be 
of use if you will find out what is meant when the witness uses the word gradual in
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">137</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">this context. Are we talking about ten days or years?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As a paleontologist, the theory of punctuated equilibrium refers to events of geological scale, and 
in fact the punctuations of which we speak in that theory usually take on the order of tens of thousands 
of years, which is very slow by the scale of our lives, but a second in geological perspective.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you talk about gradual, not you but when you discuss gradual in terms of the modern 
synthesis theory, does that refer to just time or the degree of change in the species or both?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The main idea to be identified as gradual is not a notion that rates are constant, but for the idea 
that evolution precedes by the wholesale transformation of a lineage, so if you had species A the whole 
thing changes steadily until you want to call it something else. Under punctuated equilibrium, while 
this change does not occur that way, but it occurs during events of branching or speciation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> To use an oversimplified example and
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">138</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">one could be said as the hand, does the modern synthesis theory say that the hand evolved gradually? 
By &quot;gradually,&quot; I mean was there an earlier form of the hand where it would look quite different than 
now and it slowly grew into the form that we know have?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's not a good example because we really don't have a lot of direct evidence for the hand.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The question I am asking is, though, if you are going to look at other parts of anatomy &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The general idea, though no one would claim that it holds in all cases, would be under the 
modern synthesis that most structures arise through a series, not necessarily every, but through a series 
of intermediary stages.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would the punctuated equilibrium differ on that point?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not necessarily in that punctuated equilibrium is about species, and the punctuational origin 
of species. Species are small units, so you might under punctuated equilibrium get a hand through 
27 sequential events of speciation, step by step. But each step
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">139</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">would be rapid.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Rapid in the sense you're talking about &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: Rapid meaning tens of thousands of years.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What did the column BORN AGAIN CREATION, where did this appear?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In a magazine called SCIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is SCIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a magazine of scientists who tend to have political opinions to the left of center.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is that published by some organization?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's published by Science for the People, which is an organization based in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. I think it's called Scientists and Engineers for Social and Political&#151;I don't remember.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you a member of the group?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. Insofar &#151; I am a member insofar as I pay my dues to get the magazine. That's my only 
contact with it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do they have a statement of purpose reduced to writing?
<BR>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They may. I don't have it. As I say, the extent of my activities is to subscribe to the journal.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Why do you state in here that the Australopithecines has passed an &quot;equal time law&quot;?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Maybe I made a mistake. Does it say balanced treatment here? I could have made a mistake. 
It wouldn't be the first time. Probably made a mistake. I don't really know what balanced treatment 
means. What does it mean?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's one of the issues in the lawsuit. If you were going to balance treatment of two opposing 
theories, do you have an idea how you would do it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Depends on the theories. I don't know what balance treatment means, but seeing as in my 
view creation isn't a science, so it isn't an issue of whether you give 20 percent or 50 percent of the lectures 
on creation-science. Either 20 percent or 50 percent of a nonscience in a science course is inadmissible.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Tell me how would you balance a treatment of two opposing theories.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Two opposing scientific

<P><font face="Times New Roman">141</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">theories?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> By presenting the evidence for both.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What if on one side there was more evidence than the other &#151; than on the other side?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I would have to give a little more time, but it wouldn't be real fair. Just to mention while the kids 
were packing their books at the end of the class hour that there was another view. I don't think I can 
define that. It's like basic kind. It's ambiguous.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But suppose one aspect of the theory there was no evidence for one theory and all of it was for 
the other.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I am really not a legal scholar. I disclaimed on the origin of life, which I know a little bit more 
about than &#151; I don't know what you mean. You have to tell me what you think that phrase &quot;balanced 
treatment&quot; means. When I discuss &#151; I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">When I don't know the answer to something and I think there are two competing theories, I tend to 
give roughly equal time to both. I am not saying that would be so in all

<P><font face="Times New Roman">cases.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think if you were teaching two opposing theories of science, and you were asked to give 
balanced treatment and that was left to your professional discretion, do you think you could do it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> If they were two scientific theories?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Your question does presuppose that it was left to his professional discretion to 
determine what he thinks balance means?</font>

it means.</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: As to what it means, we will have to leave for the court's ultimate decision.</font>

<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">143</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">to the form of the question because I think it assumes that the act leaves that to the discretion of

that it be stricken from the record. If you wish to ask the question as a hypothetical, then I will let the

<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I am going to have made as exhibit number 2 to the deposition an article 
entitled BORN AGAIN CREATIONISM, by Steve Gould from SCIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE. It's dated 
September, October, November 1981.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(Whereupon, document above referred to was marked as Defendants' Exhibit 2 for identification, as 
of this date.)</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Dr. Gould, directing your attention to Exhibit 2, I think we have already established what while 
you use the term &quot;equal time law&quot; in reference to Act 590, that that term in itself, at least, is not found in 
the act, correct?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">144</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. And we also established that balanced treatment is to be at least in part determined by 
legislative decision.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> And you state that &quot;The creationist leaders may be dishonest in argument and even malevolent. 
Do you consider them to be that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think some of the misquotations are so egregious that it verges on dishonesty. One can only 
make inferences.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In this article you quote Duane Gish where I think you had the same essential quote earlier where 
he says &quot;We cannot discover by scientific investigations anything about the creative processes used by 
the Creator.&quot; There is no reference for that.</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You sure could. It is the end line of the longer quotation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">That is in fact not the version I got the quote from. It's basically the same statement.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That quote that you used from Dr. Gish, is it not simply consistent with the earlier

<P><font face="Times New Roman">145</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">discussion that you and I had about the fact that we can only tell from creation-science that the 
creator has some power?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I read the quote as an admission that so-called creation-science isn't science. After all, if you 
cannot discover by scientific investigations anything about the creative process is an admission that in 
principle it cannot explain the most important claim that it makes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But when you look at that statement, can you not distinguish &#151; would it not be possible to 
distinguish between the determining by scientific investigation the exact creative processes used and the 
fact that creation did occur?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's not enough. Listen to what it says. &quot;We cannot discover by scientific investigations 
anything about the creative processes. You can't admit in principle that in principle you can't discover 
anything about the major phenomenon.</font>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">not quote or reference some of the information published by the Seagraves and also some things by 
Gish. You do kind of tend to lump creation scientists together, don't you?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They share a set of beliefs.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The same way some evolutionists share some beliefs?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> To that extent I would lump as evolutionists all people who believe in evolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Including those who have said in the past that an average black adult male has the mental capacity 
of a 11 year old Caucasian or something?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> So far as they said that, they were not behaving at scientists. But they were not evolutionists. 
Good guys and bad guys everywhere.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you feel like you understand the second law of the thermodynamics?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not in its details, but a hell of a lot better than Mr. Gish does.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think &#151; do you agree that it essentially states that order must decrease through time?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. It specifically doesn't say that.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">147</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">It specifically states the circumstances in which order will decrease, as I understand it. I am not 
a physicist, and I will not go very far. It states that in so-called closed systems, that the systems in 
which there is neither input nor outflow of energy, that order will decrease, which is another way of 
saying entropy will increase.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How do you define what is a closed system?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Again, I don't want to go too far because I am not even positive that this is technically the 
correct definition. I understand it's a system which is closed, that is there is no energy entering or leaving 
by boundaries of the system.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You state that &quot;Creationism is part of the program of the Evangelical right in America, and 
this movement, considered peripheral a decade ago, has became central in Reaganland.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's America.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you explain to me on what you base your conclusion on that creationism is part of the 
program of the Evangelical right?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Well, that term insofar as that term
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">148</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">has been applied to people like Mr. Falwell who has a larger political program, insofar as creationism 
is one aspect of his political program, then the definition holds.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you know whether Jerry Falwell is responsible for the passage of Act 590?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have no idea.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is the fact that it's part of the Evangelical right one of the reasons that you oppose it that you view 
it as being &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Oppose what, the teaching in the public schools or the document itself? Do you 
understand the question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I mean empirically in my own life the answer would have to be no because I opposed it just as 
much ten years ago when there wasn't an identifiable Evangelical right.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is Reaganland?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a metaphorical description of the U.S. of A. And its current political climate.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How do you feel about that personally, not as a scientist?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: Is that relevant?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: At the trial I would object
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">149</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">on the ground that it's irrelevant, but we have waived questions as to relevancy until the time of 
the trial, so if David wants to spend a lot of time asking those kinds of questions, do so.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I did not vote for Ronald Reagan. I don't think &#151; I am not very happy with his presidency.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would you say that's a fair and accurate depiction &#151; description of your feelings about the 
political climate of the country right now, that you are not very happy with his presidency?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So you're somewhat happy?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Okay. All right. I will be a little more forthcoming. I am not opposed to everything he's done, but in 
the panoply of presidents I have witnessed, I would rank &#151; since my memory which extends back as a 
little child to the death of Franklin Roosevelt, one of the first things I do remember, I would rank 
Reagan second to Nixon in the terms of the ones I didn't like.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You state in your article that &quot;The creationist laws lost a series of court battles
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">150</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">between 1975 and 1978, when several statutes for &quot;equal time&quot; were tossed out because they had 
violated the principle of the separation of church and state.&quot; What court battles do you have in mind there?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Particularly &#151; I hope my years are right&#151; the overturning of the Tennessee creation bill, which 
I think was in 1977. I may be wrong.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's one.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Were there not others?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am asking you.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think there were. I wrote this article several months ago, and I think I had some documents 
before me. In fact, what I was basing that on, I remember, was a news report from SCIENCE, THE 
JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, that listed the others and I do not know recall what they were.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware as to whether there were any differences in that Tennessee law and this law?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, I say there are. I think there are differences of rhetoric, rather than of substance.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I understand that's the way you feel. But do you agree that there are differences?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In statement but not in substance.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">151</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> According to your column here that only after &#151; it says, &quot;at this point,&quot; I guess that's between 
the court battles of '75 and '78, &quot;creationists shifted gears and began to argue that creation-science was 
a purely scientific alternative to scientific evolution.&quot; Where did you establish that that is the dividing 
line between two different approaches taken?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I just remember that when I used to read creationist literature a while back there were 
numerous explicit references to God, religion and Christianity, and those have been notably absent in the last 
few years, and I made inference, that this was in recognition of a different legal strategy to pass the 
same kinds of laws.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You further state in your article that &quot;As a sidelight to a correct perception (and cowardly 
decision) about the politics involved, I was originally scheduled to testify for the State in this trial but was 
dropped as a witness by the Attorney General because he felt that my leftist political&quot; &#151; I see. The light 
has struck. You're talking about the California trial?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. No, you never called me.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">152</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Let me finish the - let me start again to get the entire quote in. &quot;As a sidelight to a correct 
perception (and cowardly decision) about the politics involved, I was originally scheduled to testify for the State 
in this trial but was dropped as a witness by the Attorney General because he felt that my leftist 
politics might enhance the impression that evolution is some kind of Commie plot.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Is that a statement or a question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: That's a statement, and I am going to ask questions about the quote.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Briefly describe for me your leftist politics, if there are such?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It was all moot because I never got to testify because as you know in the California trial the 
grounds were so narrowed that none of the scientists were &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Again, let me just note for the record that we would object to this line of questioning if 
it were attempted to be used at the trial on the ground that it's irrelevant, but for these purposes I will 
let the witness answer the
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">153</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">question.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's too vague.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You are the person who used the term &quot;leftist politics.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. My political views tend to the left of center.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you be more specific about your political views?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know how to be. I am not a joiner, so I am not a member of any organization. So I have 
always resisted labeling. But if you read my other book, THE MISMEASURE OF MAN, which is not 
included because it is not about evolution, you will get a sense of my political views.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What do you talk about in THE MISMEASURE OF MAN?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a book about the history of measurement of intelligence.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But it makes the argument, you were saying?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It makes the argument that the primary &#151; it makes the argument that attempts to measure 
intelligence have been politically motivated and represent a misuse of science in
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">154</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">order to support existing social distinctions as biologically inevitable.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you done much reading in the area of political philosophy?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have not made an intensive study. I expect I have read some.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What books would you say were most influential on you in the area of your own political philosophy?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think the most influential book I ever read was C. Wright Mills. THE POWER ELITE. Some 
of Chomsky, who is not a political philosopher but writes politics. In fact, over the last many years I 
have not read widely in this area. It does not hold as much interest for me as it once did.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You go on to say, just to paraphrase, that you are less concerned about the court strategy than 
the school board strategy, as you refer to it. Why are you more concerned about the so-called school 
board strategy?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Because I think that's where creationists may be more effective in persuading local school boards 
to adopt creationist texts.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">155</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you know how many schools have adopted some form of creationist text?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, I don't</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You also make a comment about the textbook publishers who you say will incorporate almost 
any nonsense to win orders that may mean millions of copies. Do you think that if this law and others like 
it should be upheld, that the textbook publishers would meet the need for books which incorporate 
creation-science without religious references?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I assume the main thing they will do is what they have always done, kick evolution out.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's assuming</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: You asked the witness a question.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a justified assumption that happened after the Scopes trial and it's happening now.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How can they kick it out if they require that both be thought?
[probably should be &quot;...both be <i>taught</i>?&quot; - MvADP Editor]&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Or neither. That's an alternative. One way to make it neither is not to include either.
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">156</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Given your views as to the, call them good business sense of textbook publishers, don't you think 
they would also have volumes of text which would incorporate both?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think the primary thing they will do based on previous experience and things that have 
happened already, and if you contact Wayne Moyer, he has been monitoring the decrease of information 
about evolution in textbooks. Based on previous experience, the primary effects of this law will be to 
decrease the coverage or eliminate the coverage of evolution in textbooks.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So you see that as a result of the law?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If you had an alternative of either trying to get balanced treatment or eliminating both, which 
would you prefer?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's very hard to decide between two reprehensible alternatives. I don't know. They are both 
really frightening to me.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You have no opinion, you wouldn't make a decision on that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think the human psyche is generally a jolly thing and likes to postpone considering bad
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">157</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">things that may not happen.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But if you had to make a decision, what decision would you make?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know. I don't have to make it, thank goodness.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The Act 590 does say that you ought to teach the scientific evidences and inferences for both 
creation-science and evolution science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There aren't any for creation-science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> All right. Assuming that, why are you so opposed to the act, if there is no scientific evidence 
for creation-science and the overwhelming scientific evidence is all for evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Because the act nonetheless requires that what is not science be taught as science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I think the act says in section one that you ought to give balanced treatment to both if you 
teach either, then in section 4 it says the scientific evidence&#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You're not really telling me that one conceivable interpretation of this law is no creationism will 
ever be taught anywhere in any of the schools?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">I am not telling you that, I am just
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">158</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">referring you to what the bill says. It says &quot;the scientific evidence and inferences therefrom.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Is your question that if a teacher concludes that there is no scientific evidence for points 
1 through 6, then a teacher does not have to say a word about creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I am talking about the act does require balanced treatment for both. But then it 
says that you defines creation-science as to be the scientific evidence and inferences therefrom for creation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Your question is if there is no scientific evidence, then what?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If you feel there is none and you feel the overwhelming authority of scientific evidence is on the side 
of evolution, then what are you afraid of?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Because a public school teacher in the state of Arkansas, that despite that conviction I would 
be compelled to present some pseudo evidence as it exists in books that I think have no intellectual 
stature, but are published nonetheless for creation-science. I don't read this bill as giving freedom to 
every teacher to
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">159</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">assess the evidence as he sees it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would you agree that your, and by your I am talking about your position personally, concerning 
you don't want this taught, that you oppose this law, does it rise to the level of censorship?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. It is a just a proper separation of disciplines. I have never said that I think parents or 
creationists shouldn't tell their children what they want. I teach science and I don't want to be told by the 
State Legislature that I have to teach in a science course that something that in my professional judgment 
is not science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What if there is a teacher out there who has reviewed all the scientific evidence in the literature 
and has concluded that creation-science is a science, should he or she be able to teach it? I'm not asking 
it legally.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: You're not asking for a legal conclusion and you're not asking whether there is a need for 
a statute to permit a teacher to do that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: I am not asking anything
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">160</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">about that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I have to ask you a question. Before this law was passed what stopped them from doing it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Those are some of the issues for the trial. I am asking if someone out there thinks it should be 
taught, do you think they should be prohibited from teaching it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I can't give a yes or no to a question like that. There are grounds for dismissal on competence 
occasionally. I suspect that if a teacher of physics did insist the earth were flat and presented it as dogma 
and failed school children who said otherwise, there might be cause. One can be too dogmatic about anything.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">But in general, as far as I understand it, the statute should leave teachers free to make their own 
professional judgments. I will disagree with many of them. What I don't like about this statute is it 
dictates what a teacher must do.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So if a teacher absent and apart from this statute should decide that creation-science has 
some validity and wants to teach it in the classroom to balance the treatment, if you will,
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">161</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">that you would not want the teacher to be prohibited from doing that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's a funny hypothetical question. I can't respond to hypothetical questions like that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware that one teacher in another state has been fired for teaching creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't quite understand the relevance of that to this particular act. I am not on the school board 
in the state of Arkansas anyway. And that is a different and very difficult issue.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> As a matter of academic freedom, should the teacher be able to teach the course?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: I am still looking for guidance.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: I think probably the reason the witness is having trouble answering that question is 
that would depend upon the particular facts of each case of exactly what's being taught, how much is 
being taught. If the teacher is supposed to be teaching a course on social studies and teaches 
creation-science instead, that's irrelevant. If it's a biology course, so forth.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">162</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">I would have trouble answering the question because on those kinds of academic freedom grounds 
you need to know all the facts and circumstances. The hypothetical doesn't state what they are.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">THE WITNESS: If they were lying, that would be one thing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I thought my question was specific on that. Let me restate it. You have a high school teacher of 
science in the area of biology who has reviewed all the scientific literature that he or she can get his hands 
on. Reviewed it and has determined that creation-science is a valid scientific theory.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Let me tell you the problem I have. I would not consider such a person any more to be operating as 
a scientist. That I will be clear on. Whether that constitutes grounds for firing is another matter. There 
will be some teachers who might not be good teachers and are not teaching the best material, and I 
don't know whether that's always a grounds for firing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Grounds for firing have to be quite lenient in my view. I can clearly say that such a person is no longer 
a scientist or operating as a
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">163</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">scientist if they accept a theory that's patently not a science. But whether they should be fired, there is 
a whole question of tenial laws I don't understand.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am asking whether they should be free to teach it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. Because who is to stop them. What's the penalty of not firing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> For example, they can say you can't teach that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> And then if they did they are fired. So I mean it is fundamentally about losing one's job.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">But you're placing something in my hypothetical that's really not in there. Let's approach it this 
way. Define academic freedom.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Not the law of, his own view?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My personal view of academic freedom is the right for teachers to shape the subject matter of 
their courses according to their competence and own judgments within the confines of that subject matter 
as understood by the community within that profession.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">164</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">If a teacher of classical music decides that he is not interested any more and only teaches painting, 
I think it would be right to say that they are no longer teaching that subject and if that were the 
only teacher of classical music in the school, and someone moves against that teacher because the 
subject matter is not being taught, that would not be abridgement of my definition of academic freedom.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How can academic freedom then properly be limited, if it can?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't regard that as a limit. You contract to teach a certain subject. One has an understanding 
of what that subject is and within the confines of that subject one does it one's way, as Mr. Sinatra says.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Can the state prescribe curricula for the secondary schools?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Are you asking for a legal conclusion?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know very much about how a school curricula is set up. I know what academic freedom 
usually means on a college level. I don't
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">165</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">really know much about high school law and how it works.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think a teacher has to agree with a theory personally before they can adequately teach it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, no. I mean, after all, I teach &#151; when I teach alternate theories I may have my preference but 
I hope I can give an adequate account. However, as a science teacher I only teach scientific theories. 
Very much different from teaching a theory that is not part of the profession that I agreed to teach.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you made any personal studies concerning evidence for evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Sure.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You mentioned your dissertation I think. Would that be one?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I am a research biologist, sure. I work on the evolution of Western Indian land snails. I am sure 
you don't want to hear about them, but I would being glad to tell you.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would all of the research that you have done fits within the evolutionary theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It certainly does.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">166</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You provided me with a copy &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Wait a minute. The evolution theory fit within the general theory that evolution &#151; that there must 
be some mechanism for it. I said I don't know what the mechanism of evolution is. All my work certainly 
fits the conviction that evolution occurred, that it is a fact. As to the mechanism by which it occurred, 
we have much to learn.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What's your opinion of the creation-science materials that you have read, I am talking about 
reference to the books that you earlier referenced and this article on Cephalopods.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's not science. In fact, I think it's primarily based on rhetoric and misquotation.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You think it's valid criticism of some of the shortcomings of evolution, or problems?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Occasionally within the forest of rhetoric and misquotation they will raise in a tangential way 
a legitimate point. But the essence of the argument is unscientific and unfair in most of the publications 
I have read.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that the evolution theory of origins is an unquestionable fact of science?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">167</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There is no such thing. My definition of fact confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse 
to withhold provisional assent.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Does evolution presuppose that no creator exists?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> For what? No, of course not. But wait. This goes back to about 10 o'clock this morning. I mean 
evolution is a statement about general logical connections. If there was a creator and he made matter 
177 billion years ago and then set up the laws of nature, such that they yielded this result by natural 
laws, and if he even smiles down upon it and says it's good, that's all right. It's occurring within natural 
law. What is inadmissible in science is the suspension of those laws in order to introduce by fiat creation 
of life from nothing.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Bear with me for a second. If you would, let's say, go back to the first life and you had these 
chemical reactions, and as I understand it those are very complex chemical reactions which would have to 
occur for this first life to arise. If you had all these natural laws operating, and a creator, whatever that 
might be,
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">168</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">kind of intervened but only to the extent to cause it to happen &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> If God sticks his finger in the soup by suspending the laws of nature, it's not science. It's like a 
little bit pregnant. Not even a little suspension of natural laws. However, I emphasize many 
evolutionists believe even in very personal notions of God, but it's a God who doesn't break his own laws. I 
mean, evolutionists from Asa Gray to Dobzhansky have been atheists, no problem.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But to consider evolution and try to make it consistent with a belief in a creator, does present 
problems, doesn't it - let me be a bit more specific.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Object to the form of the question because when you say to consider evolution and try 
to make it consistent with the belief of a creator, I don't think the witness has testified that there is 
anything at all about evolution and that belief.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I will be more specific. Is one of the essential characteristics of evolution that it has occurred more 
or less in a random and chance way?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">169</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Nope.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Why not?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's not part of most evolutionary theories. See, in Darwinism for example, and of course there 
are other theories of evolution, randomness is only called upon to produce variation, to produce raw 
material. In fact, the direction of change is imposed by natural selection, which is a deterministic force that 
adapts organisms to prevailing local environments. That's one of the common misunderstandings of 
evolution. That most theories regard what happened as due to chance. That's not true.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> If you are a theoristic evolutionist, and as I understand you would think that would mean that 
someone who believed that had a creator or some supernatural power set up the laws of nature at the 
beginning. And if he didn't - if he just set up the laws and just let them operate, does that mean or do we 
know - strike that. That's incapable of resolution.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Do you think that the theory of evolution is contrary to the religious convictions or moral values 
or philosophical beliefs of some
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">170</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">people?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't think they can be contrary to properly constituted morality and ethics, because that's a 
whole other realm, and evolution is about the facts of the world. I don't see how the world's facts can be 
contrary to ethical and moral belief. That doesn't mean that it ought to be. If you asked me as an 
empirical fact whether some people feel that evolution runs contrary to what they feel is the foundation of 
what loosely is called their philosophy, I guess the answer is yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think the theory of evolution or the theory or the facts, however you would like to describe 
it, has affected society beyond the study of biology?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It caused a lot of people to think about a lot of things. Whether the theories have actually 
promoted social change or merely been used to or usually misused to rationalize that social change is going 
to occur, I don't know.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that the theory of evolution can be presented in the classroom without reference to 
any religious doctrine?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">171</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It usually is. By the theory of evolution it varies. I present it without reference to any religious 
doctrine. Religion to me is about ethics and morality.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How do you define religion?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's about as hard as asking me to define God. I know what it's not, but it's one of those subjects 
hard to put in a few sentences. To me religion is the set of ideas that fundamentally deals with the way 
we should conduct our lives in ethical and moral terms. It tries to provide justifications for moral precepts.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Does religion necessarily require a God?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not under &#151; depends on what a God is. It doesn't require some supernatural force that intervenes 
to break the laws of nature, no. And there are people who call themselves religious, as you know, 
particularly in non-Western cultures, who do not have a belief in anything that by the Western 
vernacular would be called God.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think atheism could be a religion?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Why are you asking that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am just curious, sir.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">172</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I mean, atheism simply means a lack of a belief in God. Atheists have moral values. In fact, 
ethical values don't come from the lack of a belief in God. That's merely a statement. They derive their 
moral principles from elsewhere. But evolution does not speak to this issue. There have been atheists who 
are evolutionists, devout Christians who have been evolutionists.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that religion can be based on science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. They are a different sphere, simply different.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you know whether anyone has articulated the possibility of basing religion on science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Insofar as people have, I think they are fundamentally mistaken. You can find people to say 
almost anything, of course.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So while you personally don't think it could be, there are people out there in the scientific 
communities, for example, who &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not very much and they are wrong and we will try and show them why they are. I have been in a 
lot of evolution classes in my life, and I
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">173</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">don't think I have ever heard any of my teachers make pronouncements about the nature of God with 
the material in the classroom.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you have a definition for faith?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not really, because the word I think means too many different things. If you give me a context, I 
will give you a definition.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think it means scientists have faith in evolution?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Not in the usual vernacular sense of that term, which I take to mean a belief held so strongly that 
in the absence of evidence it is still accepted. To that extent, evolutionists don't because their acceptance 
of evolution is based on hard information.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In your article in SCIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE, you state that this creation battle or 
creation-science is one part of the coherent political program of the Evangelical right, including anti-ERA, 
anti-abortion, anti-military and anti-Communism. Is that a correct &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Sounds right.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is that one of reasons why you oppose creation-science?
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">174.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As I said, from my own personal history, since my opposition has become no less intense since 
before these ties arose, my opposition is not caused by that. I would not say that my feelings &#151; that 
those points are irrelevant to my feelings about it. But I assure you my opposition was as intense before 
these connections were clear.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you provided the attorneys for the plaintiffs with any reports or any written 
documentation, have you written anything for them other than what you have given me today?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No, I haven't.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you know at this point what your testimony will consist of, for example, what opinions you 
will give?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> We have not discussed that except in the broadest outline. That as a paleontologist, I will deal 
I imagine with those areas that are closest to my competence, namely the question of how 
creationists explain the facts of the fossil record, and particularly the issue of gaps in this record.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you just briefly summarize how you do view the way the creationists treat the
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">175</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">fossil record and the gaps therein?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As I understand it, the foundation of the view of those creationists I have read is that the fossil 
record, with its ordered sequence, is a product of deposition after everything got mixed together in Noah's 
flood. As for the gaps in the fossil record, creationists cite them as evidence that evolution is in trouble, and 
I believe those gaps to be a result of those imperfections in this record and the fact that evolution 
proceeds more by punctuated equilibrium than by gradual change within lineages.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The article on Cephalopods and the creation of the universal deluge, how do you plan to use this 
in your testimony?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Perhaps only to talk about what I regard to be a misapplication of a quotation from one of my 
works, perhaps as an example of an attempt to explain a fossil sequence by flood geology, but probably only 
in the first sense.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you speaking with specific reference to a quote which says &quot;paleontologists and evolution 
biologists are famous for their facility in devising plausible stories but they
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">176</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">often forget that plausible stories need not be true.&quot;?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's the quote, yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What do you anticipate your testimony about that quote might be?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That statement comes from a paper in which I was with several other authors referring only to 
stories that paleontologists tell that attempt to interpret in adaptive terms the facts of an evolutionary tree. It 
is cited in that context to make it appear that I believe the existence of the tree itself to be tentative.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you have any idea who John Woodmorappe is?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I do not, no.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your article from PALEOBIOLOGY which is entitled &quot;Punctuated Equilibria, the tempo and Mode 
of Evolution Reconsidered,&quot; do you plan to rely on this in your testimony?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. Well, I plan to use it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Could you describe for me how you will use it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> To explain the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">177</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Does this article fairly give your views, current views?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. That's the most extensive statement ever published on the theory of punctuated equilibrium.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are there any assumptions which underlie your punctuated equilibrium theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's too broad a question. All science has certain assumptions like the uniformity of natural law.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Anything peculiar to any assumptions which are peculiar to &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I wouldn't use the term assumptions. Let me say it's based on certain premises which I don't regard 
as assumptions but I regard as fairly well documented evolutionary principles. First, that 
evolutionary change occurs during events of speciation. Secondly, that events of speciation, though slow on the scale 
of our lives, are geologically instantaneous, tens of thousands of years. Thirdly, that most species during 
the course of their history tend to change vary little.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I am sorry, what was the third one?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That most species during the course of
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">178</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">their history tend to change rather little.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Go ahead.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's call stasis. That's all.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So the change comes in essence at the point where the species changes to a new species, as you 
view it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> When one species branches off from another, the ancestor usually persists.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What happens to the ancestors?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> They usually persist for a while, anyway.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Would they then more often than not die out or would they more often than not continue?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, I don't think &#151; it's probably about 50-50.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> When you talk about, for example, that the record of human evolution seems to provide a 
particularly good example that no gradualism has been detected within any hominid taxon, does that not provide 
&#151; would that not be consistent with creation-science?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It would not.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Why not?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> In the sense that there is a very good
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">179</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">evolutionary trend, it just doesn't proceed by slow and steady alteration. But there is a very good 
evolutionary trend as seen through successive speciation towards hominids with larger brains and 
larger bodies and if all forms life simultaneously weren't mixed up in the flood, I don't know why they 
would then sort out in such an ordered sequence of increasing size of brain and body from the 
australopithecines to Homo habilis to Homo erectus to Homo sapiens.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your article &#151; or maybe perhaps it is part of a book on punctuated equilibria, what book is this from?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> A book called MODELS AND PALEOBIOLOGY, 1972.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is there anything in here that is not in the first article that I mentioned?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That is the first article. No, I don't think there is anything in there that is not covered, but I gave 
you that because that is the original statement of the theory.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is meant by the term &quot;world view in relation to Darwin&quot;?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> What's the context?
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">180</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In this particular copy reference it says &quot;aside from natural selection itself, gradualism became 
the most pervasive and controlling aspect of Darwin's world view?&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a translation of a German term weltanschaung, which is used by scholars to signify &#151; as 
an informal term to signify the basic assumptions that people make about the nature of the world and 
life, what is in the vernacular often called one's philosophy.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That implies to me, that for example if you're talking about Darwin as part of his world view 
that evolution as he viewed it was not limited to the neat confines of evolutionary biology.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes, I would include other things in his world view on gradualism to Darwin was an important part 
of the way he looked at many other things besides science.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think Darwin's ON ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES can be studied in a public school classroom 
or should be?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Why not, it's one of the great books of Western history.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">181</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware that he calls upon a creator in that text?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> What he says &#151; first of all, he doesn't even use the word in the first edition. But in later editions 
he uses the term creator much in the essence of a scientist. What is the last line? He says there is a 
grandeur &#151; &quot;with its several powers have been freed,&quot; and I guess he adds &quot;by the creator&quot; in later 
editions, into a few forms or into one, which would be consistent with the notion of Newton's clockwinder God.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is the concept of a creator an inherently religious concept in your mind?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Depends on how you define it. Again, as I understand &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is the creator as referenced in Darwin, is it inherently a religious view?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The whole question of Darwin's religious views is an interesting one. The best book on that is by 
Neal Gillespie, published a few years ago, and a very complex one.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But when he uses that term that life having been breathed into the first few forms by a creator, do 
you take that to be a reference to a
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">182</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">creator in the religious sense?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> One doesn't know, but no, I don't necessarily take it as such. It could be for Einstein's view that 
what we call the creators, wherever produced, or Spinoza's view, the creators of the laws of the universe. 
That's a metaphor and the book is full of metaphors. Every book is.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So a creator is not an inherently religious concept?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The use of the word creator is not. What becomes inherently nonscience is when you call upon 
the creators to suspend natural law to put creatures on earth.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think in studying Darwin's ON ORIGIN OF SPECIES that you have to dwell on his 
references to the creator, talk about that, what does that mean at great length?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> First of all, if you use the first edition it won't even be there. Secondly, it's a word here, there, 
whose meaning is ambiguous. I don't know &#151; and thirdly, if it is studied in the science classroom, that's 
not what you talk about.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So it really brings us back to that question again of first life. And what Darwin
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">183</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">seemed to say there was a creator had breathed life into &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There is all sorts of metaphor in THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. It's a great work of literature. He says 
so many times in metaphor &#151; what's the greatest one that's a metaphor of the tangled bank, the 
metaphor of the tree of life, and the best of all, nature appears to us bright with gladness, he says. But behind 
that we see the war.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">And the book is full of metaphor, and I think it's really clear in the context that that is a metaphor 
to state that he doesn't know how first life got here. I think the best proof of that is that the phrase &quot;by 
the creator&quot; is added the into some subsequent editions.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> It was added by Darwin, wasn't it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. See, because the creator can be the laws of nature.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you recall whether he used the creator with a capital C, if that makes any difference?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't know. And that's really a typographical issue.
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">184</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So whether it's an a capital C or not doesn't make any difference to you?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I don't think so. In Victorian times many things were capitalized that we wouldn't today. I think 
laws of nature are often capitalized in literature of that time. In fact, nature itself is often written with 
a capital N.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I want to make sure I understand. Invocation of a creator is not inherently a religious concept?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Are you asking whether in the sense Darwin used it or are you talking about in Act 590?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. WILLIAMS: First of all, in the sense that Darwin used it. I think I am talking about in any 
concept, inherent is an invocation of a creator.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> What's unscientific is to talk about the suspension of natural law to invoke that concept of a 
creator. To invoke a creator to state unfalsifiable hypotheses.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is the indication of a creator by Darwin an inherent religious concept?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> When Einstein says God doesn't play
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">185</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">dice with the universe, a famous metaphor, what he says is that he believes that deterministic laws 
were discovered to render what we now consider chance. It is clearly a metaphor, as is Darwin's usage in 
that paragraph.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> In summary, what is your defense of Teilhard &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> My case? My defense?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> There is a reference here in PILTDOWN IN LETTERS, and a letter, I think, from you among 
others concerning a defense, according to the editor, of Teilhard de Chardin.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think he played a role in the Piltdown fraud.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What role did he play, as you see it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I think it quite likely since he was at Piltdown and reasonably friendly with Mr. Dawson, who I 
think clearly was the primary instigator of the hoax, that he played a role, probably a small one, in it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is this paper?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's an untitled essay which will appear in NATURAL HISTORY next February, which I 
included under your request for unpublished
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">186</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">documents because, as you will note, the last page contains some reference to creationism.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you intend at this time to rely on this essay?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. I presume that doesn't bar me if it should come up.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I said at this time. What was the article you wrote for the New York Times &quot;on Mankind Stood 
up First and Got Smart Later&quot;?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's a little commentary from section 4 one Sunday, probably some 700 words or so, on 
Johanson's DISCOVERY OF LUCY.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Essentially, what was your comment on that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That was a long time ago. That the DISCOVERY OF LUCY fairly well proved what in fact we 
have pretty well known since the 1920's, that the australopithecines, though quite small brained, only 
slightly larger than the ape brain, nonetheless walked fully erect.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> &quot;Evolution: Explosion, not ascent&quot;?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That is a very badly named article, not mine, giving a very short explication of the theory of 
punctuated equilibrium. Nothing there
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">187</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">not covered in more detail in the two articles you have.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware of any other articles on which you might rely?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I might rely on the essays in Darwin and THE PANDA'S THUMB, which you have.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Any particular ones in there?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I can't anticipate. It will be a cross-examination, I think, more than direct.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is it fair to say from your essay on Velikovsky and collision that you will not object to Velikovsky 
being studied as a science although you don't agree with him?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Velikovsky stated his hypotheses in a falsifiable way, and they were falsified. I would not 
teach Velikovsky now because I think the argument is beyond doubt, but I would certainly answer 
questions about it and would not regard it as inappropriate material for courses studying scientific methodology.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">His hypotheses were testable, therefore they were science or formulated in a scientific way though 
they have been falsified, in my view.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Your curriculum vitae includes articles
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">188</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">only up to 1980, I notice. Your writings. The one that I have stops at '57, which is &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's B. Yes, there is an A part and a B part. That's not the main part. I know you had it. That's 
in fact the small &#151; let me see that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> That's the one I was handed this morning.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No. That is everything. See, this is the main part, articles. It's in two parts. And that goes 
through 1981. I just haven't updated the B part that has little notes and letters and things. There may be one 
or two items that are not there just because I haven't updated it in recent months. But the A part is 
the main part. Those are the articles. Too many people iflate(?) &#151; off the record.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(Discussion off the record.)</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> &quot;Darwin Novelized&quot;?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That's a review of Irving Stone's biography of Charles Darwin called ORIGIN.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you familiar with Pergamon Press?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I know it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> It's not a creation-science publisher,
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">189</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">is it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I don't know if I can say it. ONTOGENY AND PHYLOGENY, I haven't had a chance to look at it 
in detail, what is it?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a history of the current status that old individuals in the course of their growth and 
embryology repeat the evolutionary stages of their ancestry. It's not true, but it was historically an important 
point. That is my major technical book. I thought you might want to see it. I rather suspect you won't want 
to read too much of it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But that concept has been discredited at this point?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is that different than the idea that an embryo passes through all of the different stages and 
supposedly had gills and that sort of thing?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> We have gills, that's correct. But the evolutionists have a different interpretation today.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What interpretation is that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That it represents &#151; that the gills
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">190</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">represent not the fish ancestor, from which we descended, not the adult fish ancestor, but rather 
a common, stage in the embryology of all vertebrates which mammals have preserved and therefore 
it indicates conservative heredity.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What's the Cecilia Society?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's a course.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is &quot;History versus Prophecy&quot; in AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> That is an article commenting on the work of a geologist whose name I forget, it was a long time 
ago, who claimed that the book of Isaiah described correctly certain aspects of geological processes. It 
has nothing to do with the creation debate. It's whoever wrote Isaiah knew a lot about processes of 
erosion, and I argued that in fact what those passages are about is not geological. It's not relevant. You can have 
a copy if you like.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I would like to have a copy of it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's my one exercise in biblical exegesis.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What is the article that you wrote in the American Journal of Science called IS
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">191</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">UNIFORMITARIANISM NECESSARY?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The very first article I ever wrote. How nice of you to go back to it. It's an analysis of the principle 
of uniformitarianism.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What's the answer to the question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Pardon me?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> What's the answer to the question?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> As among all academics, the answer is yes or no, that uniformitarianism means several 
different things. Some aspects of which are part of the definition of science, and others of which are 
testable claims that are wrong.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you aware in geology of any sort of trend, to use that term roughly, toward greater discussion 
of catastrophes?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Oh, yes, and we welcome that. But it's not the kind of catastrophism that creationists talk about. 
As you know, it has a lot of interest now in the asteroidal theory of Cretaceous extinction. This has 
nothing to do with &#151; there is nothing in the correct application of uniformitarianism that precludes the idea 
of local catastrophes, or even occasionally global ones produced by impact of extraterrestrial bodies, for
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">192</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">example.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> So you would not necessarily as a geologist necessarily deny that there have been worldwide 
catastrophes?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The earth is 4 billion years old, and it must have been hit now and again with large bodies like 
asteroids and comets, but the creationist account calls upon all the strata to be produced by one single 
such catastrophe. And that is not part of the theory of any geologist.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Where does it say that in the act, that all of that has to come from the one?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It doesn't. The act could be read differently, but in the major literature the explanation of the 
earth's geology by catastrophe is including the occurrence of a worldwide flood. That does indicate that all 
the earth's geology can be explained by catastrophism.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> You're really superimposing what you think it means from other literature into the act, aren't you?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It says explanation of the earth's geology by catastrophism, which indicates that if there was 
more than one that still the record has
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">193</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">to be the record of its catastrophes and it clearly is not. At least not worldwide catastrophes, which 
is what the ordinary sense of catastrophism is. And the evidence for a recent worldwide flood is 
nonexistent, by the way.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Are you familiar with Boyden at all? You're not familiar with that name at all?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Can you think of other theories which are not falsifiable or testable which are taught in the 
science curriculum?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Other theories than what?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I think you said you felt like that creation-science is not&#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Creationism is not taught, it shouldn't be.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> But can you think of others which have been taught?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Today?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Yes.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Do you have an example?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> I don't know. I am trying to recall. I have read something about that. It seems like perhaps some 
of Newton's laws &#151; I really can't
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">194</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">recall, but are you aware of any others?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> No.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you made any effort to read all of the creation-science literature?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> You can't read all of it. There is too much. I read a lot of it.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> How have you made a decision as to what you would read?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> There are works cited more than others by people that are in the news more than others. It seems 
best I read the people whose work seems to be discussed most. And that is certainly most representative.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Have you made &#151; you mean it's been just kind of a subjective decision? Have you provided 
any specific criteria as reading every fifth book on creation-science that comes out?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> The major cited works of the people most in the news, which I think is the way you go about 
reading in any new subject.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Some of the criticisms which have been leveled even by you during this deposition at the 
creation scientists, have not some criticisms been leveled at you by some other proponents of the
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">195</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">modern synthesis theory?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Such as?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> For example, set up a strawman, unfairly trying to abstract or summarize a theory.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">MR. ENNIS: Do you have any particular example?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Modes of argument are similar. The question is whether they have validity.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> The modes of argument are similar?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. People may say the same thing, but I am prepared to argue the characterization in the case of 
Mr. Gish is fair. It isn't so much that Gish sets up straw men, it's mostly that he doesn't discuss most of 
the literature at all. I have never been accused of that.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> For example, to my earlier question, are you aware that &#151; I forget what the &#151; Ledyard &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> G. Ledyard.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> &#151; and Stebbins has said that &quot;We object to Gould because he misrepresents the synthetic theory.&quot; 
Are you aware of that quote?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Sure. That's from his article &#151; maybe it's from a news report. That's a matter for
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">196</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">friendly debate between two people who are friends, me and Ledyard, that is. After all, one can 
characterize a theory in many ways. He thinks I haven't characterized it fairly and I think I have. And I 
will meet him in Washington this January and maybe we will resolve it and maybe we won't. But we will 
stay friends and colleagues on the same side of whether or not evolution occurred.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Stebbins has also said, to paraphrase, that while such sudden erratical changes might grow 
mutations or &#151; macromutations are common, they almost never spread through further generations to 
become established. Are you familiar with that?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> I agree with that. That's not the theory of punctuating equilibrium. That's talking about the theory 
of hopeful monsters that is not a theory that I have pushed.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that &#151;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> But I do emphasize that Ledyard and I have no disagreements with whether evolution occurs.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think that Archaeopteryx was a link between reptiles and birds?
<BR>
</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">197</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes, I do.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Do you think any modern birds existed at the same time as Archaeopteryx?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> It's possible &#151; more modern? No. That's a funny question. You mean modern species? Of course. If 
you mean anatomically more modern, the answer is probably yes because evolution is a branch of a bush 
and ancestors tend to persist so you always have the more primitive forms while advanced descendants 
are around. So it's very likely that it would be true.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">For example, the genus Australopithecus in the form of Australopithecus robustus, lived on until 
it became contemporaneous with Homo erectus. It don't mean the genus itself is not ancestral.</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(Continued on following page)
<BR>&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">198</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Q.</B> Is part of your objection to creation-science a notion that it's based on something which is not 
tentative and not revisable?</font>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>A.</B> Yes. It seems to me what's not revisable is the basic belief that a document, namely Genesis, 
must contain literal truth.</font>

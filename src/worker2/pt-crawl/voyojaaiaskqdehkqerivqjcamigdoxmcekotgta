/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: Printed in the <u>Academy</u> 
          of 31 December 1898. Wallace's observations, later noted by the leading 
          American economist Irving Fisher, turned out to be a significant precursor 
          to twentieth century discussions on currency stabilization theory. Fisher 
          went so far as to dedicate one of his books (<u>Stablizing the Dollar</u>) 
          to Wallace. Original pagination indicated within double brackets. To

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 549]]</font> The proposition 
          embodied in this heading will seem to most persons to be an absurdity; 
          but I hope to be able to show from the statements and admissions of 
          orthodox authorities that paper money, under proper regulations, would 
          be the most permanent, and therefore the best, possible standard of 
          value. I presume that the late Prof. W. Stanley Jevons was a trustworthy 
          authority on the subject; and in his volume on <i>Money and the Mechanism 
          of Exchange</i> he gives some important facts and principles bearing 
          upon this question, and these I shall take as the basis of my argument. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. He shows that gold has undergone great changes 
          of value during the last hundred years, as determined from the average 
          prices of fifty or a hundred of the chief necessaries of life. The difference 
          amounted to a fall of 46 per cent. from 1789 to 1809; while from 1809 
          to 1849 it rose 145 per cent. Since 1849 it fell about 20 or 25 per 
          cent.; while in the last twenty or thirty years all the authorities 
          declare that it has risen considerably.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Having thus shown that gold does not even approximate 
          to a permanent standard of value--though I believe the alleged fluctuations 
          are enormously exaggerated, for reasons which it would take too long 
          to give here--he goes on to explain the various proposals which have 
          been made to obviate the evils of such fluctuations by means of a &quot;Tabular 
          Standard of Value.&quot; A Government official--who might be called the Registrar 
          of Prices--would collect the market prices of the list of commodities 
          fixed upon to determine the value of money, and would publish the result 
          monthly or quarterly, and the value of money so determined would be 
          used to regulate all payments of debts, salaries, &amp;c. &quot;Thus, suppose 
          a debt of &pound;100 was incurred on July 1, 1875, and was to be paid 
          July 1, 1878, and the Registrar's table showed that in that interval 
          gold had fallen in value six per cent., then the creditor would claim 
          to be paid an increase of six per cent., while, if there had been a 
          rise in the value of gold then the debtor would have a right to pay 
          proportionally less than the amount nominally due.&quot;
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He says there are only two difficulties--the determination 
          of the commodities chosen to fix the standard value, and the complexity 
          introduced into the relations of debtors and creditors. The latter is, 
          no doubt, a real objection, but it does not arise (as I shall presently 
          show) when paper money alone is used. Neither is there any real difficulty 
          in the former. What is needed is to take a representative selection 
          of all the <i>necessaries</i> of life. These may be roughly classed 
          as food, clothing, houses, fuel, and literature. For the first we might 
          take meat, bread, potatoes, sugar, tea, butter, and beer; for houses 
          timber, bricks, iron, glass, lime, cement, slates, and building land--and 
          so on under the other headings. But the most important consideration 
          is, that each item be taken in the proportion in which it is consumed 
          in the country. This was seen by the original proposer of this method--Joseph 
          Lowe, in 1822--but has been neglected by some modern writers. It would, 
          therefore, be necessary, first to estimate the total quantities of each 
          item consumed in the kingdom in a year, and then, representing the smallest 
          quantity by one or ten, to give all the others their due proportions. 
          The prices of these several commodities being ascertained on the average 
          of a number of years to be fixed upon, a table would be formed, giving 
          the money-value of the due proportion of each of the commodities. Then, 
          by adding up these values, we should have a sum total which would represent 
          with considerable accuracy the average cost of all the chief necessaries 
          of life in the proportions in which they are consumed by the whole community. 
          In order that money may retain the same purchasing power, and thus constitute 
          a real standard of value, this same amount of money must always purchase 
          the same amounts of all these commodities. This can never be the case 
          with gold or silver money, or with the two combined, but I will now 
          show that paper-money may be so regulated as to have always the same 
          purchasing-power.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Jevons states the chief objections to inconvertible 
          paper-money as follows:
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The great temptations which it offers to over-issue 
          and consequent depreciation.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The impossibility of varying its amount in accordance 
          with the requirements of trade.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these objections does not arise when 
          the whole purpose of adopting a paper-currency is to secure a permanent 
          standard of value. The second objection must have been stated without 
          due consideration, since nothing is more simple than to produce this 
          &quot;variation of amount&quot;; and when the variation is such as to keep average 
          prices steady, that steadiness will exist <i>because</i> the quantity 
          issued <i>is</i> in accordance with the requirements of trade. This 
          objection, which is stated at length under the heading &quot;Want of Elasticity 
          of Paper Money&quot; (p. 237), is really <font color="990000">[[p. 550]]</font> 
          completely answered by the method of the tabular &quot;Standard of Value&quot; 
          (p. 329), but the two things are not brought together. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to show how Prof. Jevon's &quot;impossibility&quot; 
          may be easily overcome, let us suppose the transition period to have 
          been passed over: all gold coin being called in or having ceased to 
          be a legal tender, and the paper-currency issued to the same amount. 
          The Registrar of Prices, having determined that during the preceding 
          year the purchasing power of this money is two or three per cent. greater 
          than that of the standard as determined by his table of average values, 
          and having had experience of the effect produced by a given increase 
          or diminution of the currency, instructs the Mint to issue fresh money 
          at a given rate per week. This money is sent to the Treasury and is 
          at once brought into circulation by being paid away in salaries, wages, 
          purchase of materials, &amp;c., in the various Government departments. 
          There is thus no difficulty whatever in increasing the amount of the 
          currency and thus diminishing its purchasing power. The Registrar of 
          Prices carefully watches the effect upon the markets week by week, and 
          month by month, and when he sees that the standard is very nearly attained 
          he instructs the Mint to stop further issues. On the other hand, when 
          prices are rising, owing to there being rather more money in circulation 
          than is necessary, instructions are sent to the Treasury to cancel a 
          certain amount of the money paid in for taxes, stamps, &amp;c., till 
          the balance is restored. But this will very seldom, perhaps never, be 
          necessary. The continuous increase of the population requires a constant 
          increase in the currency, while another constant renewal is required 
          to make good the losses by fire, water, and other accidents. And as 
          the amount required to keep average prices steady would be so carefully 
          watched, the mere stoppage of the normal issues would in most cases 
          suffice to bring back average prices when they showed any tendency to 
          rise above the standard amount.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total gain to the country of such a currency 
          would be very great. All the additions required to keep up with increase 
          of population and to make good losses would be clear gain, and would 
          probably amount to a considerable annual revenue; while during the transition 
          from gold to paper an enormous amount of coin would be accumulated by 
          the Treasury which might be kept as a reserve against foreign war expenses, 
          or might be supplied to merchants as bullion of guaranteed quality for 
          foreign payments. Silver and bronze coins for wages and small transactions 
          might be continued in use, as they are both customary and convenient, 
          but their actual value in metal might be reduced, thus giving a larger 
          profit to the Government on their issue than there is now.
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A convenient form for the &pound;1 and &pound;5 
          notes would probably be very thin tough cards of the size of railway 
          tickets, and of different colours. They would thus be very portable 
          and easily distinguishable. They would be the legal tender of the country, 
          and would always purchase, on the average, the same quantities of the 
          chief necessaries of life. They would thus constitute a permanent standard 
          of value--the ideal perfection of money; and would have the additional 
          advantage of being a steady source of revenue to the country.</p>

Located in the center of campus, the Bing Theatre is a traditional
proscenium house hosting both theatrical and musical performances,
including those given by the USC Thornton Opera. It is equipped with a
fly system, trap doors, and an orchestra pit. In 2001 the Bing got a
new lobby and seats, and in the summer of 2005 the proscenium was
modified to improve acoustics in the theater. To learn

piano to jazz ensembles, with a richness often lacking in other modern
halls. To learn

<strong>Rehearsal Spaces</strong><br/>
Opportunities for rehearsal are available in four different locations across the campus: 
</p>

<li>Ramo Hall of Music (RHM)</li>
<li>Booth Hall of Music (BMH)</li>
<li>Music Practice and Instructional Center (PIC)</li>

<p>In these four locations, groups as large as the USC Thornton
Symphony and as small as a string duo can find space to rehearse for
their performances.

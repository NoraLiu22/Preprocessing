<p>
This earthquake caused 28 fatalities and about $11
million in damage to highways and timber. It is
characterized by extensive fault scarps, subsidence
and uplift, a massive landslide, and a seiche in Hebgen Lake.
A maximum MM intensity X was assigned
to the fault scarps in the epicentral area. The instrumental
epicenter lies within the region of surface
faulting. Area of perceptibility, maximum
intensity, and Richter magnitude all were larger for
this earthquake than for any earlier earthquake on
record in Montana (from May 1869).
<p>
The most spectacular and disastrous effect of the
earthquake was the huge avalanche of rock, soil and
trees that cascaded from the steep south wall of the
Madison River Canyon. This slide formed a barrier
that blocked the gorge and stopped the flow of the
Madison River and, within a few weeks, created a
lake almost 53 meters deep. The volume of material that
blocked the Madison River below Hebgen Dam has
been estimated at 28 - 33 million cubic meters. Most of the 28
deaths were caused by rockslides that covered the
Rock Creek public campground on the Madison
River, about 9.5 kilometers below Hebgen Dam.
<p>
New fault scarps as high as 6 meters formed near
Hebgen Lake. The major fault scarps formed along
pre-existing normal faults northeast of Hebgen Lake.
Subsidence occurred over much of an area that was
about 24 kilometers north-south and about twice as long
east-west. As a result of the faulting near Hebgen
Lake, the bedrock beneath the lake was permanently
warped, causing the lake floor to drop and generate a
seiche. Maximum subsidence was 6.7 meters in Hebgen
Lake Basin. About 130 square kilometers subsided more than
3 meters, and about 500 square kilometers subsided more than
0.3 meters. The earth-fill dam sustained significant cracks in its
concrete core and spillway, but it continued to be an
effective structure.

<p>
Many summer houses in the Hebgen Lake area
were damaged: houses and cabins shifted off their
foundations, chimneys fell, and pipelines broke. Most
small-unit masonry structures and wooden buildings
along the major fault scarps survived with little damage
when subjected only to vibratory forces.
Roadways were cracked and shifted extensively, and
much timber was destroyed. Highway damage near
Hebgen Lake was due to landslides slumping vertically
and flowing laterally beneath pavements and
bridges, which caused severe cracks and destruction.
Three of the five reinforced bridges in the epicentral
area also sustained significant damage.
<p>
High intensities were observed in the northwest
section of Yellowstone National Park. Here, new geysers
erupted, and massive slumping caused large
cracks in the ground from which steam emitted.
Many hot springs became muddy.
<p>
On the basis of vibration damage (and excluding
geologic effects), damage to buildings along the fault
zone was singularly unspectacular (MM intensity
VIII at places, intensity VII generally). Minor
damage occurred throughout southern Montana, northeast
Idaho, and northwest Wyoming. Felt as far as
Seattle, Washington, to the west; Banff, Canada, to the
north; Dickinson, North Dakota, to the east; and Provo,
Utah, to the south. This area includes nine Western
States and three Canadian Provinces. Aftershocks
continued for several months.

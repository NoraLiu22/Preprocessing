   <p name="notoverdue" id="notoverdue" class="faq">
     Is it true that the next caldera-forming eruption of Yellowstone is overdue?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        No. First of all, one cannot present recurrence intervals based on only two values. It would be statistically meaningless. But for those who insist... let's do the arithmetic. The three eruptions occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 0.64 million years ago. The two intervals are thus 0.8 and 0.66 million years, averaging to a 0.73 million-year interval. Again, the last eruption was 0.64 million years ago, implying that we are still about 90,000 years away from the time when we might consider calling Yellowstone overdue for another caldera-forming eruption. Nevertheless, we cannot discount the possibility of another such eruption occurring some time in the future, given Yellowstone's volcanic history and the continued presence of magma beneath the Yellowstone caldera.

      When will Yellowstone erupt again?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We do not know. Future volcanic eruptions could occur
        within or near Yellowstone National Park for the simple
        reason that the area has a long volcanic history and
        because there is hot and molten rock, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/magma.html">
        magma</a>, beneath the caldera now. Yellowstone is
        monitored for signs of volcanic activity by YVO
        scientists who detect earthquakes using seismographs and
        ground motion using GPS (Global Positioning System). YVO
        has not detected signs of activity that suggest an
        eruption is imminent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crust of North America continuously moves southwest
        over the Yellowstone hotspot as the Earth's crust
        stretches above it, promoting the ascent of heat and
        molten rock. These processes produce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/basalt.html">
        basaltic</a> magmas within the Earth's mantle, which rise
        into the overlying crust and continue to heat the rocks
        beneath Yellowstone, maintaining and possibly adding to
        the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/rhyolite.html">
        rhyolite</a> magma in the crust above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yellowstone's 2-million-year history of volcanism, the
        copious amount of heat that still flows from the ground,
        the frequent earthquakes, and the repeated uplift and
        subsidence of the caldera floor also testify to the
        continuity of magmatic processes beneath Yellowstone and
        point to the possibility of future volcanism and
        earthquake activity.

      What type of eruption will occur if Yellowstone erupts
      again?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Yellowstone's volcanic and hydrothermal history suggests
        the potential for various kinds of eruptions in the
        future. The likelihood of a certain type of eruption
        occurring in the future can be judged by how often
        eruptions have occurred in the past.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The most likely type of eruption would not be
            volcanic but, rather, hydrothermal. This type of
            small, but still explosive eruption can occur from
            shallow reservoirs of steam or hot water rather than
            molten rock. These reservoirs are the sources of
            Yellowstone's famous geysers, hot springs, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/fumarole.html">
            fumaroles</a>. Such explosions could blast out
            shallow craters more than a kilometer wide; as has
            occurred in the northern Yellowstone Lake Basin,
            including Mary Bay and nearby Turbid Lake and Indian
            Pond, and in western Yellowstone National Park north
            of Old Faithful. Each of these craters was produced
            by steam blasts within the past few thousand years.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The most likely type of volcanic eruption at
            Yellowstone would produce lava flows of either <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/rhyolite.html">
            rhyolite</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/basalt.html">
            basalt</a>; rhyolitic lava eruptions could also
            include explosive phases that might produce
            significant volumes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/ash.html">
            volcanic ash</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/pumice.html">
            pumice</a>. Such eruptions could range in size from
            smaller than the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens
            through much larger than the 1991 Mount Pinatubo
            eruption.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The least likely but worst-case volcanic eruption at
            Yellowstone would be another explosive
            caldera-forming eruption such as those that occurred
            2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 640,000 years ago.
            However, the probability of such an eruption in any
            given century or millennium is exceedingly low- much
            lower than the smaller eruptions mentioned above.

      When will the next large earthquake occur in Yellowstone?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Earthquakes cannot be predicted yet, but modern
        surveillance conducted with seismographs (instruments
        that measure earthquake locations and magnitudes) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/About/What/Monitor/Deformation/GPS.html">
        Global Positioning System (GPS)</a> instruments that
        measure slow ground movements help scientists understand
        the state of stress in the Earth's crust that could
        trigger earthquakes as well as magma movement.

      <p name="weather" id="weather" class="faq">
      Could a large Yellowstone eruption significantly change
      weather patterns?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If another catastrophic caldera-forming Yellowstone
        eruption were to occur, it quite likely would alter
        global weather patterns and have enormous effects on
        human activity, especially agricultural production, for
        many years. In fact, the relatively small 1991 eruption
        of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines was shown to have
        temporarily, yet measurably, changed global temperatures.
        Scientists, however, at this time do not have the
        predictive ability to determine specific consequences or
        durations of possible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118011434/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/VolGas/SO2Aerosols.html">
        global impacts</a> from such large eruptions.

    <p name="drilling" id="drilling" class="faq">
      Can you release some of the pressure at Yellowstone by drilling into the volcano?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Scientists agree that drilling into a volcano would be of
questionable usefulness. Notwithstanding the enormous expense and technological
difficulties in drilling through hot, mushy rock, drilling is unlikely
to have much effect. At near magmatic temperatures and pressures, any hole would rapidly become sealed by minerals crystallizing from the natural fluids that are present at those depths.

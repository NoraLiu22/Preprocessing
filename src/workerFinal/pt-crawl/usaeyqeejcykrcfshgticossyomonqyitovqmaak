/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 
        review of modern Darwinism might fitly have terminated with the preceding 
        chapter; but the immense interest that attaches to the origin of the human 
        race, and the amount of misconception which prevails regarding the essential 
        teachings of Darwin's theory on this question, as well as regarding my 
        own special views upon it, induce me to devote a final chapter to its 
        discussion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
        any one who considers the structure of man's body, even in the most superficial 
        manner, it must be evident that it is the body of an animal, differing 
        greatly, it is true, from the bodies of all other animals, but agreeing 
        with them in all essential features. The bony structure of man classes 
        him as a vertebrate; the mode of suckling his young classes him as a mammal; 
        his blood, his muscles, and his nerves, the structure of his heart with 
        its veins and arteries, his lungs and his whole respiratory and circulatory 
        systems, all closely correspond to those of other mammals, and are often 
        almost identical with <font color="990000">[[p. 446]]</font> them. He 
        possesses the same number of limbs terminating in the same number of digits 
        as belong fundamentally to the mammalian class. His senses are identical 
        with theirs, and his organs of sense are the same in number and occupy 
        the same relative position. Every detail of structure which is common 
        to the mammalia as a class is found also in man, while he only differs 
        from them in such ways and degrees as the various species or groups of 
        mammals differ from each other. If, then, we have good reason to believe 
        that every existing group of mammalia has descended from some common ancestral 
        form--as we saw to be so completely demonstrated in the case of the horse 
        tribe,--and that each family, each order, and even the whole class must 
        similarly have descended from some much more ancient and more generalised 
        type, it would be in the highest degree improbable--so improbable as to 
        be almost inconceivable--that man, agreeing with them so closely in every 
        detail of his structure, should have had some quite distinct mode of origin. 
        Let us, then, see what other evidence bears upon the question, and whether 
        it is sufficient to convert the probability of his animal origin into 
        a practical certainty.</p>
      <p><i>Rudiments and Variations 
        as Indicating the Relation of Man to other Mammals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All 
        the higher animals present rudiments of organs which, though useless to 
        them, are useful in some allied group, and are believed to have descended 
        from a common ancestor in which they were useful. Thus there are in ruminants 
        rudiments of incisor teeth which, in some species, never cut through the 
        gums; many lizards have external rudimentary legs; while many birds, as 
        the Apteryx, have quite rudimentary wings. Now man possesses similar rudiments, 
        sometimes constantly, sometimes only occasionally present, which serve 
        intimately to connect his bodily structure with that of the lower animals. 
        Many animals, for example, have a special muscle for moving or twitching 
        the skin. In man there are remnants of this in certain parts of the body, 
        especially in the forehead, enabling us to raise our eyebrows; but some 
        persons have it in other parts. A few persons are able to move the whole 
        scalp so as to throw off any object placed on the head, <font color="990000">[[p. 
        447]]</font> and this property has been proved, in one case, to be inherited. 
        In the outer fold of the ear there is sometimes a projecting point, corresponding 
        in position to the pointed ear of many animals, and believed to be a rudiment 
        of it. In the alimentary canal there is a rudiment--the vermiform appendage 
        of the c&aelig;cum--which is not only useless, but is sometimes a cause of disease 
        and death in man; yet in many vegetable feeding animals it is very long, 
        and even in the orang-utan it is of considerable length and convoluted. 
        So, man possesses rudimentary bones of a tail concealed beneath the skin, 
        and, in some rare cases, this forms a minute external tail.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        variability of every part of man's structure is very great, and many of 
        these variations tend to approximate towards the structure of other animals. 
        The courses of the arteries are eminently variable, so that for surgical 
        purposes it has been necessary to determine the probable proportion of 
        each variation. The muscles are so variable that in fifty cases the muscles 
        of the foot were found to be not strictly alike in any two, and in some 
        the deviations were considerable; while in thirty-six subjects Mr. J. 
        Wood observed no fewer than 558 muscular variations. The same author states 
        that in a single male subject there were no fewer than seven muscular 
        variations, all of which plainly represented muscles proper to various 
        kinds of apes. The muscles of the hands and arms--parts which are so eminently 
        characteristic of man--are extremely liable to vary, so as to resemble 
        the corresponding muscles of the lower animals. That such variations are 
        due to reversion to a former state of existence Mr. Darwin thinks highly 
        probable, and he adds: &quot;It is quite incredible that a man should, through 
        mere accident, abnormally resemble certain apes in no less than seven 
        of his muscles, if there had been no genetic connection between them. 
        On the other hand, if man is descended from some ape-like creature, no 
        valid reason can be assigned why certain muscles should not suddenly reappear 
        after an interval of many thousand generations, in the same manner as, 
        with horses, asses, and mules, dark coloured stripes suddenly reappear 
        on the legs and shoulders, after an interval of hundreds, or more probably 
        of thousands of generations.&quot;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

        <i>The Embryonic Development of Man and other Mammalia.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        progressive development of any vertebrate from the ovum or minute embryonic 
        egg affords one of the most marvellous chapters in Natural History. We 
        see the contents of the ovum undergoing numerous definite changes, its 
        interior dividing and subdividing till it consists of a mass of cells, 
        then a groove appears marking out the median line or vertebral column 
        of the future animal, and thereafter are slowly developed the various 
        essential organs of the body. After describing in some detail what takes 
        place in the case of the ovum of the dog, Professor Huxley continues: 
        &quot;The history of the development of any other vertebrate animal, lizard, 
        snake, frog, or fish tells the same story. There is always to begin with, 
        an egg having the same essential structure as that of the dog; the yolk 
        of that egg undergoes division or segmentation, as it is called, the ultimate 
        products of that segmentation constitute the building materials for the 
        body of the young animal; and this is built up round a primitive groove, 
        in the floor of which a notochord is developed. Furthermore, there is 
        a period in which the young of all these animals resemble one another, 
        not merely in outward form, but in all essentials of structure, so closely, 
        that the differences between them are inconsiderable, while in their 
        subsequent course they diverge more and more widely from one another. 
        And it is a general law that the more closely any animals resemble one 
        another in adult structure, the larger and the more intimately do their 
        embryos resemble one another; so that, for example, the embryos of a snake 
        and of a lizard remain like one another longer than do those of a snake 
        and a bird; and the embryos of a dog and of a cat remain like one another 
        for a far longer period than do those of a dog and a bird, or of a dog 
        and an opossum, or even than those of a dog and a monkey.&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        thus see that the study of development affords a test of affinity in animals 
        that are externally very much unlike each other; and we naturally ask 
        how this applies to man. Is he developed in a different way from other 
        mammals, as we should certainly expect if he has had a distinct and <font color="990000">[[p. 
        449]]</font> altogether different origin? &quot;The reply,&quot; says Professor 
        Huxley, &quot;is not doubtful for a moment. Without question, the mode of origin 
        and the early stages of development of man are identical with those of 
        the animals immediately below him in the scale.&quot; And again he tells us: 
        &quot;It is very long before the body of the young human being can be readily 
        discriminated from that of the young puppy; but at a tolerably early period 
        the two become distinguishable by the different forms of their adjuncts, 
        the yelk-sac and the allantois;&quot; and after describing these differences 
        he continues: &quot;But exactly in those respects in which the developing man 
        differs from the dog, he resembles the ape. . . . So that it is only quite 
        in the latter stages of development that the young human being presents 
        marked differences from the young ape, while the latter departs as much 
        from the dog in its development as the man does. Startling as this last 
        assertion may appear to be, it is demonstrably true, and it alone appears 
        to me sufficient to place beyond all doubt the structural unity of man 
        with the rest of the animal world, and more particularly and closely with 
        the apes.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
        few of the curious details in which man passes through stages common to 
        the lower animals may be mentioned. At one stage the os coccyx projects 
        like a true tail, extending considerably beyond the rudimentary legs. 
        In the seventh month the convolutions of the brain resemble those of an 
        adult baboon. The great toe, so characteristic of man, forming the fulcrum 
        which most assists him in standing erect, in an early stage of the embryo 
        is much shorter than the other toes, and instead of being parallel with 
        them, projects at an angle from the side of the foot, thus corresponding 
        with its permanent condition in the quadrumana. Numerous other examples 
        might be quoted, all illustrating the same general law.</p>
      <p><i>Diseases Common to Man 
        and the Lower Animals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though 
        the fact is so well known, it is certainly one of profound significance 
        that many animal diseases can be communicated to man, since it shows similarity, 
        if not identity, in <font color="990000">[[p. 450]]</font> the minute 
        structure of the tissues, the nature of the blood, the nerves, and the 
        brain. Such diseases as hydrophobia, variola, the glanders, cholera, herpes, 
        etc., can be transmitted from animals to man or the reverse; while monkeys 
        are liable to many of the same non-contagious diseases as we are. Rengger, 
        who carefully observed the common monkey (Cebus Azar&aelig;) in Paraguay, found 
        it liable to catarrh, with the usual symptoms, terminating sometimes in 
        consumption. These monkeys also suffered from apoplexy, inflammation of 
        the bowels, and cataract in the eye. Medicines produced the same effect 
        upon them as upon us. Many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, 
        coffee, spirits, and even tobacco. These facts show the similarity of 
        the nerves of taste in monkeys and in ourselves, and that their whole 
        nervous system is affected in a similar way. Even the parasites, both 
        external and internal, that affect man are not altogether peculiar to 
        him, but belong to the same families or genera as those which infest animals, 
        and in one case, scabies, even the same species.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
        These curious facts seem quite inconsistent with the idea that man's bodily 
        structure and nature are altogether distinct from those of animals, and 
        have had a different origin; while the facts are just what we should expect 
        if he has been produced by descent with modification from some common 
        ancestor.</p>
      <p><i>The Animals most nearly 
        Allied to Man.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 
        universal consent we see in the monkey tribe a caricature of humanity. 
        Their faces, their hands, their actions and expressions present ludicrous 
        resemblances to our own. But there is one group of this great tribe in 
        which this resemblance is greatest, and they have hence been called the 
        anthropoid or man-like apes. These are few in number, and inhabit only 
        the equatorial regions of Africa and Asia, countries where the climate 
        is most uniform, the forests densest, and the supply of fruit abundant 
        throughout the year. These animals are now comparatively well known, consisting 
        of the orang-utan of Borneo and Sumatra, the chimpanzee and the gorilla 
        of West Africa, and the group of gibbons or long-armed apes, consisting 
        of many species and inhabiting South-Eastern <font color="990000">[[p. 
        451]]</font> Asia and the larger Malay Islands. These last are far less 
        like man than the other three, one or other of which has at various times 
        been claimed to be the most man-like of the apes and our nearest relations 
        in the animal kingdom. The question of the degree of resemblance of these 
        animals to ourselves is one of great interest, leading, as it does, to 
        some important conclusions as to our origin and geological antiquity, 
        and we will therefore briefly consider it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
        we compare the skeletons of the orang or chimpanzee with that of man, 
        we find them to be a kind of distorted copy, every bone corresponding 
        (with very few exceptions), but altered somewhat in size, proportions, 
        and position. So great is this resemblance that it led Professor Owen 
        to remark: &quot;I cannot shut my eyes to the significance of that all-pervading 
        similitude of structure--every tooth, every bone, strictly homologous--which 
        makes the determination of the difference between <i>Homo</i> and <i>Pithecus</i> the anatomist's difficulty.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        actual differences in the skeletons of these apes and that of man--that 
        is, differences dependent on the presence or absence of certain bones, 
        and not on their form or position--have been enumerated by Mr. Mivart as 
        follows:--(l) In the breast-bone consisting of but two bones, man agrees 
        with the gibbons; the chimpanzee and gorilla having this part consisting 
        of seven bones in a single series, while in the orang they are arranged 
        in a double series of ten bones. (2) The normal number of the ribs in 
        the orang and some gibbons is twelve pairs, as in man, while in the chimpanzee 
        and gorilla there are thirteen pairs. (3) The orang and the gibbons also 
        agree with man in having five lumbar vertebr&aelig;, while in the gorilla and 
        the chimpanzee there are but four, and sometimes only three. (4) The gorilla 
        and chimpanzee agree with man in having eight small bones in the wrist, 
        while the orang and the gibbons, as well as all other monkeys, have nine.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        differences in the form, size, and attachments of the various bones, muscles, 
        and other organs of these apes and <font color="990000">[[p. 452]]</font> 
        man are very numerous and exceedingly complex, sometimes one species, 
        sometimes another agreeing most nearly with ourselves, thus presenting 
        a tangled web of affinities which it is very difficult to unravel. Estimated 
        by the skeleton alone, the chimpanzee and gorilla seem nearer to man than 
        the orang, which last is also inferior as presenting certain aberrations 
        in the muscles. In the form of the ear the gorilla is more human than 
        any other ape, while in the tongue the orang is the more man-like. In 
        the stomach and liver the gibbons approach nearest to man, then come the 
        orang and chimpanzee, while the gorilla has a degraded liver more resembling 
        that of the lower monkeys and baboons.</p>
      <p><i>The Brains of Man and Apes.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        come now to that part of his organisation in which man is so much higher 
        than all the lower animals--the brain; and here, Mr. Mivart informs us, 
        the orang stands highest in rank. The height of the orang's cerebrum in 
        front is greater in proportion than in either the chimpanzee or the gorilla. 
        &quot;On comparing the brain of man with the brains of the orang, chimpanzee, 
        and baboon, we find a successive decrease in the frontal lobe, and a successive 
        and very great increase in the relative size of the occipital lobe. Concomitantly 
        with this increase and decrease, certain folds of brain substance, called 
        'bridging convolutions,' which in man are conspicuously interposed between 
        the parietal and occipital lobes, seem as utterly to disappear in the 
        chimpanzee, as they do in the baboon. In the orang, however, though much 
        reduced, they are still to be distinguished. . . . The actual and absolute 
        mass of the brain is, however, slightly greater in the chimpanzee than 
        in the orang, as is the relative vertical extent of the middle part of 
        the cerebrum, although, as already stated, the frontal portion is higher 
        in the orang; while, according to M. Gratiolet, the gorilla is not only 
        inferior to the orang in cerebral development, but even to his smaller 
        African congener, the chimpanzee.&quot;<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 
        the whole, then, we find that no one of the great apes can be positively 
        asserted to be nearest to man in structure. Each of them approaches him 
        in certain characteristics, while <font color="990000">[[p. 453]]</font> 
        in others it is widely removed, giving the idea, so consonant with the 
        theory of evolution as developed by Darwin, that all are derived from 
        a common ancestor, from which the existing anthropoid apes as well as 
        man have diverged. When, however, we turn from the details of anatomy 
        to peculiarities of external form and motions, we find that, in a variety 
        of characters, all these apes resemble each other and differ from man, 
        so that we may fairly say that, while they have diverged somewhat from 
        each other, they have diverged much more widely from ourselves. Let us 
        briefly enumerate some of these differences.</p>
      <p><i>External Differences of 
        Man and Apes.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All 
        apes have large canine teeth, while in man these are no longer than the 
        adjacent incisors or premolars, the whole forming a perfectly even series. 
        In apes the arms are proportionately much longer than in man, while the 
        thighs are much shorter. No ape stands really erect, a posture which is 
        natural in man. The thumb is proportionately larger in man, and more perfectly 
        opposable than in that of any ape. The foot of man differs largely from 
        that of all apes, in the horizontal sole, the projecting heel, the short 
        toes, and the powerful great toe firmly attached parallel to the other 
        toes; all perfectly adapted for maintaining the erect posture, and for 
        free motion without any aid from the arms or hands. In apes the foot is 
        formed almost exactly like our hand, with a large thumb-like great toe 
        quite free from the other toes, and so articulated as to be opposable 
        to them; forming with the long finger-like toes a perfect grasping hand. 
        The sole cannot be placed horizontally on the ground; but when standing 
        on a level surface the animal rests on the outer edge of the foot with 
        the finger and thumb-like toes partly closed, while the hands are placed 
        on the ground resting on the knuckles. The illustration on the next page 
        (Fig. 37) shows, fairly well, the peculiarities of the hands and feet 
        of the chimpanzee, and their marked differences, both in form and use, 
        from those of man.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        four limbs, with the peculiarly formed feet and hands, are those of arboreal 
        animals which only occasionally and awkwardly move on level ground. The 
        arms are used in <font color="990000">[[p. 454]]</font> progression equally 
        with the feet, and the hands are only adapted for uses similar to those 
        of our hands when the animal is at rest, and then but clumsily. Lastly, 
        the apes are all hairy animals, like the majority of other mammals, man 
        alone having a smooth and almost naked skin. These numerous and striking 
        differences, even more than those of the skeleton and internal</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../pics/S724CH15.jpg" width="45%" height="auto" /></p>
<p>anatomy, point to an enormously 
        remote epoch when the race that was ultimately to develop into man diverged 
        from that other stock which continued the animal type and ultimately produced 
        the existing varieties of anthropoid apes.</p>
      <p><i>Summary of the Animal Characteristics 
        of Man.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        facts now very briefly summarised amount almost to a demonstration that 
        man, in his bodily structure, has been derived from the lower animals, 
        of which he is the culminating development. In his possession of rudimentary 
        structures <font color="990000">[[p. 455]]</font> which are functional 
        in some of the mammalia; in the numerous variations of his muscles and 
        other organs agreeing with characters which are constant in some apes; 
        in his embryonic development, absolutely identical in character with that 
        of mammalia in general, and closely resembling in its details that of 
        the higher quadrumana; in the diseases which he has in common with other 
        mammalia; and in the wonderful approximation of his skeleton to those 
        of one or other of the anthropoid apes, we have an amount of evidence 
        in this direction which it seems impossible to explain away. And this 
        evidence will appear more forcible if we consider for a moment what the 
        rejection of it implies. For the only alternative supposition is, that 
        man has been specially created--that is to say, has been produced in some 
        quite different way from other animals and altogether independently of 
        them. But in that case the rudimentary structures, the animal-like variations, 
        the identical course of development, and all the other animal characteristics 
        he possesses are deceptive, and inevitably lead us, as thinking beings 
        making use of the reason which is our noblest and most distinctive feature, 
        into gross error.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        cannot believe, however, that a careful study of the facts of nature leads 
        to conclusions directly opposed to the truth; and, as we seek in vain, 
        in our physical structure and the course of its development, for any indication 
        of an origin independent of the rest of the animal world, we are compelled 
        to reject the idea of &quot;special creation&quot; for man, as being entirely unsupported 
        by facts as well as in the highest degree improbable.</p>
      <p><i>The Geological Antiquity 
        of Man.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        evidence we now possess of the exact nature of the resemblance of man 
        to the various species of anthropoid apes, shows us that he has little 
        special affinity for any one rather than another species, while he differs 
        from them all in several important characters in which they agree with 
        each other. The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is, that his points 
        of affinity connect him with the whole group, while his special peculiarities 
        equally separate him from the whole group, and that he must, therefore, 
        have diverged from the common ancestral form before the existing types 
        of anthropoid apes <font color="990000">[[p. 456]]</font> had diverged 
        from each other. Now, this divergence almost certainly took place as early 
        as the Miocene period, because in the Upper Miocene deposits of Western 
        Europe remains of two species of ape have been found allied to the gibbons, 
        one of them, Dryopithecus, nearly as large as a man, and believed by M. 
        Lartet to have approached man in its dentition more than the existing 
        apes. We seem hardly, therefore, to have reached, in the Upper Miocene, 
        the epoch of the common ancestor of man and the anthropoids.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        evidence of the antiquity of man himself is also scanty, and takes us 
        but very little way back into the past. We have clear proof of his existence 
        in Europe in the latter stages of the glacial epoch, with many indications 
        of his presence in interglacial or even pre-glacial times; while both 
        the actual remains and the works of man found in the auriferous gravels 
        of California deep under lava-flows of Pliocene age, show that he existed 
        in the New World at least as early as in the Old.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> These earliest remains of man have been received with doubt, and even 
        with ridicule, as if there were some extreme improbability in them. But, 
        in point of fact, the wonder is that human remains have not been found 
        more frequently in pre-glacial deposits. Referring to the most ancient 
        fossil remains found in Europe--the Engis and Neanderthal crania,--Professor 
        Huxley makes the following weighty remark: &quot;In conclusion, I may say, 
        that the fossil remains of Man hitherto discovered do not seem to me to 
        take us appreciably nearer to that lower pithecoid form, by the modification 
        of which he has, probably, become what he is.&quot; The Californian remains 
        and works of art, above referred to, give no indication of a specially 
        low form of man; and it remains an unsolved problem why no traces of the 
        long line of man's ancestors, back to the remote period when he first 
        branched off from the pithecoid type, have yet been discovered.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        has been objected by some writers--notably by Professor Boyd Dawkins--that 
        man did not probably exist in Pliocene times, because almost all the known 
        mammalia of that epoch are distinct species from those now living on the 
        earth, and that the same changes of the environment which led to <font color="990000">[[p. 
        457]]</font> the modification of other mammalian species would also have 
        led to a change in man. But this argument overlooks the fact that man 
        differs essentially from all other mammals in this respect, that whereas 
        any important adaptation to new conditions can be effected in them only 
        by a change in bodily structure, man is able to adapt himself to much 
        greater changes of conditions by a mental development leading him to the 
        use of fire, of tools, of clothing, of improved dwellings, of nets and 
        snares, and of agriculture. By the help of these, without any change whatever 
        in his bodily structure, he has been able to spread over and occupy the 
        whole earth; to dwell securely in forest, plain, or mountain; to inhabit 
        alike the burning desert or the arctic wastes; to cope with every kind 
        of wild beast, and to provide himself with food in districts where, as 
        an animal trusting to nature's unaided productions, he would have starved.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        follows, therefore, that from the time when the ancestral man first walked 
        erect, with hands freed from any active part in locomotion, and when his 
        brain-power became sufficient to cause him to use his hands in making 
        weapons and tools, houses and clothing, to use fire for cooking, and to 
        plant seeds or roots to supply himself with stores of food, the power 
        of natural selection would cease to act in producing modifications of 
        his body, but would continuously advance his mind through the development 
        of its organ, the brain. Hence man may have become truly man--the species, 
        Homo sapiens--even in the Miocene period; and while all other mammals were 
        becoming modified from age to age under the influence of ever-changing 
        physical and biological conditions, he would be advancing mainly in intelligence, 
        but perhaps also in stature, and by that advance alone would be able to 
        maintain himself as the master of all other animals and as the most widespread 
        occupier of the earth. It is quite in accordance with this view that we 
        find the most pronounced distinction between man and the anthropoid apes 
        in the size and complexity of his brain. Thus, Professor Huxley tells 
        us that &quot;it may be doubted whether a healthy human adult brain ever weighed <font color="990000">[[p. 458]]</font> less than 31 or 32 ounces, or that 
        the heaviest gorilla brain has exceeded 20 ounces,&quot; although &quot;a full-grown 
        gorilla is probably pretty nearly twice as heavy as a Bosjes man, or as 
        many an European woman.&quot;<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> The average human 
        brain, however, weighs 48 or 49 ounces, and if we take the average ape 
        brain at only 2 ounces less than the very largest gorilla's brain, or 
        18 ounces, we shall see better the enormous increase which has taken place 
        in the brain of man since the time when he branched off from the apes; 
        and this increase will be still greater if we consider that the brains 
        of apes, like those of all other mammals, have also increased from earlier 
        to later geological times.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
        these various considerations are taken into account, we must conclude 
        that the essential features of man's structure as compared with that of 
        apes--his erect posture and free hands--were acquired at a comparatively 
        early period, and were, in fact, the characteristics which gave him his 
        superiority over other mammals, and started him on the line of development 
        which has led to his conquest of the world. But during this long and steady 
        development of brain and intellect, mankind must have continuously increased 
        in numbers and in the area which they occupied--they must have formed what 
        Darwin terms a &quot;dominant race.&quot; For had they been few in numbers and confined 
        to a limited area, they could hardly have successfully struggled against 
        the numerous fierce carnivora of that period, and against those adverse 
        influences which led to the extinction of so many more powerful animals. 
        A large population spread over an extensive area is also needed to supply 
        an adequate number of brain variations for man's progressive improvement. 
        But this large population and long-continued development in a single line 
        of advance renders it the more difficult to account for the complete absence 
        of human or pre-human remains in all those deposits which have furnished, 
        in such rich abundance, the remains of other land animals. It is true 
        that the remains of apes are also very rare, and we may well suppose that 
        the superior intelligence of man led him to avoid that extensive destruction 
        by flood or in morass which seems to have often overwhelmed other animals. 
        Yet, when <font color="990000">[[p. 459]]</font> we consider that, even 
        in our own day, men are not unfrequently overwhelmed by volcanic eruptions, 
        as in Java and Japan, or carried away in vast numbers by floods, as in 
        Bengal and China, it seems impossible but that ample remains of Miocene 
        and Pliocene man do exist buried in the most recent layers of the earth's 
        crust, and that more extended research or some fortunate discovery will 
        some day bring them to light.</p>
      <p><i>The Probable Birthplace 
        of Man.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        has usually been considered that the ancestral form of man originated 
        in the tropics, where vegetation is most abundant and the climate most 
        equable. But there are some important objections to this view. The anthropoid 
        apes, as well as most of the monkey tribe, are essentially arboreal in 
        their structure, whereas the great distinctive character of man is his 
        special adaptation to terrestrial locomotion. We can hardly suppose, therefore, 
        that he originated in a forest region, where fruits to be obtained by 
        climbing are the chief vegetable food. It is more probable that he began 
        his existence on the open plains or high plateaux of the temperate or 
        sub-tropical zone, where the seeds of indigenous cereals and numerous 
        herbivora, rodents, and game-birds, with fishes and molluscs in the lakes, 
        rivers, and seas supplied him with an abundance of varied food. In such 
        a region he would develop skill as a hunter, trapper, or fisherman, and 
        later as a herdsman and cultivator,--a succession of which we find indications 
        in the pal&aelig;olithic and neolithic races of Europe.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        seeking to determine the particular areas in which his earliest traces 
        are likely to be found, we are restricted to some portion of the Eastern 
        hemisphere, where alone the anthropoid apes exist, or have apparently 
        ever existed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        is good reason to believe, also, that Africa must be excluded, because 
        it is known to have been separated from the northern continent in early 
        tertiary times, and to have acquired its existing fauna of the higher 
        mammalia by a later union with that continent after the separation from 
        it of Madagascar, an island which has preserved for us a sample, as it 
        were, of the early African mammalian fauna, from which not only the anthropoid 
        apes, but all the higher quadrumana <font color="990000">[[p. 460]]</font> 
        are absent.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> There remains only the great 
        Euro-Asiatic continent; and its enormous plateaux, extending from Persia 
        right across Tibet and Siberia to Manchuria, afford an area, some part 
        or other of which probably offered suitable conditions, in late Miocene 
        or early Pliocene times, for the development of ancestral man.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is in this area that we still find that type of mankind--the Mongolian--which 
        retains a colour of the skin midway between the black or brown-black of 
        the negro, and the ruddy or olive-white of the Caucasian types, a colour 
        which still prevails over all Northern Asia, over the American continents, 
        and over much of Polynesia. From this primary tint arose, under the influence 
        of varied conditions, and probably in correlation with constitutional 
        changes adapted to peculiar climates, the varied tints which still exist 
        among mankind. If the reasoning by which this conclusion is reached be 
        sound, and all the earlier stages of man's development from an animal 
        form occurred in the area now indicated, we can better understand how 
        it is that we have as yet met with no traces of the missing links, or 
        even of man's existence during late tertiary times, because no part of 
        the world is so entirely unexplored by the geologist as this very region. 
        The area in question is sufficiently extensive and varied to admit of 
        primeval man having attained to a considerable population, and having 
        developed his full human characteristics, both physical and mental, before 
        there was any need for him to migrate beyond its limits. One of his earliest 
        important migrations was probably into Africa, where, spreading westward, 
        he became modified in colour and hair in correlation with physiological 
        changes adapting him to the climate of the equatorial lowlands. Spreading 
        north-westward into Europe the moist and cool climate led to a modification 
        of an opposite character, and thus may have arisen the three great human 
        types which still exist. Somewhat later, probably, he spread eastward 
        into North-West America and soon scattered himself over the whole continent; 
        and all this may well have occurred in early or middle Pliocene times. 
        Thereafter, at very long intervals, successive waves of migration carried 
        him into every <font color="990000">[[p. 461]]</font> part of the habitable 
        world, and by conquest and intermixture led ultimately to that puzzling 
        gradation of types which the ethnologist in vain seeks to unravel.</p>
      <p><i>The Origin of the Moral 
        and Intellectual Nature of Man.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 
        the foregoing discussion it will be seen that I fully accept Mr. Darwin's 
        conclusion as to the essential identity of man's bodily structure with 
        that of the higher mammalia, and his descent from some ancestral form 
        common to man and the anthropoid apes. The evidence of such descent appears 
        to me to be overwhelming and conclusive. Again, as to the cause and method 
        of such descent and modification, we may admit, at all events provisionally, 
        that the laws of variation and natural selection, acting through the struggle 
        for existence and the continual need of more perfect adaptation to the 
        physical and biological environments, may have brought about, first that 
        perfection of bodily structure in which he is so far above all other animals, 
        and in co-ordination with it the larger and more developed brain, by means 
        of which he has been able to utilise that structure in the more and more 
        complete subjection of the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms to his 
        service.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        this is only the beginning of Mr. Darwin's work, since he goes on to discuss 
        the moral nature and mental faculties of man, and derives these too by 
        gradual modification and development from the lower animals. Although, 
        perhaps, nowhere distinctly formulated, his whole argument tends to the 
        conclusion that man's entire nature and all his faculties, whether moral, 
        intellectual, or spiritual, have been derived from their rudiments in 
        the lower animals, in the same manner and by the action of the same general 
        laws as his physical structure has been derived. As this conclusion appears 
        to me not to be supported by adequate evidence, and to be directly opposed 
        to many well-ascertained facts, I propose to devote a brief space to its 
        discussion.</p>
      <p><i>The Argument from Continuity.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. 
        Darwin's mode of argument consists in showing that the rudiments of most, 
        if not of all, the mental and moral faculties of man can be detected in 
        some animals. The <font color="990000">[[p. 462]]</font> manifestations 
        of intelligence, amounting in some cases to distinct acts of reasoning, 
        in many animals, are adduced as exhibiting in a much less degree the intelligence 
        and reason of man. Instances of curiosity, imitation, attention, wonder, 
        and memory are given; while examples are also adduced which may be interpreted 
        as proving that animals exhibit kindness to their fellows, or manifest 
        pride, contempt, and shame. Some are said to have the rudiments of language, 
        because they utter several different sounds, each of which has a definite 
        meaning to their fellows or to their young; others the rudiments of arithmetic, 
        because they seem to count and remember up to three, four, or even five. 
        A sense of beauty is imputed to them on account of their own bright colours 
        or the use of coloured objects in their nests; while dogs, cats, and horses 
        are said to have imagination, because they appear to be disturbed by dreams. 
        Even some distant approach to the rudiments of religion is said to be 
        found in the deep love and complete submission of a dog to his master.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning 
        from animals to man, it is shown that in the lowest savages many of these 
        faculties are very little advanced from the condition in which they appear 
        in the higher animals; while others, although fairly well exhibited, are 
        yet greatly inferior to the point of development they have reached in 
        civilised races. In particular, the moral sense is said to have been developed 
        from the social instincts of savages, and to depend mainly on the enduring 
        discomfort produced by any action which excites the general disapproval 
        of the tribe. Thus, every act of an individual which is believed to be 
        contrary to the interests of the tribe, excites its unvarying disapprobation 
        and is held to be immoral; while every act, on the other hand, which is, 
        as a rule, beneficial to the tribe, is warmly and constantly approved, 
        and is thus considered to be right or moral. From the mental struggle, 
        when an act that would benefit self is injurious to the tribe, there arises 
        conscience; and thus the social instincts are the foundation of the moral 
        sense and of the fundamental principles of morality.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        question of the origin and nature of the moral sense and of conscience 
        is far too vast and complex to be discussed <font color="990000">[[p. 
        463]]</font> here, and a reference to it has been introduced only to complete 
        the sketch of Mr. Darwin's view of the continuity and gradual development 
        of all human faculties from the lower animals up to savages, and from 
        savage up to civilised man. The point to which I wish specially to call 
        attention is, that to prove continuity and the progressive development 
        of the intellectual and moral faculties from animals to man, is not the 
        same as proving that these faculties have been developed by natural selection; 
        and this last is what Mr. Darwin has hardly attempted, although to support 
        his theory it was absolutely essential to prove it. Because man's physical 
        structure has been developed from an animal form by natural selection, 
        it does not necessarily follow that his mental nature, even though developed 
        <i>pari passu</i> with it, has been developed by the same causes only.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
        illustrate by a physical analogy. Upheaval and depression of land, combined 
        with sub-aerial denudation by wind and frost, rain and rivers, and marine 
        denudation on coast-lines, were long thought to account for all the modelling 
        of the earth's surface not directly due to volcanic action; and in the 
        early editions of Lyell's <i>Principles of Geology</i> these are the sole 
        causes appealed to. But when the action of glaciers was studied and the 
        recent occurrence of a glacial epoch demonstrated as a fact, many phenomena--such 
        as moraines and other gravel deposits, boulder clay, erratic boulders, 
        grooved and rounded rocks, and Alpine lake basins--were seen to be due 
        to this altogether distinct cause. There was no breach of continuity, 
        no sudden catastrophe; the cold period came on and passed away in the 
        most gradual manner, and its effects often passed insensibly into those 
        produced by denudation or upheaval; yet none the less a new agency appeared 
        at a definite time, and new effects were produced which, though continuous 
        with preceding effects, were not due to the same causes. It is not, therefore, 
        to be assumed, without proof or against independent evidence, that the 
        later stages of an apparently continuous development are necessarily due 
        to the same causes only as the earlier stages. Applying this argument 
        to the case of man's intellectual and moral nature, I propose to show 
        that certain definite portions of it could not have been developed by 
        variation and natural selection alone, and that, therefore, some other 
        influence, law, or agency is <font color="990000">[[p. 464]]</font> required 
        to account for them. If this can be clearly shown for any one or more 
        of the special faculties of intellectual man, we shall be justified in 
        assuming that the same unknown cause or power may have had a much wider 
        influence, and may have profoundly influenced the whole course of his 
        development.</p>
      <p><i>The Origin of the Mathematical 
        Faculty.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        have ample evidence that, in all the lower races of man, what may be termed 
        the mathematical faculty is, either absent, or, if present, quite unexercised. 
        The Bushmen and the Brazilian Wood-Indians are said not to count beyond 
        two. Many Australian tribes only have words for one and two, which are 
        combined to make three, four, five, or six, beyond which they do not count. 
        The Damaras of South Africa only count to three; and Mr. Galton gives 
        a curious description of how one of them was hopelessly puzzled when 
        he had sold two sheep for two sticks of tobacco each, and received four 
        sticks in payment. He could only find out that he was correctly paid by 
        taking two sticks and then giving one sheep, then receiving two sticks 
        more and giving the other sheep. Even the comparatively intellectual Zulus 
        can only count up to ten by using the hands and fingers. The Ahts of North-West 
        America count in nearly the same manner, and most of the tribes of South 
        America are no further advanced.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> The Kaffirs 
        have great herds of cattle, and if one is lost they miss it immediately, 
        but this is not by counting, but by noticing the absence of one they know; 
        just as in a large family or a school a boy is missed without going through 
        the process of counting. Somewhat higher races, as the Esquimaux, can 
        count up to twenty by using the hands and the feet; and other races get 
        even further than this by saying &quot;one man&quot; for twenty, &quot;two men&quot; for forty, 
        and so on, equivalent to our rural mode of reckoning by scores. From the 
        fact that so many of the existing savage races can only count to four 
        or five, Sir John Lubbock thinks it improbable that our earliest ancestors 
        could have counted as high as ten.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        465]]</font> When we turn to the more civilised races, we find the use 
        of numbers and the art of counting greatly extended. Even the Tongas of 
        the South Sea islands are said to have been able to count as high as 100,000. 
        But mere counting does not imply either the possession or the use of 
        anything that can be really called the mathematical faculty, the exercise 
        of which in any broad sense has only been possible since the introduction 
        of the decimal notation. The Greeks, the Romans, the Egyptians, the Jews, 
        and the Chinese had all such cumbrous systems, that anything like a science 
        of arithmetic, beyond very simple operations, was impossible; and the 
        Roman system, by which the year 1888 would be written MDCCCLXXXVIII, was 
        that in common use in Europe down to the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries, 
        and even much later in some places. Algebra, which was invented by the 
        Hindoos, from whom also came the decimal notation, was not introduced 
        into Europe till the thirteenth century, although the Greeks had some 
        acquaintance with it; and it reached Western Europe from Italy only in 
        the sixteenth century.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> It was, no doubt, 
        owing to the absence of a sound system of numeration that the mathematical 
        talent of the Greeks was directed chiefly to geometry, in which science 
        Euclid, Archimedes, and others made such brilliant discoveries. It is, 
        however, during the last three centuries only that the civilised world 
        appears to have become conscious of the possession of a marvellous faculty 
        which, when supplied with the necessary tools in the decimal notation, 
        the elements of algebra and geometry, and the power of rapidly communicating 
        discoveries and ideas by the art of printing, has developed to an extent, 
        the full grandeur of which can be appreciated only by those who have devoted 
        some time (even if unsuccessfully) to the study.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        facts now set forth as to the almost total absence of mathematical faculty 
        in savages and its wonderful development in quite recent times, are exceedingly 
        suggestive, and in regard <font color="990000">[[p. 466]]</font> to them 
        we are limited to two possible theories. Either prehistoric and savage 
        man did not possess this faculty at all (or only in its merest rudiments); 
        or they did possess it, but had neither the means nor the incitements 
        for its exercise. In the former case we have to ask by what means has 
        this faculty been so rapidly developed in all civilised races, many of 
        which a few centuries back were, in this respect, almost savages themselves; 
        while in the latter case the difficulty is still greater, for we have 
        to assume the existence of a faculty which had never been used either 
        by the supposed possessors of it or by their ancestors.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let 
        us take, then, the least difficult supposition--that savages possessed 
        only the mere rudiments of the faculty, such as their ability to count, 
        sometimes up to ten, but with an utter inability to perform the very simplest 
        processes of arithmetic or of geometry--and inquire how this rudimentary 
        faculty became rapidly developed into that of a Newton, a La Place, a 
        Gauss, or a Cayley. We will admit that there is every possible gradation 
        between these extremes, and that there has been perfect continuity in 
        the development of the faculty; but we ask, What motive power caused its 
        development?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        must be remembered we are here dealing solely with the capability of the 
        Darwinian theory to account for the origin of the <i>mind</i>, as well 
        as it accounts for the origin of the <i>body</i> of man, and we must, 
        therefore, recall the essential features of that theory. These are, the 
        preservation of useful variations in the struggle for life; that no creature 
        can be improved beyond its necessities for the time being; that the law 
        acts by life and death, and by the survival of the fittest. We have to 
        ask, therefore, what relation the successive stages of improvement of 
        the mathematical faculty had to the life or death of its possessors; to 
        the struggles of tribe with tribe, or nation with nation; or to the ultimate 
        survival of one race and the extinction of another. If it cannot possibly 
        have had any such effects, then it cannot have been produced by natural 
        selection.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is evident that in the struggles of savage man with the elements and with 
        wild beasts, or of tribe with tribe, this faculty can have had no influence. 
        It had nothing to do with <font color="990000">[[p. 467]]</font> the early 
        migrations of man, or with the conquest and extermination of weaker by 
        more powerful peoples. The Greeks did not successfully resist the Persian 
        invaders by any aid from their few mathematicians, but by military training, 
        patriotism, and self-sacrifice. The barbarous conquerors of the East, 
        Timurlane and Gengkhis Khan, did not owe their success to any superiority 
        of intellect or of mathematical faculty in themselves or their followers. 
        Even if the great conquests of the Romans were, in part, due to their 
        systematic military organisation, and to their skill in making roads and 
        encampments, which may, perhaps, be imputed to some exercise of the mathematical 
        faculty, that did not prevent them from being conquered in turn by barbarians, 
        in whom it was almost entirely absent. And if we take the most civilised 
        peoples of the ancient world--the Hindoos, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the 
        Romans, all of whom had some amount of mathematical talent--we find that 
        it is not these, but the descendants of the barbarians of those days--the 
        Celts, the Teutons, and the Slavs--who have proved themselves the fittest 
        to survive in the great struggle of races, although we cannot trace their 
        steadily growing success during past centuries either to the possession 
        of any exceptional mathematical faculty or to its exercise. They have 
        indeed proved themselves, to-day, to be possessed of a marvellous endowment 
        of the mathematical faculty; but their success at home and abroad, as 
        colonists or as conquerors, as individuals or as nations, can in no way 
        be traced to this faculty, since they were almost the last who devoted 
        themselves to its exercise. We conclude, then, that the present gigantic 
        development of the mathematical faculty is wholly unexplained by the theory 
        of natural selection, and must be due to some altogether distinct cause.</p>
      <p><i>The Origin of the Musical 
        and Artistic Faculties.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
        distinctively human faculties follow very closely the lines of the mathematical 
        faculty in their progressive development, and serve to enforce the same 
        argument. Among the lower savages music, as we understand it, hardly exists, 
        though they all delight in rude musical sounds, as of drums, tom-toms, 
        or gongs; and they also sing in monotonous chants. Almost exactly as they 
        advance in general intellect, and in the arts <font color="990000">[[p. 
        468]]</font> of social life, their appreciation of music appears to rise 
        in proportion; and we find among them rude stringed instruments and whistles, 
        till, in Java, we have regular bands of skilled performers probably the 
        successors of Hindoo musicians of the age before the Mahometan conquest. 
        The Egyptians are believed to have been the earliest musicians, and from 
        them the Jews and the Greeks, no doubt, derived their knowledge of the 
        art; but it seems to be admitted that neither the latter nor the Romans 
        knew anything of harmony or of the essential features of modern music.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> 
        Till the fifteenth century little progress appears to have been made in 
        the science or the practice of music; but since that era it has advanced 
        with marvellous rapidity, its progress being curiously parallel with that 
        of mathematics, inasmuch as great musical geniuses appeared suddenly among 
        different nations, equal in their possession of this special faculty to 
        any that have since arisen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
        with the mathematical, so with the musical faculty, it is impossible to 
        trace any connection between its possession and survival in the struggle 
        for existence. It seems to have arisen as a <i>result</i> of social and 
        intellectual advancement, not as a <i>cause</i>; and there is some evidence 
        that it is latent in the lower races, since under European training native 
        military bands have been formed in many parts of the world, which have 
        been able to perform creditably the best modern music.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        artistic faculty has run a somewhat different course, though analogous 
        to that of the faculties already discussed. Most savages exhibit some 
        rudiments of it, either in drawing or carving human or animal figures; 
        but, almost without exception, these figures are rude and such as would 
        be executed by the ordinary inartistic child. In fact, modern savages 
        are, in this respect hardly equal to those prehistoric men who represented 
        the mammoth and the reindeer on pieces of horn or bone. With any advance 
        in the arts of social life, we have a corresponding advance in artistic 
        skill and taste, rising very high in the art of Japan and India, but culminating 
        in the marvellous sculpture of the best period of Grecian history. In 
        the Middle Ages art was chiefly manifested in <font color="990000">[[p. 
        469]]</font> ecclesiastical architecture and the illumination of manuscripts, 
        but from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries pictorial art revived 
        in Italy and attained to a degree of perfection which has never been surpassed. 
        This revival was followed closely by the schools of Germany, the Netherlands, 
        Spain, France, and England, showing that the true artistic faculty belonged 
        to no one nation, but was fairly distributed among the various European 
        races.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
        several developments of the artistic faculty, whether manifested in sculpture, 
        painting, or architecture, are evidently outgrowths of the human intellect 
        which have no immediate influence on the survival of individuals or of 
        tribes, or on the success of nations in their struggles for supremacy 
        or for existence. The glorious art of Greece did not prevent the nation 
        from falling under the sway of the less advanced Roman; while we ourselves, 
        among whom art was the latest to arise, have taken the lead in the colonisation 
        of the world, thus proving our mixed race to be the fittest to survive.</p>
      <p><i>Independent Proof that 
        the Mathematical, Musical, and Artistic Faculties have not been Developed 
        under the Law of Natural Selection.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        law of Natural Selection or the survival of the fittest is, as its name 
        implies, a rigid law, which acts by the life or death of the individuals 
        submitted to its action. From its very nature it can act only on useful 
        or hurtful characteristics, eliminating the latter and keeping up the 
        former to a fairly general level of efficiency. Hence it necessarily follows 
        that the characters developed by its means will be present in all the 
        individuals of a species, and, though varying, will not vary very widely 
        from a common standard. The amount of variation we found, in our third 
        chapter, to be about one-fifth or one-sixth of the mean value--that is, 
        if the mean value were taken at 100, the variations would reach from 80 
        to 120, or somewhat more, if very large numbers were compared. In accordance 
        with this law we find, that all those characters in man which were certainly 
        essential to him during his early stages of development, exist in all 
        savages with some approach to equality. In the speed of running, in bodily 
        strength, in skill with weapons, in acuteness of vision, or in power of <font color="990000">[[p. 470]]</font> following a trail, all are fairly 
        proficient, and the differences of endowment do not probably exceed the 
        limits of variation in animals above referred to. So, in animal instinct 
        or intelligence, we find the same general level of development. Every 
        wren makes a fairly good nest like its fellows; every fox has an average 
        amount of the sagacity of its race; while all the higher birds and mammals 
        have the necessary affections and instincts needful for the protection 
        and bringing-up of their offspring.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        in those specially developed faculties of civilised man which we have 
        been considering, the case is very different. They exist only in a small 
        proportion of individuals, while the difference of capacity between these 
        favoured individuals and the average of mankind is enormous. Taking first 
        the mathematical faculty, probably fewer than one in a hundred really 
        possess it, the great bulk of the population having no natural ability 
        for the study, or feeling the slightest interest in it.<a href="#17"><sup>17</sup></a> 
        And if we attempt to measure the amount of variation in the faculty itself 
        between a first-class mathematician and the ordinary run of people who 
        find any kind of calculation confusing and altogether devoid of interest, 
        it is probable that the former could not be estimated at less than a hundred 
        times the latter, and perhaps a thousand times would more nearly measure 
        the difference between them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        artistic faculty appears to agree pretty closely with the mathematical 
        in its frequency. The boys and girls who, going beyond the mere conventional 
        designs of children, draw what they <i>see</i>, not what they <i >know</i> 
        to be the shape of things; who naturally sketch in perspective, because 
        it is thus they see objects; who see, and represent in their sketches, 
        the light and shade as well as the mere outlines of objects; and who can 
        draw recognisable sketches of every one they know, are certainly very 
        few compared with those who are totally <font color="990000">[[p. 471]]</font> 
        incapable of anything of the kind. From some inquiries I have made in 
        schools, and from my own observation, I believe that those who are endowed 
        with this natural artistic talent do not exceed, even if they come up 
        to, one per cent of the whole population.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        variations in the amount of artistic faculty are certainly very great, 
        even if we do not take the extremes. The gradations of power between 
        the ordinary man or woman &quot;who does not draw,&quot; and whose attempts at representing 
        any object, animate or inanimate, would be laughable, and the average 
        good artist who, with a few bold strokes, can produce a recognisable and 
        even effective sketch of a landscape, a street, or an animal, are very 
        numerous; and we can hardly measure the difference between them at less 
        than fifty or a hundred fold.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        musical faculty is undoubtedly, in its lower forms, less uncommon than 
        either of the preceding, but it still differs essentially from the necessary 
        or useful faculties in that it is almost entirely wanting in one-half 
        even of civilised men. For every person who draws, as it were instinctively, 
        there are probably five or ten who sing or play without having been taught 
        and from mere innate love and perception of melody and harmony.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> On the other band, there are probably about as many who seem absolutely 
        deficient in musical perception, who take little pleasure in it, who cannot 
        perceive discords or remember tunes, and who could not learn to sing or 
        play with any amount of study. The gradations, too, are here quite as 
        great as in mathematics or pictorial art, and the special faculty of the 
        great musical composer must be reckoned many hundreds or perhaps thousands 
        of times greater than that of the ordinary &quot;unmusical&quot; person above referred 
        to.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        appears then, that, both on account of the limited number of persons gifted 
        with the mathematical, the artistic, or the musical faculty, as well as 
        from the enormous variations in its development, these mental powers differ 
        widely from those which are essential to man, and are, for the most part, 
        common to him and the lower animals; and that they could <font color="990000">[[p. 
        472]]</font> not, therefore, possibly have been developed in him by means 
        of the law of natural selection.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        have thus shown, by two distinct lines of argument, that faculties are 
        developed in civilised man which, both in their mode of origin, their 
        function, and their variations, are altogether distinct from those other 
        characters and faculties which are essential to him, and which have been 
        brought to their actual state of efficiency by the necessities of his 
        existence. And besides the three which have been specially referred to, 
        there are others which evidently belong to the same class. Such is the 
        metaphysical faculty, which enables us to form abstract conceptions of 
        a kind the most remote from all practical applications, to discuss the 
        ultimate causes of things, the nature and qualities of matter, motion, 
        and force, of space and time, of cause and effect, of will and conscience. 
        Speculations on these abstract and difficult questions are impossible 
        to savages, who seem to have no mental faculty enabling them to grasp 
        the essential ideas or conceptions; yet whenever any race attains to civilisation, 
        and comprises a body of people who, whether as priests or philosophers, 
        are relieved from the necessity of labour or of taking an active part 
        in war or government, the metaphysical faculty appears to spring suddenly 
        into existence, although, like the other faculties we have referred to, 
        it is always confined to a very limited proportion of the population.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        the same class we may place the peculiar faculty of wit and humour, an 
        altogether natural gift whose development appears to be parallel with 
        that of the other exceptional faculties. Like them, it is almost unknown 
        among savages, but appears more or less frequently as civilisation advances 
        and the interests of life become more numerous and more complex. Like 
        them, too, it is altogether removed from utility in the struggle for life, 
        and appears sporadically in a very small percentage of the population; 
        the majority being, as is well known, totally unable to say a witty thing 
        or make a pun even to save their lives.<a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
      <p><font color="990000">[[p. 473]]</font> 
        <i>The Interpretation of the Facts.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        facts now set forth prove the existence of a number of mental faculties 
        which either do not exist at all or exist in a very rudimentary condition 
        in savages, but appear almost suddenly and in perfect development in the 
        higher civilised races. These same faculties are further characterised 
        by their sporadic character, being well developed only in a very small 
        proportion of the community; and by the enormous amount of variation in 
        their development, the higher manifestations of them being many times--perhaps 
        a hundred or a thousand times--stronger than the lower. Each of these characteristics 
        is totally inconsistent with any action of the law of natural selection 
        in the production of the faculties referred to; and the facts, taken in 
        their entirety, compel us to recognise some origin for them wholly distinct 
        from that which has served to account for the animal characteristics--whether 
        bodily or mental--of man.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">&nbsp;[[p. 
        474]]</font> The special faculties we have been discussing clearly point 
        to the existence in man of something which he has not derived from his 
        animal progenitors--something which we may best refer to as being of a 
        spiritual essence or nature, capable of progressive development under 
        favourable conditions. On the hypothesis of this spiritual nature, superadded 
        to the animal nature of man, we are able to understand much that is otherwise 
        mysterious or unintelligible in regard to him, especially the enormous 
        influence of ideas, principles, and beliefs over his whole life and actions. 
        Thus alone we can understand the constancy of the martyr, the unselfishness 
        of the philanthropist, the devotion of the patriot, the enthusiasm of 
        the artist, and the resolute and persevering search of the scientific 
        worker after nature's secrets. Thus we may perceive that the love of truth, 
        the delight in beauty, the passion for justice, and the thrill of exultation 
        with which we hear of any act of courageous self-sacrifice, are the workings 
        within us of a higher nature which has not been developed by means of 
        the struggle for material existence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        will, no doubt, be urged that the admitted continuity of man's progress 
        from the brute does not admit of the introduction of new causes, and 
        that we have no evidence of the sudden change of nature which such introduction 
        would bring about. The fallacy as to new causes involving any breach of 
        continuity, or any sudden or abrupt change, in the effects, has already 
        been shown; but we will further point out that there are at least three 
        stages in the development of the organic world when some new cause or 
        power must necessarily have come into action.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        first stage is the change from inorganic to organic, when the earliest 
        vegetable cell, or the living protoplasm out of which it arose, first 
        appeared. This is often imputed to a mere increase of complexity of chemical 
        compounds; but increase of complexity, with consequent instability, even 
        if we admit that it may have produced protoplasm as a chemical compound, 
        could certainly not have produced <i>living</i> protoplasm--protoplasm 
        which has the power of growth and of reproduction, and of that continuous 
        process of development which has resulted in the marvellous variety and 
        complex organisation of the whole vegetable kingdom. There is in all this 
        something <font color="990000">[[p. 475]]</font> quite beyond and apart 
        from chemical changes, however complex; and it has been well said that 
        the first vegetable cell was a new thing in the world, possessing altogether 
        new powers--that of extracting and fixing carbon from the carbon-dioxide 
        of the atmosphere, that of indefinite reproduction, and, still more marvellous, 
        the power of variation and of reproducing those variations till endless 
        complications of structure and varieties of form have been the result. 
        Here, then, we have indications of a new power at work, which we may term 
        <i>vitality</i>, since it gives to certain forms of matter all those characters 
        and properties which constitute Life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        next stage is still more marvellous, still more completely beyond all 
        possibility of explanation by matter, its laws and forces. It is the introduction 
        of sensation or consciousness, constituting the fundamental distinction 
        between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Here all idea of mere complication 
        of structure producing the result is out of the question. We feel it to 
        be altogether preposterous to assume that at a certain stage of complexity 
        of atomic constitution, and as a necessary result of that complexity alone, 
        an <i>ego</i> should start into existence, a thing that <i>feels</i>, 
        that is <i>conscious</i> of its own existence. Here we have the certainty 
        that something new has arisen, a being whose nascent consciousness has 
        gone on increasing in power and definiteness till it has culminated in 
        the higher animals. No verbal explanation or attempt at explanation--such 
        as the statement that life is the result of the molecular forces of the 
        protoplasm, or that the whole existing organic universe from the am&aelig;ba 
        up to man was latent in the fire-mist from which the solar system was 
        developed--can afford any mental satisfaction, or help us in any way to 
        a solution of the mystery.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        third stage is, as we have seen, the existence in man of a number of his 
        most characteristic and noblest faculties, those which raise him furthest 
        above the brutes and open up possibilities of almost indefinite advancement. 
        These faculties could not possibly have been developed by means of the 
        same laws which have determined the progressive development of the organic 
        world in general, and also of man's physical organism.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        476]]</font> These three distinct stages of progress from the inorganic 
        world of matter and motion up to man, point clearly to an unseen universe--to 
        a world of spirit, to which the world of matter is altogether subordinate. 
        To this spiritual world we may refer the marvellously complex forces which 
        we know as gravitation, cohesion, chemical force, radiant force, and electricity, 
        without which the material universe could not exist for a moment in its 
        present form, and perhaps not at all, since without these forces, and 
        perhaps others which may be termed atomic, it is doubtful whether matter 
        itself could have any existence. And still more surely can we refer to 
        it those progressive manifestations of Life in the vegetable, the animal, 
        and man--which we may classify as unconscious, conscious, and intellectual 
        life,--and which probably depend upon different degrees of spiritual influx. 
        I have already shown that this involves no necessary infraction of the 
        law of continuity in physical or mental evolution; whence it follows that 
        any difficulty we may find in discriminating the inorganic from the organic, 
        the lower vegetable from the lower animal organisms, or the higher animals 
        from the lowest types of man, has no bearing at all upon the question. 
        This is to be decided by showing that a change in essential nature (due, 
        probably, to causes of a higher order than those of the material universe) 
        took place at the several stages of progress which I have indicated; a 
        change which may be none the less real because absolutely imperceptible 
        at its point of origin, as is the change that takes place in the curve 
        in which a body is moving when the application of some new force causes 
        the curve to be slightly altered.</p>
      <p><i>Concluding Remarks.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those 
        who admit my interpretation of the evidence now adduced--strictly scientific 
        evidence in its appeal to facts which are clearly what ought <i>not</i> 
        to be on the materialistic theory--will be able to accept the spiritual 
        nature of man, as not in any way inconsistent with the theory of evolution, 
        but as dependent on those fundamental laws and causes which furnish the 
        very materials for evolution to work with. They will also be relieved 
        from the crushing mental burthen imposed upon those who--maintaining that 
        we, in common with the <font color="990000">[[p. 477]]</font> rest of 
        nature, are but products of the blind eternal forces of the universe, 
        and believing also that the time must come when the sun will lose his 
        heat and all life on the earth necessarily cease--have to contemplate a 
        not very distant future in which all this glorious earth--which for untold 
        millions of years has been slowly developing forms of life and beauty 
        to culminate at last in man--shall be as if it had never existed; who are 
        compelled to suppose that all the slow growths of our race struggling 
        towards a higher life, all the agony of martyrs, all the groans of victims, 
        all the evil and misery and undeserved suffering of the ages, all the 
        struggles for freedom, all the efforts towards justice, all the aspirations 
        for virtue and the wellbeing of humanity, shall absolutely vanish, and, 
        &quot;like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wrack behind.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
        contrasted with this hopeless and soul-deadening belief, we, who accept 
        the existence of a spiritual world, can look upon the universe as a grand 
        consistent whole adapted in all its parts to the development of spiritual 
        beings capable of indefinite life and perfectibility. To us, the whole 
        purpose, the only <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the world--with all its complexities 
        of physical structure, with its grand geological progress, the slow evolution 
        of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, and the ultimate appearance of man--was 
        the development of the human spirit in association with the human body. 
        From the fact that the spirit of man--the man himself--<i>is</i> so developed, 
        we may well believe that this is the only, or at least the best, way for 
        its development; and we may even see in what is usually termed &quot;evil&quot; 
        on the earth, one of the most efficient means of its growth. For we know 
        that the noblest faculties of man are strengthened and perfected by struggle 
        and effort; it is by unceasing warfare against physical evils and in the 
        midst of difficulty and danger that energy, courage, self-reliance, and 
        industry have become the common qualities of the northern races; it is 
        by the battle with moral evil in all its hydra-headed forms, that the 
        still nobler qualities of justice and mercy and humanity and self-sacrifice 
        have been steadily increasing in the world. Beings thus trained and strengthened 
        by their surroundings, and possessing latent faculties capable of such 
        noble development, are surely destined for a higher and more permanent <font color="990000">[[p. 478]]</font> existence; and we may confidently 
        believe with our greatest living poet--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;      </p><blockquote><font size="2">That life 
        is not as idle ore,<br />
        But iron dug from central gloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heated hot with burning fears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dipt in baths of hissing tears,<br />
        And batter'd with the shocks of doom<br />
        To shape and use.</font></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        thus find that the Darwinian theory, even when carried out to its extreme 
        logical conclusion, not only does not oppose, but lends a decided support 
        to, a belief in the spiritual nature of man. It shows us how man's body 
        may have been developed from that of a lower animal form under the law 
        of natural selection; but it also teaches us that we possess intellectual 
        and moral faculties which could not have been so developed, but must have 
        had another origin; and for this origin we can only find an adequate cause 
        in the unseen universe of Spirit.</p>

        It has been recently stated that some of these facts are erroneous, and 
        that some Australians can keep accurate reckoning up to 100, or more, 
        when <font color="990000">[[p. 465]]</font> required. But this does not 
        alter the general fact that many low races, including the Australians, 
        have no words for high numbers and never require to use them. If they 
        are now, with a little practice, able to count much higher, this indicates 
        the possession of a faculty which could not have been developed under 
        the law of utility only, since the absence of words for such high numbers 
        shows that they were neither used nor required. <font color="990000">[[on

        This is the estimate furnished me by two mathematical masters in one of 
        our great public schools of the proportion of boys who have any special 
        taste or capacity for mathematical studies. Many more, of course, can 
        be drilled into a fair knowledge of elementary mathematics, but only this 
        small proportion possess the natural faculty which renders it possible 
        for them ever to rank high as mathematicians, to take any pleasure in 
        it, or to do any original mathematical work. <font color="990000">[[on

        I am informed, however, by a music master in a large school that only 
        about one per cent have real or decided musical talent, corresponding 
        curiously with the estimate of the mathematicians. <font color="990000">[[on

        In the latter part of his essay on Heredity (pp. 91-93 of the volume of 
          <i>Essays</i>), Dr. Weismann refers to this question of the origin of 
        &quot;talents&quot; in man, and, like myself, comes to the conclusion that they 
        could not be developed <font color="990000">[[p. 473]] </font>under the 
        law of natural selection. He says: &quot;It may be objected that, in man, in 
        addition to the instincts inherent in every individual, special individual 
        predispositions are also found, of such a nature that it is impossible 
        they can have arisen by individual variations of the germ-plasm. On the 
        other hand, these predispositions--which we call talents--cannot have arisen 
        through natural selection, because life is in no way dependent on their 
        presence, and there seems to be no way of explaining their origin except 
        by an assumption of the summation of the skill attained by exercise in 
        the course of each single life. In this case, therefore, we seem at first 
        sight to be compelled to accept the transmission of acquired characters.&quot; 
        Weismann then goes on to show that the facts do not support this view; 
        that the mathematical, musical, or artistic faculties often appear suddenly 
        in a family whose other members and ancestors were in no way distinguished; 
        and that even when hereditary in families, the talent often appears at 
        its maximum at the commencement or in the middle of the series, not increasing 
        to the end, as it should do if it depended in any way on the transmission 
        of acquired skill. Gauss was not the son of a mathematician, nor Handel 
        of a musician, nor Titian of a painter, and there is no proof of any special 
        talent in the ancestors of these men of genius, who at once developed 
        the most marvellous pre-eminence in their respective talents. And after 
        showing that such great men only appear at certain stages of human development, 
        and that two or more of the special talents are not unfrequently combined 
        in one individual, he concludes thus--&quot;Upon this subject I only wish to 
        add that, in my opinion, talents do not appear to depend upon the improvement 
        of any special mental quality by continued practice, but they are the 
        expression, and to a certain extent the bye-product, of the human mind, 
        which is so highly developed in all directions.&quot; It will, I think, be 
        admitted that this view hardly accounts for the existence of the highly 
        peculiar human faculties in question. <font color="990000">[[on pp. 472-473]]</font></font></p>

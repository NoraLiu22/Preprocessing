/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<center><em>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: Third party rendering of comments Wallace offered during a
field meeting ('A Visit to Ilford') of the Essex Field Club on 24 July 1880, later printed in
Volume Two of their <U>Journal of Proceedings at Ordinary, Field, and Other Meetings</U> series in
1882. Original pagination indicated within double brackets. To link directly to this page, connect

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. xxxiv]]</font> Mr. A. R. Wallace, after some prefatory remarks, said that there were one or two
points in the discussion that afternoon about which he should like to say a few words. First of all
he must refer to the interesting and most remarkable specimens of ancient implements and art
which Sir Antonio Brady had been good enough to show them. He <font color="990000">[[p. xxxv]]</font> was particularly
struck with the stone spear-head so fashioned as to give the weapon a rotatory motion in the air,
and thus increase the accuracy of flight. This specimen was especially interesting to him because
it came from America. When he was travelling there he noticed that the arrows of the aborigines
of the Amazon valley were fringed with feathers arranged spirally round the shafts so as to keep
the weapon in a straight path when projected. In many other parts, as for instance in New Guinea,
weapons are not so &quot;rifled,&quot; and it was, therefore, a very noteworthy fact that the custom of
rifling spears and arrows had persisted in America from the earliest stone ages until now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mr. Wallace's opinion the carved figures of men and animals which Sir Antonio Brady
had exhibited were also of the very greatest interest; they were of such intense interest that it was
difficult to believe they were genuine. If he remembered rightly, the animal carvings of Reindeer,
Mammoth, &amp;c., which had hitherto been discovered were all of a period supposed to be
intermediate between the Pal&aelig;olithic and Neolithic ages--the &quot;Reindeer Period&quot; of M. Lartet; but
it was evident, Sir Antonio's carvings being accepted as genuine, that such were not by any
means the oldest. They had represented by them not only the animals then existing, but also the
men who fed upon them; of the hunter as well as the hunted. It must be remembered that savages
always depicted in their carvings and drawings their own type, and therefore we may take the
figures carved upon the bones to represent the type of face which prevailed among the hunters of
the Mammoth. One of the carvings presented a curious resemblance to the profile of the Duke of
Wellington, and accepting that as a contemporaneous carving, they might draw therefrom the
conclusion that the early hunters of the Mammoth were by no means a low and degraded race.
This was an exceedingly interesting point in connection with the question of the antiquity of
man. We have not made the slightest approach towards the discovery of a lower type. Although
we have been enabled to trace the Old World hunter back to the Pleistocene age, he remains as
much man as the most intelligent races of the present day. Of course he did not mean therefore to
infer that men of a lower type had not existed, but he believed that they must go immensely
further back to discover the first traces of primeval man. He did not agree with Professor Boyd
Dawkins in the inference that man did not exist in the Miocene age because the animals which
must have surrounded him, being of forms which had developed into other species, man would
have therefore been influenced by the law of development, and in the succeeding ages would
have presented characters very different from the genus <em>Homo</em> as at present existing. Mr. Wallace
was disposed to think that, man having reached a certain stage of development, his physical and
mental qualities would enable him rather to control than be controlled by the changing character
of his environment; and <font color="990000">[[p. xxxvi]]</font> therefore, although he might advance in his mind, his bodily
structure would remain very constant. The fact that the earliest races of men yet traced out
present a type similar to man now existing is rather a proof that the human species is immensely
more ancient than we hitherto have had any conception.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With reference to the Glacial Epoch in Geology, Mr. Wallace said it was a subject which for
upwards of fifteen years he had thought and written upon. He was glad to say that he did not
differ from their good friend Sir Antonio Brady to the extent he believed. He quite agreed that
the period of the Mammoth and the earlier <em>Mammalia</em> was a period close upon or within the
Glacial Epoch. In point of fact he considered that the time would come when they would find
that changes in climatal conditions have been the principal causes in producing the changes of
plants and animals on the earth. He believed that the chief agent in inducing these changes of
climate was the geographical alterations in the contours of continents by submergence and
upheaval in different stages of the earth's history. He had lately been attempting to show in some
detail how it was that these changes in Geography did afford us the means of explaining that
hitherto insolvable problem--the mild and luxurious vegetation of the Arctic regions during the
Miocene and many earlier Geological epochs. It was quite impossible to accept in its entirety Mr.
Croll's explanation; but Mr. Wallace believed he had found the solution in Mr. Croll's own
theory of Ocean Currents. Mr. Croll maintained that there had been alternate mild and glacial
conditions in the northern hemisphere throughout the Tertiary period; but the objection to this
was that all the Geological evidence showed that before the last Glacial Epoch mild climates
alone prevailed in the Arctic regions, whether in the Upper or Lower Miocene, the Cretaceous,
the Jurassic or the Carboniferous period;--in fact, every Geological Formation in the Arctic
Regions, anterior to the Pliocene, furnished evidence of mild, and in no single instance of cold
climates. Now Mr. Croll had himself demonstrated the wonderful power of the Gulf Stream in
carrying the warmth of the Tropics into North Temperate and Polar Regions. At present this was
the only important body of warm water that reached the Arctic Seas, but there was good
geological evidence that in earlier ages the great Northern Continents--Europe, Asia, and North
America--were not as now solid masses of land, but were broken up and penetrated by arms of
the sea which carried other bodies of warm water northward. When this was the case, the
formation of ice in the polar seas would be entirely prevented; and when there was no ice the
power of the sun during the long day of the polar summer was amply sufficient to support the
vegetation, the remains of which so astonish us in the Arctic Regions. The last Glacial Epoch
was undoubtedly produced by the astronomical conditions which have been so well set forth and
illustrated by Mr. <font color="990000">[[p. xxxvii]]</font> Croll, but it was only rendered possible by the concurrence of
geographical conditions, then recently brought about, by which the greater part of the warm
water of the Tropics which had before entered the Polar seas was shut out from them by the
elevation and solidification of the great Northern Continents. This continued growth and
extension of the land in the Northern Continent during the Tertiary period has been long known
to geologists, but its importance as affecting the most powerful of all climatal
agencies--northward flowing and heat-bearing ocean currents--appears to have been hitherto
overlooked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By thus modifying Mr. Croll's theory, giving greater importance to ocean currents and
comparatively less to astronomical causes, Mr. Wallace believed that the difficulties that had
hitherto beset all attempts to explain the mild climates of the Arctic Regions, so as to satisfy both
geologists and physicists, might be overcome; and in his forthcoming work, &quot;Island Life,&quot; he had
endeavoured to demonstrate the correctness of these views. (Loud applause.)</p>

Nov. 11 to salute alumnus Mark Stevens — one of Silicon Valley’s most successful 
venture capitalists – for his $22-million gift to establish a new Mark and Mary 
Stevens Institute for Technology Commercialization (SITeC) at the USC Viterbi 
School of Engineering. 
<br /></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Faculty, students, staff, alumni, and corporate and industry colleagues turned 
out for a late afternoon celebration for Stevens, a USC graduate with two engineering 
degrees and a degree in economics, who is now a general partner at Sequoia Capital 
in Menlo Park, Calif.  Stevens’ gift, the second largest in the School’s seven-year 
fundraising campaign, has pushed the Viterbi School’s $300-million campaign over 
the halfway mark, bringing the fundraising total to $160 million.   </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“It’s a great honor that Mary and Mark Stevens have chosen to associate their 
name with an academic enterprise dedicated to encouraging innovation in the lab 
and translation to the marketplace,” said USC President Steven B. Sample, an electrical 
engineer who, early in his own career, successfully commercialized his invention: 
the digital touch controls used in microwave ovens and other appliances. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Thanks to Mary and Mark Stevens’ forward-looking generosity, we will not only 
speed up our ability to turn laboratory research into marketplace reality, but 
we will also be able to attract and retain the best professors and educate the 
best students,” he said. “Their gift truly has the potential to transform this 
university.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Brightly painted tech transfer illustrations adorned the stage on the steps of 
Vivian Hall.  Approximately 200 VIPs were seated in chairs in front of the stage, 
with spectators crowded around on all sides to watch the festivities. </div>

Mark Stevens, right, look on. </h6></td></tr></tbody></table></strong><strong>An ‘extraordinary catalyst’</strong></div>
<div>Sample said SITeC would serve as an “extraordinary catalyst” for USC students 
and faculty looking to turn their research into products that will address a wide 
variety of societal needs.  </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>USC Viterbi School Dean C. L. Max Nikias introduced Stevens as a “man with a 
passion for improving people’s lives.” </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Today we salute a man with a passion for benefiting the lives of ordinary people 
everywhere,” Nikias said. “A man who has shown great wisdom and magnanimity in 
his investments in the leading businesses and industries of the future.  A man 
who has now created a dramatic partnership that will allow USC and its Viterbi 
School to join him in his passion for building a better world. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“It is one thing to have a passion, but it is a completely different thing to 
achieve the goals that our passions drive us to,” he continued. “Mark Stevens 
has modeled this latter ability.  And we are all better for it.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Stevens was called to the podium to watch as engineering students unveiled a 
60-foot-long cardinal red banner bearing the institute’s new name — the Mark and 
Mary Stevens Institute for Technology Commercialization — in gold letters. </div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>The crowd burst into applause, then raised their hands and formed the “V” for 
victory as Band Director Arthur Bartner led theTrojan Marching Band through “Conquest.” 
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“I think one of the key changes for universities in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is going to be interdisciplinary study, being able to cross-pollinate, 
cross-fertilize ideas from different parts of a university campus,” Stevens said.  
“I believe that SITeC can be a key element to that, in taking ideas from the business 
school, ideas from the engineering school, ideas from the cinema school or the 
medical school and coming up with technologies in these diverse areas.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The genesis for companies like Cisco, Yahoo! and Google — all companies that 
Sequoia Capital helped take public — came right off of university campuses, Stevens 
noted. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>”It’s a trend that must continue if America is going to have a competitive economy 
in the 21<sup>st</sup> century,” he said.  </div>

<h6>The crowd closed in around the stage to watch the festivities. </h6></td></tr></tbody></table>SITeC’s mission      </h1>
<div>As envisioned, the new Mark and Mary Stevens Institute for Technology Commercialization 
will be home to a rigorous program of technology transfer and academic instruction.  
While some universities have technology transfer programs at the institutional 
level, Nikias said SITeC’s home within the USC Viterbi School of Engineering will 
make it a first.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SITeC’s program of comprehensive commercialization education and training will 
set it apart from other university-based tech transfer programs. “In tomorrow’s 
world, everyone with an engineering degree, no matter how specialized, must understand 
the key elements of technology commercialization,” Nikias said. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Our goal isn’t simply to raise individual competence, but to create a new culture 
and awareness of the value of     commercialization.  Then technology transfer 
can become a natural, intuitive process,” he said.  “SITeC’s professional staff 
will provide a dynamic interface between USC engineers and potential investors 
and corporate partners with a full range of consulting services, from market analyses 
to third-party investor introductions.  In this way, SITeC will build new links 
to industry as it assists USC engineers in addressing the overlapping technical, 
legal and business aspects of commercialization. The result: a more seamless technology 
transfer process.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SITeC will be run by a professional staff, including an executive director, licensing 
and marketing experts, Nikias said.  The staff will concentrate on helping researchers 
at the USC Viterbi School, and in other parts of the campus, to commercialize 
new technologies produced by their research. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As more USC technology innovations enter the marketplace, creating new opportunities 
and jobs, SITeC could boost Southern California’s economy, as well as the state’s 
and the nation’s economy.  “Many companies have learned that the USC Viterbi School 
welcomes cooperation and collaboration with industry,” Stevens said.  “I hope 
that SITeC will spread this message still further.”      </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SITeC will be a resource for students and faculty from across campus to strengthen 
technology transfer capabilities university-wide.  The institute will collaborate 
with the USC Marshall School of Business and the USC Gould School of Law to create 
a strong academic program providing comprehensive technology commercialization 
education and training for all of its engineering students at the undergraduate 
and graduate levels. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Everyone who earns an engineering degree at the USC Viterbi School will leave 
here with a basic understanding of the key elements of technology commercialization 
– intellectual property, business, economics, marketing, management, business 
plan development and ethics – as they relate to technology commercialization,” 
Nikias said.  “We believe this will be unique in engineering education.”</div>

<h6>Brightly painted technology banners decorated the stage in honor of the new commercialization 
institute.</h6></td></tr></tbody></table>About Mark Stevens </h1>
<div>Stevens, 44, earned his B.S. in electrical engineering and his B.A. in economics 
simultaneously at USC.  He went on to earn an M.S. in computer science, and then 
joined Intel, then a mid-sized company about to capitalize on the PC boom.  He 
left later to earn an MBA at Harvard University. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In 1989, he became a partner at Sequoia Capital and began to concentrate his 
talents on semiconductor, software and systems-related investments.  Over the 
years, he became a rising star on <em>Forbes</em> magazine’s Midas List of top 100 venture capitalists, climbing as high as 10<sup>th</sup> place in the ranking.   </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Currently he is one of five voting partners at Sequoia Capital and jointly responsible 
for some of the high-tech industry’s most spectacular investments: Google, Yahoo!, 
NVIDIA and others.  He also sits on the board of NVIDIA and six Sequoia-funded 
private companies, and has been a director of such winning startups as mp3.com, 
Aspect Development, Documentum and BillPoint.  </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He is a member of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering Board of Councilors and 
the USC Board of Trustees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>His business intuition and marketing skill have served him well in venture capital, 
but Stevens knows from experience that there is a void in today’s engineering 
curricula that a commercialization program can fill. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Many engineers in industry know how to build a widget, but they have no idea 
how to build a company,” he said earlier when asked about why he was establishing 
SITeC.  “I have a widget that I built in my garage. Now what do I do with it? 
How do I sell it? How do I market it? Who’s going to build it for me? How do I 
file my patents so I can protect my invention? Engineers learn this by accident 
or by osmosis or just on their own. The learning’s not very structured or formalized 
— and that’s why we’re doing SITeC.”  </div>

<p>The Bowery was originally the road to Peter Stuyvesant's 
farm; "farm" is <i>bouwerij</i> in Dutch. The avenue above 
Cooper Square was renamed Fourth Avenue to try to shake some 
of The Bowery's gritty associations&mdash;but 4th Avenue became 
associated with a smoke-belching railroad that ran down a cut 
in the middle, as well as with a criminal gang 
that lived in the cut. When the cut was paved over, the part 
above 32nd Street was renamed Park Avenue, after the new 
surface's landscaping. The section from Union Square to 
32nd was later renamed Park Avenue South to placate residents 
with status envy.

<p><b>740 (corner):</b> This 19-story limestone-clad apartment building is said to be home to more billionaires than any other building in the country; six of the 25 richest New Yorkers are current or former residents. Completed in 1930, it's considered the masterpiece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Candela" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Rosario Candela</a>, the master designer of luxury apartment houses, who collaborated here with the Empire State Building's Arthur Loomis Harmon.
<p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr., lived here from 1937 until his death in 1960. It's the current address of David Koch, billionaire backer of the Tea Party movement, who's <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/david-koch-gave-50-holiday-tips-at-740-park-avenue-tv.html" target="_blank" title="Bloomberg">noted</a> for giving his doorman here a $50 annual tip. Other notable past and present residents include Marshall Field, Time Warner's Steve Ross, KKR's Henry Kravis, designer Vera Wang and novelist Jerzy Kosinski. It was the childhood home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, whose grandfather was the building's developer; Andy Warhol protoge <a href="http://www.rams.demon.co.uk/estext.htm" target="_blank" title="Biography">Edie Sedgwick</a> lived here with her grandmother in 1964. The French ambassador to the UN and the German consul general have residences here.
<p>Among those whose celebrity reportedly made them unwelcome as apartment-owners here are Barbra Streisand, Joan Crawford and Barbara Walters.

<p>Illustrating the way local tax laws <a href="http://ny.curbed.com/tags/low-tax-lifestyles-of-the-rich-famous" target="_blank" title="Curbed">
favor the super-wealthy</a>, the entire building is assessed at $63 million for tax purposes, even though a single duplex here <a href="http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2012/05/14/740_park_duplex_sells_for_recordbreaking_52_million.php" target="_blank" title="Curbed">sold</a> in 2012 for $52 million.
<p>There's a 
<a href="http://mgross.com/writing/books/740-park/" target="_blank" title="Home">
book</a> about the building subtitled <i>The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building</i>; it inspired a film, <i>Park Avenue</i>, that offended David Koch and other PBS funders and helped expose

<p><b>Corner (101 E 69th):</b> New York City's oldest social club, founded in 1836. Its members have included some of the city's most powerful figures.  including tycoons Cornelius Vanderbilt, J.P. Morgan and John Jacob Astor IV; newspaper moguls James Gordon Bennett, Jr. and  William Randolph Hearst; generals Winfield Scott, Philip H. Sheridan and William Tecumseh Sherman; and presidents U.S. Grant and Dwight Eisenhower. 
<p>The <a href="#37st">Union League Club</a> was formed in 1863 by members unhappy with the club's refusal to expel Confederate sympathizers from its ranks. In 1871, concern that the Union Club's membership standards were falling led to the creation of the <a href="5av.htm#62st">Knickerbocker Club</a>. Other offshoots include The Brook and the Metropolitan Club.
<p>The Union Club relocated here from <a href="5av.htm#51st">Fifth Avenue and 51st Street</a> in 1933. This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/realestate/11scap.html" target="_blank" title="Streetscapes">
clubhouse</a> was designed by Delano &amp; Aldrich, who wanted a more restrained design than club members insisted on.

<h3>Queen Sofia Spanish Institute</h3>
<p><b>684:</b> A neo-Federal house from 1926, designed by McKim Mead & White for World War I aviator Oliver Filley and his wife Mary Pyne Filley; it was paid for by Mary's parents, who lived next door.

 align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4"  /></a> 
<p><b>695 (block):</b> The largest college in the CUNY system, Hunter was established in 1870 by New York State legislature as the Female Normal and High School (later the Normal College of the City of New York)&mdash;a "normal school" being a school for teachers that established educational norms. 
<p>The school was renamed in 1914 for its president for the first 37 years, Irish immigrant Thomas Hunter; Hunter established a then-unusual policy of accepting applicants of all ethnicities and religions, and today the college is still known for the remarkable diversity of its student body. The college began admitting men in 1964.
<p>Brooklyn College and Lehman College in The Bronx both began as Hunter satellite colleges.

 align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4"  /></a> 

<p>This building, which provides Hunter with its official address, was completed in 1941 after a 1936 fire destroyed much of the former Collegiate Gothic campus. Designed in International Style by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, the architects of the Empire State Building, it was one of the first Modernist public buildings in New York. Its "warehouse design" was highly controversial at the time, and its unsentimental approach still makes it a startling presence on Park Avenue.
<p>Notable Hunter College alumni include Bella Abzug, Bobby Darin, Ellen Barkin, Ruby Dee, Jean Stapleton, Grace Paley, Donna Shalala (who was later the college's president) and Vin Diesel.

<p>This block-filling red-brick castle, also known as the Park Avenue Armory, was built in 1877-80 to house the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_New_York_Militia" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">7th Regiment of the New York State Militia</a>.
<p>The 7th Regiment descends from a militia unit formed in 1806 in response to skirmishes with the British Navy off the coast of Sandy Hook. Called into military service, it participated in the War of 1812, the Civil War (when it protected the nation's capital from rebel encirclement) and both world wars (as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/107th_Infantry_Regiment_%28United_States%29" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">107th Infantry</a>). Closer to home, it helped to put down the Astor Place Riot in 1849, the Dead Rabbits and Bowery Boys in 1857 and the Draft Riots in 1863. It guarded Abraham Lincoln's body when it was brought through New York City in 1865, and participated in the inauguration of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 and the Statue of Liberty in 1886.

<a name="66st"></a>
<p>Known as the Silk Stocking Regiment because of its ties to New York's social elite, it was originally based at the Tompkins Market in what is now the East Village, where Cooper Union's new building now stands. After the Civil War, which included the worst civil unrest in the city's history, the regiment looked for a new home closer to the wealthy neighborhoods deemed essential to protect. The armory, designed by Gothic revivalist (and 7th Regiment veteran) Charles Clinton, was privately funded with contributions from the likes of John Jacob Astor, William H. Vanderbilt and James Lenox. The lavish ornamentation of the fortress includes two rooms decorated by Louis Comfort Tiffany.

Seagram Building</a></h2>
 
<p><b>375 (block):</b> This 39-story <a href="http://www.nyc-architecture.com/UES/UES002.htm" target="_blank" title="NYAI">
brown-glass-and-bronze 
office tower</a>, built in 1958 for 
the Seagram's beverage company, is considered 
the epitome of the International Style and 
architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's 
American masterpiece.  Its superbly proportioned 
geometric form and use of floor-to-ceiling windows 
were enormously influential on corporate architecture; 
the <i>New York Times</i> has called it the most 
important building of the 20th Century.

width="180" height="240" 
alt="Seagram building by jeni rodger, on Flickr" 
 align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4"  /></a> 
<p>The vertical bronze beams on the exterior 
are, ironically, a decorative element intended to express 
a fuctionalist aesthetic. The plaza surrounding 
the building--taking Lever House's rejection 
of the street wall farther by eliminating 
the earlier building's base--was so admired 
that zoning laws were changed to encourage 
similar public spaces...few of which were 
as successful as this one.
<p>The building is home to <b>The Four 
Seasons</b>, a restaurant known for its 
power lunches, whose sumptuous interior 
was designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Johnson" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">
Philip Johnson</a>, who was 
van der Rohe's collaborator on the entire 
structure. Painter <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/feature/0,1169,931796,00.html" target="_blank" title="Info">
Mark Rothko</a> was commissioned 
to do art for the restaurant, but he decided 
he hated the place too much and kept the 
series for himself.
<p>In the series <i>That Girl</i>, the 
Marlo Thomas character works in a 
magazine stand in this building.

<p>The address used to be that of an apartment 
building on the block's northern corner, where 
songwriter <a href="http://www.haroldarlen.com/bio.html" target="_blank" title="Home">
Harold Arlen</a> 
lived in the 1940s in the penthouse apartment building.
Another building torn down for the skyscraper, at <b>116 E. 
53rd</b>, was the home of actor <a href="http://www.cmgww.com/stars/clift/about/biography.htm" target="_blank" title="Home">
Montgomery Clift</a> from 1935-43, when he was a teenager 
and young man.

the more fashionable churches in town. A 1919 work by 
Bertram Goodhue (who considered it his favorite), 
its entranceway was salvaged from an earlier 
St. Bartholomew's designed by Stanford White. The 
church tried to tear down Goodhue's Community House 
and sell the land to developers, but the city 
successfully defended its landmark law in court--
an important precedent for preservationists.
<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02313c.htm" target="_blank" title="Image">
Saint Bartholomew</a> was an apostle about whom 
little is known; tradition holds that he was 
martyred by being skinned alive. I suspect that 
churches are named after him largely because of the 
St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, an attack on 
Protestants in France.

<p><b>230:</b> The original name of this 1929 Warren & 
Wetmore building; when it was changed to 
''New York General Building,'' only two stone-carved 
letters needed to be altered.  Later renamed the 
Helmsley Building by the Queen of Mean.
<p>It's built on shock absorbers to dampen the rumbling of 
Grand Central's trains; legendary tour guide Justin 
Ferate demonstrates that it doesn't touch 
<a name="45st"></a>
the ground by slipping a ballpoint pen between the 
building and its foundation. 

<p>On September 10, 1931, <i>capo de tutti capi</i> 
Salvatore Maranzano was murdered in his ninth-floor 
office here by hitmen sent by Lucky Luciano and 
Vito Genovese, ambitious underlings whom Maranzano 
had hired Vincent ''Mad Dog'' Coll to kill. 
 
<p>This had previously been the address of the restaurant of acclaimed chef Charles Pierre, for whom the <a href="5av.htm#61st">Pierre Hotel</a> is named.

Grand Central Terminal</a></h2>

 align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4"  /></a>

<p>Has 67 tracks arriving at 44 platforms--more than 
any other train station in the world. The site 
became a rail terminal in 1854, when 
the Common Council banned steam locomotives below 
42nd Street; horse-drawn trolleys took passengers 
the rest of the way downtown. Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt 
built the Grand Central Depot here in 1871, a metal and glass 
structure that was reconfigured by 1900 as Grand Central Station. 
Between 1903 and 1913, the current <a href="http://www.nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID031.htm" target="_blank" title="Info">
Beaux Arts landmark</a> was built, 
designed by Warren & Wetmore with help from Reed & Stern.
Oak and acorn motifs are used throughout, a reference 
to Vanderbilt's motto, ''Great oaks from little 
acorns grow.''

title="Grand Central Station by KM&G-Morris, on Flickr">

width="180" height="240" 
alt="Grand Central Station by KM&G-Morris, on Flickr" 
 align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4"  /></a>
<p>The terminal's Grand Concourse is noted for its 
ceiling constellations; they appear to be 
backwards, since they're based on an old-fashioned 
star globe that depicted the stars from the "outside." 

They look much better since the terminal's 1998 
renovation. The staircase here was inspired by the 
Paris Opera. 

<p>Fred Astaire sings here in <i>The Band Wagon</i>. Cary Grant 
buys a ticket at Window 15 in <i>North by Northwest</i>. 
Terry Gilliam filmed commuters here 
all breaking into a waltz in <i>The Fisher King</i>. 
Lex Luthor has his lair underneath the station in the 
<i>Superman</i> movie, as do the mutants in <i>Beneath the 
Planet of the Apes</i>.

<p>The terminal features many restaurants, including the 
famous <a href="http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,20676799-27985,00.html" target="_blank" title="Image/Info">
<b>Oyster Bar</b></a> with its vaulted ceiling. Outside the 
Oyster Bar is the 
<a name="42st"></a>
<a href="http://localoaf.org/tag/interesting/" target="_blank" title="Image">
Whispering Gallery</a>, an acoustical marvel 
that's featured in John Crowley's novel <i>Little, Big</i>.

<p>The 42nd Street facade features a <a href="http://www.bridgeandtunnelclub.com/bigmap/manhattan/midtown/gct/index.htm" target="_blank" title="Image">
massive sculpture</a> of Mercury flanked by Hercules and Minerva &mdash;
representing commerce, strength and wisdom.

David Bowie met Iggy Pop there; Debbie Harry was a

Union Square</a> was not named for the North 
or for labor, but for the fact this 
stretch of roadway can be construed 
to be part of both Broadway and what 
was once the Bowery, at that time 
Broadway's rival as NYC's main street.  
In the city plan of 1811, Broadway 
was supposed to be eliminated north of 14th Street, 
permanently uniting it with Fourth 
Avenue. Fortunately, NYC was unable 
to raise money to reroute Broadway, saving 
Manhattan from complete predictability.

<p>Union Square has a rich political history:  
250,000 gathered to support Union during the Civil War (1861), the largest crowd ever 
assembled in North America up to that point; 
the first U.S. labor day parade (1882); <a href="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Goldman/" target="_blank" title="Info">
Emma Goldman</a> 
arrested for telling unemployed to 
steal bread (1893); a funeral march for <a href="http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/" target="_blank" title="Info">
Triangle Shirtwaist Fire</a> victims (1911); 
protests against <a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/sacvan.html" target="_blank" title="Info">
Sacco & Vanzetti</a>'s execution 
(1927), and against the <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_STOR.HTM" target="_blank" title="Info">
Rosenbergs</a>' (1953). After the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, 
Union Square became a spontaneous center of grieving and peace 
vigils.

<p>The <a href="http://www.mcny.org/collections/abbott/a080.htm" target="_blank" title="Image">
statue of Lafayette</a> is by Bartholdi, 
sculptor of the Statue of Liberty; he made 
this statue to remind New York of 
Franco-American friendship as part of his 
campaign to raise money for Liberty's pedestal. 
The statue ought to be facing the statue of 
Washington, to whom he's offering his sword; 
as it is, he seems to be pledging his loyalty 
to a tree.

<h3>Washington Statue</h3>

<p>The 1856 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/275837089/" target="_blank" title="Image">
statue of George Washington</a> by Henry Kirke Brown
(assisted by John Quincy Ward) was formerly on the traffic 
island next to 4th Avenue, where it 
supposedly marked the actual spot where 
Washington greeted the citizens of New York when he 
liberated the city from British 
rule after the Revolutionary War, on November 25, 1783. 
Back then, though, the junction of Broadway and Bowery 
was probably closer to where the statue is now.

<p>The south end of the square in particular is one of 
Manhattan's great public spaces, a haven for political 
ranters, skateboarders and breakdancers--and for those 
who want to watch the passing scene. The Critical Mass 
bicycle rallies gather here on the last Friday of every month
--though police repression has taken much 
of the fun out of it. 
There's a craft fair here every year in December.

Apartments built on the site of (and named for) <b>A.T. Stewart's 
Cast-Iron Palace</b> (1862), the first large store 
on Ladies' Mile, of which it was the southern endpoint. 
Stewart, called "one of the meanest men that ever lived," died 
1876, and his body was kidnapped from St Marks' graveyard 
in 1878 and held for ransom; they were returned by parties 
unknown in 1881 in exchange for $20,000. The store was 
purchased by John Wanamaker in 1896, closed in 1954, 
and burned down in 1956 in an inferno that injured 208 firefighters.
<p>These apartments were home to Leon 
Klinghoffer, the man in a wheelchair 
on the <i>Achille Lauro</i> cruise ship 
who was shot and pushed overboard by 
Palestine Liberation Front terrorists, October 8, 1985.

Hotel flophouse, which was overhead. In December 1973 Hilly Kristal 
opened it under the acronym that stood for "Country

Gourmandizers."

<p>That was the kind of music the club intended 
to book, but a strange rock band called Television talked 
themselves into a gig, and later played a second show double-billed 
with The Ramones. In 1975, Patti Smith did four shows a 
week here for seven weeks. Later Blondie and Talking Heads 
got their starts here; the latter refer to the club in 
the song "Life During Wartime." I saw five people from my 
hometown of Libertyville, Illinois play here in something 
like seven different bands.

<p><b>Corner (11 E. 1st):</b> This 2007 development, associated with the 
larger Avalon Chrystie Place across Houston, spelled the 
destruction of two historic structures despite the 
strenuous efforts of neighborhood residents. (See below.) 
On the plus side, fears that construction would doom the 
adjacent Liz Christy Garden proved unfounded; the garden 
seems to be 
<a href="http://www.curbed.com/archives/2007/05/14/in_avalons_loving_shadow_liz_chrystie_garden_grows.php" target="_blank">

<p><b><i>295</i>:</b> Advertised itself as the roughest joint in 
town (1895-1902); working conditions were 
so horrific that at least five backroom girls 
killed themselves by drinking 
carbolic acid.  Later the Liberty Hotel. 
Torn down in 2005, after residents fought a losing battle to 
save the historic building from demolition.

<h3>Site of Volksgarten</h3>
<p><b><i>293-291</i>:</b> In the 19th Century, a gathering 
place for the German-American community that once dominated this 
neighborhood.  Later Wesley Hall, a notable Bowery 
mission, which was renamed <b>Hadley Hall</b> after Samuel Hadley, the 
Civil War vet who ran the mission for many years.  
A venue for labor meetings. For the past 40 years it has housed 
Stanton Trading, a restaurant supply company. It too was demolished 
in 2005--respresenting a failure of the Landmark 
Commission to preserve New York's historic buildings.

<p><b>Corner:</b> This beautiful sanctuary, is  
named for one of the founders of the Green Guerrillas, 
helped inspire the community garden movement in NYC when it was started in 1973. 
Features a rare dawn redwood and a turtle pond. Recently saved 
from being paved over for an unnecessary extension of 1st Street, 
it survived the construction of Avalon Bowery Place and actually 
got some funding from the developers to expand into unused space 
all the way to 2nd Avenue.

<p><b>50:</b> The <b>Atlantic Garden</b> opened here

52-54</b> as well. Herbert Asbury called it "the most famous

more than a thousand, and two four-horse drays, working ten hours 
a day, were scarely able to keep the customers supplied with fresh 
beer from the brewery." By 1927, it was a movie palace.

<h3>Site of Bulls Head Tavern</h3>
<p><b>46-48:</b> Here George

<p>Later, in 1826, the <b>Bowery Theater</b> opened 
on this site, the first gaslit theater. 
The first ballet performance in the U.S. 
took place here on February 7, 1827; 
<i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> had its U.S. debut 
here on June 16, 1879. A mob 
ransacked the theater on July 9, 1834, in search

supposedly made anti-American remarks. The theater 
burned down and was rebuilt several times.

<p><b>36:</b> The address of the <b>Branch Hotel</b>, 
home of 
<a href="http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/hyertom.shtml" target="_blank">
Tom Hyer</a>, considered the heavyweight 
champion of bare-knuckled boxing from 
1841-51, even though he only fought two bouts--
both of which he won. His 1849 fight against 
Yankee Sullivan was perhaps the most famous 
match of the 19th Century.  Afterwards, he ran 
the bar here. 
<p>That saloon was the 
headquarters of the Atlantic Guard, better known 
as the Bowery Boys (or B'hoys), a 
gang associated with the anti-immigrant Know Nothing Party. 
When the Dead Rabbits, a mainly Irish gang, attacked 
here on July 4, 1857, it sparked two days of bloody 
rioting. The Bowery Boys inspired the film 
<i>Gangs of New York</i>--as well as a series of 
<a href="http://users.arczip.com/fwdixon/BoweryBoys/#bb" target="_blank">
slapstick films</a> of the 1940s and '50s. 
<p><b>30 (corner):</b> Here was built c. 1826 the <b>North American 
Hotel</b>, which often hosted political events and was 
a hangout for the leading actors of its day. Later 
it was the Moss Hotel, latter the <b>New England Hotel</b>, a disreputable place 
where the composer 
<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~amerimus/foster.htm" target="_blank">
Stephen Foster</a>, in the 
throes of alcoholism, had a fatal accident 
on January 10, 1864. The composer of 
<a name="bayard"></a>
"Oh! Susanna," "Old Folks at Home" and 
"Beautiful Dreamer" died with 38 cents in 
his pocket. It was torn down in 1895 by the 
Third Avenue Railroad Company to make room 
for a cable car power station.

<p><b>18 (corner):</b> The oldest surviving

between 1785 and 1789--in Georgian mixed 
with foreshadowing of Federal style. In the 
1830s and '40s it housed a brothel. 
<p><b>16:</b> This address was the headquarters 
of the Hip Sing ("Prosperous Union") Tong, one of the two main 
criminal organizations in Chinatown, whose 
territory was Pell and Doyers streets. Founded by 
Mock Duck, a ruthless, ever-smiling killer noted for his 
technique of squatting in the street and shooting 
in all directions with his eyes closed. The term 
''hatchet man'' comes from the tongs' assassins 
habit of carrying hatchets in their sleeves. 
At the headquarters  
the gang's main hitman, Sing Dock aka "The 
Scientific Killer," was fatally shot by 
former protogee Yee Toy on March 12, 1911.
<p><b>12:</b> At this address, on December 
30, 1909, comedian 
Dop Doy Hong, aka Ah Hoon, was assassinated 
by members of the Four Brothers crime family, 
which apparently didn't like his act. The legend 
about his killers slipping past armed guards 
is apparently not true.

Yung Wing Public School, named for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yung_Wing"

<p>This 15-foot statue depicting the founder 
of the Chinese ethical system, by sculptor 
Liu Shih, was put up in 1976 by the Chinese 
Consolidated Benevolent Association, which 
until recently was sort of a private-sector 
local government for Chinatown. There was some 
controversy about honoring someone seen 
as a conservative cultural figure.

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. 
        Smith's Note: A pair of letters to the Editor printed, respectively, in 
        the 2 April and 16 April 1870 numbers of <u>The Field</u>. In 1870 Wallace 
        accepted a wager offered by a flat-earth proponent to prove that the earth 
        was not flat. This resulted in the famous Bedford Canal experiment, in 
        which Wallace used his surveying experience to show that the freely sitting 
        water surface was indeed rounded. Wallace won the wager, but not, on a 
        technicality, the five hundred pounds that had been put up, and was harassed 
        for fifteen years by the loser, one John Hampden. In these two letters, 
        Wallace disputes the interpretation of the results of the experiment given 
        by another flat-earther, William Carpenter, who had served as Mr. Hampden's 
        referee during the event. Original paginations indicated within double

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 305]]</font> Sir,--As 
        the experiments made by me at the Old Bedford River are elaborately criticised 
        by Mr Carpenter's report, may I be permitted to point out the fallacies 
        and misstatements with which it abounds, and which may perhaps confuse 
        and mislead some of your readers who are not very conversant with practical 
        geodesy.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Mr Carpenter defines a &quot;straight line&quot; in 
        a manner totally new, as being absolutely identical with a &quot;level line,&quot; 
        thus introducing at the outset confusion of terms, and rendering all clear 
        reasoning impossible. It is an abuse of the English language to confine 
        the general term &quot;straight line&quot; to the one special meaning of a &quot;level 
        or horizontal straight line.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Mr Carpenter objects to the value of the view 
        in the large telescope, &quot;because it showed but two points, when a comparison 
        had to be instituted between three;&quot; but he omits to state that the telescope 
        itself was placed accurately at the third point, just as was the spirit-level 
        telescope--to the view shown by which he makes no such objection.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. He objects that the telescope was not levelled, 
        and goes into a long argument, in which the words &quot;straight line&quot; occur 
        four times, and which, whatever meaning is given to that term, is utterly 
        confused and misleading. He says that I intended to prove that the central 
        signal was five feet above a &quot;straight line&quot; joining the two extreme points. 
        This I both intended to prove and did prove, using the word &quot;straight 
        line&quot; in its proper sense; but Mr Carpenter should not impute to me the 
        absurd mistake he makes himself of thinking that there is, or is supposed 
        to be, a <em>rise</em> above the level at the centre point.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Mr Carpenter's &quot;argument&quot; exhibits a total 
        ignorance of the use of the spirit level, and of the simplest principles 
        of optics and geometry. We have three points taken, at equal distances, 
        above what Mr C. maintains to be a true horizontal straight line--the 
        surface of standing water. The eye is placed at one of the extreme points, 
        and, looking at the other two points, they do not coincide, as they must 
        do if in a straight line with the eye. Again, the cross hair in the telescope 
        of the spirit level marks the direction of &quot;the straight line at right 
        angles to the plumb line at the point of observation&quot; (as Mr C. very accurately 
        defines the true level); and as the middle signal appeared considerably 
        below this line, that alone proved that the water surface was not truly 
        level. The distant signal being apparently as much below the middle signal 
        as that was below the cross hair, is absolutely inconsistent with the 
        three being in any straight line, still less with their being in the Carpenterian 
        &quot;straight line,&quot; but is perfectly consistent with the three being points 
        in a circle of about the assumed radius of the earth. This is a question 
        of elementary geometry about which there can be no dispute. I may add 
        that the fact of the apparent &quot;equality &quot; of these distances (so dwelt 
        upon by Mr C. in his &quot;argument&quot;), and the views from both extremities 
        of the six miles agreeing so closely, both prove the very great accuracy 
        of the level used, and that it may be depended on to show that the surface 
        of water does really sink below the true level line in a continually increasing 
        degree as the distance is greater; but the proof of convexity in no way 
        depends on this accuracy, as it was shown still better by the large telescope 
        without a spirit level.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Mr Carpenter's objection No. 3 is answered 
        above. No. 4 is an entire delusion. No. 5 is an assertion destitute of 
        proof. Nos. 6 and 7 are verbal quibbles with which I have nothing to do. 
        Nos. 8, 9, and 10 rest on the fallacy of there being a &quot;rise&quot; shown by 
        the observations, which is a pure figment of Mr C.'s brain. I have never 
        used the word &quot;rise&quot; in connection with these experiments, and all the 
        observations go to show, not a <em>rise</em>, but different degrees of 
        <em>depression</em> below the true level line. Nos. 11, 12, and 13 are 
        misconceptions. The curvature shown by the large telescope, according 
        to the diagram, is about 5 1/2 ft. at the middle signal, three miles distant--equal 
        to 11 ft. if measured at the distant signal; and the depression below 
        the cross hair or true level line, being, according to Mr Carpenter, an 
        equal amount, makes 22 ft. in all, leaving less than 2 ft. for refraction 
        to bring it to the full theoretical amount, which is something less than 
        24 ft.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I beg to state that I rely on 
        the three views as shown by the diagrams, which substantially agree, and 
        which demonstrate that the three points equidistant from the surface of 
        water were not in a straight line, but deviated in a vertical direction 
        very nearly as much as is required by the assumed dimensions of the earth; 
        and I challenge Mr Carpenter to place three objects at equal distances 
        apart in a true straight line (three oranges on the parapet of Waterloo-bridge, 
        for instance), and then with a telescope at either end, in the place of 
        one object, make the centre object appear considerably raised above the 
        distant one. Till he can do that, all his wordy argumentation is utterly 
        valueless.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 
        317]]</font> Sir,--I should hardly have thought it worth while to answer 
        Mr Carpenter's letter in your last had you not invited me to do so, as 
        the question of my verbal accuracy is one quite beside the main Issue.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Carpenter's 
        &quot;Objections,&quot; 8, 9, and 10 (see <em>Field</em>, March 26), he speaks of 
        there being &quot;a rise&quot; shown from the point of observation to the central 
        signal, and argues that, if so, the point of observation must be in a 
        depression or &quot;circular concavity.&quot; Here then &quot;a rise&quot; is used in the 
        surveyor's sense of &quot;rise above the level of the point of observation,&quot; 
        and I replied that I had not used the word &quot;rise&quot; (of course meaning in 
        the same sense) in connection with these experiments. It is, therefore, 
        quite beside the question for Mr Carpenter to quote me as saying that 
        the middle signal would be seen &quot;rising&quot; above the others. His own diagrams 
        show that it did so; but at the same time it &quot;fell&quot; below the point of 
        observation (as every surveyor will tell him) by its being seen below 
        the cross hair in the level telescope, allowing of course for the inverted 
        image.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallacies in 
        the remainder of Mr Carpenter's letter have been so ably refuted (by anticipation) 
        by your correspondent Mr J. Tanner, that I need say no more about them. 
        I would ask Mr Carpenter, however, to state, for the information of your 
        readers, whether the universally-accepted and only known method of deciding 
        whether three distant points are in a straight line is true or false. 
        That method is to place the eye (whether aided by a telescope or not) 
        at or behind one of the extreme points, and see whether the other two 
        or all three coincide, the nearer hiding or covering the more distant. 
        If so, they are in a straight line. Every carpenter who looks along the 
        edge of a floor board, every surveyor who runs his base lines across the 
        country, every builder who sets out a long wall, uses this method. Does 
        Mr Carpenter say they are all wrong, and that every line thus set out 
        is a crooked or curved line? If so, let him prove this elementary point 
        by experiment and diagrams, and thus found a totally new and hitherto 
        unimagined geometry. If, on the contrary he admits that lines so set out 
        are straight, then the middle and end signal which did not so coincide 
        when seen from the other end signal could not be in a straight line, or 
        there would be two diverging straight lines terminating in the same points, 
        and inclosing a space!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr C. has confounded 
        actual with apparent equi-distance in the field of view of a telescope, 
        between which there is no connection, as Mr Tanner's diagrams show. If 
        Mr Carpenter will not try any such simple experiment as I proposed in 
        my last, I must decline to spend any more time in refuting arguments founded 
        on total ignorance alike of facts and of geometrical principles.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;men of common 
        sense&quot; to whom Mr C. so confidently appeals are very slow in coming forward. 
        The solitary individual he so triumphantly quotes against me (Mr Westlake) 
        now confesses to an oversight, and cruelly deserts him. Mr Hampden, in 
        his letter to me, continually appeals to &quot;public opinion&quot; as being against 
        the fairness of your verdict. It has, however, now clearly spoken through 
        your widely-circulated columns, and, unless he can prove that letters 
        on the other side have been refused insertion, he would do well, as a 
        man of honour and of sense, to bow to its decision.</p>

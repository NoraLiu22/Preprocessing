The recent Afrobarometer Survey of Botswana has produced some
very interesting data. This survey, conducted in May-June 2005,
surveyed a sample designed to be nationally representative. For
example, it was geographically representative, being based on the
Census Enumeration Districts.</p>

<p>In the following figures and tables, note that because numbers
have been rounded to whole numbers, totals will not necessarily
always add up to 100%, and similar small apparent anomalies may
occur.</p>

<p>One should begin by noting that 
Batswana are cautious people. Asked "Generally speaking, would
you say that most people can be trusted or that you must be very
careful in dealing with people?", 94% said "You must be very
careful" and only 6% "Most people can be trusted". Interestingly,
urban people were more trusting than rural people, by 8% to 5%.
(Table 83.) 38% trust their relatives "a lot" but 20% trust them
"not at all". (Table 84a.). "People have to be careful of what 
they say about politics" (see below), and about half those surveyed 
thought that the survey was being done by the Government (table 100);
so perhaps a little caution
is in order about some of the answers. Nevertheless, this survey is a
treasure trove of information, and deserves to be read with close
attention. I am not going to attempt a general summary; I am simply
going to summarize some of the findings that particularly interested
me. I urge readers to download and read the full report.
I may add more comments later.</p>

<h2>Language and Ethnicity</h2>

<p>The survey included questions on  sensitive
topics such as language and ethnicity. For readers unfamiliar with
Botswana, note that most of the answers have been given in a Setswana-prefixed
form; thus Kalanga, or Ikalanga, is given as SeKalanga (Se- being the
prefix normally used for languages in Setswana). [See our page on
<a href="../plnam.htm">place names and historical terms</a> 
for a basic explanation of Setswana
noun classes which will hopefully make things clearer.]</p>

<p>The
results show that Setswana is dominant as a home language,
possibly having displaced other languages significantly during
the twentieth century:</p>

<p>The distribution shows that Setswana is dominant in urban

A total of 86% speak Sotho-Tswana languages (Setswana 79%, 
Sekgalagadi 4%, Sebirwa 2%, Sengologa 1%.)</p>

<p>The related Q. 79 asked "What is your tribe? You know, your ethnic 
or cultural group?" Again, readers unfamiliar with this part of the world
should note that the answers all have the Setswana
Mo- prefix.</p>

<p class="acite">Afrobarometer Table 79.</p>

<p>For readers unfamiliar with Botswana history, perhaps I should say
something here about the problematic nature of the term "tribe" in Botswana.
When the British took over the territory, they took over a cluster of
kingdoms, all of which were ruled by Tswana <i>dikgosi</i> but which varied
in their composition. In he south-east the population was mainly Tswana,
but to the north and west it was much more mixed. Under British rule these 
states became Reserves, in which the <i>dikgosi</i> were Paramount Chiefs.
The point is, though, that the "Batawana Tribe" 
[Bat<b><big><font color="red">a</font></big></b>wana, not 
Bat<b><big><font color="red">s</font></big></b>wana] of the North-West was a <i>political</i> entity, in which
the Batawana, as an ethnic group, were a minority. Most members of the "Tribe"
spoke other languages. A "tribe" was multi-ethnic. Hence Isaac Schapera's
famous study <i>The Ethnic Composition of Tswana Tribes</i> (1952),
which sounds like a paradox to those who think of a tribe as meaning
an ethnicity.
Within a "tribe" such as the Bangwato (then more usually called Bamangwato)
there were not only the core Ngwato group, whose totem was <i>phuti</i>, but other
Tswana groups such as BaKaa, less closely related Sotho-Tswana groups such
as BaBirwa, and non-Sotho-Tswana such as Kalanga.</p>

<p>Since independence and the decline in the power of <i>dikgosi</i>, 
however, "tribe" has tended to be understood in the sense of "ethnic group",
and the question seems to make this sense explicit by
referring to "your <i>ethnic or cultural</i> group".</p>

<p>Comparison with Schapera's analysis of the 1942 census is not entirely
straightforward. I have some tentative ideas, but will write more on this later.</p>


<p>Taking the Afrobarometer results, we can group the numbers thus:</p>

<ul class="x1">
<li class="xx1">The eight traditional "major tribes": the BaKwena, the 
BaNgwaketse, the BaNgwato, the BaKgatla and the BaTawana,
the BaRolong, the BaTlokwa and the BaLete. These were the
<i>merafe</i> whose chiefs had Paramount Chief status under colonial
rule and had direct membership in the House of Chiefs according
to the Independence Constitution.
Total 50%.</li>

<li class="xx1">Other Tswana <i>merafe</i>: Bahurutshe, Bakhurutshe.
6%. Taken with the other <i>merafe</i>, this gives total Tswana, 56%.</li>

<li class="xx1">Other Sotho-Tswana: 
    <ul>
    <li>BaBirwa: 4%</li>
    <li>Batswapong: 7%</li>
    <li>BaKgalagari: 7%</li>
    </ul>
Total: 18%.  (Combined with the Tswana total, this gives a total 
figure for all Sotho-Tswana of 74%.)
</li>

<li class="xx1">Kalanga: 15%</li>

<li class="xx1">Hambukushu : 2%</li>
<li class="xx1">WaYei: 2%</li>

<li class="xx1">Basarwa: 2%</li>
<li>"Motswana only", etc: 4%</li>

</ul>

<p>We thus have three large categories, and "other" :</p>

<table summary="Major ethnic/language groups in Botswana"
cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1"
style="border: solid medium #00ff00">
<tr>
<td>Tswana:</td><td align="right">56%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other Sotho-Tswana:</td><td align="right">18%</td>

<tr>
<td>Kalanga</td><td align="right">15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFF8DC">Other responses:</td><td  align="right"bgcolor="#FFF8DC">10%</td>
</tr>
</table>




<p>The proportions shown in the survey for the various groups
among the "Other responses" may not be reliable as the numbers
are too small in relation to the survey, so I will just leave them
as "Other responses" in this grouping.
(It is interesting to note that
although the survey found 1% speaking Herero and 1% speaking
Sesobea, neither "MoHerero" nor "Mosobea" show up as ethnic
identities. Perhaps they are among the 
4% who answered "Motswana only, or 
doesn't think of self in those terms".)
Grouped as above, the proportions are 
shown in the following pie chart:</p>

<img src="ethnic-chart-1.jpg" alt="Botswana ethnic identities"
border="3" vspace="3" hspace="3">
<p><small><small><font face="arial, sans-serif">(Chart produced using OpenOffice 1.1.4)</font></small></small></p>


<p>It is notable that Bangwato are the most urban ethnicity. Groups 
such as BaKgalagari and Basarwa are mainly rural. The survey indicates
that this is also true of Hambukushu, but not of WaYei, but the 
sample is too small to be confident of these results.</p>

<p>I expect that there will be debate over the reliability and interpretation
of these results. Comments are welcomed!</p>

<h2>Politics and public affairs</h2>

<p>73% of Batswana are interested in public affairs, indeed 44% are "very
interested". The level of interest is roughly the same between
town and country. (Table 16) But as a topic of conversation, 38%
never discuss politics and 39% discuss it occasionally. Only 23%
discuss it frequently. (Table 17.) This may reflect a lack of
confidence: 65% agreed that "Politics and government sometimes
seem so complicated that you can't really understand
what's going on" while only 21% disagreed (Table 18a.).</p>

<p>Radio, television and newspapers are all significant sources
of news. Radio remains dominant: 44% listen every day, and
another 32% listen a few times a week, making 76% frequent
listeners. Newspapers seem to be read on an intermittent basis:
23% read a newspaper every day, but another 26% read one "a few
times a week" (thus 49% per week) and another 14% "a few times a
month". Perhaps the most striking result is the degree to which
television news has already become an important source.</p>

<p>36% of the population own TV sets, 51% in urban areas and 24%
in rural areas (table 93c.) In many places, people will
congregate to watch news reports, so television news reaches a
wider group than those who actually own TV sets. BTV (state-owned
public terrestrial television) now covers most of the country,
and broadcasts news in Setswana and English. It should also be
noted that after local programmes finish BTV transmits the BBC
World news channel, so anyone with BTV will have access to this,
albeit at a late hour. Satellite TV is also relatively
widespread.</p>

<p>The report indicates that ordinary people experience low levels
of corruption, a finding which was understandably given prominence
in local media reports of the Afrobarometer report's release.
Questions on party support show that the ruling BDP (Botswana 
Democratic Party) retained its clear lead at the time the survey
was taken. Omitting the parties whose support did not show
up at all, the results were:</p>

<p>This indicates that, as was already known, the BDP is relatively 
stronger in rural areas and among women. The extent of the gender
gap is perhaps surprising: there are three male BNF voters
for every two female.</p>

<p>Despite this high level of general support for the government,
there is questioning of some policies.
Some questions attempted to probe attitudes to the trend of
government policy. Most (55%) agreed that it was necessary to
suffer some hardships now for future benefits, 41% thought the
price too high. However it was thought that the policies had not
brought results yet: 60% agreed that "The government's
economic policies have hurt most people and only benefited a
few.", only 32% thought most had benefited. (Table 11).</p>

<p>There was strong opposition to the re-introduction of school
fees. The survey posed the question in a form which gave maximum
weight to the claims of school fees:</p>

<p>Which of the following statements is closest to your view?
Choose Statement A or Statement B.</p>

<ul>
<li>A. It is better to have free schooling for our children, even
if the quality of education is low.</li>
<li>B. It is better to raise educational standards, even if we
have to pay school fees.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Table 10).</p>

<p>Even confronted with the question in this form, which might be
regarded as a false dichotomy, those surveyed refused to endorse
school fees. (57% for free schooling, 33% for fees.) Opposition
is stronger in rural than urban areas, but interestingly there
seems no significant difference between male and female
opinion.</p>

<p>Batswana endorse liberal democratic values. Equal rights for
women, free speech, and the rule of law are all supported. 72%
agreed that "The President must always obey the laws and the
courts, even if he thinks they are wrong"; only 23% agreed that
"Since the President was elected to lead the country, he should
not be bound by laws or court decisions that he thinks are
wrong." (Table 41). The consistency of these answers is
interesting and suggests that Botswana's liberal-democratic
culture has broad support. However Batswana do not seem entirely
confident that they can rely on these values being implemented in
practice at the day-to-day level. A significant minority (33%)
believe that unequal treatment under the law is common (table
53d.) 53% say that "people have to be careful of what they say
about politics". (table 53a.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Batswana regard their system as a successful
democracy: only 4% thought the last elections were not free and
fair (table 45). Botswana was classed as "a full democracy" or "a
democracy with minor problems" by 73%, and as "a democracy with
major problems" by 13%. Only 3% thought it was not a democracy.
(Table 46). However, problems were evidently seen ahead: 43%
thought that "If our present system cannot produce results soon
we should try another form of government" (table 42). 
A sign of this willingness to innovate may be seen in 
the apparent preference for direct election of the President over the
present system (63% to 33%; Table 89BOT.)

on religious statistics</a>

<h2>Religion</h2>

<p>The figures on religion are interesting because for a long
time statements about Botswana's religious makeup have been very
sketchily based. The survey results, reproduced below (table 91)
show that Batswana overwhelmingly identify as Christian. The
figure for Islam (below one percent) seems too low, and is
perhaps a result of the concentration of small groups and the way
the survey worked - I will leave this to the statisticians.</p>

<p>The first problem with the figures is how to interpret the
27% who describe themselves as "Christian (general)". Comparison
with attendance figures suggests that this may represent partly
the believers who are not very formally affiliated to particular
churches. But they could also include people who are active 
church-goers but think "Christian" is the appropriate answer to
the question"What is your religion, if any?" (Table 91). This
interpretation is supported by a comparison with the Afrobarometer
survey for South Africa released at the same time. There, the total
for African Independent Churches was 4% and "Christian (general)"
scored 57% (table 91, SA report). But 45% are active members of churches 
or mosques (Table 28a, SA report) and 24% inactive members (ibid.),
a total of 69% being members, so clearly it is not a marker of 
inactivity. Probably it is to do with the fact that in South Africa
Islam and Hinduism are much more prominent, and so "Christian" seems 
a relevant answer. In Botswana, where other religions are less prominent,
a denominational answer seems more relevant to most, but probably an
answer at the level of a religion seems relevant to a significant number
of people. </p>

<p>In Botswana the survey shows more people identifying as 
adherents of the African Independent Churches than of the 
mainline churches. However, it is unclear which group is actually
larger due to the large number (27%) who answered simply "Christian"
(see above). If these are not evenly distributed between the two
it could alter the result.</p> 

<p>If this reservation is set aside, however,
the African Independent Churches are clearly the largest
group, with 21%. Even if "Protestant (Evangelical/Pentecostal)" 
and "Seventh Day Adventist" are added to
"Catholic" and "Protestant (Mainstream)" to constitute an "Other
Churches" category, they only add up to 17%. 
It would be interesting to see further research into
the relative size of particular AICs: in view of their
importance, they clearly need to be disaggregated, and 
analysed more particularly, like the "mainstream" churches.</p>

<p> Comparison
with figures for church attendance suggests a picture of Botswana
Christians something
like the following: at one end of the spectrum an active 
membership with a clear church affiliation, at the other believers
who do not attend services and lack affiliation, and in the middle
people whose attendance is less frequent and whose level of
identification with a specific church will vary (some will clearly 
be "inactive members" but evidently some do not feel they qualify).</p>

<p>It is interesting that while 28% say they have "No religion",
very few accept terms such as "Atheist".</p>

<p>Traditional Religion, identified as such and practised as an
alternative to Christianity, is claimed by only 5%. This
presumably includes the Mwali Cult. However, it would be a
mistake to think that traditional religious ideas are limited to
5% of the population.</p>

<p>Attendance weekly or more is 43%, which probably equates to
the "active membership". Attendance once a month or every few
months is 19%, matching the "inactive membership" but probably
overlapping a category of non-members who attend
occasionally.</p>

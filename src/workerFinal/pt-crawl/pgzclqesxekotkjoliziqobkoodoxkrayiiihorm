Not familiar creatures to most people, hemichordates form a small phylum
(only a few hundred species). Their importance for the study of 
vertebrate evolution, however, cannot be underestimated. The fossil
record of one group of hemichordates, the graptolites, is very well
known and is often used to correlate rocks.
<P>
Hemichordates are distinguished by a <b>tripartite</b> (threefold) 
division of the body. At the forward end of the body is a <b>preoral
lobe</b>, behind this is a collar, and last comes a <b>trunk</b>. The
name "hemichordate" means "half chordate," and hemichordates share some
(but not all) of the typical
<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/chordata/chordatamm.html>chordate
characteristics</a>. There are <b>branchial openings</b>, or "gill
slits," that open into the pharynx; there is a rudimentary structure
in the collar region, the <b>stomochord</b>, that is similar to a
<b>notochord</b>; and there is a dorsal nerve cord, in addition to
a smaller ventral nerve cord. However, hemichordates are not classified
as true chordates, although they are quite closely related. Some
DNA-based studies of evolution suggest that hemichordates are actually
closer to
<a href=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/echinodermata/echinodermata.html>echinoderms</a>
than to true chordates. This is supported by the fact that the larvae of
at least some hemichordates look very much like those of some echinoderms.

<P>
Of the three classes of hemichordates, the most familiar living ones
are the <b>Enteropneusta</b>, the acorn worms. One is pictured at the
top right of the page. The triple division of the body is obvious. Acorn worms
also have multiple branchial openings, as many as 200 in some species. 
They are slow burrowers, using the proboscis to burrow through sediment,
and may either <b>deposit feed</b> (consume sediment and digest the
organic matter, rather like earthworms in soil) or <b>suspension feed</b>
(collect suspended particles from the water). Some of these worms may be
very large; one species may reach a length of 2.5 meters (almost eight feet),
although most are much smaller.
<P>
The second living class is the
<b>Pterobranchia</b>, an obscure group with only about 20 living species.
Pterobranchs as very different from acorn worms; they form colonies in
which the individuals are interconnected by stems, or <b>stolons</b>.
Individuals, or <b>zooids</b>, are often less than 1 millimeter long.
The proboscis is not elongated, as it is in acorn worms, but shield-shaped.
The second division of the body bears a pair of branched tentacles that
collect small food particles from the water. There is only one branchial
opening. Most strikingly, almost all pterobranch species create and live
within a network of tubes, the <b>coenecium</b>. These tubes are made up of
the protein collagen, secreted by special glands in the proboscis.
Yet similar larvae and a similar tripartite body plan unite the
enteropneusts and pterobranchs. This diagram shows a colony of pterobranchs
in the genus <i>Rhabdopleura</i>.

What is now considered a third class of hemichordates, the <b>Graptolithina</b>
or graptolites, has a checkered history. Graptolites are common fossils in
<a href="/ordovician/ordovician.html">Ordovician</a> and <a href="/silurian/silurian.html">Silurian</a> rocks, but for a long time no one was sure what
kind of animals they were. Most fossil graptolites look like nothing so much
as tiny sawblades. However, well-preserved graptolites can be seen to be
tubular in cross-section, with the "teeth of the saw" formed by short
open branches from the main tube. Careful study of the microscopic structure
of the tubes of graptolites showed that they are very similar to the
tubes of pterobranchs.

Unlike their pterobranch kin, which typically live encrusting rocks and
shells, most graptolites are thought to have been planktonic, floating or
slowly sinking through the water. The spiral shape of some was probably
an adaptation to slow sinking. Other graptolites may have been connected
to gas-filled sacs, keeping them buoyant.

			<p class="MsoNormal">The reproductive cycle of <i>Bombus 
			pensylvanicus</i> is the same as other species of bumblebee.<span>&nbsp;
			</span>Bumblebees produce my means of haplodiploidy, which means the 
			female bees can produce eggs without mating.<span>&nbsp; </span>
			Fertilized eggs can become either queen bees or female workers, and 
			unfertilized eggs become males (Discover Life 2013).<span>&nbsp;
			</span>

			<p class="MsoNormal">The cycle begins at the end of summer when a 
			newly hatched queen bee mates with a male.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
			<span lang="en-us">fertilized queen bee</span> then enters 
			hibernation until spring 
			of the following year.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once conditions are right 
			the queen arises and begins a search for a nest, usually in March (Tranji 
			1996).<span>&nbsp; </span>The Queen bee begins her colony after the 
			nest is found and she has gathered nectar and pollen, which is used 
			to build the wax pot and a source of nutrition; the pollen 
			stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs; these eggs are fertilized 
			from the previous year and will develop into female workers. The
			<span lang="en-us">Queen keeps the</span> eggs warm<span lang="en-us"> 
			through</span> the beginning stages of development<span lang="en-us"> 
			with the</span> use of her pubescence.<span>&nbsp;</span>The eggs 
			then begin their life cycle beginning with the larval stage, pupae, 
			and finally adult female workers, who tend to the nest<span lang="en-us">, 
			as well as</span> the eggs the<span lang="en-us"> Queen</span> continues to lay. It is approximately four to five weeks 
			from egg to adult bee (Bumblebee 2013).<span>&nbsp; </span>The first 
			workers to emerge are small in comparison to those that will hatch 
			and begin their life cycle towards the middle of summer.<span>&nbsp;
			</span>These workers forage and contribute to the increase in size 
			of the colony by providing resources for growth (Tranji 1996).<span>&nbsp;
			</span>By late summer there can be over 200 worker bees.<span>&nbsp;
			</span>By this time the queen bee has stopped producing a chemical<span lang="en-us">, 
			that has been produced throughout the life of the colony,</span> which inhibits the ovarian production of the female 
			workers and causes the Queen to lay worker females instead of 
			queens.<span>&nbsp; </span>When this chemical ceases, the Queen bee 
			lays a batch of eggs that will themselves become queen b<span lang="en-us">ees; 
			she also begins to produce male eggs.</span><span>&nbsp;
			</span>This stage marks a change in the dynamic of the nest.<span>&nbsp;
			</span>Some female workers are now able to lay their own eggs and do 
			so despite the Queen&#8217;s attempts to destroy them.<span>&nbsp; </span>
			The animosity and tension continue through late summer until 
			finally the workers revolt and sting the queen bee to death.<span>&nbsp;
			<span lang="en-us">The </span>
			</span>workers will<span lang="en-us"> not</span> survive winter,<span lang="en-us"> 
			but</span> the batch of 
			queen bee eggs the Queen herself laid have hatched<span lang="en-us">,</span> pupated<span lang="en-us">,</span> and left 
			the nest to mate, hibernate through the winter<span lang="en-us">,</span> and begin the cycle 
			again <span lang="en-us">(BBC 2013)</span>.<o:p></o:p></p>

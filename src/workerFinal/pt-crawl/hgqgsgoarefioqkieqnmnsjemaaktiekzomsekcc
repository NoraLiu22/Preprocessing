        I really love this album, and it has a special place in my heart, especially Devil Town, Meteor Shower, and We’re Alive. This album is really nice, and it’s incredible for it being one of his first albums. Thanks, Robbie, for making such an awesome album! :)

                    <div>i’ve got miles of regrets and confusing friends
but perhaps it’s just my stupid head in the end
thinking should i wait here or make my way home
you said go

making up problems that don’t exist
why do i let myself dream like this
we’re floating away, my body’s in space
we are going home     

Missing pieces of my skull
I’ll sew on patches of my own soul
There’s nothing you or I can do so let the stars fall
Cause from up here the sky’s my thoughts and we’re all so small

Meteor shower, Quick take cover
But the hues in our hair compliment one another
I’d sell my own bones for sapphire stones
Cause blue’s your favourite colour

My heart and the earth share the same rule
It starts with Love and it ends with U
But don’t go outside, it’s dangerous tonight
Without me right here by your side 

Take it slow, you’ll know
which way to go
Sew up your skull
take your time
and we’ll be just fine</div>

Sticks and stones they say but we dont have bones inside our brains
if bones are the walls between you and I then I feel pretty tempted
to beat myself with sticks and stones anyway
I got a ray gun in my bag a treasure map under my hat

to miss the point, which is just listen

I won&#39;t fear, no I won&#39;t

Falling down like angels fighting
Stars and lightening hold me tightly
Hold me tightly

Close your blinds tonight
They&#39;ll soften and disperse the light and
If you&#39;re lucky a car might drive by
And the headlights fill your ceiling with shooting stars
Works of art
Waiting for your arms to part
And welcome in my beating heart
Badum, badum, badum, badum

Falling down like angels fighting
Stars and lightening hold me tightly

Hold me tightly</div>

i hope you’re alright
i didn’t wanna wake up last night
cause i quite liked the dream i had of holding your hand
it’s funny how slowly time goes when my thoughts have been racing all this time
 
it’s alright to feel a little bit of darkness now and then
i know i’ve said it once but i still tell myself again and again
you’ll never be enough, but what is enough, you’re selfless
isn’t that enough 

banana bread  before i go to bed will put the bees to sleep
otherwise they’d buzz and sting my lungs all night inside of me 
just wait a little while, u don’t cry too much
u know that when u smile, the sun shines more gently</div>

Chorus: Am, F, C, G

Life&#39;s alright in devil town
They&#39;re right, no one&#39;s gonna catch us now
Dad has bought a new car now
We&#39;re fine, no one&#39;s gonna catch us now

You said something dumb again
She&#39;s mad, at least that&#39;s what they say
Mum and daddy aren&#39;t in love
That&#39;s fine, I&#39;ll settle for two birthdays

Devil town is colder in the summertime
I&#39;ll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we&#39;ll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But i feel a little safer when I&#39;m with you
Falling doesn&#39;t feel so bad when I know you&#39;ve fallen this way too

We&#39;re all dead in devil town
That&#39;s fine, cause nothing&#39;s gonna scare us now
We&#39;re all in our dressing gowns, mine&#39;s white
and stripy yours is green and brown

I forgot my name again
I think that&#39;s something worth remembering
Spiders in your favourite shoes
Just leave them be cause they&#39;re more scared of you

Devil town is colder in the summertime
I&#39;ll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we&#39;ll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But i feel a little safer when I&#39;m with you
Falling doesn&#39;t feel so bad when I know you&#39;ve fallen this way too</div>

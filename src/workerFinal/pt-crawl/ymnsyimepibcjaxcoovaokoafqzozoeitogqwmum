                       Solnhofen Limestone ranks as one of the most most famous <a href="../../fossilrecord/Lagerstatte.htm">Lagerstatte</a> 
                  in the world. This fossil site in the state of Bavaria in Germany
                  has yielded an amazing diversity of fossil organisms, often
                  deposits known for the exceptional preservation of fossilized
                  organisms, where the soft parts are often preserved (a Konservat-Lagerst&auml;tte),
                  provides a snapshot of Jurassic life
                  155 million years ago. The most famous are the eight fossils
                  of the first bird known in detail, <a href="../../fossilpictures-wpd/Archaeopteryx/Archaeopteryx.htm">Archaeopteryx</a>.
                   The first Archaeopteryx fossil was discovered in 1860, a single
                  
                  feather. The next year a very complete example was found and
                   sold to the British Museum. The next specimen was discovered
                  
                  sixteen years later, and is known as the Berlin specimen. It
                   is considered by some to be the most valuable fossil in the
                  
                  world today. With its combination of characteristics of reptile-like
                   teeth and tail with the feathers of a bird, it was a quintessential
                  
                  missing link that supporters of Charles Darwin could refer
                  to  as proof of the theory of evolution. In the subsequent
                  140 plus 
                  years since the first bird was found, only six more have been
                   added to the handfull of examples.</FONT></font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  discovery of the wonderful <a href="../Solnhofen-Fossils.htm">fossils
                  of Solnhofen</a> may be attributed 
                  to the longtime uses to which the &quot;plattenkalk&quot; has 
                  been used. This is a German word that seems more appropriate 
                  than the English &quot;platy limestone&quot;. Plattenkalk was 
                  used as early as the Stone Age for making drawings and colored 
                  murals due to its softness. The flat, regularly shaped material 
                  was suitable for paving roads and building walls, something 
                  done by the ancient Romans <a href="Protolindenia-Dragonfly/Protolindenia.htm"><img src="Protolindenia-Dragonfly/Protolindenia-188.jpg" alt="Draganfly fossil Solnhofen" width="188" height="141" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="left"></a>who 
                  for a time held sway over the region. In the Middle Ages, the 
                  stone was used as floor and roofing material. The mosaic floor 
                  of the church of Hagia Sofia in Istanbul was made of limestone 
                  from the region. Artisans also used the material in the making 
                  of bas-relief sculptures and headstones. A decisive turning 
                  point in the history of the area was the discovery in 1673 by 
                  Alois Senefelder that the fine-grained material could be employed 
                  in lithography, a use that caused quarrying to skyrocket. Although 
                  the heyday of lithography only lasted a hundred years or so, 
                  it was the single most important impetus in the discovery of 
                  fossils.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  fossils have always been prized by local residents because of 
                  their beauty. As those most intimately associated<a href="Aeger-shrimp/aegerfossil.htm"><img src="Aeger-shrimp/Aeger-188.jpg" alt="Solnhofen fossil shrimp" width="188" height="141" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="right"></a> 
                  with the limestone, the quarrymen were obviously those who were 
                  responsible for their discovery. At first, quarry owners allowed 
                  the workers to keep the fossils they found, but as interest 
                  in them (and consequently, value) grew, this practice stopped. 
                  The variety and number of fossils known is deceptive. The occurrence 
                  of fossils is quite low. Indeed, a worker can quarry for an 
                  entire day and find not a single one. The hundreds of years 
                  of quarrying are what make them seem so apparently common.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  sheets of limestone are so regular that we can only conclude 
                  that they were deposited in a calm environment. The deposits 
                  were evidently laid down under a stable body of water that had 
                  some connection to the Tethys Sea. Sponges and corals grew on 
                  rises in this sea, forming lagoons. In fact, remnants of a coral 
                  reef can be found in the area to the south of Solnhofen. The 
                  region must have been near land, however, due to the discovery 
                  of insects such as wonderfully-preserved dragonflies. Assuming 
                  that Jurassic coral reefs grew in modes similar to those of 
                  today, the surface of the reefs would have been only 10 meters 
                  or so under water. The maximum depth has been estimated by some 
                  to have been 60 meters (200 feet).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="Propygolampis-Phasmida/insectfossil-25.htm"><img src="Propygolampis-Phasmida/Propygolampis-188.jpg" alt="Solnhofen Phasmida Insect Fossil Propygolampis" width="188" height="141" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="left"></a>These 
                  isolated lagoons would have been quite stagnant due to little 
                  exchange of water with the sea. Anoxic conditions would have 
                  been ideal for preventing destruction of organisms that found 
                  their way into the lagoons. Some evidently survived for short 
                  periods. One of the most famous examples of this are the horseshoe 
                  crab &quot;death spirals' that exist in which a spiral trackway 
                  has been preserved with the defunct arthropod in the center, 
                  presumably preserving its last efforts at survival. The theory 
                  most often proposed for the toxicity of the waters has been 
                  that of hypersalinity, the excessive concentration of salt. 
                  If the area were hot and dry, with little runoff from the land 
                  to the north, conditions would have been ideal for promoting 
                  excessive evaporation of water with concomitant increase in 
                  the salinity in the lagoons. The dense brine would collect in 
                  the bottom of the pools, excluding most life, as sensitivity 
                  to even minute changes in density has been seen in many marine 
                  organisms. Once an organism had been washed into the lagoon 
                  by the action of a storm, it would quickly succumb to the toxic 
                  conditions that existed within. The hypersaline, anoxic floor 
                  was ideal for the preservation of the body, often even leaving 
                  evidence of soft tissues.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Storms 
                  would have often brought in a suspension of finely-dispersed 
                  lime. Such storms would have brought in the amazing diversity 
                  of life we know from the region: pterosaurs, dinosaurs like 
                  Compsognathus and Archaeopteryx, dragonflies, and other insects, 
                  fish, turtles, crinoids, starfish, jellyfish, ammonites, worms, 
                  plants, and many, many more. The number of species found exceeds 
                  500. The limestone deposits of Solnhofen open a door closed 
                  to us over 150 million years ago, affording us a look at a wonderful 
                  diversity of life from both the land and the sea of the Jurassic.</font></p>

The basic purpose here would be <em>the continuation ofthe <a href="PROCESS.html">process</a> of evolution</em>, avoiding evolutionary "dead ends".Natural selection entails survival and development (growth, reproduction,adaptation...), summarized in the concept of <a href="FITNESS.html">fitness</a>, as the essential value (see <a href="MEANLIFE.html">the meaning of life</a>). However, the idea of an evolutionaryethics has not been very popular until now, and we will therefore go intoa little more detail about this aspect of our philosophical system. Evolutionaryethics got a bad reputation because of its association with the "naturalisticfallacy": the mistaken belief that human goals and values are determinedby, or can be deduced from, natural evolution (Campbell, 1978). <a href="SCIVAL.html">Values</a>cannot be derived from facts about nature: ultimately we are <a href="FREEDOM.html">free</a> in choosingour own goals (Turchin, 1991). <p>However, we must take into account the principle of natural <a href="SELECT.html">selection</a>,which implies that if our goals are incompatible with the conditions necessaryfor survival, then we will be eliminated from the natural scene. Of course,there is no natural law or absolute moral principle which forbids you tocommit suicide, but you must be aware that this means that the world willcontinue without you, and that it will quickly forget that you ever havebeen there. If we wish to evade this alternative, this means that we willhave to do everything for maximising survival.<p> A second fallacy to avoid is the naive extrapolation of past evolutioninto the present or future. The mechanisms of survival and adaptation thatwere developed during evolution contain a lot of wisdom--about <I>past</I>situations (Campbell, 1978). They are not necessarily adequate for presentcircumstances. This must be emphasized especially in view of the creativityof evolution: the <a href="COMPGROW.html">emergence of new levels of complexity</a>, governed by <a href="DOWNCAUS.html">novellaws</a>. <p>	For example, as shown by the theory of r/K selection in biological evolution, there is a <a href="RKSELECT.html">trade-off between fast reproduction (r selection) and long life (K selection)</a>: organisms that reproduce quickly (e.g. mice, insects) generally do not live long and therefore do not have the time or the resources to become very large, strong, efficient or intelligent, as K-selected organisms would (e.g. elephants, tortoises, people). Quick reproduction (r) is advantageous in environments where the probability of death is high, but where there are enough resources for a fast growing population. Continuing development (K) is preferable in an environment where the risks of unexpected death are under control, but that is limited in its carrying capacity in terms of available resources. Our present society becomes more and more like a K-environment, and therefore evolutionary theory would admonish us to increasingly focus on the values associated with K selection, i.e. long life and extended development, while suppressing the inherited tendency to produce a lot of offspring. <p>	As a more radical example of a needed change in evolutionary strategies, biological evolution, based on the survival of the genes, has favoured <I>selfishness</I> and nepotism: maximizing one's own profit, with a disregardfor others (unless those others carry one's own genes: close family). Ina <a href="SOCIETY.html">human society</a>, on the other hand, we need moral principles that promote<a href="COOPEVOL.html">cooperation</a>, curbing too strong selfishness. Once the social interactionshave sufficiently developed the <a href="EVOLETHICS.html">appearance of such moral principles</a> (e.g."thou shalt not steal") becomes advantageous, and hence willbe reinforced by natural selection, even though it runs counter to previous"selfish" selection mechanisms (Campbell, 1978). The developmentof human society is an example of a <a href="MST.html">metasystem transition</a>, which createsa new system evolving through a mechanism which is no longer geneticalbut cultural (Turchin, 1977). <h2>The Striving for Immortality</h2><p>One of the implications of that transition concerns the interpretationof survival. In biological evolution survival means essentially survival of the genes,not so much survival of the individuals (Dawkins, 1976). With the exceptionof species extinction, we may say that genes are effectively immortal:it does not matter that an individual dies, as long as his or her genes persistin off-spring. The death of individual organisms can even contribute to genetic fitness, by focusing resources on reproduction rather than individual survival (see <a href="EVOLAGE.html">the evolutionary causes of death</a>). <p>Individual death does not benefit  cultural evolution, though. In socio-cultural evolution, the role of genes is playedby cognitive systems ("<a href="MEMES.html">memes</a>"), embodied in individualbrains or social organizations, or stored in books, computers and otherknowledge media. However, most of the knowledge acquired by an individualstill disappears at biological death. Only a tiny part of that knowledgeis stored outside the brain or transmitted to other individuals. Furtherevolution would be much more efficient if all knowledge acquired throughexperience could be maintained, in order to make place only for more adequateknowledge. <p>This requires an effective <I><a href="IMMORT.html">immortality</a></I> of the cognitive systems defining individual and collective minds: what would survive is not thematerial substrate (body or brain), but its cybernetic organization. Thismay be called "<a href="CYBIMM.html">cybernetic immortality</a>" (Turchin, 1991). We could conceive its realization by means of very advanced man-machine systems,where the border between the organic (brain) and the artificially organicor electronic media (computer) becomes irrelevant. The death of a biologicalcomponent of the system would no longer imply the death of the whole system.<p>Cybernetic immortality can be conceived as an ultimate goal or value,capable to motivate long-term human action. It is in this respect similarto <I><a href="METIMM.html">metaphysical immortality</a></I> (Turchin, 1991): the survival of the "soul" in heaven promised by the traditional religions in orderto motivate individuals to obey their ethical teachings (Campbell, 1979),and to <I><a href="CREATIMM.html">creative immortality</a></I> (Turchin, 1991): the driving force behind artists, authors or scientists, who hope to survive in the works they leave to posterity. <p><h2>Human Development</h2>Another basic value that can be derived from the concept of survivalis "<img src=Images/externallink.GIF><a TARGET=_blank href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Maslow.pdf">self-actualization</a>" (Maslow, 1970): the desire to actualizethe human potential, that is to say to maximally develop the knowledge,intelligence and wisdom which may help us to secure survival for all futurecontingencies. Self-actualization may be defined as anoptimal, conscious use of the variety of actions we are capable to execute. Self-actualization is strongly correlated with <a href="HAPPINES.html">happiness</a>, or general satisfaction with life. By empirically determining which social and economic conditions contribute most to happiness for the world population, we can derive a more concrete list of basic values, such as health, wealth, safety, equality and freedom.<p>However, if the <a href="VARIETY.html">variety</a>of available choices becomes too great, as seems to be the casein our present, <a href="CHINNEG.html">fast moving and complex society</a>, a new control level is needed(Heylighen, 1991b). This may be realized by a new <a href="MST.html">metasystem transition</a>, leading toa yet higher level of evolution. A more detailed understanding of thisnext transition may help us to answer the question "Where are we goingto?", that is to say to understand the <a href="FUTEVOL.html">future of evolution</a>.<h2>Competition Between Levels</h2><p> The main remaining problem of an evolutionary ethics is how to reconcilethe goals of survival and development on the different levels: the level of the individual(personal freedom), the <a href="SOCIETY.html">society</a> (integration of individuals), and the planet(survival of the world ecology as a whole).The necessary competition between levels follows from the <a href="SUBOPTIM.html"> problem of suboptimization</a>, according to which what is best for a subsystem is in general not best for the global system. In its stronger form, this may lead to the "tragedy of the commons" (Hardin, 1968): the exhaustion of common resources because of individually selfish optimization.  It isclear that the different levels have very complicated interactions in theireffect on selection (Campbell, 1979), and hence we need a careful cyberneticanalysis of their mutual relations. For example, it is an open question whetherthe "cybernetically immortal" cognitive system that would emergeafter the next metasystem transition would be embodied most effectivelyin an <a href="SUP-META.html">individual being ("metabeing"), or ina society of individuals ("superbeing")</a>. <p><p><B>References</B> <p> <a href="CAMPBEL.html">Campbell</a> D.T.

<p><b>Adverse Assessments of <i>Gambusia affinis<br>
</i></b><font SIZE="2">by Henry R. Rupp</font></p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>While mosquito research and control personnel have been almost unanimous in their
approval of the use of <i>Gambusia affinis </i>for mosquito control, members of the
ichthyological community have viewed introduction of the fish into non-native habitats
with alarm, because of real and potential damage to these ecosystems. This paper presents
a brief review of adverse opinions to provide mosquito control personnel with another
perspective to consider when planning to use the fish outside its native habitat.</p>

<p>The basic text for mosquito control workers, <i>Biological Control of Mosquitoes </i>(Chapman,
ed., 1985), has a 14-page chapter <i>on Gambusia affinis affinis </i>by Meisch. Writing
from a mosquito control perspective, Meisch has a section on &quot;Negative Aspects,&quot;
although these negative comments are vitiated by insertion of positive statements about <i>Gambusia.
</i>There<i> </i>is a chapter on &quot;Other Fish&quot; by Bay. The concluding chapter of <i>Biological
Control of Mosquitoes, by </i>Laird, notes the World Health Organization (WHO)
recommendation against the introduction of <i>Gambusia </i>to non-native habitats. This
chapter presents the position that the introduction of predatory agents should not result
in &quot;the destruction of the already present natural enemies of mosquitoes,&quot;
recommends cost/risk benefits studies as an essential part of any control program, and
concludes, most realistically, no adverse impacts means no mosquito control.</p>

<p>In 1967, Bay reviewed positive and negative aspects of the use <i>of Gambusia </i>and<i>
</i>later (WHO/VBC/72.403) reviewed opposition to use of <i>Gambusia </i>in West Africa,
citing anti-<i>Gambusia </i>feelings of &quot;most ichthyologists&quot;.&nbsp; Another
source, long familiar to mosquito control workers, is &quot;Guide to the use of the
mosquito fish, <i>Gambusia affinis, for </i>mosquito control&quot; by Scholdt et al.
(1972). Scholdt warned:&nbsp;&quot;the impact of the fish on the aquatic environment
cannot be underestimated as there is good evidence that the indiscriminate use of mosquito
fish can be as detrimental as the misuse of pesticides. &quot;</p>

<p>Much the same sentiments were echoed by Laird (1977) who wrote: &quot;Time has proved
that mosquitofish eventually became harmful in some areas to which they were introduced
half a century ago --- the harm ranged from eating the eggs of economically desirable
fish, to endangering rare indigenous species.&quot;<br>
<br>
Later, in 1988, he cited Miura's work in the rice fields of California as indicative of
the lack of adverse effects on one environment, an environment Harrington (personal
comment) referred to as &quot;artificial&quot;. Laird cited Legendre's 1937 article in the
<i>Bulletin Economique Indochine </i>pointing out the threat to indigenous fish from <i>Gambusia
</i>predated Myers' 1965 article, which referred to events of the mid-1930's, but seemed
unaware of Sweetman's <i>The Biological Control of Insects</i> (1936) which had preceded
Legendre by a year and would have been more readily accessible to mosquito control
practitioners in this country. However, Laird reminds us, &quot;Too much should not be
expected, though, of such indigenous fish in natural waters of high taxonomic
diversity,&quot; and indicated, in relation to <i>Aplocheilus panchax, </i>that omnivorous
fish can maintain themselves well in nature without mosquito larvae, and <i>Gambusia </i>is
indeed an omnivore. He also cited Russian feeling that &quot;the general effectiveness of
this fish has been disappointing. &quot;</p>

<p>Speaking of biocontrol programs, Laird (1988) commented on use of <i>Aplocheilus
latipes </i>(an egglaying cyrpinodont) in Russia, following tests of larval consumption
rates of the fish in aquaria, &quot;It is submitted that biocontrol introductions of this
kind, based upon a mosquito larvivore that is very probably of far more catholic tastes
than univariate laboratory experiments could reveal, are only likely to prove successful
where mosquito production is unusually high in rather short-lived larval habitats
harbouring a limited flora and fauna; or in more complex aquatic ecosystems where
preliminary habitat manipulations is undertaken to give, for example, <i>Aplocheilus </i>unrestricted
access to dense concentrations of larval Culicidae.&quot;</p>

<p>These caveats are mild compared to the opinion presented by ichthyologists Courtenay
and Meffe (1989) in the conclusion to their section on <i>Gambusia in Ecology and
Evolution of Livebearing Fishes: </i>&quot;In summary, mosquito fish almost invariably
present a multitude of&nbsp; problems when introduced beyond their native range and offer
no real compensatory or biological control advantages. The species should not be used as a
larvivore, with native species much preferable in that role whenever possible (e.g. Lloyd
1984). Mosquitofish are far too aggressive and predatory to be indiscriminately spread
throughout the world without recognition of dangers to native biota. An international ban
on their use as a control agent is biologically appropriate and warranted.&quot;</p>

<p>What are the reasons presented for this condemnation? Let us look at some of the
evidence they present in their review of the literature dealing with the adverse effects
of the use of <i>Gambusia. </i>The first complaint is that <em>Gambusia</em> is not really
that effective in mosquito control and better control has been achieved with native
species.&nbsp; As far back as 1949 Bates was noting, &quot;The success of practical
operations along these lines [biological control] has not been very remarkable.&quot; In
1967 Harrington (personal comment) was saying, &quot;very few entomologists have sound
evidence of the alleged efficacy of <em>Gambusia</em> where it has been introduced.&quot;<i></p>
</i>

<p>In Australia, Allen (1989) remarked on <i>Gambusia's </i>lack of efficacy in mosquito
control, and in 1993 Dennis C. Haney of the National Biological Survey of the U. S.
Department of the Interior wrote (personal comment): &quot;I think you will find that
there is little or no evidence for <i>Gambusia </i>being<i> </i>particularly effective in
controlling mosquito larvae. In fact, almost all the evidence indicates that <i>Gambusia </i>is
no better at controlling larvae than are native fish.&quot;</p>

<p>Recognizing there is testimony on both sides of the issue and that <i>Gambusia </i>may
not be so universally successful as we have been led to believe, let us turn to what
ichthyologists consider a more serious issue. The failure to effect larval control is a
concern of the mosquito control community, <i>but Gambusia's </i>impact on non-target
organisms affects a broader community of interests.</p>

<p>The concern with environmental impacts goes back more than half a century when, in
1936, Harvey Sweetman warned in his pioneering <i>The Biological Control of Insects: </i>Finally,
it should always be held in mind that the introduction of any foreign animal is apt to
cause repercussions on the native fauna in unexpected ways. <i>Gambusia has </i>been
spread far and wide in anti-mosquito work, frequently in ignorance of valuable native
species. <i>Gambusia affinis </i>and<i> G. holbrookii </i>are for their size, among the
most voracious and destructive of fishes, and although no reports of damage to the young
of valuable food fishes in areas into which they have been introduced have appeared, it is
possible that introduction into certain places will prove to have been a mistake.</p>

<p>Myers, writing in 1965, noted some 30 years previously &quot;the crew of the California
State Fish and Game Department's black-bass hatchery at Friant had to discontinue using <i>Gambusia
</i>as a 'forage fish' with which to feed the bass. <i>Gambusia </i>was destroying a large
proportion of the young bass!&quot; He also reported removing <i>Gambusia </i>from a pond
shared with goldfish and seeing the goldfish population double and redouble in 2 years.</p>
<i>

<p>Gambusia</i>'s<i> </i>effectiveness as a predator as well as its omnivorous feeding
patterns make it a hazard to native species and any other aquatic organisms that can be
eaten (Courtenay and Meffe 1989). <i>Gambusia </i>does not specialize in mosquito larvae
and pupae (Harrington and Harrington 1961; Myers 1965; Washino and Hokama 1967, Meisch
1985). Myers (1965) reported the loss of 5 species subsequent to the introduction of <i>Gambusia:
Poeciliopsis </i>sp<i>. (USA); Aplocheilus panchax and Phenacosiethus </i>sp. (Thailand); <i>Gulaphallus
</i>sp. (Philippines), <i>Micropanchax sholleri </i>(Lower Nile). Courtenay and Meffe
(1989) listed other species and organisms reduced or eliminated by the introduction of <i>Gambusia</i>.
Lynch (1991) reported on the impact of <i>Gambusia </i>on the plains topminnow, <i>Fundulus
sciadicus</i>, in<i> </i>Nebraska in an experimental release program. His comments on such
research are instructive: &quot;Most experiments are done under controlled circumstances
where the experimenter has some notion of what to expect.... The release of
self-replicating agents into the environment is fundamentally different, because as soon
as they are released, any controls are lost.&quot;</p>
<i>

<p>Gambusia's </i>pugnacious and omnivorous nature is not helpful to other species'
reproduction (Myers 1965). Eggs and fry, even of intensive-care fish like the
Centrarchidae, are grist for their reproductive mill (Myers 1965), and competition for
resources is not the problem-- it is predation (Courtenay and Meffe 1989).</p>

<p>Australian ichthyologists talk of <i>Gambusia</i> almost<i> </i>as Australian
agriculturists speak of the rabbit.&nbsp; Brought in with good intentions, the fish has
spread widely across the continent and is viewed as a threat to native species (Arthington
and Lloyd 1989, Allen 1989). In coastal regions of southeast Asia, Bardach et al. (1972)
cite <i>Gambusia </i>as well as the common guppy as pest species. Wildekamp (1993) notes
the impact of the introduction of <i>Gambusia </i>on four species of <i>Aphanius </i>in
the first of a multi-volume set about killifish of the world: <i>A. anatoliae
transgradiens (Turkey); A. apodus </i>(Algeria); <i>A. fascialus </i>(Rhone
Delta-Camargue); <i>A. iberus </i>(Spain and Algeria).</p>

<p>More recently, Gratz (personal comment) wrote of a fish expert for FAO coming into his
NWO office complaining about the stupidity of people releasing <i>Gambusia </i>into<i> </i>an
area where he was trying to develop fish populations to feed indigenous populations only
to find the <i>Gambusia </i>eating the eggs of the desired fish species.</p>

<p>It is instructive to compare the commentary <i>on Gambusia </i>in two standard field
guides to freshwater fishes of North America. The Audubon Guide (1983) notes that <i>Gambusia
</i>has been widely introduced for use in mosquito control. The Peterson guide (Page and
Burr 1991) is much more specific: &quot;Introductions of this species, often for mosquito
control, have caused or contributed to the elimination of many populations of fishes with
similar ecological requirements. Introductions into western drainages have been especially
deleterious to the survival of certain rare fishes.&quot;</p>

<p>Are hazards posed by use of <i>Gambusia</i> real? One suspects arguments presented by
ichthyologists must have substance, and the evidence presented is real. Critics of <i>Gambusia
</i>ask why native species are not used to control mosquitoes? Several reasons may be
posited. If a fish is in its native habitat and is an effective predator (like saltmarsh
killies) the need to institute a biocontrol program is unnecessary. However, when it comes
to habitats where native fish are not as numerous, or numbers have been reduced by
introduction of exotics, then cultivation and stocking of native egg-laying fish, it is
assumed, take more effort. Live-bearers are supposedly easier to raise than egg layers;
the fry are larger, free swimming, and feeding at birth; they grow more quickly and become
predators faster. However, in this writer's experience, egg-laying minnows <i>(Pimephales
promelas </i>&quot;Rosy&quot;) produced thousands of fry in a 10-foot garden pond over the
course of a summer with minimal parental predation. However, <i>Gambusia are </i>easy to
use, require minimal training for application, and, more importantly, have been thought
safe. They have good public relations value (Duryea 1993), showing mosquito control's
ability to not be totally reliant on pesticides in a period of chemophobia. Further, their
easy availability has allowed us the luxury of not having to seek other tools.</p>

<p>One question never effectively raised, because <i>Gambusia </i>is a biological
organism, was the question automatically asked about any pesticide: What are the
non-target effects?&nbsp; Were a label sought for use of <i>Gambusia </i>as a pesticide
today, one suspects it might well prove unacceptable to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) because of adverse environmental impacts, particularly as those effects would
be revealed in the review process.&nbsp; Being a highly goal-oriented community, one
suspects mosquito research and control people have looked at <i>Gambusia </i>with
rose-colored glasses.&nbsp; One other question not asked is &quot;If <i>Gambusia</i> is so
effective a predator, how is it there are so many mosquitoes in areas which are its native
habitat?&quot;</p>

<p>Mosquito research and control people find their origins in the disease-preventative
programs of the past. Their concerns have been oriented toward human well-being, so it is
not surprising they welcomed a tool like <i>Gambusia. </i>However, if health concerns are
given as a reason for introduction of <i>Gambusia, </i>it should be remembered that it is
not an effective control against vector-competent species such as <i>Aedes aegypti, Ae.
albopictus, Coquillettidia perturbans or Culiseta melanura. </i>One should also note that
if disease is a factor, then control should be effected as promptly and as completely as
possible.&nbsp; It is more responsible to use an insecticide whose environmental breakdown
is a known factor rather than a biological agent whose environmental fate can only be
guessed at.</p>

<p>The role of Gambusia in disease control has not been judged as impressive. Service
(1983, 1995) and Mahmoud (1985) both have indicated <i>Gambusia </i>has not been effective
in the control of malaria.</p>

<p>Mosquito control's thinking over the years has been conditioned by what mosquito
researchers, not ichthyologists, have said about<i> Gambusia </i>and its efficacy,
particularly about the numbers of larvae consumed in aquaria or other artificial habitats.
Our thinking needs to expand its horizons to learn what other specialists in the aquatic
world have to say about <i>Gambusia, </i>and it needs to factor in that knowledge so we
can avoid ecological mishaps in areas not already destabilized by introduction of
exotics.&nbsp;

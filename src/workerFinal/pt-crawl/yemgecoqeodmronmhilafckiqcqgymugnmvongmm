<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;For a generation of Americans &mdash; and especially Chicagoans &mdash; Roger was the movies. When he didn&rsquo;t like a film, he was honest; when he did, he was effusive &mdash; capturing the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical.</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Even amidst his own battles with cancer, Roger was as productive as he was resilient &mdash; continuing to share his passion and perspective with the world. The movies won&rsquo;t be the same without Roger, and our thoughts and prayers are with Chaz and the rest of the Ebert family.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Though he was viewed as a movie critic with the soul of a poet, he also had killer business instincts. A journalist since the 1960s, he not only survived endless tumult in the craft, he thrived by embracing new opportunity and expanding his franchise at every turn.</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Just as Jay-Z is more than a musician, Roger Ebert was much more than a guy who wrote about movies. He was a newspaper writer, a television personality, a public speaker, a book author, an event impresario and a Web publisher. And through his Web site, RogerEbert.com, he is still with us even though he is gone, demonstrating the kind of stickiness and durability that media brands crave.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;There will be a long, long echo [of his work] reverberating for a long, long time&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always tried to be a good soldier of cinema myself, so of course since he&rsquo;s gone, I will plow on, as I have plowed on all my life, but I will do what I have to do as if Roger was looking over my shoulder. And I am not gonna disappoint him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;&lsquo;I was born inside the movie of my life&rsquo;: the opening words of [his memoir] &lsquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Itself-Memoir-Roger-Ebert/dp/0446584967/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365199000&amp;sr=1-1">Life Itself</a>&rsquo; announce both the crucial cinematic lure of magic images on a big screen and Roger&rsquo;s talent for analyzing his own adventures and limitations. Given his gift of gab, that movie must have been a talkie. He fits William F. Buckley Jr.&rsquo;s description of Roger&rsquo;s fellow Midwesterner Rush Limbaugh: &lsquo;preternaturally fluent.&rsquo; One imagines him popping out of the womb and saying, &lsquo;Hi, Mom! Well, that was an interesting nine-month movie I just sat through. The visuals were lacking; it was more like radio, really. But the soothing darkness well prepared me for a life of sitting in movie theaters. All in all, I give the experience two enthusiastic, tiny thumbs up!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<article class="memoriam--entry">
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Virtually alone among his generation of journalists, Ebert saw the substantive potential of social media early on and translated his fame in print and on TV to the Internet, becoming a Twitter trailblazer and a mentor who showed the rest of us in this imploding profession not just how to survive but how to prosper in the digital age. [&hellip;]</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up there with Will Rogers, H.L. Mencken and A.J. Liebling, and not too far short of Mark Twain, as one of the great plainspoken commentators on American culture and American life. What was so wonderful about Roger as a critic was the fact that he was never a snob and never condescended to anyone, while also being an immensely knowledgeable student of film who avoided the faux-populist reverse snobbery of so many of the critics who followed him into television. He wrote in clear, declarative newspaper prose aimed first and foremost at his Chicagoland readership &mdash; &lsquo;I go into the movie, I watch it, and I ask myself what happened to me&rsquo; &mdash; but was just as likely to lavish praise on foreign films or tiny indies or cheesy exploitation flicks as on Hollywood star packages.&rdquo;</p>

<article class="memoriam--entry">
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;If there was any downside to [Siskel and Ebert&rsquo;s] television success, it was that so many people only knew them from that medium and never sought out their printed reviews. I was one of those people. It was only with the invention of the Internet that I began reading Roger&rsquo;s reviews, on his comprehensive website, and marveling at his writing skill. He is the only critic I know who unashamedly drew on his life experiences to explain his feelings about a given movie. It wasn&rsquo;t a gimmick, and it never made him seem self-absorbed, just disarmingly candid.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;CHICAGO&mdash;Calling the overall human experience &lsquo;poignant,&rsquo; &lsquo;thought-provoking,&rsquo; and a &lsquo;complete tour de force,&rsquo; film critic Roger Ebert praised existence Thursday as &lsquo;an audacious and thrilling triumph.&rsquo; &lsquo;While not without its flaws, life, from birth to death, is a masterwork, and an uplifting journey that both touches the heart and challenges the mind,&rsquo; said Ebert, adding that while the totality of all humankind is sometimes &lsquo;a mess in places,&rsquo; it strives to be a magnum opus and, according to Ebert, largely succeeds at this goal.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;He saw, and felt, and described the movies more effectively, more cinematically, and more warmly than just about anyone writing about anything. Even his pans had a warmth to them. Even when you disagreed with Roger you found yourself imagining the movie he saw, and loved (or hated) more than you did.</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;I came late to film criticism in Chicago, after writing about the theater. Roger loved the theater. His was a theatrical personality: a raconteur, a spinner of dinner-table stories, a man who was not shy about his accomplishments. But he made room in that theatrical, improbable, outsized life for others.&rdquo;</p>

<article class="memoriam--entry">
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Ebert enjoyed his status as the world&rsquo;s most famous film critic but did not believe it was fully deserved. When I wrote an article calling him the finest film critic we will ever see, he sent me an email telling me off. &lsquo;I am not the best film critic in the world,&rsquo; he wrote. &lsquo;Though I might be the hardest-working.&rsquo; He was right on the second count and wrong on the first.</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;His rules for writing were simple and obvious to anyone who knew him: never be dull, never be dishonest and never miss a deadline. This is what he taught me about film criticism and this is what he taught me about life.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;I grew up in Kansas City and Dallas in the seventies and eighties. To put it mildly, these were not film towns. They had precious few art-house theaters. Roger Ebert&rsquo;s review show with Gene Siskel, which ran on PBS and then in syndication under various titles, was my gateway into cinematic worlds I might not have otherwise explored, and that road led to my becoming a film and TV critic. Siskel and Ebert had as much to do with stoking my interest in films and film criticism as anyone I knew personally. Maybe more.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Fast-forward to my adolescent years. Roger and Gene (in color) were on Channel 11, the same channel that satiated my love of Abbott and Costello, Douglas Sirk and Yankees baseball. Roger had also become syndicated in the New York newspaper, so I could finally partake of his prose. It read as if he were in the room with me, having a conversation. Roger Ebert was educating me about foreign films, arty-fartsy fare and blockbusters. But he was also telling me a story. There was no stuffy pretense to his words; he wrote in a relaxed, engaging style I wanted to emulate. This was odd at first, since I usually sided with Siskel. But great writing doesn&rsquo;t need to be agreed with to be admired or even cherished. I had found my writer idol.&rdquo;</p>

He was so kind and caring, always listening, always watching. He knew he had the power to touch people&rsquo;s lives, and he did so as often as he could, and with such humbleness. For instance, what need did this man have to give people around the world a chance to speak up, on his blog?</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Of the entries included on the [Microsoft Cinemania CD-ROM] disc, the ones by Roger were the longest and most detailed. Maltin wrote capsules and Kael&rsquo;s pieces were the edited-down versions of her &lsquo;New Yorker&rsquo; reviews, originally contained in &lsquo;5001 Nights at the Movies.&rsquo; Roger&rsquo;s prose was instantly accessible and inviting. He seemed uninterested in infallibility (something Kael would thrive on, clearly having enjoyed publishing what she saw as final words on her subjects). He came off as a super-knowledgeable guy who happened to want to simply talk movies with you. He would never judge you for botching a phrase in English, I thought to myself &mdash; only for being untrue to your gut feeling. I took immediate comfort in that; one that later allowed me to make my own tentative attempts of writing criticism in English.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">ldquo;On one of their many lively talk show appearances during that era, Gene paused in between trading playful barbs to confess that what he envied most about Roger was his writing ability. Gene was right: Ebert was better. And whether he was reviewing Cries and Whispers for the Sun-Times or jousting with cinephiles on CompuServe, the agility of his prose was the same. Many writers have linked Roger&rsquo;s loss of his voice with his use of the Internet, probably because Roger made the connection many times himself. But he had created his own virtual forum at least as early as 1995 or 1996, a pioneer in online criticism and communication. I joined CompuServe briefly around then. Sparring directly with Ebert was fun. With the proto-trolls who prowled the forum spouting venom and lunacy, not so much. After a few months I wrote Roger an email, politely telling him that I was leaving. Unexpectedly he replied: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you!&rsquo; He added that there was &lsquo;a lot of silliness&rsquo; online, but that he also found enough value in the virtual realm to stick around.&rdquo;</p>

Ebert wrote back to every single one, with lengthy and heartfelt missives that were far more than a snot-nosed kid clearly getting off on Knowing Roger Ebert deserved. I have no idea why he did it. He told me &lsquo;that this is important to you as it is, that&rsquo;s a very large percentage of what you need, really.&rsquo; He emphasized that such ephemera like &lsquo;career&rsquo; and &lsquo;success&rsquo; were mostly beside the point. &lsquo;Just write, get better, keep writing, keep getting better.

Back in the &rsquo;80s, during the height of the politically reactionary Reagan era, he would proudly identify himself as a &lsquo;card-carrying member of SDS.&rsquo; (Not sure, though, whether Roger hewed to the original Port Huron statement, or &lsquo;the compromised second draft,&rsquo; as the Dude dismissed it in &lsquo;The Big Lebowski.&rsquo;)</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;His union sympathies began at an early age. His father, Walter, worked as an electrician, and Roger remained a member of the Newspaper Guild throughout his career &mdash; though after he became an independent contractor, he probably could have opted out.

Ebert writes, in the introduction to his 2006 anthology of his work, &lsquo;Awake in the Dark,&rsquo; of seeing &lsquo;three movies during a routine workday,&rsquo; and, according to Douglas Martin&rsquo;s obituary in the Times, Ebert &lsquo;said he saw 500 films a year and reviewed half of them.&rsquo; Some movies elicit passionate exultation; others, passionate revulsion. Those movies that repel you are the hardest to write about, and, for many critics, that&rsquo;s the majority of movies. That&rsquo;s where Ebert&rsquo;s unique temperament, his humanistic world view, comes into play.&rdquo;</p>

He didn&rsquo;t waste time clearing his throat. &lsquo;They meet for the first time when she is in her front yard practicing baton-twirling,&rsquo; begins his review of &lsquo;Badlands.&rsquo; Often, he managed to smuggle the basics of the plot into a larger thesis about the movie, so that you don&rsquo;t notice the exposition taking place: &lsquo;&ldquo;Broadcast News&rdquo; is as knowledgeable about the TV news-gathering process as any movie ever made, but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high-pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves.&rsquo; The reviews start off in all different ways, sometimes with personal confessions, sometimes with sweeping statements. One way or another, he pulls you in. When he feels strongly, he can bang his fist in an impressive way. His review of &lsquo;Apocalypse Now&rsquo; ends thus: &lsquo;The whole huge grand mystery of the world, so terrible, so beautiful, seems to hang in the balance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;The more Roger became a prisoner of his body, the more he seemed to escape into his rich and sophisticated mind. By the agreement of almost everyone I know, his writing in these last years was among the best he&rsquo;d ever done, more personal and expansive, marked by a still-astonishing rate of productivity. He wrote a wonderful memoir, close in its deceptively profound, plainspoken way to two of the writers Roger most admired: Charles Dickens and Samuel Johnson. And indeed, Roger was nothing if not an Anglophile: Among the least known books he authored is a slender volume called &lsquo;The Perfect London Walk,&rsquo; an instructional travel book that, having taken the journey it maps, I can assure you is a rare case of truth in titling.&rdquo;</p>

A writer I know once told me he didn&rsquo;t read Ebert because he get could a plot summary anywhere.

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tempted to say that if Roger had never written a word, he&rsquo;d be known for bringing people together. But the writing was what made Roger Roger. He wasn&rsquo;t just generous with those close to him. He told everyone a lot about himself &mdash; sometimes, I think, more than he knew &mdash; in the words he published: his reviews, his op-ed pieces, his interviews, his blog, his memoir &mdash; even his tweets.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Did I mention he was a film critic?</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Well, <em>who you are</em> is and isn&rsquo;t what you officially do for a living. Ebert wasn&rsquo;t working so hard to prove a point. He worked so hard because that&rsquo;s who he was. Writing was like breathing to him.</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;No wonder this Champaign-Urbana transplant was the quintessential Chicagoan. We like to think of Chicago as the city that gets things done.</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Ebert got things done. He got a whole hell of a lot of things done.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;&lsquo;Start writing. Short sentences. Describe it. Just describe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="memoriam--entry-text">&ldquo;Roger said, when I asked him about writer&rsquo;s block. Then he quoted the first three paragraphs of his &lsquo;Persona&rsquo; review and told me that it had completely baffled him in 1967 but this strategy worked brilliantly. Tonight, as I sit here numbly staring at the screen with the hardest writer&rsquo;s block I&rsquo;ve ever known, I place my fingers on the keyboard to follow the advice of the greatest man I know, and just describe it.&rdquo;</p>

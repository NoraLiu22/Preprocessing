</p>

<p>MOAC (Museums and the Online Archive of California) is pleased to announce the new MOAC website with access to expanded collections, a new interface, and the comprehensive new <em>MOAC Report 2003</em>, which includes an "Introduction" by Robin Chandler, "Project Manager's Report" by Richard Rinehart, "Standards and Best Practices" by Guenter Waibel, and "Field Reports" from several of the consortium partners.</p>

<p>Users can browse or search selected collections from MOAC partner institutions. This resource currently includes 75,000 records and images from 11 California cultural institutions, presented online in collaboration with the California Digital Library.</p>


<p>MOAC began in 1997 when 10 California museums began working with the California Digital Library to integrate access to collections of art, historical artifacts, photography, and manuscripts from museums, archives, and libraries throughout the state. In addition to developing  unparalleled content resources for research and instruction, MOAC had a second, equally important, goal: developing best practices for museums so that museums of all sizes and types could cost-effectively participate in the "digital revolution" and provide sophisticated, standards-based access to their collections. The Institute of Museum and Library Services generously funded a MOAC testbed project from 1999-2001.</p> 

<p>MOAC has developed into a growing community of like-minded museums and archives in California who continue to participate in several projects that further the initial goals of the group. Detailed documents describing the project can be found under "Project Documentation" on the project website at &lt;<a href="http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/moac">http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/moac</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>The European Library (TEL) is a pioneering collaboration between the national libraries of Finland, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, along with the national central cataloguing institute (ICCU) from Italy. TEL was  created under the auspices of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL). It will establish a professionally designed and maintained single access point to selected  holdings spanning a range of collections in all the partner national libraries so that the informed citizen in any country can utilise the resources not only of his or her own national library but also&#151;during the same search session&#151;the resources of any other partner national libraries that may hold material relevant to the citizen's interest.</p>

<p>In the TEL project (February 2001 to January 2004) with partial funding from the European Commission, the feasibility of the TEL venture is being tested, and the results are encouraging. TEL partners have committed themselves to moving from the project phase to a fully operational TEL service. The launch of this service is anticipated to take place at the beginning of 2005.</p>

<p>To focus on the successes of the TEL project, the partners:</p>
<ul> <li>have achieved consensus on the mission for TEL;</li>
<li>have developed and will support the TEL Metadata Profile that will serve as the basis for the operational service;</li>
<li>have agreed on a  subscription-based business model that results in a free resource discovery service;</li>
<li>have taken a pragmatic and flexible approach to the technical development of the service, resulting in what they believe will be a low risk and functional service open to development as resources allow and to a change of platform as and when desirable.</li></ul>

<p>During the afternoon of 24 September 2003, the TEL Final Conference was held at the National Library of Lithuania in Vilnius before the Annual Meeting of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL). The presentations held at the TEL Final Conference as well as further results of the project are now available on the project website: &lt;<a href="http://www.europeanlibrary.org">http://www.europeanlibrary.org</a>&gt;.

<p><b>SheetMusicNow.com - Digital Distribution of Sheet Music in Denmark</b></p>

<p>The digital sheet music distributor SheetMusicNow.com has introduced a new subscription offer to Danish libraries for the purchase and distribution of digital sheet music.</p> 

<p>A pilot phase was successfully completed this summer. In cooperation with the Danish National Library Authority seven main libraries in Denmark (Gentofte, Copenhagen, Odense, Herning, Aarhus and the State Library) took part in the program. The subscription offer has now been opened up to all libraries in Denmark.</p> 

<p>Library users can have their own copy of high quality original editions downloaded and printed for them to take away and keep. The costs are covered by the libraries through their agreement with SheetMusicNow.com. The composers, artists and publishers receive a royalty for each copy distributed.</p> 

<p>The participating libraries have welcomed the new service, as it presents valuable cost reduction possibilities and access to a large amount of new music.</p> 

<p>"The cooperation regarding digital sheet music is an example of a project where cultural institutions and a private enterprise working together not only benefit the public, but also secure the rights of the artists. With the cooperation between Sheet Music Now A/S and the libraries for the distribution of digital sheet music, Denmark puts itself at the forefront of the field with the first project of this kind in Europe." -- Jens Thorhauge, Director of the Danish National Library Authority.</p>

<p>The SheetMusicNow.com catalog contains thousands of published classical and jazz editions from Schott Musik International, Josef Weinberger Ltd., Oxford University Press, Pizzicato Verlag Helvetia, Muzyka and many other publishers. It also presents for the first time new jazz arrangements from the new syllabus of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music in London.</p> 

<p>In addition to the published editions, SheetMusicNow.com also presents the works of world famous artists such as Sir James Galway, Chick Corea, Steven Isserlis, Joe Lovano and Stephen Hough.</p>

<p>The Illinois State Library Talking Book and Braille Service (TBBS), a division of the office of Secretary of State and State Librarian Jesse White, is overseeing and participating in a one-year, multi-state pilot project offering digital talking books to visually impaired and physically challenged library users.</p>

<p>The Lobe Library is offering digital talking books to readers from July 2003 to June 2004. Patrons participating in the TBBS Talking Book program who have a temporary or permanent physical or visual inability to read regular printed material are eligible to participate in the pilot program. They receive a handheld MP-3 type player by Audible that is loaded with a digital audio book, headphones, an instruction sheet and a bibliography of available books and order form. Patrons may test the player for three weeks. In June 2004, a national electronic book expert will write an evaluation report based upon the experiences of readers who participate to determine if and how the service will be continued and whether it should be expanded.</p>

<p>Currently, patrons receive talking books on cassettes and use cassette recorders. Digital talking books would allow users to access more modern and convenient technology.  The goal of the Lobe Library is to ensure that our print disabled population has the same access to new technologies as sighted persons. If the pilot program is a success, it is hoped that TBBS would eventually be able to offer digital talking books on a permanent basis.</p>

<p>Four of Illinois' regional Talking Book Centers located in Pekin, Carterville, Chicago and Geneva are also participating in the program, along with libraries in Hawaii, New Jersey, Montana and Mississippi.</p>

<p>Persons interested in signing up for the pilot program may contact the Illinois State Library Talking Book and Braille Service at 1-800-665-5576, extension 5, or &lt;psalamon&#064;ilsos.net&gt;.

<h4>Survey for visual resource librarians and museum personnel</h4>

<p><em>Announced 7 October 2003 by Abby Goodrum, Syracuse University</em></p>

<p>&quot;The Information Institute of Syracuse (IIS) at Syracuse University is
engaged in a project designed to build collaborative digital museum and
library references services. The project team is currently developing and
evaluating processes that enable museums and libraries to work together in
providing reference assistance over the Web to support patrons' image
information needs. As a first step, we are asking visual resource librarians
and museum personnel to participate in a short survey. The purpose of this
survey is to collect baseline data about visual resource librarians and
museum's digital reference practices. Access to the survey is:
&lt;<a href="http://quartz.syr.edu/dii">http://quartz.syr.edu/dii</a>&gt;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The data you provide will be analyzed in aggregate, thus there will not be
any identification of individuals. Participants are invited to provide their
demographic information so that we can follow-up, however, that is not
required.&quot;</p>

<h4>Open Archives Initiative and Project RoMEO Initiate OAI-rights</h4>

<p>&quot;September 29, 2003, Ithaca, NY, Los Alamos, NM &amp; Loughborough, UK -- The Open Archives Initiative and Project RoMEO  announce the formation of OAI-rights.  The goal of this effort is to investigate and develop means of expressing rights about metadata and resources in the OAI framework. The result will be an addition to the OAI implementation guidelines  that specifies mechanisms for rights expressions within the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The area of rights expressions is wide-open with many organizations proposing languages and mechanisms. Therefore, the OAI-rights effort will aim to be extensible, providing a general framework for expressing rights statements within OAI-PMH. These statements will target both the metadata itself and the resources described by that metadata. In the context of this broader framework, OAI-rights will use Creative Commons licenses  as a motivating and deployable example.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A white paper describing the scope and issues in OAI-rights is available at  &lt;<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/documents/OAIRightsWhitePaper.html">http://www.openarchives.org/documents/OAIRightsWhitePaper.html</a>&gt;.&quot;</p>

<h4>New Jersey State Library and Rutgers University receive a
$460,000 "Digital Highway" grant</h4>


<p>&quot;September 26, 2003, New Jersey State Library: The Institute of Museum and Library Services announced today that the New
Jersey State Library and Rutgers University will receive a $460,000 grant to
build "The New Jersey 
Digital Highway," a portal to the state's rich historical and cultural
heritage materials. The grant will focus on accessing and using digitized
collections of materials available in libraries, historical societies,
museums and archives around the state so that educators, students and the
public can have access to these materials online for their research and
personal use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Norma Blake, New Jersey State Librarian describes the project as an 'exciting collaboration between the state's cultural heritage institutions
and New Jersey educators to immerse New Jersey's rich historical resources
in a 21st century digital environment.' Blake notes that New Jersey
educators will develop lesson plans and activities using the digital
collections that will become available around the state.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rutgers University Libraries will build the portal and technical
infrastructure to support and house the New Jersey Digital Highway
collections...The State Library oversees the statewide
advisory committee that envisioned and proposed the New Jersey Digital
Highway. It also hosts the project website, and plans to provide training
and support materials for implementing digitization projects.  Susan Kaplan,
Consultant in the Library Development Bureau of the State Library and a
co-writer of the grant states, 'Training in digital collection building is a
major component of the project.  We will also be purchasing laptops and high
quality scanners that will be 'loaned' to participants so that they can
manage the onsite digitization of their materials.'&quot;</p>

<h4>President Signs Legislation to Improve Library and Museum Service</h4>

<p>&quot;September 25, 2003, Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS): Washington, DC. - At a ceremony today in the White House President George W. Bush signed into law H.R. 13 the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003.  The legislation reauthorizes federal support provided by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).  Thousands of U.S. libraries and museums receive IMLS funds each year; the agency is the primary source of federal support for these institutions.  All types of museums, art, history, natural history, science and technology centers, children's museums, botanical gardens, and zoos; and all types of libraries, public, academic, school, research, and archives are eligible for funding from the IMLS.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...This legislation advances the role of libraries and museums to connect people to knowledge and ideas in a new era.  Today innovative technologies, increasing diversity, and shifts in industry and labor markets combine to make adapting to change a way of life.  Navigating change, and achieving prosperity and individual productivity, require the ability to learn continually, to adapt readily, and to evaluate information critically.  This legislation will help museums and libraries work together and with their communities to meet these challenges.&quot;</p>

<h4>ALA issues new guidelines for developing library privacy policy</h4>

<p>&quot;September 19, 2003, American Library Association (ALA): The American Library Association (ALA) is pleased to announce the Guidelines for Developing a Library Privacy Policy, prepared by the ALA Intellectual Freedom Committee (IFC).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Increased identity theft, emerging technologies that profile and identify individuals, new and expanded federal and state privacy laws, and increased law enforcement monitoring prompt the IFC to urge libraries to act now to develop and/or revise their privacy policies.   Librarians play an essential role in protecting confidential user information from abuse. Written and up-to-date guidelines help ensure that libraries remain free from liability and public relations problems&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;...The guidelines are based on the Federal Trade Commission's "Fair Information Practice Principles."  These five principles outline the user rights of Notice, Choice, Access, Security and Enforcement.&quot;</p>

<h4>New center to improve technology-enhanced teaching and learning of science</h4>



<p>&quot;September 18, 2003, University of California, Berkeley - 'Science education does not yet take full advantage of modern technology,' says Marcia Linn, a University of California, Berkeley, education professor. But as principal investigator of the new Technology-Enhanced Learning in Science center, she hopes that's about to change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded $10 million for the center, which is designed to bring together teachers, students, researchers, policy-makers and high-tech designers from Berkeley to Boston to study how instructional technology can improve science education in grades 6 through 12. It also will create classroom-tested technological tools to be woven into science teaching.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Technology-Enhanced Learning in Science center (TELS) is one of 16 centers the NSF has established "to understand more deeply what it means to be a good teacher and what it takes to help students be successful in science, technology, engineering and mathematics," according to Judith Ramaley, assistant director of NSF's Education and Human Resources Directorate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The goal of the center, said Linn, is to increase the number of teachers who are using innovative, proven, technology-enhanced science curricula to impart key scientific concepts and methods to their students. Eight universities, six school districts, and the Concord Consortium in Concord, Mass., are participating in the center. The Concord Consortium is a non-profit educational research and development organization.&quot;</p>

<h4>National Library of The Netherlands and BioMed Central agree to open access archive</h4>

<p>&quot;17 September 2003, BioMed Central - &quot;Jan Velterop, Director and Publisher of BioMed Central, and Wim van Drimmelen, Director General of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB), the National Library of the Netherlands, today signed an agreement to secure the long-term digital archiving of all research published by BioMed Central.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The KB will act as an official archival agent for BioMed Central. As well as archiving all of the publisher's research articles, the KB has committed to updating the archive as technology changes. This will preserve the articles as a usable resource and ensure open access in perpetuity....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Should the BioMed Central website be inoperable for a long period of time, for example in the case of a disaster, the KB would be part of the interim service system. In the unlikely event that BioMed Central or a successor should be forced by circumstance to cease to make these journals available, as an official archive the KB would continue to keep them accessible to all indefinitely, maintaining the open access promise.&quot;</p>

<h4>All Systems Go for the 21st Century Public Library</h4>


<p>&quot;London, 17 September 2003 - Resource:  Resource has today launched the Master Plan that will see public libraries across England transformed into centres of knowledge, learning, creativity and inspiration, fit for the citizen of the 21st Century.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In February 2003 the Government launched Framework for the Future, its vision for public libraries, with the aim to promote public libraries, set out why libraries matter to everyone and illustrate how they can best serve their communities in the 21st century.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...At the heart of the vision is the promotion of reading and informal learning; access to digital skills and services including e-government and measures to tackle social exclusion, build community identity and develop citizenship.  The three-year Action Plan prepared by Resource and developed with a wide range of partners, aims to help library services to achieve the Framework vision.  It presents a range of projects and programmes covering the three key development themes for public libraries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The Framework for the Future: Action Plan 2003-06 is available on the Resource website at &lt;<a href="http://www.resource.gov.uk/action/framework/framework.asp">http://www.resource.gov.uk/action/framework/framework.asp</a>&gt;. A pamphlet summarising Turning Vision into Action for Public Libraries is also available on the website.  Hard copies are available by emailing a request to &lt;info&#064;resource.gov.uk&gt;.&quot;</p>

<h4>eBooks Get Serious: Sales expected to top $10 million in 2003, Unit Sales Grow 40% Over 2002</h4>

<p>&quot;New York, NY -- September 16, 2003 -- Churning steadily just below the high profile of the music industry's digital drama, electronic publishing has quietly become a major force in the worlds of media and technology.  In the first half of this year, alone, eBook sales revenues are up by 30% and unit sales up by 40% over the same period in 2002.  This compares to an annual growth rate of just about 5% in traditional print publishing.  The Open eBook Forum (OeBF), the electronic publishing industry's trade and standards organization, reveals detailed statistics on the current state of eBooks and provides a comprehensive industry analysis in its first quarterly eBook and eDocument Publishing and Retail Statistics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Compiled from data submitted by 34 of the world's leading publishers and retailers, the analysis marks the first-ever quantitative assessment of the electronic publishing industry.&quot;</p>

<h4>Project announced to develop DOIs for scientific data: German National Library of Science and Technology joins IDF</h4>

<p>&quot;15 September 2003: The International DOI Foundation is pleased to welcome a new member, the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB), the world's largest library of science and technology. TIB is to act as IDF contact for a major project, initially of one year duration from 1 October, made possible by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), which will implement the use of DOIs to persistently identify scientific data sets. The project is co-ordinated by the World Data Center for Climate (WDCC) at the Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Meteorologie in Hamburg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This follows from earlier work by a National Committee of CODATA, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology of the International Council for Science (<a href="http://www.icsu.org">http://www.icsu.org</a>), resulting in a report "Concept of Citing Scientific Primary Data" in May 2002 recommending the use of DOIs. A continuation through a one year project for pilot implementation has now been made possible by a grant from DFG, the central research organisation that promotes research at universities and other publicly financed research institutions in Germany.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A team from several data centres, led by Dr. Michael Lautenschlager at the World Data Centre for Climate, will focus on providing a means of publicly registering data sets with a persistent identifier and structured basic description. The pilot deployment will use geo-reference data (e.g., from observational stations, satellites, and climate models), but will in principle be extensible to any scientific data. This use of DOI will provide for the effective publication of primary data using a persistent identifier for long-term data referencing, allowing scientists to cite and re-use valuable primary data. The DOI's persistent and globally resolvable identifier, associated to both a stable link to the data and also a standardised description of the identified data, offers the necessary functionality and also ready interoperability with other material such as scientific articles. &quot;</p>

<h4>DOI funding success good news for digital print industry</h4>

<p>&quot;11 September 2003: A new project assisting Australia's digital print industry was launched in Canberra yesterday  by the Federal Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, The Hon Ian Macfarlane MP&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The project will trial a significant new enabling technology, called Digital Object Identifier (DOI), that will assist the digital print industry in developing its economic potential.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Coordinated by Copyright Agency Limited [CAL], this important endeavour has been made possible thanks to a $500,000 grant from the Federal Government's Book Production -- Enhanced Printing Industry Competitiveness Scheme (EPICS). The EPICS scheme funds projects that encourage the use of innovative technologies, improved business practices and training and skills development.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...CAL and its partners have chosen the university sector to begin trials of DOI-enabled technology. Over the coming months a series of pilot programs will be undertaken with the aim of developing an online model for the delivery of coursepack material to students.&quot;</p>

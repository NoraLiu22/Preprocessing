The amended Terms supersede all previous versions.<br/><br/><strong>10) Agreement to Arbitrate</strong><br/>In consideration of and as a condition of your use of the Site you and C16 (collectively, “<strong>the parties</strong>”) agree as follows (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”):<br/>‍<br/><em>Applicability; Exclusions; Court and Jury Trial Waiver</em><br/>‍<br/>The parties agree that any and all covered disputes (as defined below) that either party has the legal right to sue for in court, whether now or in the future, shall be subject to final and binding arbitration under the arbitration provisions set forth below. This means that the parties have selected arbitration as the sole and exclusive forum for the parties to sue or be sued in for all covered disputes, regardless of when the dispute first arose or arises and irrespective of the time period(s) involved in the dispute. The term “<strong>covered disputes</strong>” means all disputes and claims between the parties, including any disputes or claims: arising out of or relating to these Terms; relating to the relationship between the parties; and all other claims or disputes under federal, state, and local statutes and laws, municipal ordinances, executive orders, contract, tort, public policy, or common law (judge-made law).<br/>‍<br/>The parties intend to require arbitration of all covered disputes that can lawfully be arbitrated. It is understood by the parties that the term “covered disputes” shall cover and include all such disputes not only between the parties to these Terms but also all disputes or claims against any of your heirs, executors, personal representatives, and assigns, and all such disputes or claims not only against C16 but also against any and all of its affiliates, subsidiaries, and parents collectively and its and their predecessors and successors and any of its and their collective officers, agents, employees, members, shareholders, directors, managers, and attorneys.<br/>‍<br/><em>Usage of JAMS Streamlined or Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; Arbitrator to Decide All Issues; Arbitrator’s Decisions Are Final and Binding</em><br/>‍<br/>Either party shall initiate arbitration under either the JAMS Streamlined or Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (which are currently available for review at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/" target="_blank" class="text-link">https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/</a>). The arbitrator (and not a court) shall decide all issues in any covered dispute including, but not limited to, issues regarding the non-availability of class arbitration, timeliness, scope of arbitrator’s authority, arbitration procedures, any issues regarding arbitrability of the parties’ dispute, statute of limitations, and all other issues regarding the application, interpretation, and implementation of these Terms. The arbitrator’s decisions shall be final and binding. The parties agree that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter a judgment upon the award made by the arbitrator or to confirm an arbitration award, and any such proceeding shall not itself be deemed a covered dispute.<br/>‍<br/><em>Selection and Authority of Arbitrator; Full Remedies Available; Enforceability</em><br/>‍<br/>The parties agree that a single arbitrator shall be selected by the parties consistent with the applicable JAMS Rules and Procedures as they exist at the time of the Terms’ execution. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall have the power and authority to award any remedy or relief available under applicable law and shall be the sole authority to interpret and apply the provisions of these Terms. The arbitrator shall have the authority to apply any federal, state, local, or municipal law, or executive order, or any common law that the Arbitrator deems applicable to the covered dispute. If there are any ambiguities in these Terms, it is the parties’ intent that all ambiguities be resolved in favor of arbitration. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.<br/>‍<br/><em>Class and Collective Action Waiver; No Consolidated or Joint Actions<br/>‍</em><br/>The parties agree that all covered disputes brought against each other will be arbitrated on an individual basis only and not in a class action arbitration, a collective action arbitration, or on any other group, representative, consolidated, or joint basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any covered dispute or any claim or issue in a covered dispute on any basis other than on an individual basis and may not proceed or direct the parties to proceed on a class or collective action basis or consolidate or join one or more covered disputes pertaining to you with any other individual’s or entity’s covered dispute(s). The provisions in this Arbitration Agreement mean that both parties waive their right to commence, become a party to, or in any way participate in any class action, collective action, or group or representative action or claim against the other party or in any such action or claim consolidated or joined with another party, with respect to any covered dispute, and each party agrees to opt-out of or be severed from any such action or proceeding.<br/>‍<br/><em>Fees, Award<br/>‍</em><br/>The parties agree that they shall share equally (each pay one-half) the fees and costs of the arbitrator and the fees and costs of arbitration charged by JAMS; except: (i) that the filing fees will be paid by you; and (ii) as otherwise required by law. Each party shall bear the cost of his/her/its own legal fees and costs, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees, subject to any right to recover such fees and costs under applicable law, which the arbitrator shall apply where applicable. In rendering an arbitration award, the arbitrator shall apply applicable and appropriate law and shall award all statutory remedies and penalties, including attorneys’ fees and costs to the extent authorized by and consistent with law. The award shall be in writing and the arbitrator shall set forth the essential findings of fact and law. Either party may request that a transcript and/or recording of the hearing be made.<br/><br/><strong>11) Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong><br/>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SITE WILL BE CORRECTED.

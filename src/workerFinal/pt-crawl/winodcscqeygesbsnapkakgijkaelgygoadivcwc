      <p align="left" class="style3">Improvisation  is a word – like chance, indeterminacy, and aleatory – which may have a specific  meaning, but has come to denote different things to different people. Its  definition and various forms and styles of practice have no doubt changed over  time and according to place. Certainly, concepts of improvisation in Middle  Eastern music have differed from those in the Far East or in the diverse  civilizations spread over the continent of Africa.  Looking at Europe, and the development over the past 700 years of what we call  classical music, we know that improvisation played an important role, though, lacking  audio recordings, we have no precise idea how Bach sounded when he improvised  at the organ (despite the surviving written accounts), or the full extent of  Mozart’s ability to spontaneously create a cadenza in one of his piano concertos  – which, given the largely unchanged harmonic conventions from his time to  ours, may not have been that much different from the manner in which Count  Basie filled in the open spaces of a Buster Harding or Neal Hefti arrangement. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">Nevertheless,  despite these origins, by the 20th century the classical world came  to look upon improvisation with disdain and distrust. The composer had been  elevated to the top of the classical hierarchy, with the score as his icon and  the orchestral conductor as sole arbiter in his absence; in chamber music, the  responsibility for accuracy and total adherence to the score was equally  binding. Exceptions emerged, as they did in all the arts, as revolutionaries,  outsiders who intended to upset the status quo, sought ways to break free from  the constraints enforced by the establishment. Ironically, even the  controversial and widely condemned 12-tone theories of Schönberg and his  disciples were initially an attempt to maintain the supremacy of the composer  and the singlemindedness of the compositional process in a world where  governments, societal canons, and cultural traditions were crumbling. It wasn’t  until the 1950s that the iconoclastic ideas of John Cage began to make a  serious dent in the hegemony of classical music. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">Though  Cage had been composing with idiosyncratic post-Schönberg methods as early as  1931 and spent the ‘40s experimenting with percussion ensembles, the prepared  piano, and systems influenced by Eastern philosophies, 1951 saw his first  venture into chance-derived composing, using the <em>I Ching </em>as his guide. By abdicating the ego-motivated  responsibilities of the composer, Cage became the figurehead for a number of  like-minded composers who were exploring ways to involve the performer in the  process of not just re-creating, but <em>making</em> music. Cage did not invent the idea of graphic, or non-notational scores, but  he, Morton Feldman, and Christian Wolff, among others, conceived ideas in the  1950s that gradually took hold. As Wolff explained, it was an attempt “to  turn the making of music into a collaborative and transforming activity  (performer into composer into listener into composer into performer, etc.), [from]  the cooperative character of the activity to the exact source of the music. To  stir up, through the production of the music, a sense of social conditions in  which we live and of how these might be changed.”</p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">To do so, they created scores that required performers to <em>craft</em> a “realization”—that is, a  carefully, conscientiously, and accurately gauged response to proposed musical conditions  and indeterminate (unpredictable) possibilities. The performers were charged to  variously choose their own notes, create rhythmic patterns, determine durations  and attacks, and affect their group alignment, but in an environment of music-making  that was <em>not </em>considered improvisational  (despite the almost endless misconceptions that resulted, and still, alas,  exist). So when, in 1957, composer/pianist Lukas Foss founded a group called  the Improvisation Chamber Ensemble, he considered their approach to be radical  and unique in classical music. Foss used the ensemble, and his particular ideas  about improvisation, to provide interludes between the conventionally notated  movements of his 1960 composition “Time Cycle,” and in 1961 released an album  entitled <em>Studies In Improvisation</em> (RCA). But, just as Cage saw no relation between his indeterminate scores and  the style of improvisation used by jazz musicians up to this time, Foss deemed  his method of improvisation distinct from jazz – and from Cage’s chance-derived  compositional methodology as well. Of course, jazz at this time featured  improvisation within the confines of predetermined blues and song forms;  something which neither composer apparently had any interest in. Ornette  Coleman and Cecil Taylor were, in 1957, expanding song form through their  improvisations, but had not yet broken free of it. But Foss’ comments (quoted  from the booklet that accompanied the LP) show how most “serious” musicians  felt about jazz: “To the classically trained musician, improvisation means  something makeshift, random, haphazard…a form of self-indulgence.” </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">In Foss’ words, “We do not play ‘anything that comes to  mind,’ rather, we play ‘anything that comes to mind within a pre-determined,  limited sound-conception.’” And further, “System and chance form the basis for  ensemble improvisation, but <em>the performer  holds the reins</em>. [His italics.] His task is to find the appropriate note,  rhythm, phrasing, dynamic, register on his instrument, and at a moment’s  notice. He <em>corrects </em>[my italics]  chance rather than surrenders to chance – chance controlled rather than chance  in control.” (Thus Foss’ attitude towards Cage.) In order to “correct” chance,  Foss and his collaborators (Richard Dufallo, clarinet; Howard Colf, cello; and  Charles Delancey, percussion) reserved the right to shape their pieces in  advance. “Without order, direction, and discipline, there can be no ensemble  improvisation. In fact, ensemble improvisation is not possible unless specific  ordering principles have been determined beforehand. This involves a study of  musical freedom within a controlled field: a study of predetermined  coordination of non-predetermined musical ideas,” Foss wrote. In effect, he was  describing the sense of inevitability that often distinguishes a composition  from a free improvisation – the feeling that there is a common, perceivable  goal which the various components are working toward, as opposed to that of an  ensemble spontaneously constructing its own environment. While allowing the  musicians to choose some of the specific details which would fill the  preconceived form, he was not yet ready to give complete responsibility for the  form itself over to the perceived imperfections of spontaneous group interplay  – what the philosopher and music critic Theodor Adorno once called the  “approximate values” which he felt had no place in classical music. Thus they  “democratically” designated points of reference – harmonic “guide tones;” areas  of leadership, support, or counterpoint; cued entrances and durations; even  occasional notated themes. With so many of the musical parameters worked out in  advance, it doesn’t seem like chance had much of a chance.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">Not surprisingly, the music of the Improvisation Chamber  Ensemble sounds, for the most part, composed – which is not all bad. In their  “Fantasy and Fugue,” they set up a series of opportunities for shifting  relationships between the instruments – treacherous clarinet and cello clashing  against the piano’s foundation, a brief rhapsodic cello interlude, canonic phrases,  staggered dance-like motifs, culminating in layered fugal lines. They varied  their harmonic frameworks between diatonic, modal, and atonal maneuvers. Even at  their most spontaneous sounding, however – in the sparse and responsive “Music  for Clarinet, Percussion, and Piano” and the eloquently sculpted melodies and  combined events of “Quintet (Moirai)” – their ideas could have come from a  single composer, for example, Morton Feldman’s numerically-generated graph  paper scores. Though they were an interesting step along the way, ICE had not  yet overcome the classical prejudice against improvisational form. By measuring  their success or failure against established compositional values, they proved  to be more conventional than Cage and his cohorts, who were proposing not just  new music, but new attitudes that accepted new formal relationships. In ICE,  the mindset of the composer still held sway. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">There is an irony in the fact that the Improvisation  Chamber Ensemble consisted of classical musicians who wanted to examine  improvisation as an isolated technique rather than a consolidated process,  whereas today a quartet of musicians primarily identified with improvisation  through jazz, free jazz, and free improv experiences – clarinetists Theo  Jörgensmann and Etienne Rolin, violinist/violist Albrecht Maurer, and bassist  Kent Carter – have chosen to name themselves the Rivière Composers’ Pool. The  implication is striking; it may have taken 50 years, but improvisers working  from a composer’s perspective have achieved the kind of formal coherence and grace  comparable to specific forms of classical composition. The Emanem label has  released a three-CD set of their studio and live performances, <em>Summer Works 2009</em>, which expand upon  Foss’ historical premise in ways which are comparable to today’s free jazz  musicians’ relationship to Coleman and Taylor’s position in 1957. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">The widespread belief that free improvisation <em>is</em> spontaneous composition (and which  Martin Davidson touches upon in his album notes) comes in part from the broader  acceptance of the vagaries of form and the appreciation of new sounds and  unfamiliar styles that were proposed by Cage’s work throughout his career, and  in part because of the expanded methodologies which improvisers developed over  time. Jörgensmann, Rolin, Maurer, and Carter are examples of musicians  comfortable in a variety of improvisational styles because of something Foss  did not have fifty years ago: experience. In fact, I consider the music on <em>Summer Works 2009 </em>to be closer to Foss’  intentions – that is to say, a classical format – than to other styles of free improvisation  or free jazz because, through countless opportunities to improvise in different  settings and the familiarity they have achieved with each other (Davidson  wisely maps out their various collaborations), they have learned how to <em>internalize</em> and assemble spontaneously  and collectively the types of strategies Foss and his colleagues pre-arranged. (Interestingly,  this same sense of stylistic familiarity and internalized form is what enabled  the 1949 Lennie Tristano group to create what are widely considered the first  free group improvisations in jazz.) Using Foss’ own criteria, they <em>have</em> studied musical freedom within  several types of controlled fields and devised methods of coordination that are  compositional in sound and nature, and exhibit “order, direction, and  discipline.” Etienne Rolin’s description is remarkably similar, when he  pinpoints “the coordination of aural information, instrumental reflex, and  formal perception within the quartet.”</p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">To my ear, their music displays  classical melodic contours and gestures – a sense of tension in the  anticipation of how their interactive details will resolve harmonically;  frequent manipulation of tonal gravity to dramatic effect and brief but pungent  textural effects. (Rolin tends to be more extravagant in this regard than the  linear, lyrical Jörgensmann, and he adds alto flute on occasion for another  color.) Their formal relationships are sympathetic and transparent – often it’s  possible to follow the improvisational logic as they find and then sustain the  nature of a specific piece. Dance-like, animated rhythms contrast with fluid or  crisp counterpoint and more complex exchanges and designs. But it’s the group  empathy – the roles they adopt in interacting to shape and reshape the music –  that creates the convincing, engaging balance of formal proportion and  surprising detail. This is what improvisation can bring to compositional  procedures, and the members of the Rivière Composers’ Pool show how ensemble improvisation  has become a medium not just of freedom, but of trust.      </p>

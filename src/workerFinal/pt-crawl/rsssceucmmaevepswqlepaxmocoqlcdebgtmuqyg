        Up
        until the 1970s all recording systems were 'analogue': the
        variations
        in voltage coming from the microphone were amplified and applied
        to the
        variable movement of a groove, the width of an optical track, or
        the
        intensity of magnetization of tape. Digital recording developed
        slowly
        at
        first, used in recording studios for making the master recording
        which
        would then become a gramophone record. The electrical signal
        representing the sound was sampled at very frequent intervals -
        thousands of times a second - and its level at each instant
        described
        as a number in the binary code used in computers. <br>
        <br>
        The early
        methods often involved tape mechanisms adapted from video
        recorder
        techniques; at the beginning of the 1980s the popular Compact
        Disc
        system became available to the public, providing high quality,
        no wear
        in use, and easy use (though 'Perfect Sound Forever', as
        advertised,
        was open to debate).<br>
        <br>
        When computer technology evolved to the
        state where this digital audio could be recorded onto a hard
        disk the
        system came into its own: now it was 'non-linear'. Tape is a
        linear
        medium - you have to spool through it to find a particular
        place.
        Gramophone records, though of course they have one continuous
        groove,
        are non-linear to the extent that you can go straight to
        any point on a side - but obviously not editable. Hard disk
        systems
        could find any point immediately, and could move a section of
        the
        recording from one place to another; the order in which the
        information
        was recorded on the hard disk didn't matter since the machine
        could be
        instructed to play the audio in any required order - thus
        providing
        truly non-linear editing. You could cut a bit out of a
        recording, and
        if you didn't like the result, just put it back: and copying
        through
        several generations didn't degrade the quality in the way that
        analogue
        systems inevitably did.<br>
        <br>
        <img style="width: 418px; height: 286px; float: right;" alt="DAR
          Soundstation" src="images/soundstation.gif" hspace="10"
          vspace="3">The
        first digital editors used dedicated hardware: the first one I
        saw was
        the DAR SoundStation (right) which we had on demo briefly in
        1989. The
        display
        showed a tape-like travelling waveform: where with tape we'd
        moved the
        tape backwards and forwards by hand to find the place (we called
        it
        'inching' but for some reason it's now called 'scrubbing') the
        Soundstation had a wheel with an indent for your finger (oddly
        called a
        'thumbwheel' though you would be unlikely to use your thumb);
        rotating
        this felt very much like moving tape. You marked the start and
        end of
        the edit with a button, hit delete, and your edit was done (and
        undoable). It was a glimpse of a completely different method of
        working, and a very attractive one.<br>
        <br>
        We never actually used the
        SoundStation: we did have one AMS AudioFile, which was similar
        but much
        more complex (and not very user-friendly) - it was used for
        assembling
        radio plays piecemeal in much the same way that film sound
        editing was
        done, but of course the results had to be copied to tape in real
        time
        so that they could be played out on-air.<br>
        <br>
        Only when personal
        computers and networks with central servers became powerful
        enough to
        handle large amounts of audio (and pump it round a large
        building) did
        digital audio really come into its own for broadcasting. There
        were
        many competing systems, and I'm not going to attempt to discuss
        them
        here - the World Service experience gives a good idea of how the
        process developed. <br>
        <br>
        <img style="width: 427px; height: 273px; float: left;" alt="Cool
          Edit" src="images/cooledit.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="3">The
        first method to go into use was digital recording and editing
        using a
        computer screen, with programs such as Cool Edit (left) (which
        later
        became Adobe Audition). By using the mouse to select parts of
        the
        waveform, edits could be made: though 'scrubbing' wasn't
        practicable -
        one became adept at finding the place by eye. Of course edits
        could
        easily be checked and remade if necessary. Other systems were in
        use,
        particularly the very complex <a
          href="http://www.sadie.com/sadie_home.php">SADiE</a>,
        which had its own hardware (and a very steep learning curve).<br>
        <br>
        <a name="radioman"></a>This
        was still a localized system: the results still had to be copied
        to
        tape to go to the studio. The development which made all the
        difference
        was the use of a central server, and PCs ('workstations') in
        each
        studio and office, so that recordings once made in one studio
        were
        available to edit or play out anywhere else (though there was
        usually a
        permissions method to restrict access to those who should have
        it).<br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 571px;
            height: 432px;" alt="RadioMan playlist"
            src="images/radioman.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="3"><br>
        </div>
        A number of systems were tried
        over several years, including Dave 2000, Netia and DaCapo before
        Jutel's <a
          href="https://www.jutel.fi/radio-broadcast-automation/"
          target="_blank">RadioMan</a>
        was decided on (on factors which included not only usability but
        support and availability): it came into use from 2004 (though
        News
        decided to stick with Dave 2000, which they had been using for
        some
        time). As before,
        recordings would be made in a studio on a local PC , then saved
        to
        the server. The producer could tinker with his programme to his
        heart's content in his office: then for transmission the
        producer would
        assemble a playlist (above) which could be accessed in the
        studio.<br>
        <br>
        It's important to understand that the
        items in the playlist are not the actual recordings, just
        pointers to
        them. If you delete an item from the playlist you don't delete
        the
        original recording; items can be added, deleted, or moved around
        in the
        running order very easily, so there is complete flexibility in
        organizing the transmission. It's possible to 'chain' items if
        desired,
        and a countdown to the end is shown. Items turn up on
        alternating
        faders (so you do need to be clear which fader is next) which
        means
        that one item can be faded under the next; you can even check
        the end
        of an item which is currently playing.<br>
        <br>
        Like any new system,
        there were teething problems. (Tape had been around for so long
        - forty
        years - that there was no-one who remembered the teething
        troubles it
        gave, or the previous methods.) It was possible to make
        operational
        errors that could paint you into a corner: and unlike tape,
        where the
        worst a machine can do is eat the tape which is on it at the
        moment, if
        any digital system of this sort fails it takes the entire
        transmission
        with it (and if the server or network fails the results get
        quite
        exciting). There were backup procedures, but inevitably there
        were
        difficulties at first. <br>
        <br>
        <img style="width: 370px; height: 197px; float: right;"
          alt="RadioMan control pad" src="images/rmpad.jpg" hspace="10"
          vspace="5">Control
        of the items is done from keys on the desk, a mouse and standard
        keyboard, or from
        a dedicated control pad which gives access to all the important
        facilities (right).<br>
        <br>
        Once fully installed and running, this
        system makes a huge change in the way broadcasting can be done.
        Recordings don't have to be physically carried round the
        building: a
        producer in his office can amend the running order of a
        transmission
        currently on-air; and complete assembly of programmes from the
        component items can be done in an office on headphones (not
        always with
        desirable results).<br>
        <br>
        One issue is that non-technical staff,
        watching an experienced operator doing tape editing at a very
        fast
        speed, are impressed by the appearance of this and think it's
        the
        difficult bit: give an untrained producer a computer editing
        system and
        he can do just as well. Of course, the important thing is
        knowing <span style="font-style: italic;">where</span>
        to cut, not how fast you can do it - it's vital to maintain the
        natural
        pace of edited speech, avoiding over-short pauses, double
        breaths, and
        so on: I've heard any amount of bad editing as a result of these
        developments (which is a failing in training rather than the
        equipment
        itself).<br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 719px;
            height: 469px;" alt="Radioman-equipped studio"
            src="images/s14.jpg"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        However
        on the whole it proved a valuable method to replace tape. The
        photo
        above shows a
        small studio equipped with RadioMan; at the time it was taken
        the older
        technology still hadn't been removed (CD players would always be
        necessary, but Darts and Minidiscs were by then no longer in
        use). With
        the closure of Bush House in 2012 and the move to the new
        Broadcasting
        House I understand that a different playout system is now in use
        but
        the general principles will be the same.<br>
        <br>
        So
        we've seen the development from no recording at all, through
        steel
        tape, discs and modern magnetic tape to a centralized system
        where
        recordings can be immediately available anywhere required. I
        offer no
        predictions on what will come next.<br>

<p>The tale of a young bride joining her husband on the barge where he works with the coarse, ursine Père Jules (Michel Simon), L’Atalante is rooted in a pungent, earthy naturalism that, in Vigo’s hands, becomes the springboard for flights of film poetry. Estranged by boredom, then separated when Juliette (Dita Parlo) flees for the excitements of Paris, the film visualises the lovers’ mutual longing with sensuous immediacy, as when Jean dives into the Seine and imagines his lost love in the water alongside him. Vigo’s open-air spontaneity and low-budget lyricism were a key influence on the French New Wave of the late 1950s and 1960s.</p>

<p>“No one achieved more in less time than Jean Vigo – how would the history of cinema be different if he had lived past 29? L’Atalante remains raw, strange, radical and singular. You don’t watch it so much as you are immersed in it, swimming through visions like the lovesick barge captain when he plunges into the river in search of his lost bride. No film embodies more fully and purely the inherent fluidity, surrealism, realism, eroticism and ghostliness of cinema.” <strong>Imogen Sara Smith</strong></p>

Estranged by boredom, then separated when Juliette (Dita Parlo) flees for the excitements of Paris, the film visualises the lovers’ mutual longing with sensuous immediacy, as when Jean dives into the Seine and imagines his lost love in the water alongside him. Vigo’s open-air spontaneity and low-budget lyricism were a key influence on the French New Wave of the late 1950s and 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No one achieved more in less time than Jean Vigo – how would the history of cinema be different if he had lived past 29? L’Atalante remains raw, strange, radical and singular. You don’t watch it so much as you are immersed in it, swimming through visions like the lovesick barge captain when he plunges into the river in search of his lost bride. No film embodies more fully and purely the inherent fluidity, surrealism, realism, eroticism and ghostliness of cinema.” <strong>Imogen Sara Smith</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Jean Vigo","producer":"Jacques-Louis Nounez","writer":"Jean Vigo, Albert Riéra","featuring":"Michel Simon, Dita Parlo, Jean Dasté"},"year":"1934","nameAndYear":"L'Atalante (1934)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":89,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":34,"tied":false,"category":"critics"},{"position":46,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":{"critics":[{"firstname":"Jason","surname":"Anderson","slug":"jason-anderson","name":"Jason Anderson","sortName":"Anderson, Jason","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Short Cuts Programmer, Toronto International Film Festival ","country":"Canada","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/jason-anderson"},{"firstname":"Dudley","surname":"Andrew","slug":"dudley-andrew","name":"Dudley Andrew","sortName":"Andrew, Dudley","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Professor emeritus of Comparative Literature and Film Studies, Yale University","country":"USA","remarks":[{"type":"p","key":"A maddening exercise this has proved, but one with some value nevertheless.

It's a snapshot of what seems to be the ten most important films to me in various ways but undoubtedly will keep evolving sooner than later. Some might think that the large number of black and white pre-widescreen films might reflect living through two and a half years of a pandemic with significant lockdowns, a narrowing view of a bleaker world. I'm happy to have included some wider and more colourful horizons. The concerning, most regrettable aspect is that so many great filmmakers are not represented here. My apologies to them and their genius. Tomorrow and the days after they may return to another top ten or preferably twenty. The masterworks of John Ford, Jean Renoir, Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, Howard Hawks, Ernst Lubitsch, Abbas Kiarostami, Edward Yang, Sergei Eisenstein, Bernardo Bertolucci, Charles Chaplin, Patricio Guzmán, Luchino Visconti etc. all deserve a place in any pantheon. A permanent and unique top ten films of all time seems impossible but perhaps this indeed is one of the rules of the game.

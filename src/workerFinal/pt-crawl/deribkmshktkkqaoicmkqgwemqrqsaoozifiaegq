<P>
A common critique of the World Wide Web(WWW), and the Internet
in general, is that while there are numerable and usefulness information
sources that are accessible, identification of significant resources
is not as efficient and effective as many desire. To facilitate
access to selected WWW and other Internet resources, a prototype
demonstration service called CyberStacks(sm) (<A HREF="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~CYBERSTACKS/">http://www.public.iastate.edu/~CYBERSTACKS/</A>)
has been created that has adapted the classification scheme used
by the Library of Congress and other major research libraries
to identify and organize significant reference resources in a
variety of scientific and technological disciplines.
<P>
The Library of Congress classification system is a well-established
scheme that has been used by libraries worldwide for organizing
a variety of other publications and media for generations. Within
its schedules, this classification system not only denotes subject
coverage and content, but information format and conceptual relationship
as well. It is believed that the scheme offers the context and
structure that can facilitate identification of relevant WWW and
other Internet resources.
<P>
CyberStacks(sm) has applied the classification scheme at a deep
level of specificity and description and has incorporated resources
within a hypertexted framework that allows users to browse through
a virtual library stacks with resources in order by their respective
classification number. CyberStacks(sm), thus, seeks to make full
use of capability of the WWW itself and the versatility of Web
browsers in its description and presentation of selected resources.
Key to the CyberStacks(sm) system is a browsable classification
scheme that allows users to scan broader or narrower subject categories
at will, and then if desired to connect directly to a selected
resource. The structure, organization and access provided by CyberStacks(sm)
represents the convergence, merger and fusion of a subject-ordered
catalog and an associated collection, where like materials stand
together in the stacks.
<P>
Through a variety of links, users themselves have the option of
nominating resources for inclusion within CyberStacks(sm), or
to request that a specific type of publication be made available
as a Web publication within it. Several Virtual Advisory Boards
are in the process of formation to assist with its further development
and refinement, and interested specialists are encouraged to participate.
<P>
In its selection of resources for incorporation, CyberStacks(sm)
has adopted many of the same philosophies and guidelines used
in the selection of non-Internet resources by most librarians.
As with it overall scheme, CyberStacks(sm) seeks not be a digital
library per se, but a true 'virtual' collection.
<P>
CyberStacks(sm) is a demonstration prototype that has been made
available to a community of potential users for review and critique.
As much of it is still 'Under Construction', it would be premature
to bookmark or link to it at this time. It is hoped that with
the appropriate level of support, CyberStacks(sm) will become
a functioning service by July 1, 1996.
<P>
CyberStacks(sm) is an ongoing personal research project and its
availability does not constitute an endorsement by Iowa State
University, the Iowa State University Computation Center, nor
the Iowa State University Library. <I><B> </B></I><HR>

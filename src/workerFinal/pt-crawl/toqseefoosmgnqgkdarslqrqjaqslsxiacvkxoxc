            perhaps the earliest application of mathematical arguments to evolution, 
            <a href="../../lit/muller_1879.pdf">M&uuml;ller in 1879</a> 
            showed not only that each member of a pair of unpalatable species 
            could benefit from mimicry, but also that the ratio of advantages 
            for mimicry was greatly in favour of the rarer species -- in proportion 
            to the square of the ratio of relative abundances (<em>a</em><font size="-2">1</font>,<em>a</em><font size="-2">2</font>). 
            M&uuml;ller had earlier explained his idea in a brief note in 1878 
            (see <a

 href="muller1878.html">translation</a>), using a numerical example. M&uuml;ller 
            assumed that both species are equally unpalatable (the number taken 
            during learning, <i>n, </i>thus represents degree of palatability 
            in M&uuml;ller's treatment); however, the results also hold for unequal 
            palatabilities (see Mallet 1999. Causes and consequences of a lack 
            of coevolution in M&uuml;llerian mimicry. Evol Ecol 13: 777-806. <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/mimcoev.pdf"><strong>REPRINT</strong></a>).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is certainly the first precise model

of frequency-dependent selection of any sort.

&nbsp;M&uuml;ller's mimicry theory also models an Allee effect (a density-dependent effect

which

becomes more deleterious as density declines), as well as an example of a

mutualism

(mutually beneficial symbiosis). &nbsp;M&uuml;ller's treatment must surely

be

the first mathematical treatment of each of these topics, and it appears to be the first

mathematical

treatment of any evolutionary or ecological topic in a Darwinian

framework.</font></p>

  <p>Let <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> be the numbers

of two distasteful species of butterflies in some definite district

during one summer, and let <i>n</i> be the number of individuals of a

distinct species which are destroyed in the course of a summer before

its distastefulness is generally known. If both species are totally

dissimilar, then each loses <i>n</i> individuals. If, however, they

are undistinguishably similar, then the first loses&nbsp;<img

second&nbsp;<img src="Image26.gif" align="middle" height="53" width="61">.

The absolute gain [in numbers] by resemblance is therefore for the

absolute gain, compared with the occurrence of the species, gives for

the first,&nbsp;<img src="Image29.gif" align="middle" height="52"

<p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Ralph Meldola later

reported to Darwin that the reception of this paper, which he had read

in translation at the Entomological Society, had been lukewarm (even by

<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/Bates63.html">Henry

Walter Bates</a>, who in 1862 himself had recognized mimicry between

rare unpalatable species and commoner models). &nbsp;Meldola wrote:

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 545]]</font> Dr. Alfred 
        Russel Wallace is writing his autobiography, and its interest may find 
        some herald in the present talk which took place with him the other afternoon, 
        at his home down in Dorset.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, where the pine trees and the heather 
        are neighbours to the sea, he passes full days, for, although he is eighty 
        and two years older, he has the energy and the spirits of youth. He is 
        not only living his life over again in his reminiscences as he writes 
        them down, but he is adding to its activities by following closely and 
        cheerily the day's work of the world. When he looks out of his study window 
        in the morning it is to see the Purbeck Hills in the distance and the 
        gleam of the sea still further away. Beside him are his books and his 
        papers, telling eloquently, if quietly, what a busy, fruitful career his 
        has been, and how much he has achieved in it.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not to speak of that, however, that I 
        went to see him, for Dr. Russel Wallace finds other people and other things 
        much more interesting than himself, and it was only now and then that 
        his own personality crept, so to speak, into view. The phrase &quot;a dreamer 
        of dreams&quot; has been applied to more than one great man; and you can read 
        it in the blue, thoughtful eyes of this veteran, who, before most of us 
        began life, was dragging nature's secrets from her on the Amazon and in 
        the islands of far Malaya.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, and here the charm and simplicity 
        of the man came out in a sentence; &quot;Yes, I think the most fortunate thing 
        that happened to me was the loss, by the burning of the ship that carried 
        them, of many of the specimens as they were coming home from the Amazon. 
        Otherwise I should have gone back there, where Bates had been working 
        for years, while as the result of this accident I went to the Malay Archipelago, 
        a perfectly virgin country, which hardly any naturalist had then properly 
        explored. My experiences in the Far East were of singular interest to 
        me, and I look back upon them as standing for probably the best part of 
        my life.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 546]]</font> Now how 
        many people would give this blithe, radiant history of an incident which 
        meant the loss of the results of much valuable work? It was the same when 
        Dr. Russel Wallace went on to speak of Charles Darwin and of that extraordinary 
        drama of science, their simultaneous discovery, for so it may well be 
        called, of the great theory of Natural Selection.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What Darwin's surprise must have been,&quot; said 
        Dr. Russel Wallace, &quot;when he got my paper on Natural Selection it is easy 
        to understand, for he had long, as I thereupon learned, been developing 
        the identical theory. Sir Charles Lyell said to him, 'Well, I warned you 
        that somebody would get hold of the idea and bring it out, and now here, 
        you see, Wallace has been working on the same lines as yourself.' Darwin's 
        intention had been to set the thing out thoroughly in a large book which 
        would have taken years to write, and which might, in conception, be compared 
        to Spencer's system of philosophy. He modified that plan by preparing 
        'The Origin of Species'--for which he had an immense deal of material 
        to draw upon--the great book of the nineteenth century, the book most 
        far-reaching in its consequences on the thought and knowledge of the world.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Many people have asked me if I was not a little 
        disappointed to find that Darwin had anticipated me, because he had his 
        materials gathered and ready? For that very reason I was not disappointed. 
        I felt that while I could only have written a slight volume, he was able 
        to launch the discovery backed, first, by a mass of carefully compiled 
        evidence, and secondly, by his already very high reputation as a naturalist. 
        Everything was for the best, as perhaps it usually is. All this, indeed, 
        only brought Darwin and myself closer as friends, and in our respective 
        work we criticised each other faithfully as friends should. There were 
        several special points upon which we could not agree, and upon which we 
        stubbornly held our own views. This thought pained him, and the melancholy 
        way in which he spoke of it in some of his letters was most amusing.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for a chapter in the history of thought, 
        and now for Dr. Russel Wallace's memory of Charles Darwin the man, with 
        a word on Herbert Spencer.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A delightful man.&quot; That is how he summed up 
        Darwin. &quot;He had a vast deal of natural humour, which brimmed over in his 
        conversation and in his private writings making both so interesting. No 
        doubt the two greatest men I have known were Darwin, the naturalist, and 
        Spencer, the philosopher. A rather tragic fact which linked them was this: 
        they were both confirmed invalids, an infliction hard to bear. <font color="990000">[[p. 
        547]]</font> Darwin saw few people, because conversation, at all events 
        when it became debate, was apt to bring on his stomach trouble. Spencer, 
        again, suffered from chronic insomnia. His extreme argumentativeness, 
        as he says in his autobiography, was one of his great faults. Naturally, 
        however, that was not noticeable when he was with men of his own calibre, 
        like Huxley or Tyndall.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Spencer was very 
        musical, and he sometimes played the flute; accordingly, though he lived 
        in boarding-houses and thus among a lot of commonplace people, he said 
        the life suited him well enough. What he meant, I suppose, was that it 
        was rest and change to his intellect.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From science and the high road which Dr. Russel 
        Wallace has trodden so ardently, we turned to the other one of literature 
        and to Tennyson, also a seer into the future.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have not,&quot; remarked Dr. Russel Wallace, &quot;known 
        many great literary men, because I was away so many years, and because, 
        for the rest, I have been so closely occupied with my own special work. 
        But while I was living at Godalming I paid a visit to Tennyson, whose 
        Surrey home was not far off, and we had a most delightful hour or so together. 
        He wanted to see and talk to me about Spiritualism. He was practically 
        a Spiritualist, as his writings show, and he wished to hear of my personal 
        experiences in the matter.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After luncheon, when he had lighted his pipe, 
        we talked at considerable length. His poetry, as it seems to me, shows 
        a wonderful insight into science--he had the seeing eye, the vision into 
        the beyond. 'In Memoriam' is a marvellous poem, both for beauty of feeling 
        and the wonderful scientific anticipations which it voices. We talked 
        almost wholly of Spiritualism, and he spoke of trying to see something 
        himself, but we did, for a little while, drift to another subject.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As you will remember, there is in 'Enoch Arden' 
        a description of the paradise of the Tropics, and Tennyson was curious 
        to know if the local colour was correct. I was able to say that it was 
        perfectly correct.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Another case of this power of grasping local 
        conditions by intuition occurred to me when I read of the death of my 
        namesake, General Lew Wallace. His 'Ben Hur' has all the glow of the East 
        in its pages, and yet when he wrote it he had never been there. A third 
        case which one might mention occurs in a story by Charles Reade. It gives 
        a most realistic description of life on the Australian gold fields a full 
        half-century ago. Reade was never there, he knew nothing from actual experience, 
        and, as he explained, he got the local colour <font color="990000">[[p. 
        548]]</font> from a book, never very well known and now, I suppose, wholly 
        forgotten, which was written by William Howitt<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
        under, I think, the title 'Land, Labour, and Gold.'&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we had been speaking of men who possessed 
        in an eminent degree what Dr. Russel Wallace, making some allusion to 
        his own autobiography, called the faculty of language.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I never had it,&quot; he said, &quot;and the setting 
        down of these reminiscences has very much confirmed me in the belief. 
        What I mean, of course, is not that I have any difficulty in writing what 
        I want to say, but that, for example, I can never recall the words of 
        a conversation. And that is a real charm in biography and autobiography,--the 
        gift of reproducing a conversation, not necessarily as it took place, 
        but in a life-like fashion. I can't do it, and so it is a relief to me 
        to be able to draw upon the letters and other accumulated materials which 
        I have had lying beside me. I never kept a journal except when abroad, 
        but I constantly wrote to my friends at home; and these letters, as I 
        have been going over them, tell very freshly the story of my doings in 
        various quarters of the globe. But I would have liked, if only for this 
        present task of mine, to have had the faculty of language. Huxley had 
        it in a high degree, Darwin not so much. With Dickens, as the most casual 
        reader of him discovers, it was part of his genius.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name of Dickens thus came up, Dr. Russel 
        Wallace went on to express his admiration of his books.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can,&quot; he said, &quot;read him again and again, 
        and I cannot do that with Thackeray. Charlotte Bronte is another favourite 
        author of mine, and I have a real regard for some of Miss Braddon's<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
        stories. Might I speak as highly as one can of 'The Silence of Dean Maitland'<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> 
        and of the same author's other book, 'His Last Sentence.' These have struck 
        me as two of the most remarkable books of recent years, and the second 
        I think even finer than the other. People seem to grumble about the state 
        of our literature, but I cannot myself see much reason in that attitude. 
        True, we have not the great lights of a generation or two ago, no Scott, 
        no Dickens. Still we have our lights, and I should doubt if at any time 
        the quality of English literature, speaking generally, has been higher. 
        The amount of clever new work that comes out is perfectly surprising. 
        What I am really afraid about is that those who write good books do not 
        always get adequate recognition. Some years back there appeared Mr. W. 
        H. Hudson's work 'A Naturalist in La Plata.' It was widely read, I believe, 
        but that <font color="990000">[[p. 549]]</font> was a finer work than 
        Darwin's 'Voyage of the Beagle' or my own 'Malay Archipelago.' I suppose 
        we all have our discouragements, for I always remember the experience 
        of my first book, 'Travels on the Amazon,' which was published in 1853. 
        We printed 750 copies, and between the time that it appeared and the time 
        of my return from the Far East, we had sold--how many do you think?--five 
        hundred. However, the book in a cheaper edition still sells, which proves, 
        I take it, that it requires a name to make an average book sell.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Russel Wallace has gratitude for the Tropics 
        as well as praise. &quot;I was,&quot; he casually remarked, &quot;excessively delicate 
        as a child, so delicate that I was despaired of on three occasions during 
        my early years. Here I am, you see, at eighty-two fairly well, all things 
        considered, and still capable of doing a little work. I lived for twelve 
        years in the best portions of the glorious Tropical climate--those near 
        the Equator--with the sun and the sky, the wind and nature, always about 
        me, and it was then, I do not doubt, that I laid up the store of health 
        which is not yet, I am glad to say, exhausted.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colour of the Tropics will indeed be in 
        the coming autobiography, which everybody will read, as everybody will 
        wish that its author may long be spared to us.</p>

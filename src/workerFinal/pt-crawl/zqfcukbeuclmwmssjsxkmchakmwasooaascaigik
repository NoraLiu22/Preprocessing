The three laws of planetary motion Kepler developed transformed people's understanding of the Solar System and laid the foundations for the revolutionary ideas Isaac Newton produced later. Kepler is also thought to have written one of the first works of science fiction. However, he faced a number of challenges. He had to defend his mother from charges of witchcraft, he had few financial resources and his career suffered as a result of his Lutheran faith.  \nWith\nDavid Wootton\nProfessor of History at the University of York\n\nUlinka Rublack \nProfessor of Early Modern European History at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of St John's College\n\nAdam Mosley \nAssociate Professor in the Department of History at Swansea University \n\nProducer: Victoria Brignell."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p04l8fwv.jpg","duration":{"value":2922,"label":"48 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2016-12-29T11:30:00Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p04p6wsv","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:b087rt4z","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2017-01-12T00:00:00Z","label":"12 Jan 2017"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality"},"synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Nietzsche's On The Genealogy of Morality.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Nietzsche's influential ideas about what it means to be moral.","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Nietzsche's On The Genealogy of Morality - A Polemic, which he published in 1887 towards the end of his working life and in which he considered the price humans have paid, and were still paying, to become civilised.

The rise has been attributed to an increase of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, though it is not yet known conclusively what the source of those gases was.

The Pauli Exclusion Principle proposes that no two electrons in an atom can be at the same time in the same state or configuration, and it helps explain a wide range of phenomena such as the electron shell structure of atoms. Pauli went on to postulate the existence of the neutrino, which was confirmed in his lifetime.

In the West, there were new systems put in place to pray for the souls of the dead, on a greater scale, with opportunities to buy pardons to shorten time in Purgatory. The idea was enriched with visions, some religious and some literary; Dante imagined Purgatory as a mountain in the southern hemisphere, others such as Marie de France told of The Legend of the Purgatory of Saint Patrick, in which the entrance was on Station Island in County Donegal. This idea of purification by fire had appalled the Eastern Orthodox Church and was one of the factors in the split from Rome in 1054, but flourished in the West up to the reformations of C16th when it was again particularly divisive.\n\nWith\n\nLaura Ashe\nAssociate Professor of English and fellow of Worcester College at the University of Oxford\n\nMatthew Treherne\nProfessor of Italian Literature at the University of Leeds\n\nand\n\nHelen Foxhall Forbes\nAssociate Professor of Early Medieval History at Durham University\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0538jhg.jpg","duration":{"value":2918,"label":"48 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2017-05-25T10:33:46Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},{"id":"p054ldzq","type":"playable_item","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:b08rp369","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.5.0/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"release":{"date":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","label":"01 Jun 2017"},"titles":{"primary":"In Our Time","secondary":"Enzymes","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Enzymes"},"synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss enzymes, the catalysts essential for life.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss enzymes, the proteins that control the speed of chemical reactions in organisms which would otherwise happen too slowly to keep the organisms alive.","long":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss enzymes, the proteins that control the speed of chemical reactions in living organisms.

Kant argued that when someone was doing the right thing, that person was doing what was the universal law for everyone, a formulation that has been influential on moral philosophy ever since and is known as the Categorical Imperative. Arguably even more influential was one of his reformulations, echoed in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in which he asserted that humanity has a value of an entirely different kind from that placed on commodities.

News of the Great Siege of Malta spread fear throughout Europe, though that turned to elation when, after four months of horrific fighting, the Ottomans withdrew, undermined by infighting between their leaders and the death of the highly-valued admiral, Dragut.

There is also an argument that free radicals are a byproduct of normal respiration and over time they cause an accumulation of damage that is effectively the process of ageing.

To Kant, 'what may I hope' was one of the three basic questions which human reason asks, while Nietzsche echoed Hesiod, arguing that leaving hope in the box was a deception by the gods, reflecting human inability to face the demands of existence.

From 1678, they went to great lengths to support their scheme, forging evidence and identifying the supposed conspirators.

Anyone who doubted him had to keep quiet, to avoid being suspected a sympathiser and thrown in prison. Oates was eventually exposed, put on trial under James II and sentenced by Judge Jeffreys to public whipping through the streets of London, but the question remained: why was this rogue, who had faced perjury charges before, ever believed?\n\nWith\n\nClare Jackson\nSenior Tutor and Director of Studies in History at Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge\n\nMark Knights\nProfessor of History at the University of Warwick\n\nAnd\n\nPeter Hinds\nAssociate Professor of English at Plymouth University\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p03t5swt.jpg","duration":{"value":2945,"label":"49 mins"},"progress":null,"availability":{"from":"2016-05-12T10:21:39Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qykl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qykl","title":"In Our Time","synopses":{"short":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","medium":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas, people and events that have shaped our world.","long":null},"activities":[]},"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"activities":[],"play_context":null,"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"recommendation":null},"playQueuePlayCount":0,"isPlayQueueEnded":false},"tracklist":{"tracks":[]}}; </script>

<p align=justify><font size="3" face="Arial">If Atari and Magnavox had funds
to design complete lines of video games, there were other small businesses
that tried to enter the market as they could. Executive Games is a great
example.<br><br>

Executive Games Inc. of Dorchester, Massachusetts was incorporated in 1968
under the direction of owner <b>Peter Stepanek</b>. Games and novelty items,
such as chess and backgammon, were the company's original product line.
Foot-high chessmen and a plush checkered playing surface rug evidenced the
unique and novel appeal of one chess set.  By 1974, yearly sales had grown
to $2-million and the company was on the verge of a major two-fold product
expansion.<br><br>

Executive Games became one of the leading producers of home video games by
January 1976. The electronic games market flourished in late 1975 as a major
development in the consumer electronics industry, following hand-held
calculators and digital watches.  Until then high costs had restricted video
games to coin operated machines in public areas. Peter Stepanek recruited the
engineering skills of a group of M.I.T. students to develop a less expensive
version of these popular games: <b>Gabor Szakacs, Robert Dickson, Mike Shields,
Glen Dash, David Agans, and Joseph Corkery</b>. Glen Dash continued 
working on video games after the Executive Games plant closed in 1976. He was 
another key person in this field, not only for his unique competences in FCC 
testing, but also as an engineer. More details can be found at the end of this 
page about the works of Glen Dash.<br><br>

The company released two video game systems in 1975 and 1976: Electronic Television Tennis and Face Off (TV Hockey/Soccer). Electronic 
Television Tennis was the third American home video game system (excluding URL 
Video Action II and III. See why on <a href="url.htm">the URL page</a>). It 
passed the FCC tests only a month after Atari Pong and began selling in the fall 
of 1975. Executive Games continued to sell Television Tennis until October 1976. 
Despite being a small company, Executive Games managed to sell approximately 
65,000 Television Tennis games during that time (Magnavox produced 140,000
<a href="odyssey.htm">Odyssey</a> units in 1972, and only around 60,000 in 1975). Approximately 18,000 Face Off units were produced and approximately 13,000 
units were sold between October and December 1976. The remaining 5000 units were 
either sold as surplus in 1977 or went missing in a robbery of the Executive 
Games' Dorchester, Massachusetts plant just before the close of the 1976 
Christmas season.<br>
<br>
The whole history of Executive Games is detailed in a well-written business case 
study authored by an MIT student, Victor Tom, in 1977. Glen Dash, one of the MIT 
students who developed Television Tennis, made corrections to this document and 
sent it to us. Click <a href="ExecutiveGames.pdf">here</a> to read it. (It is in 
a PDF format so you may need to download the <a href="http://www.adobe.com">
Adobe Acrobat Reader</a> to view it.)<br>
<br>

<br>
Once you have read the PDF document, you might wonder why Executive Games did 
not design a single video game chip to lower the cost of their units and bring 
more advanced games. Here is the answer, which Glen Dash emailed us in March 
2003:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align=justify><i><font face="Arial">As far as I can remember, the chips that 
Atari and GI were making were the most complex LSI devices that, up until that 
time, had been designed for the consumer market. Though we knew of GI's 
intentions in 1975, we did not think that they could produce something on the 
order of six million of these devices in 1976 and early 1977. That was quite a 
remarkable performance. Secondly, timing in the games market is very tricky, and 
dangerous. While public demand greatly exceeded supply in 1975 and 1976, I am 
not sure if that was the case by Christmas of 1977. Anyone stuck with inventory 
when demand dried up would have been killed. I agree that we had a window in 
which to produce chips in 1976 and early 1977, but being successful in the games 
market in late 1977 and 1978 would have required extraordinary vision. (As I am 
sure you know, hand held games were a rage for a while and then Mattel's 
Intellivision and Atari's microprocessor based video game fought it out until 
the early 1980's. But that's a story for another time.)</font></i></p>

<p align=justify><font size="3" face="Arial">
David B Lamkins who originally did board-level repairs on Executive Games systems
and remembers really well the story of that company emailed David Winter
mid-2001 to tell what happened exactly.</font></p>

<tr><td bgcolor="#808080">
<p align=justify><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000040"><b>
Here's what I remember about Executive Games:
<br><br>
I was hired to do board-level repair on their TV tennis game.  I ended up
not only doing the repairs, but also running the repair department which
was four to five people besides me.
<br><br>
The game electronics were designed mostly by Glen Dash.  I believe that he
was still an MIT student at the time, working in MIT's "Innovation
Center".  The mechanical design was done by one of Glen's fellow students.  
I didn't have as much daily contact with this fellow, and can't recall his
name.  There was probably some kind of licensing agreement between
Executive Games and MIT, but I never knew the details.
<br><br>
Executive Games was owned and operated by the Stepanek family.  I think
the president was Peter Stepanek.  His two sons worked with him.  The
family ran another business from the same space, making canvas tote bags.  
I believe that company did business under the name "Totes".
<br><br>
Keep in mind that the electronic game business was in its infancy, and
that there were no trade-specific magazines, retail outlets, etc.  The
only trade show that was applicable was Toy Fair; I'm almost certain
that's how Executive Games introduced their products.  
<br><br>
The Stepaneks took advantage of their distribution channels for the tote
bags.  They sold totes to many of the large department-store retailers.
This gave them the connections they needed to get their TV tennis product
into the big stores.
<br><br>
The factory was located in the old Bakers Chocolate building in Milton,
MA.  My "office", shared by the four or five techs I supervised, was an
enclosed bridge above the alley between two buildings.  Occasionally a
trailer truck just an inch or two too tall would scrape beneath the
bridge, and everything would shake up and down.  There was no heating or
air conditioning in that space, so we ran lots of space heaters in the
winter and lots of fans in the summer.
<br><br>
Executive games made a big splash with the TV tennis game, which was the
first such game to retail at under $100.  This was either the Christmas
season before Atari's Pong hit the stores, or Pong started at a higher
price point - I'm not certain about the details.  Regardless, Executive
Games did OK that first season.
<br><br>
For the second season, Executive Games developed a TV Hockey/Soccer game.  
This was a two-player console with a built-in X-Y joystick and a button
for each player.  The button was used to "carry" the ball (puck).
<br><br>
There were a lot of companies in the TV game console market, and one
hurdle they all had to overcome was getting FCC approval for their RF
modulators.  Since Executive Games had successfully accomplished this feat
for two products, they sold their services to other game manufacturers.  
Glen Dash would take an untested game, bring it into the lab and perform
the same tests that the FCC would perform.  He'd make modifications as
necessary and tell the manufacturer how to change their design to pass the
FCC testing.  This was invaluable, since each attempt at FCC approval
could take months.  Being able to go in the this first time with a product
that met FCC requirements saved time and ensured that the product would
not miss the narrow window for Christmas sales.
<br><br>
Executive Games folded shortly after that second Christmas season.  At the
time, I was working in the MIT Innovation Center lab trying to find
suitable materials (focusing on conductive polymeres) to design a
low-cost, reliable X-Y joystick replacement for the TV Hockey/Soccer game.  
One day, I got a call from Glen saying that the factory had been
vandalized the previous night and that the Stepaneks would be closing the
business soon.
<br><br>
The technology behind both games was very similar.  These were
analog/digital hybrids.  There were about 25 to 30 14- and 16-pin chips
and a couple handfuls of discrete resistors, capacitors and transistors on
each circuit board.
<br><br>
As best I can recall (I didn't take schematics with me when I left) the
digital logic was used to generate the TV horizontal and vertical sync
timimg.  There was something unusual about that timing chain; I'm pretty
sure that the horizontal frequency was derived from the line frequency by
some kind of poor-man's PLL circuit.  Composite sync was generated using
summing resistors at the outputs of the timing chains.
<br><br>
The digital circuitry was built from SSI/MSI chips - basically gates and
counters - on two-sided PC boards.  I'm pretty sure that the original
production runs used 74LS-series chips and later runs adopted CMOS,
probably a mix of 74C- and 4xxx-series.  This was a quarter century ago,
so I'm really not certain about the details.
<br><br>
The player and ball were generated using analog window comparators.  A
window comparator's output is "on" when the input falls between a high
threshold and a low threshold.  Object position was determined by dragging
the pair of thresholds to higher and lower voltages while driving the
comparator's other input with a voltage ramp synchronized to the
horizontal or vertical sweep.  A pair of window comparators was used for
each object - one comparator for the vertical bounds of the object and the
other for the horizontal bounds.  (Actually, that's probably true only for
the ball position on TV Tennis.  I think the horizontal positioning of the
tennis players must have been generated digitally.  But on TV
Hockey/Soccer where the players had two degrees of freedom, they had to
use window comparators for both axes.)
<br><br>
Player position was generated by the hand controllers on TV Tennis - these
were a simple voltage divider that moved the comparator's window to a
higher or lower voltage depending upon the position of the potentiometer
in the controller.  On TV Hockey/Soccer, the principle was the
same.  However, there was an additional RC integrator that added a lag
between motion of the joystick and motion of the player on the screen to
give a feel of inertia to the player's movement.
<br><br>
The consoles connected to the TV set using an external pod.  A cable
carried power and video to the pod.  An RF oscillator tuned to channel 3
or 4 (approximately) was modulated with the video signal and coupled to
the antenna terminals of the TV through a switch that selected either the
game or the customer's normal antenna.  The pod was also designed by Glen
Dash, who later turned it into a construction project for one of the
electronic hobbyist magazines.
<br><br>
Neither game console played sound through the TV.  Adding an FM modulator
for the sound would have been prohibitively expensive.  Rather, a small
speaker mounted in the console itself played "pings" gated from an
appropriate tap on the timing chain.
<br><br>
I wish I remembered how hit detection was done.  Like everything else in
that circuit, it was friendishly simple.  I think there were simply AND
gates attached to the player and ball outputs.  If both the player and ball
were "on" at the same time, they had to be generating video at the same
spot on the screen, thus there was a collision between the objects.
<br><br>
The effect of a hit detection was pretty simple.  In TV Tennis, it
reversed the input to the integrator for the ball's horizontal position,
causing it to reverse direction on the screen.  There was some clever bit
of circuitry that affected the ball's vertical motion depending upon where
it hit the player vertically, but I don't remember how that worked.  TV
Hockey/Soccer behaved similarly, but there was an added button that would
slave the ball position to the player position allowing the player to
"carry" the ball.
<br><br>
Finally, there were a pair of seven-segment LEDs on the console for
scoring.  This was cheaper than generating on-screen characters with the
technology of the day.  I don't recall how a goal was detected - it was
probably another analog comparator.  A goal bumped the score counter for
the appropriate player and reset the ball position for the start of the
next round.
<br><br>
I hope this helps.  If you can locate anyone who still has schematics from
those consoles, I can refresh my memory and offer a more accurate and
complete explanation.

<p align=justify><font color="#69B4FA" size="5" face="Arial"><b>FCC Problems:</b></font></p>

<p align=justify><font face="Arial">Another interesting detail of this history: 
problems with FCC tests. Every video game system had to pass special FCC tests 
before going to production. Glen Dash sent us another email in April 2003 to 
explain what happened exactly:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align=justify><font size="3" face="Arial">
<i>The manner the FCC used for testing was not well documented so one had to see 
it to understand it. That is, in part, why most video games manufacturers in the 
mid 1970's had so much trouble getting FCC type approval. Even TV Tennis failed 
to pass the FCC on its first try. I made the changes and 
we passed the second time.<br>
<br>
Basically, the method used by the FCC involved a great deal of cable movement to 
maximize the emissions from the device under test. The cables moved were the 
power cable, the cable to the TV and in our case, the cable to the hand controls. 
If the FCC found any position of the cables that put the device over the limit 
by more than a couple dB at any frequency between 30 and 1000 MHz, the device 
would be failed. This coupled with very tough limits (15 uV/m at 1 meter from 
the device under test) and made things very difficult in those days.</i><br><br>

Revision C units were sometimes returned due to a joystick problem. These games 
used Zamco joysticks which were originally designed for quadraphonic audio 
systems. The joysticks were designed to control four separate audio channels, 
hence the four pots. The Zamco joysticks had a steel ball into which the 
joystick shaft was pressure-fitted. Some players would rest one hand on the unit 
and work the joystick with the other hand, causing an upward pressure on the 
joysticks which sometimes pulled the shaft out of the ball. The later molded-on 
ball of the in-house designed &quot;Launie&quot; joysticks survived this kind of pressure. 
Ken Launie was another MIT student.<br><br>
Glen Dash found the data on the sales and returns of Face Off:</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p align=justify><font face="Arial"><i>Of the 13,000 or so sold, 1,200 
were returned. Of this, 580 units were unopened and not defective. Of the 
defective returns (about 620), 50.8% were due to joystick problems, 17.6% were 
due to electrostatic discharge problems, 7.4% were due to problems with the 
Videocube (switch-box), 8% were due to solder defects, and other problems accounted 
for 16.5%. These returned units were checked and repaired, if necessary, then 
shipped to the above mentioned discount and surplus outlets.</i></font><br></p>

Actually, the game shown is a <a href="pics/executivegames/redMock.jpg">wooden mockup</a>.<br>
The electronics were hidden for the photograph.<br>
The game was in wire wrap form at that time, so this photo would<br>
have been from early 1976. It was taken at the lab at MIT, Room 33-214.<br>
Ken Launie later designed the replacement joysticks for the game.<br>

After the close of the Executive Games plant in 1977, Glen Dash continued 
working on video games as a consultant. He proved to be a key person in his 
field, principally FCC testing. In America at that time, few people had the 
expertise needed to get FCC approvals for electronic games, which the FCC held 
to strict limits.. For that reason, he was responsible for testing a large 
number of video and handheld games, some of which never made it to the market. 
As an engineer, he also worked for General Instruments to design test prototypes 
for their new AY-3-8600 and AY-3-8700 game chips, for Texas Instruments (who 
released a game chip containing the TV Tennis circuits including the same 
bugs!), and for Mattel (Intellivision console, etc).<br><br>
The AY-3-8600 prototype was housed in a TV Tennis unit. It used the AY-3-8615 
color encoder and the circuits were rather simple. Glen optimized the circuit 
board to minimize radio frequencies generated by the local oscillators. This 
prototype was designed while the AY-3-8600 chip was still in late development 
stages. For that reason, the schematic mentions three versions of the chip: 
AY-3-8600/001, /002 and /003. The differences between those versions are 
currently unknown.<br><br>
The AY-3-8700 prototype was housed in a Face-Off unit and used an early chip 
version /001.<br><br>
Once completed, the prototypes were sent to General Instruments, and the 
(official) story doesn't go any further.<br><br>
Glen Dash kept his original drawings, which you can see below by clicking the 
various pictures.<br>&nbsp;</font></p>

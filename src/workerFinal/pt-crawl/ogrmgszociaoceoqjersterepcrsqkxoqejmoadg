<p>Two publications are in the pipeline. They are: </p>

<p>1. <strong>Protea Red Data Book</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Protea Atlas Project is updating the Red Data Book status of all our proteas based
  on the data collected by atlassers and herbarium data. We are in the process of working up
  the herbarium data prior to making the maps of the species. The maps and the species texts
  will be sent to protea and conservation experts in the Cape and Transvaal areas for review
  and comment. If you want to participate in this process, please contact us.</p>
  <p>Have a look at the <a href="reddata.htm">Red Data Book status</a> of our proteas.</p>

      have a species description (under headings of Habit, Leaves, Flowerheads,

    <p align="center"><strong>Tony Rebelo (1995)</strong></p>
    <p>Sasol Proteas is the field guide recommended for use by Protea Atlassers. It was
    designed with amateur field identification in mind. Easy to use &quot;Quick Keys&quot;
    illustrate the main groups of proteas for identifying the 14 genera and also sections
    within the genera. Text and pictures are grouped in clusters of most similar species,
    making quick visual identification simple. The start of each section includes an
    illustration of the group (genus or section) together with a short summary of the
    diagnostic features. Where needed a further key or summary of features to note in the
    identification of species within the section is given. The photographs by Colin Paterson
    Jones were chosen to show the diagnostic features in close up detail, and include the
    scale for comparison between pictures. The text for each species comprises a description -
    in simple English, with diagnostic features in italics to facilitate comparison between
    other species; as well as data on Distribution, Habitat, Status, Flowers, Fruits, and
    additional Notes on some species. A detailed map summarises the distribution of the
    species. SASOL Proteas starts with an introduction to the ecology of proteas, dealing with
    pollination, seed dispersal, root strategies, flowering, avoiding herbivory and fire, and
    growing proteas. A few notes on how to use the book and a locality map complete the
    introduction. The book ends off with the four extinct species, An illustrated Glossary
    (augmenting the simple English text for reference purposes), A list of Common Names, A
    list of Scientific names (including all those old synonyms that most people know so well),
    and References &amp; Further reading completes SASOL Proteas.</p>
    <p><strong>SASOL Proteas edition 1 is currently out of print but it is expected that <a href="sasol2.htm">Sasol Proteas edition 2</a> will be published sometime in 2001.</strong></p>
    <p>SASOL Proteas is ook in Afrikaans verkrygbaar.</p>

    <p>The fully updated second edition of SASOL Proteas presents the latest information
    avaiable after 10 years of atlassing by almost 500 atlassers. Since the publication of the
    <a href="sasol.htm">first edition</a> in 1995, three <a href="newspp.htm">new species</a>
    have been found (we have since discovered two more! See <a href="sescop.htm">Forlorn
    Spiderhead - <em>Serruria scoparia</em> rediscovered after 200 years</a> and <a href="ldclim.htm">Climax Conebush - '<em>Leucadendron climacticum</em>'</a>), a species
    believed to be <a href="sotenu.htm">extinct has been rediscovered</a>, and the <a href="idms.htm">distribution ranges</a> of one third of species have been extended. The
    second edition retains the handy guide features of quick keys, clear and concise text and
    more than 480 photographs to aid the identification of the 370 proteas in the field. The
    diagnostic features of genera and species are highlighted. The distribution maps were
    compiled automatically from the Protea Atlas Project database, combining information from
    herbarium records and data submitted by atlassers to produce maps filtered to within 3km
    resolution. Of course, this detail could not be presented in the map space available and
    map localities have had to be buffered to improve clarity, resulting in an extremely
    accurate, but appealing map of the species distributions. SASOL Proteas is an invaluable
    companion on all rambles in Fynbos, honed by thousands of hours of atlassing to the ideal
    field identification kit for Proteas.&nbsp; It has been published in association with the
    National Botanical Institute and with the support of SASOL and WWF-SA.</p>

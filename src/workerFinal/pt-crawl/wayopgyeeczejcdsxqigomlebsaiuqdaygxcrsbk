        A horned toad! I haven't seen one of those in years!&quot; 
        is a comment I often hear when event-goers see my bearded 
        dragon. To me, the resemblance is superficial: the flattened 
        body liberally supplied with sharp-looking spikes of various 
        sizes. The head shape is very different, however, with 
        the bearded dragon's being bluntly triangular as opposed 
        to the slightly rounded head shape of the horned toad 
        (whose proper name is horned lizard, <i>Phrynosoma</i> 
        sp.) which is also furnished with longer spikes protruding 
        from the back of the skull. The horned lizards are native 
        to the American Southwest while the bearded dragons are 
        native to Australia and New Guinea.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Australia 
        is home to a number of dragons, a name given to many of 
        their agamid lizards which include the popular bearded 
        dragons and water dragons. Australia has very restrictive 
        export laws relating to its wildlife; thus, the bearded 
        dragons found in the U.S. pet trade are descendants from 
        founder animals imported from Europe. Bearded dragons 
        are gaining popularity as pets. Wonderfully tempered, 
        intriguing in appearance, quizzical in countenance, these 
        lizards do not get very large (especially in relation 
        to the green iguana), and require little in the nature 
        of active training or taming to make them calm and handleable. 
        As with all reptiles, there are important things to know 
        before buying a bearded, and to keep them healthy and 
        long-lived.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Natural 
        History<br>
        </font> </b> For some 60 million years, the life forms 
        in Australia evolved in splendid isolation from the rest 
        of the earth's landmasses. Set apart, surrounded by ocean, 
        animal life developed bizarre attributes. Along with the 
        egg-laying mammalian platypus to the gastric-brooding 
        frogs, from the frilled lizards to jumping joeys, an amazing 
        variety of lizards and snakes came to be. To this day, 
        relatively little is known about Australia's wildlife, 
        far less than we know about Africa's.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Even 
        less may be known about Australia's herpetofauna than 
        its mammalian wildlife. Every one recognizes koala bears 
        and the various members of the kangaroo family; these 
        mammals are especially &quot;cute&quot; and thus were 
        accepted far earlier than the herps. In 1963, the definitive 
        book on Australia's reptiles was written by Eric Worrell. 
        At that time, herpetoculture was barely beginning, and 
        very few researchers, Australian or otherwise, were studying 
        this sector of Australian wildlife. Coinciding with the 
        growing interest in herpetoculture and herpetology came 
        the Australian government's clamping down on the collection, 
        keeping, and exporting of native wildlife, thus successfully 
        quashing animals available not only to collectors and 
        breeders outside of Australia, but to researchers in country 
        as well. Since that time, things have changed, at least 
        in terms of the interest in the herpetofauna by Australian 
        and other researchers. Our understanding of these fascinating 
        herps has grown by leaps and bounds; there is even now 
        a CD-ROM comprised solely of Australian herptiles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Bearded 
        dragons are agamid lizards belonging to the genus <i>Pogona</i> 
        (formerly <i>Amphibolurus</i>, under which name they are 
        found in books published up to just a couple of years 
        ago). There are seven species (Sprackland 1994; six according 
        to Fogle 1993) of which the most common in the pet trade 
        is the <i>P. vitticeps</i>, the inland or central (also 
        called the yellow-headed) bearded dragon is the most widely 
        available. In smaller numbers, the common bearded (<i>P. 
        barbata</i>) and the Rankin's (<i>P. henrylawsoni</i>) 
        have become more widely available and the number of captive-bred 
        animal slowly increases. The other <i>Pogona</i> dragon 
        species include the western (<i>P. minima</i>), the dwarf 
        (<i>P. minor</i>), the Northwest bearded (<i>P. mitchelli</i>), 
        the Nullarbor (<i>P. nullarbor</i>), and the <i>P. microlepitoda</i>. 
        (This article will discuss the care associated primarily 
        with <i>P. vitticeps</i> and <i>P. barbata</i>.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Bearded 
        dragons live in the arid, rocky, semi-desert regions and 
        arid open woodlands. They are adept climbers, spending 
        time on branches and in bushes, even found on fence posts 
        when living near human habitation. They also bask on rocks 
        and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> These 
        diurnal lizards are omnivores, voracious eaters of invertebrates 
        and small vertebrates alike. They also forage for soft 
        plant matter, including greens, fruits, and flowers. Like 
        most desert dwellers, beardeds spend the hottest part 
        of the day in underground burrows and are well adapted 
        to the cool desert nights.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
        bearded's blunt arrow-shaped head is typical of the agamids. 
        The scales along the skin of the throat and the side of 
        the head have specialized into spiny points. The scales 
        along the sides of their bodies also carry these pointy 
        extensions. When threatened, the dragons flatten out their 
        bodies, making themselves look wider. The &quot;beard&quot; 
        in the dragon's name comes from its flared-out throat, 
        done to scare off conspecifics and potential predators. 
        This threatening vision is enhanced by a gaping mouth. 
        Such behavior is rarely seen in captivity, however, as 
        these lizards adapt so well to their human caretakers. 
        The most one usually sees is a flattening of the body 
        and a small flare to the black &quot;beard.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Dragons 
        are social animals, which is one of the reasons they are 
        engaging and interested in their surroundings in captivity. 
        They frequently become very secure in their environment 
        and soon stop displaying their beard. The young especially 
        perform a distinctive &quot;wave&quot; as a way of communicating 
        nonaggression. Beardeds also use their tongue to check 
        out their environment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Bearded 
        dragons reach reproductive age at one to two years of 
        age. During breeding season, the beards of mature males 
        turn black. Males can also be differentiated from females 
        by the presence of pre-anal and femoral pores (which are 
        almost impossible to see on very young dragons, making 
        them difficult to sex).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Older 
        females may lay up to sixteen eggs in the early summer, 
        in shallow &quot;nests&quot; dug in the sandy soil. Juveniles, 
        which may weigh as little as 2.1 grams at hatching, are 
        often banded and may have an orange stripe near their 
        eyes; as they mature, the pattern becomes less distinct.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <font size="3"><b>Housing</b></font><br>
        Despite their relatively modest size (adults to 20 in 
        [50 cm]), beardeds are still considered by many to be 
        a &quot;giant&quot; lizard and do require generous space. 
        As adult beardeds will cheerfully eat animals smaller 
        than themselves, hatchlings should not be housed with 
        juveniles or adults. Males tend to be territorial, making 
        even 50-gallon tanks too small for them. Overcrowding, 
        too, can lead to aggression and stress, compounded when 
        the subordinate animal has no place to run off to hide. 
        Such conditions also cause injuries, including lost toes 
        and tails, and loss of appetite, not uncommon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> An 
        enclosure should be large enough to provide a wide temperature 
        gradient both horizontally and vertically. Beardeds can 
        be surprisingly quick (trotting with their bodies raised 
        well off the ground), making top-opening enclosures a 
        must. A top to the enclosure is required; this will keep 
        the dragon from taking off on its own and will keep the 
        crickets inside the tank. Tanks must be well-ventilated, 
        yet able to retain heat. Tanks with parts of their top 
        or sides made of screen often work well. Make sure the 
        tank top is large enough and sturdy enough to hold a full-spectrum/UV 
        light and a fixture for supplemental heating.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> There 
        is some debate about the best substrate. In their native 
        environment, beardeds live in sandy desert areas. Decomposed 
        granite or large grained sand (available as playground 
        sand in hardware stores, as well as in pet stores and 
        nurseries) is often used, though there have been reports 
        of intestinal impaction. Other substrates include gravel 
        and aquarium rock (which are more difficult to clean and 
        disinfect), outdoor carpeting (trim loose threads), butcher 
        paper, unprinted newsprint, paper towels and terry towels 
        all making suitable substrates, though there is no question 
        that the proper sand layered thickly on the bottom of 
        the tank, with branches for climbing and basking, and 
        rocky, ceramic, or wooden caves, and perhaps even some 
        nonprickly succulents, make for an attractive, and relatively 
        easy-to-maintain, vivarium. Do not use corn or walnut 
        cob, alfalfa pellets, kitty litter, or wood shavings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Beardeds 
        have a very active metabolic rate, so plan on frequent 
        cleaning. As their fecal pellets are dry and compact, 
        if sand is used a kitty litter scooper may be used on 
        a regular basis, with the tank undergoing a thorough cleaning 
        and disinfecting several times a year. Regular replacement 
        of the substrate assures the environment remains as healthy 
        as possible for the dragon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Beardeds 
        need both basking and hiding areas. Ideally, the tank 
        should be big enough to have a hiding place at both ends 
        of the temperature gradient, plus a basking area closer 
        to the heat source. Provide, at least, a hiding area on 
        the cooler side, with branches and logs for climbing and 
        basking on the warm side.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <font size="3"><b>Heat</b></font><br>
        Although bearded dragons are primarily desert dwellers, 
        they do spend the hottest part of the days in relatively 
        cool areas; as with all desert animals, too much heat 
        can be just as dangerous as too little.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
        temperature gradient during the day should range from 
        76 F (24 C) on the cool side to 86 F (30 C) on the warm 
        side, with a basking area ranging from 90-100 F (32-37.7 
        C). Night time temperatures can drop no lower than the 
        low to mid 70s (21 C) on the cool side.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> An 
        undertank heating pad under the warm side of the tank 
        will gently heat the substrate. A basking light or heating 
        element should be positioned above so that there is a 
        vertical gradient, with the warmest end at the top.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> To 
        give yourself as much flexibility as possible to cope 
        easily with changing ambient room temperatures throughout 
        the seasons, consider hooking your heating element or 
        basking light to a thermostat. There are several models 
        available, ranging from those that are hardwired into 
        the tank to plug-in ones with simple dials. An even easier 
        method is to plug the heating element or basking light 
        fixture into a table lamp dimmer switch. Check around 
        for a model that gives you many setting options; some 
        have only three (off-dim-bright) which may be too limiting 
        for your needs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> If 
        using a ceramic heating element, you should use a porcelain 
        light socket as the socket part of the fixture can get 
        very hot; the last thing you want is meltdown or fire. 
        If using high-wattage light bulbs, make sure that the 
        light fixture you are using is rated for the wattage of 
        the bulb; some fixtures can safely handle bulbs up to 
        150 watts, which could be a problem if your bulb is over 
        200 watts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Use 
        at least three thermometers to check your temperatures: 
        one on the cool side, one on the warm side, and one in 
        the basking area. Place them where the animal spends its 
        time, not just where it is convenient for you.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> <font size="3"><b>Light</b></font><br>
        Beardeds need daily access to a UVB source, either being 
        regularly exposed to direct sunlight, or to <a href="uvtable.html">UVB-producing 
        fluorescent tube</a> such as Duro-Test's Vita-Lite or 
        Vita-Lite Plus, Zoo Med's Iguana or Reptisun lights (5.0+) 
        or similar UVB-producing fluorescent tube. Incandescent 
        lights, while suitable for use as heat sources, do not 
        provide the full spectrum required by reptiles, including 
        no UVA and never any UVB. Plant lights and many aquarium 
        lights are wide-spectrum rather than full-spectrum lights, 
        and so should not be used other than as supplemental lighting 
        or heating in addition to the full-spectrum lighting. 
        The term &quot;full spectrum&quot; is incorrectly used 
        by incandescent light manufacturers whose lights are suitable 
        only for producing heat and light; they do not produce 
        the UVB required for calcium metabolism. For additional 
        information on the different heat and light sources available, 
        please read the <a href="liteheat.html">Lighting and Heating</a> 
        article.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> A UVB-producing 
        tube that also produces white light may also be paired 
        with a fluorescent BL black light (not a screw-in Halloween 
        or so-called poster light) to provide additional UVB, 
        the wavelength that essential in the metabolism of vitamin 
        D3. Some herpetoculturists feel that it is beneficial 
        to provide additional UVB to desert lizards.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Make 
        daily lighting easy for you. By plugging the light fixture 
        into an appliance timer, such as those made for table 
        lamps, you can set the light to go on and off automatically. 
        When you use a timer, your lizard won't be left in the 
        dark all day or in the light all night if you work late 
        or have to go out of town for a day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Never 
        use a white light of any sort at night, for lighting or 
        for heat. This will stress your animal, eventually affecting 
        its ability to thrive through the resultant lack of sleep, 
        loss of appetite, and other stress-related symptoms. If 
        you need to provide supplemental heat at night in addition 
        to the undertank heating, use a ceramic heating element 
        or a nocturnal reptile bulb; the former produces no light, 
        while the latter produces a dim bluish-purple light.</font></p>

        </b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">Always 
        provide fresh water for your dragon. It should be in a 
        bowl or dish shallow enough for your lizard to see easily 
        into and drink out of; deeper bowls can be half-sunk into 
        the substrate. Due to the corrosive action of hot water 
        on copper pipes in hard-water systems, use only cool or 
        cold water if using tap water for drinking water.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"> Your 
        bearded will enjoy a shower now and then: a light misting 
        with water will also help keep the skin humidified to 
        make it easier to shed. The tank, however, should never 
        be damp.</font></p>

          </b></font> You must feed very small prey to baby bearded 
          dragons. While the rule-of-thumb for feeding lizards 
          says that it is generally safe to feed prey that is 
          2/3 the size of the lizard's head, this is not advisable 
          with baby beardeds (0-4 months). When fed prey that 
          is too large for them, serious physical problems often 
          result: partial paralysis, seizures, ataxia (loss of 
          motor control), inability to self-feed, gut impaction, 
          even death. Start with feeding pinhead crickets and 
          tiny, freshly molted worms, moving only slowly and gradually 
          to larger sizes, phasing in day-old pinks when they 
          are ready for them. Despite the fact that most stores 
          sell animals that need them, most don't sell pinheads, 
          so you will have to order them directly from a <a href="resources/preysources.html">cricket

      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        bearded dragons are omnivores, with plant foods comprising 
        about 20 percent of their diet. Since these lizards consume 
        a wide variety of invertebrates and small vertebrates 
        in the wild, a variety of protein sources must be offered 
        in captivity. Prey items such as appropriately sized cultured 
        crickets, cockroaches, mealworms, king worms, and wax 
        worms can be fed, along with pink mice. Make sure the 
        invertebrates are freshly molted to reduce the amount 
        of tough, indigestible exoskeleton the dragon will ingest; 
        exoskeletons can cause intestinal impaction so the least 
        amount ingested the better. As the dragon grows, it is 
        better to feed him mice (pinks, fuzzies, crews, young 
        adult) rather than mostly insects. Whole rodent prey is 
        more nutritious - and will not cause the impaction that

        your invertebrate prey before feeding your dragon. Prey 
        bought from pet stores are generally in dire need of a 
        good meal, having subsisted on cardboard or bran for several 
        days at least. Sprinkle or dust prey with a calcium supplement 
        just before feeding them to your lizard 3-5 times a week 
        (more for baby and pregnant dragons), and use a multivitamin 
        supplement 2-3 times a week (more for babies and pregnant 
        females). Prepare an enclosure for your crickets, furnishing 
        it with pieces of egg crate or cardboard cores from paper 
        towels and toilet paper. Pieces of fruits and vegetables, 
        as well as food such as high-protein baby cereal mixed 
        with reptile vitamins, tropical fish flakes, and rodent 
        chow, all make suitable foods. Since smaller crickets 
        are more nutritious than larger crickets (proportionately 
        less exoskeleton) it is better to feed out more of the 
        smaller ones than fewer of the big ones. For additional 
        information on housing and feeding prey invertebrates, 
        read the article on <a href="feedingbugs.html">Feeding 
        Invertebrate Prey</a>.</font></p>

        carrots, escarole, parsley, mustard, dandelion and collard 
        greens, raspberries, mango, and cantaloupe. (A good mixed 
        salad is the <a href="iguana/igdiet.html">iguana salad</a>

        scoop up your dragon with your hand under its belly. Dragons 
        tend to be very trusting and will not necessarily hold 
        on as will other lizards, so always take care to support 
        your dragon. They do not like being firmly held; let them 
        rest in your palm with your fingers gently curled over 
        the back. Dragons are inquisitive animals, so create a 
        controlled space in which it may do some exploring.</font></p>

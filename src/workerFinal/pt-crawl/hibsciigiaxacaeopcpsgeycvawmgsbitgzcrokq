<p><b><a name="path1"></a><font color="#993366">Abstract</font></b>

        <p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a few years after the publication 

          of Darwin's <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, Alfred Russel Wallace made 

          public his opinion that natural selection was not an all-sufficient 

          cause of the evolution of man--particularly, as regards the higher human 

          faculties (moral, artistic, and mathematical abilities, etc.). Most 

          workers have drawn the direct conclusion that Wallace "changed his mind" 

          about the theory he originally set out--perhaps because of an inability 

          to reconcile "the survival of the fittest" concept with his utopian 

          social views, or in conjunction with his adoption of spiritualist beliefs. 

          In the present work a different interpretation of the events is presented: 

          that Wallace's natural selection views derive from a cosmological position 

          utterly distinct from that underlying Darwinian principles, that Wallace 

          never believed natural selection could explain the presence of man's 

          higher faculties to begin with, and that he never had the change of 

          mind usually attributed to him. Wallace's approach to evolution was 

          shaped by his youthful rejection of the doctrine of first causes and 

          by a distrust of then-existing notions regarding continuity. His first 

          response was to adopt a unique brand of anti-first causes teleology, 

          but this position later matured into a body of ideas compatible with 

          materialist logic on his recognition of the principle of natural selection 

          and his adoption of spiritualism. Wallace is interpreted as having rejected 

          the argument of necessary utility of adaptation before 1858: at that 

          time he equated such acceptance with acceptance of first causes-based 

          doctrine. The 1858 Ternate essay not only signalled his recognition 

          of this mistake, but anticipated his later arguments that the adaptive 

          process was associated with a hierarchical domain of causality. Wallace 

          had been trying from the beginning to develop an evolutionary model 

          that described a continuity of causality extending beyond the immediate 

          domain within which natural selection is now usually credited as operating. 

          Wallace did not view his adoption of spiritualism as a retreat from 

          natural selection; rather, he considered spiritualism the best available 

          accounting of the overall direction of evolution at the moral/intellectual 

          level, and endorsed it accordingly. The arguments leading to these conclusions 

          are supported by excerpts from (and additional references to) his writings, 

          and by emphasizing the fact that Wallace himself wrote nothing providing 

          any real evidence for the "change of mind" theory.</font><br>

<p><b><a name="path2"></a><font color="#993366">Introduction</font></b>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The life and studies of the nineteenth and early 

          twentieth century naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) have 

          received considerable attention in recent years. The main influences 

          on his life--especially his support of Owenite social ideals,<SUP><a href="#1">1</a></a></SUP> 

          interest in mesmerism and phrenology,<SUP><a href="#2">2</a></SUP> travels in tropical 

          lands,<SUP><a href="#3">3</a></SUP> connections with Darwin and development of the concept 

          of natural selection,<SUP><a href="#4">4</a></SUP> and adoption of spiriitualism<SUP><a href="#5">5</a></SUP>--have 

          been treated fairly thoroughly as a matter of historical record, and 

          in their relation to the major sociological and scientific trends of 

          the period. I believe, however, that Wallace is unlikely to be fully 

          appreciated until he is perceived in other than historical-sociological 

          terms. Otherwise put, the significant difficulty in coming to grips 

          with Wallace's work is that his cosmology is both highly complex and 

          irreducible to simple cause and effect associations with the major intellectual 

          trends of his time. The debates of his period provided him with a stage 

          for his weighed opinions, of course, but it is important to keep in 

          mind that he was a highly inventive thinker who was not afraid to follow 

          any path he felt was leading to the truth.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three interrelated analyses comprise the present 

          study. In the first I argue that Wallace's eventual adoption of spiritualism 

          was assured many years before either his initial studies of the belief, 

          or earlier formulation of natural selection. The second discussion focuses 

          on the development of Wallace's evolutionary views, my conclusion being 

          that these were broadly enough constituted to accommodate both natural 

          selection and spiritualism without internal inconsistency. Lastly, the 

          idea that Wallace supposedly underwent a "change of mind" regarding 

          the applicability of natural selection to the evolution of man is refuted 

          by reference to earlier discussion, by showing how certain contentious 

          passages in his writings are more easily accounted for through the interpretation 

          of his work presented here, and by taking note of the significant fact 

          that Wallace himself never wrote anything referring to, or conceding, 

          such a change. The analysis remains close to Wallace's own writings; 

          not only is this not the place to attempt to treat fully of all period 

          connections, but frequent reference to what he actually wrote is still 

          necessary in view of the many dubious conclusions that have been reached 

          about his thought process.<br>

          &nbsp;

        <p><b><a name="path3"></a><font color="#993366">Wallace's Adoption of 

          Spiritualism</font></b>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most relevant analyses of Wallace's belief in 

          spiritualism, already referred to in note 5, are by R. Smith, Kottler, 

          Schwartz, and Malinchak. Smith took an important step forward by recognizing 

          the interdependent nature of Wallace's ideas: "...Whereas it has been 

          customary to consider his thought as primarily biological and his digressions 

          into phrenology, spiritualism, socialism, and ethnology as peripheral, 

          these apparently diverse subjects were in reality aspects of a unified 

          interpretation of the world in terms of humanitarian values."<SUP><a href="#6">6</a></SUP> 

          He decides that "A consideration of Wallace's philosophy of nature...leads 

          to the conclusion that he saw and intended no discontinuity between 

          general and human evolution and that it is a mistaken view to recognize 

          such a discontinuity."<SUP><a href="#7">7</a></SUP> Smith takes relatively little notice 

          of Wallace's adoption of spiritualism in his analysis, preferring to 

          attribute his rejection of the all-sufficiency of natural selection 

          to the incompatibility of its logic with his utopian social views, especially 

          to the degree the principle of utility could not be extended to account 

          for the higher human faculties. Kottler, on the other hand, comes to 

          the conclusion that "...spiritualism stimulated Wallace to reconsider 

          the utility of various human features," and thus that it was the cause 

          of his divergence of viewpoint from Darwin.<SUP><a href="#8">8</a></SUP> Schwartz's paper 

          is primarily concerned with showing how Wallace's views on man might 

          have pushed Darwin into writing <i>The Descent of Man</i>, but he also 

          gives attention to the spiritualism issue, deciding that Wallace's position 

          on man must have begun to shift before he committed himself to spiritualism 

          in 1865. He concludes that "Wallace's departure from the Darwinian point 

          of view of the origin of man resulted from his inability to bridge his 

          scientific and moral beliefs," and that "Wallace's belief in social 

          equality and political reform conflicted with the ineluctable operations 

          of natural law (including natural selection)."<SUP><a href="#9">9</a></SUP> Malinchak, 

          like Smith, examines the situation from a sociology of science perspective. 

          Regarding the man/natural selection question, she states "It was only 

          after Wallace engaged in his extensive studies in spiritualism and became 

          convinced of the genuineness of spiritualistic phenomena that he began 

          to inject quasi-religious notions of the guidance of higher intelligences 

          in the development of the human mind into his scientific arguments."<SUP><a href="#10">10</a></SUP> 

          Malinchak nevertheless does not specifically refer Wallace's conversion 

          to spiritualism to causes rooted in his natural selection views, apparently 

          preferring to interpret it as a residual effect of some of his early 

          experiences with the supernatural, and of period social and intellectual 

          trends.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize, the position now generally held is 

          that Wallace was led to spiritualistic belief as a function of his inability 

          to view human evolution in entirely materialistic terms--in particular, 

          as a function of the limitations of natural selection. Thus, spiritualism 

          supposedly provided Wallace with a previously missing religious element 

          in his life--one which also explained (away) the intellectual and moral 

          development of the human race.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me, however, that these conclusions 

          represent a misreading of the available facts. Wallace had from the 

          very beginning been pursuing a course of investigation that inherently 

          (and, to a degree, unwittingly) denied priority to materialistic interpretations 

          of nature, and only through natural selection and spiritualism was he 

          able to forge a synthesis compatible with materialist logic. In short, 

          I shall take the position that all events in Wallace's intellectual 

          evolution after 1858 are entirely predictable given conclusions he had 

          reached by that year.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As is now well known from both his own writings 

          and secondary analysis,<SUP><a href="#11">11</a></SUP> Wallace was personally introduced 

          to occult phenomena when he attended a lecture/demonstration on mesmerism 

          given by a Mr. Spencer Hall in 1844. Sometime earlier, Wallace had read 

          George Combe and become interested in related phrenological subjects.<SUP><a href="#12">12</a></SUP> 

          At that early date, there were few believers in mesmerism. Indeed, the 

          common opinion, even within the scientific and medical communities, 

          was that it was a hoax. Wallace attended the lecture as a nonbeliever; 

          shortly afterward, however, he found himself able to induce the same 

          effects that he had witnessed on stage on subjects of his own choosing, 

          and eventually became a skilled practitioner of the art.<SUP><a href="#13">13</a></SUP> 

          This had a profound effect on him, as he learned, to repeat his own 

          words, "my first great lesson in the inquiry into those obscure fields 

          of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men, or their accusations 

          of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the 

          repeated observation of facts by other men admittedly sane and honest."<SUP><a href="#14">14</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This "great lesson" had both its general and specific 

          elements. In the more general sense, new discoveries--no matter how 

          unusual--were deserving of detached and rational study, not ignorant, 

          ill-informed disbelief. More specially, psychical phenomena were not 

          to be branded unworthy of attention <i>a priori</i>.<SUP><a href="#15">15</a></SUP> Wallace 

          spent a considerable portion of the next two decades mulling over the 

          validity of these ideas, especially in their relevance to the customs 

          and beliefs of the many native peoples among whom he lived and worked. 

          Their religions, superstitions, and cosmological traditions especially 

          attracted his attention, and in later writings he made frequent use 

          of his observations.<SUP><a href="#16">16</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after his return to England in 1862 Wallace 

          began to look into the by-then well-established, but still-growing, 

          spiritualism movement.<SUP><a href="#17">17</a></SUP> It was apparently two or more years 

          before he started taking the subject seriously, but by 1866 he was a 

          confirmed spiritualist, as is fully evident from his 'The scientific 

          aspect of the supernatural,' most likely written in the spring or early 

          summer of that year.<SUP><a href="#18">18</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The context of Wallace's conversion has remained 

          obscure, possibly because many have assumed that his "investigation" 

          of spiritualism in the 1860s consisted predominantly of his attending 

          numerous seances. That he was a frequent attender is true enough; through 

          this experience he gained a first-hand acquaintance with the range of 

          supposed spiritualistic "contact phenomena" (<i>e.g.</i>, spirit materializations, 

          table-rappings, automatic slate-writing, etc.). But it is equally true 

          that his investigation extended to more than just observation. Wallace 

          invariably began any new investigative effort with an exhaustive literature 

          review.<SUP><a href="#19">19</a></SUP> In this instance he read everything he could "lay 

          his hands on" as he undertook his intensive program of seance attendance.<SUP><a href="#20">20</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this literature review he would have learned 

          not only of the records of purported contacts with spirit beings, but 

          of the relevance of such phenomena to the philosophical, historical 

          and moral teachings of the movement as well. Research on Wallace's association 

          with spiritualism has sometimes emphasized the sensationalism attached 

          to his seance experiences instead of what it was that attracted him 

          to the belief to begin with. It is thus necessary first to emphasize 

          that spiritualism <i>per se</i> is not 

          a religion--at least not in the usual sense of that term.<SUP><a href="#21">21</a></SUP> 

          It can more accurately be viewed as a form of theosophy,<SUP><a href="#22">22</a></SUP> 

          depicting the natural world as extending to a level of psychic organization 

          to which ordinary consciousness has but peripheral access. Significantly, 

          the view expressed in spiritualist (and other theosophical) writings 

          is that the chain of natural causality nonetheless extends continuously, 

          and back and forth, between the psychic (<i>i.e.</i>, aspatial) and 

          physical (<i>i.e.</i>, spatial) domains. The sensational manifestations 

          of this continuity allegedly occurring during seances and analogous 

          conditions are, it has usually been supposed, the only aspects of it 

          whose causes might readily be distinguished from the ordinary "material" 

          phenomena of nature.<SUP><a href="#23">23</a></SUP> Wallace's (and many other investigators') 

          interest in such contact phenomena was that there appeared to be no 

          other avenue through which the subject could be explored objectively.<SUP><a href="#24">24</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's recognition of the principle of natural 

          selection in 1858 had forced him into the unanticipated role of celebrity. 

          There is nothing in the Ternate essay (or his subsequent recollections 

          of its writing<SUP><a href="#25">25</a></SUP>), however, that indicates he foresaw the 

          degree and immediacy of natural selection's impact on the intellectual 

          community. The reason for this, I suggest, is that at that time he considered 

          the concept only a partial solution to more general problems he had 

          been working on for about fifteen years. The remainder of the solution--as 

          a continuation, not reversal, of thought--occurred to him only as he 

          became familiar with the writings of spiritualism. It was almost certainly 

          the moral, historical and philosophical themes of the belief and their 

          relation to the subject of natural causation that really attracted him 

          to the movement. In these themes he recognized an informal characterization 

          of natural processes which operated in a manner transcending, yet complementing, 

          natural selection. These views were acceptable to Wallace because they 

          were consistent with his rational approach to the assessment of evidence, 

          his position on the meaning of continuity of cause and effect, and the 

          generally "progressive" attitude he had maintained since adolescence.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace distilled the 

          teachings of spiritualism in a number of his later writings. Excerpts 

          from several of these are presented now for the sake of illustration 

          and reference:<SUP><a href="#26">26</a></SUP><blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "...The universal teaching of modern spiritualism is that the world 

          and the whole material universe exist for the purpose of developing 

          spiritual beings--that death is simply a transition from material existence 

          to the first grade of spirit-life--and that our happiness and the degree 

          of our progress will be wholly dependent upon the use we have made of 

          our faculties and opportunities here..."<SUP><a href="#27">27</a></SUP></font><p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...we

            the future life, even more completely than now. Just in proportion 

            as we have developed our higher intellectual and moral nature, or 

            starved it by disuse, shall we be well or ill fitted for the new life

            as he indulges in passion, or selfishness, or the reckless pursuit 

            of wealth, and neglects to cultivate his moral and intellectual nature, 

            so does he inevitably prepare for himself misery in a world in which 

            there are no physical wants to be provided for, no struggle to maintain 

            mere existence, no sensual enjoyments except those directly associated 

            with sympathy and affection, no occupations but those having for their 

            object social, moral, and intellectual progress--is impelled towards 

            a pure and moral life by motives far stronger than any which either

            reward or punishment meted out to us by superior beings; but, just 

            as surely as cleanliness and exercise and wholesome food produce health 

            of body, so surely does a moral life here produce health and happiness

            strengthen man's intellectual nature; while the oppression and wrong,

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preceding selections 

        feature the following essential ideas: (1) the human being's full span 

        of individual existence extends on to a period following biological death; 

        (2) the characteristics of conscious existence during this alleged period 

        are primarily determined by the level of intellectual and moral development 

        attained during one's biological life experience; (3) said intellectual 

        and moral development is a function of the degree of willful rejection 

        of materialistic, self-centered goals and the adoption of an explorative, 

        non-pre-judging, and socially-conscious attitude; and (4) there is, overall, 

        a continuity of just cause and effect in nature which cannot for long 

        be circumvented, and which complements individual action, sooner or later, 

        with no more nor less than a commensurate reaction. Theme four would have 

        been the one that most impressed Wallace initially. We shall return to 

        this subject in a moment.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relevance of the 

          four themes just noted to Wallace's conversion can be better appreciated 

          after examining words he set out almost twenty years before being introduced 

          to spiritualism (indeed, before the beginning of the "modern spiritualism 

          movement" itself). In late 1843, while employed as a surveyor for his 

          older brother William, Wallace composed a lecture entitled 'The advantages 

          of varied knowledge.' Portions of the essay are reproduced and discussed 

          in his autobiography <i>My Life</i>, 

          published in two volumes in 1905. From this source the following significant 

          passages may be noted:<SUP><a href="#32">32</a></SUP><blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          [on gaining "a general acquaintance with history, biography, art, and 

          science":] "...There is an intrinsic value to ourselves in these varied 

          branches of knowledge, so much indescribable pleasure in their possession, 

          so much do they add to the enjoyment of every moment of our existence, 

          that it is impossible to estimate their value, and we would hardly accept 

          boundless wealth, at the cost, if it were possible, of their irrecoverable 

          loss. And if it is thus we feel as to our general store of mental acquirements, 

          still more do we appreciate the value of any particular branch of study 

          we may ardently pursue... here we see the advantage possessed by him 

          whose studies have been in various directions, and who at different 

          times has had many different pursuits, for whatever may happen, he will 

          always find something in his surroundings to interest and instruct him..."</font><p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [on 

            gaining "a knowledge of the elementary laws of physical science":] 

            "...He who has extended his inquiries into the varied phenomena of 

            nature learns to despise no fact, however small, and to consider the 

            most apparently insignificant and common occurrences as much in need 

            of explanation as those of a grander and more imposing character. 

            <i>He sees in every dewdrop trembling on the grass causes at work

            his window-panes on a frosty morning he recognizes the action of laws

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These passages reflect 

        the views of a twenty year old man on the reasons for--and advantages 

        of--pursuing an ongoing program of self-education and rational, moral 

        and intellectual exploration. The messages in 'Advantages...' and the 

        spiritualism-related excerpts presented earlier have much in common with 

        respect to the way they portray the ideal "life strategy"; the only real 

        difference, in fact, is spiritualism's specific referral to an afterlife 

        ('Advantages...' only goes so far as to consider "whatever new state of 

        being the future may have in store for us"). In both sets of writings, 

        moreover, appear the essence of his belief in the connection between justice 

        and natural causality, and it is this connection that represents the cornerstone 

        of his entire life's work.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's scientific 

          philosophy rests on two basic ideas regarding the relation of cause 

          to effect. The first is that the occurrence of action--any action--unaccompanied 

          by equal and commensurate reaction is unthinkable. The doctrine of first 

          causes therefore seemed irrational to him: it accepted the notion of 

          effect without relatable, comprehendable cause. It is not clear exactly 

          when this element of Wallace's thinking first established itself, but 

          his reading of Charles Lyell's <i>Principles of Geology</i> about 1844 

          possibly represented the eventual deciding influence. Lyell's uniformitarian 

          geological views provided Wallace with an understanding of cause-and-effect 

          that appealed only to continuously-acting and, importantly, observable 

          and verifyable, forces.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fully as central to 

          Wallace's cosmology as the "equal and commensurate reaction" concept, 

          however, were the implications stemming from his idea that "just" effect 

          emanated from cause. Supposing that only a limited range of "equal and 

          commensurate" reactions could derive from any given cause at any given 

          time, and accepting that the consequences of any given cause were more 

          or less restricted to some predominantly closed and limited domain, 

          it seemed reasonable to believe that such consequences would eventually 

          feed back on the agent of causation. Wallace considered such feedback 

          inevitable--and, as a truism, "just"--whether the reinforcement involved 

          was of a positive nature or not.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This utterly uniformitarian 

          position on the meaning of "just" reaction provided Wallace with a neutral 

          starting point for his ideas on all subjects. Take, for example, his 

          views on morality. Those who could not see or understand the negative 

          implications of their own actions were merely amoral, and even the bad 

          implications themselves had the positive effect of providing instruction 

          for anyone receptive enough to benefit from such consideration. The 

          relative morality of behaviors could thus be assessed, with adoption 

          or rejection following as a function of considered appraisal. At the 

          same time, however, Wallace would not accept that new and higher moral 

          conceptions were constantly emanating from human beings <i>de novo</i>; 

          this contradicted his ideas on continuity of cause and effect. Instead, 

          such notions "come to us--we hardly know how or whence, and once they 

          have got possession of us we can not reject or change them at will";<SUP><a href="#34">34</a></SUP> 

          <i>i.e.</i>, they originate beyond the immediate domain of human consciousness, 

          and are merely "applied" through human action.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In like fashion, biological 

          adaptation was the "just" result of the interplay of ambient biological/environmental 

          conditions. The weak or maladapted individual was less successful in 

          passing on its traits; the broadly adapted population tended to persist 

          at the expense of maladapted ones. These "just results," however, were 

          no more than the logical implications of confining ecological realities. 

          Biological evolution, on the other hand, occurred as: (1) selection 

          forces acted on such pre-existing variation (<i>i.e.</i>, the existing 

          "biological domain") and (2) variation itself was introduced as a function 

          of biological and extra-biological forces of whose causes and actions 

          we were still largely ignorant.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's position 

          on the role of "just reaction" in progressive evolution was strongly 

          fortified when he read Herbert Spencer's<i> Social Statics</i> in 1853. 

          Wallace immediately latched onto Spencer's "social justice" concept. 

          Spencer argued that each individual should receive no more nor less--especially 

          no more--than was his or her just due, a position Wallace would fully 

          endorse to the end of his days. There is little difficulty understanding 

          how this fit into the 'Advantages...' argument: social evolution had 

          to be a progressive function of the most intelligently and morally conceived 

          actions (<i>i.e.</i>, causes).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, as of 1853 (or 

          even 1843) the only feature distinguishing Wallace's personal philosophy 

          of life from that later endorsed by spiritualists was the latter's assignment 

          of their rationale for moral behavior to a specific final cause--the 

          "carrot" of continuing personal evolution in an assumed afterlife. We 

          need address two questions in this connection. First, did Wallace in 

          fact maintain fundamentally the same philosophical perspective between 

          1843 and the date of his adoption of spiritualism (about 1865)? Second, 

          what was Wallace's position on final--as distinct from first--causes?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of Wallace's 

          subsequent activities, it can hardly be doubted that over the next two 

          decades he followed the advice offered in his 1843 essay to a tee. Certainly 

          his experiments with mesmerism shortly thereafter attest to his inquisitiveness, 

          as do his adoption of an evolutionary perspective about one year later<SUP><a href="#35">35</a></SUP> 

          and later explorations and natural history and ethnological investigations 

          in the tropics. In the latter context his appreciations of tropical 

          peoples are particularly refreshing: he avoided prejudgment, especially 

          the trap of using the state of so-called "civilized Europe" as a basis 

          for assessing degree of moral advance in other cultures.<SUP><a href="#36">36</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sentiment that 

          a many-directioned (and, when specifically referred to human beings, 

          intelligently and morally-directed) experience is fundamentally valuable 

          to the individual's welfare actually does consistently surface in Wallace's 

          writings over the next twenty years, and in a great variety of contexts. 

          Take, for example, the implied basis for his assessment of the relative 

          level of civilization attained by various native peoples:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "The Dyaks are more lively, more talkative, and less diffident than 

          the American [Indians], and therefore pleasanter companions. They have 

          more amusements and are more social, while at the same time they have 

          less variety of weapons, and are less skilful in their methods of obtaining 

          game and fish. Both these circumstances will lead us to place them one 

          degree higher in the scale of civilization... Dyak youths...have their 

          social games, their trials of strength and skill... They possess...numerous 

          puzzles and tricks with which they amuse themselves... These apparently 

          trifling matters are yet of some importance, in arriving at a true estimation 

          of their social state. They show that these people have passed beyond 

          that first stage of savage life in which the struggle for existence 

          absorbs their whole faculties, in which every thought and every idea 

          is connected with war or hunting or the provision for their immediate 

          necessities. It shows too an advanced capability of civilization, an 

          aptitude to enjoy other than mere sensual pleasures, which, properly 

          taken advantage of, may be of great use in an attempt to raise their 

          social and mental condition."<SUP><a href="#37">37</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the following, on the 

        "robustness" of natural forms of selection:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "In the wild animal, on the contrary [<i>i.e.</i>, as contrasted with 

          domesticated forms], all its faculties and powers being brought into 

          full action for the necessities of existence, any increase [of power 

          or capacity in an organ or sense] becomes immediately available, is 

          strengthened by exercise, and must even slightly modify the food, the 

          habits, and the whole economy of the race. It creates as it were a new 

          animal, one of superior powers, and which will necessarily increase 

          in numbers and outlive those inferior to it... Domestic animals are 

          abnormal, artificial; they are subject to varieties which never occur 

          and never can occur in a state of nature: their very existence depends 

          altogether on human care; so far are many of them removed from that 

          just proportion of faculties, that true balance of organization, by 

          means of which alone an animal left to its own resources can preserve 

          and continue its race."<SUP><a href="#38">38</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general idea that 

        many-directioned efforts are likely to yield the most productive long-term 

        results is evident in the following selections as well:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          and in the parts most affected we discover the Scolyti to have been 

          at work, and erroneously impute the mischief to them... It now becomes 

          a question whether the supposed criminals are not really our benefactors,--teaching 

          us, by their presence, that there is something wrong, before we could 

          otherwise perceive it. We may then be induced to inquire into the state 

          of the soil or of the atmosphere, and be led to examine what diseases 

          or what enemies may be at work on the roots or on the foliage of our

            then his speculations deserve some consideration, until they can be 

            overthrown by positive evidence, or until some other hypothesis can 

            be framed which shall, on similar grounds, be better worthy of acceptance."<SUP><a href="#45">45</a></SUP></font><p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...The

            wondered at, that in their attempts to pay some little regard to natural 

            affinities, while forcing the genera and families into these divisions,

        </blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there is the 

        following, from a letter of March 15, 1861 to Wallace's brother-in-law, 

        Thomas Sims:<SUP><a href="#48">48</a></SUP><blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "...You intimate that the happiness to be enjoyed in a future state 

          will depend upon, and be a reward for, our belief in certain doctrines 

          which you believe to constitute the essence of true religion. You must 

          think, therefore, that belief is voluntary and also that it is meritorious. 

          But I think that a little consideration will show you that belief is 

          quite independent of our will, and our common expressions show it. We 

          say, 'I wish I could believe him innocent, but the evidence is too clear'; 

          or, 'Whatever people may say, I can never believe he can do such a mean 

          action.' Now, suppose in any similar case the evidence on both sides 

          leads you to a certain belief or disbelief, and then a reward is offered 

          you for changing your opinion. Can you really change your opinion and 

          belief, for the hope of reward or the fear of punishment? Will you not 

          say, 'As the matter stands I can't change my belief. You must give me 

          proofs that I am wrong or show that the evidence I have heard is false, 

          and then I may change my belief'? It may be that you do get more and 

          do change your belief. But this change is not voluntary on your part. 

          It depends upon the force of evidence upon your individual mind, and 

          the evidence remaining the same and your mental faculties remaining 

          unimpaired--you cannot believe otherwise any more than you can fly.</font><p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...How, 

            then, can [belief] be meritorious? When a jury try a case, all hear 

            the same evidence, but nine say 'Guilty' and three 'Not guilty,' according 

            to the honest belief of each. Are either of these more worthy of reward 

            on that account than the others? Certainly you will say No! But suppose 

            beforehand they all know or suspect that those who say 'Not guilty' 

            will be punished and the rest rewarded: what is likely to be the result? 

            Why, perhaps six will say 'Guilty' honestly believing it, and glad 

            they can with a clear conscience escape punishment; three will say 

            'Not guilty' boldly and rather bear the punishment than be false or 

            dishonest; the other three, fearful of being convinced against their 

            will, will carefully stop their ears while the witnesses for the defence 

            are being examined, and delude themselves with the idea they give 

            an honest verdict because they have heard only one side of the evidence. 

            If any out of the dozen deserve punishment, you surely agree with 

            me it is these. Belief or disbelief is therefore not meritorious, 

            and when founded on an unfair balance of evidence is blameable.</font><p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...In 

            my early youth I heard, as ninety-nine-hundredths of the world do, 

            only the evidence on one side, and became impressed with a veneration 

            for religion which has left some traces even to this day. I have since 

            heard and read much on both sides, and pondered much upon the matter 

            in all its bearings. ...I think I have fairly heard and fairly weighed 

            the evidence on both sides, and I remain an utter disbeliever in almost 

            all that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass over as 

            utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut 

            out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality of 

            Christianity. You I know will not believe that in my case, and I know 

            its falsehood as a general rule. I only ask, Do you think I can change 

            the self-formed convictions of twenty-five years, and could you think 

            such a change would have anything in it to merit reward from justice? 

            I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass 

            of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there 

            be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul 

            or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear 

            of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, 

            or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have 

            lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which 

            are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction."</font> 

        </blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sims letter is an 

        important document. Not only does it show that as of 1861--three years 

        after his formulation of natural selection--Wallace obviously was experiencing 

        no pangs of guilt related to his rejection of religious views, but it 

        also succinctly roots his reasons for such rejection in his convictions 

        regarding the value of belief. Belief had no intrinsic merit; only a continuing 

        unbiased examination of the facts pertaining to any given question resulted 

        in values that were progress-serving.<SUP><a href="#48">49</a></SUP> Superficial or prejudging 

        evaluations generated actions likely to be inconsistent with the greater 

        reality, and thus deserving of rejection by that reality. "Progress" thus 

        occurred only as individual human beings combined a willingness to re-evaluate 

        positions with a receptivity to constructive change. Considering the passage 

        assigned to note 44, Wallace extended this understanding to account for 

        the way society in general "progressed." His approach to classification 

        (note 46), moreover, suggests he had concluded that success within the 

        biological world was, in like fashion, a function of a well-rounded adaptation 

        to multiple influences. In the biological context, of course, the analog 

        to such "continual re-evaluation of position" was achieved rotely, forced 

        by ambient environmental circumstances; nevertheless, those individual 

        organisms (or populations) that were capable of responding productively 

        to the widest range of constraints were the ones that generally prevailed 

        in the struggle for existence.<SUP><a href="#50">50</a></SUP> Thus, whether one was considering 

        the evolution of organisms or social systems, it was possible to view 

        progress as being facilitated by actions deriving from a wide-ranging 

        experience (again, whether "experience" was acquired deliberately, through 

        a coupling of conscious effort and receptivity, or probabilistically, 

        in response to complex interactions of forces; <i>e.g.</i>, at the population 

        level).<SUP><a href="#51">51</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's youthful 

          conclusions regarding the interrelationship of justice, merit and belief 

          are critical to understanding the directions his thinking took in 1858 

          and afterward.<SUP><a href="#52">52</a></SUP> He put the merit/belief argument itself 

          to direct use on several later occasions;<SUP><a href="#53">53</a></SUP> later, we shall 

          look further into how his biological views developed in parallel fashion.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 1862 and his return 

          to England Wallace was a celebrity, and any insecurity he may have ever 

          felt concerning the validity of his personal philosophy of life had 

          long since left him. Consider, therefore, the kind of effect spiritualist 

          philosophy most likely would have had on him at that point. First, it 

          concerned an occult subject--one, moreover, whose phenomena some were 

          trying to attribute to a mechanism with which he was personally familiar: 

          mesmerism. All of these circumstances would have held interest for him. 

          Not only could he personally contribute to the discussion as mesmerism 

          pertained to it,<SUP><a href="#54">54</a></SUP> but as a habitual champion of unappreciated 

          causes, he would have enjoyed trying to right what he perceived to be 

          naive criticisms of a poorly understood subject. Second, the moral teachings 

          of spiritualism were directly relatable to phenomena that appeared to 

          be, at least in some instances, verifiable, and were thus believable. 

          Here, it seemed, was another aspect of the natural world inviting detached 

          exploration by the intelligent skeptic, and Wallace was by nature both 

          skeptical and insatiably curious. Third, the teachings themselves avoided 

          dogma, instead encouraging the individual to respond as his or her personal 

          assessment of the facts warranted. No unmeritorious belief here: this 

          was not religion--at least not of any variety depending on the kind 

          of inculcation and blind acceptance to which Wallace objected. The teachings 

          were also perfectly in line with the ideas on continuity of causality 

          Wallace had reasoned out and adopted some twenty or more years earlier. 

          In short, he recognized in spiritualism elements of a truly "natural" 

          philosophy: it gave a logical, testable accounting of how just cause 

          and effect are related at the level of human consciousness, moral and 

          intellectual behavior, and evolution. Spiritualism, moreover, supported 

          his program of "balancing evidence" (as so succinctly described in the 

          letter of March 15, 1861 to his brother-in-law); <i>i.e.</i>, its proponents 

          concurred with his earlier-stated notion that there was to be no fear 

          of suffering "for the study of nature and the search for truth." His 

          familiarization with spiritualism could only have fortified his already 

          existing negative impression of conventional theism: the less one depended 

          on opinions served up by unquestioning authority, the better.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of the 

          connections set out above alone, it is not difficult to understand why 

          Wallace adopted the belief. He recognized in the movement something 

          quite distinct from rote acceptance of unverifiable doctrines (<i>i.e.</i>, 

          religion), investigated on this basis, and was convinced (rightly or 

          wrongly) by what he found.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever spiritualism 

          may actually represent, Wallace's efforts to grapple with the vagaries 

          of the subject seem scientific enough; that his interpretations of the 

          phenomena (allegedly) involved were biased by anthropomorphism is clear, 

          but the same thing is likely to be said in future years of our present 

          manner of study of psychical subjects. In any case, analysis of Wallace's 

          intellectual development before--or after--1858 should not rest on undefendable 

          assumptions. It cannot be admitted as demonstrated that the teachings 

          of spiritualism are fundamentally inconsistent with nature as the latter 

          is more conventionally interpreted, and, more importantly, these teachings 

          are, in point of fact, neither anti-evolutionary nor anti-"progressive." 

          In my opinion, Wallace viewed them as relaying an evolutionary interpretation 

          of reality, and as being, to a close approximation, compatible with 

          the then-developing materialistic interpretations of biological evolution. 

          Of course, if it is argued <i>a priori</i> that spiritualism and evolution 

          represent mutually incompatible conceptual domains, one inexorably arrives 

          at the facile conclusion that upon accepting spiritualistic beliefs 

          Wallace must have had a change of mind regarding natural selection's 

          relation to man's higher faculties. But the fundamental principles of 

          Wallace's approach to the study of man/nature were set in his mind well 

          before he finally stumbled onto natural selection, and given the fact 

          that he repeatedly re-affirmed his belief in those principles in his 

          writings over a span of seventy years--that is, over a period beginning 

          well before 1858--it is extremely difficult to believe that either natural 

          selection or spiritualism had any profound effect on re-directing them. 

          His relation of the two ideas is the product of his personal evolution 

          of thought, not its cause.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point it becomes 

          necessary to re-examine some of the other things that were on Wallace's 

          mind before 1858, and how these helped shape his formulation of natural 

          selection in that year.<br>

        <p><b><a name="path4"></a><font color="#993366">Wallace's Evolutionary 

          Views: Introduction</font></b>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schwartz has analyzed 

          Wallace's views on the evolution of man in an effort to distinguish 

          them from Darwin's.<SUP><a href="#55">55</a></SUP> Schwartz feels that Wallace came to 

          decide man and nonhuman animals had evolved differently some time after 

          the appearance of his 1858 paper 'On the tendency of varieties to depart 

          indefinitely from the original type,' as that work makes no specific 

          mention of man. But how much weight can be put in this instance on such 

          negative evidence? Perhaps Wallace felt the model could be applied equally 

          well to man, but didn't want to unduly complicate his initial, and typically 

          lucid, presentation of the idea. Or perhaps, as I shall argue, the main 

          point of the Ternate essay, beyond its introduction of natural selection 

          <i>per se</i>, was to lay the groundwork 

          for the idea that man<i> is</i>, in fact, an exception. It should be 

          kept in mind that Wallace had no opportunity to re-work his paper before 

          it was presented to the Linnean Society and then published.<SUP><a href="#56">56</a></SUP> 

          It had been relayed to Darwin and Lyell for comment, not for publication 

          in that form. As such behavior was not Wallace's usual policy before 

          attempting to publish, it is altogether likely that he was contemplating 

          adding material to it. And even this presumes that he was intending 

          to try to publish it right away to begin with: he had, after all, been 

          sketching out the material for a book on evolution.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note that there 

          was no particular reason for him to single out man anyway. The paper 

          was restricted to a consideration of speciation, and avoided any discussion 

          of Wallace's views on evolution in general. Whether he intended to add 

          remarks concerning man's possible exceptional evolutionary relationship 

          to natural selection before publishing the work in one form or another 

          is, at this time, conjectural only; that the work omitted any special 

          reference to man, however, is irrelevant altogether to the conclusions 

          that have been drawn from this fact if Wallace had a different agendum 

          in mind than has generally been assumed.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace probably became 

          an evolutionist about 1845 after reading <i>Vestiges of the Natural 

          History of Creation</i>.<SUP><a href="#57">57</a></SUP> At that point, however, he had 

          not yet begun to relate evolution to the immediate causal agencies we 

          now associate with the workings of natural selection. His letters to 

          Henry Walter Bates during that period<SUP><a href="#58">58</a></SUP> and later comments 

          on <i>Vestiges</i><SUP><a href="#59">59</a></SUP> show that he was more critical of Chambers's<SUP><a href="#60">60</a></SUP> 

          inability to set out a model of process integrating the facts available 

          than he was that writer's rather philosophical/cosmological approach 

          to the subject <i>per se</i>.<SUP><a href="#61">61</a></SUP> 

          Certainly, there were "facts" that could be interpreted as the products 

          of evolution, and it was out of these that a dogma-free conceptualization 

          of the process had to be constructed. The investigations in natural 

          history Wallace had conducted in his spare time while working as a surveyor 

          and teacher in the early 1840s led him to conclude that the facts of 

          diversity might provide a firm base for such a model; as a result, he 

          made constructing a connection between evolution and the distribution 

          of organisms a conscious objective of his collecting expeditions to 

          South America and the Malay Archipelago. It is quite certain that he 

          actually was giving all related variables a good deal of attention: 

          he says so directly in print in 'On the law which has regulated the 

          introduction of new species,'<SUP><a href="#62">62</a></SUP> remarks that are corroborated 

          by the contents of letters he exchanged with his friend Bates.<SUP><a href="#63">63</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's preconceptions 

          about natural process and organization at the time he left for South 

          America devolved in part from his reading of <i>Vestiges</i>, and in 

          part from the general outlook he already had at that point in his life. 

          He had apparently rejected most orthodox Christian interpretations of 

          nature and society long before reading <i>Vestiges</i>, and his adoption 

          of an evolutionary perspective was not an inconsistent next step.<SUP><a href="#64">64</a></SUP> 

          This does not mean, however, that Wallace had also rejected the notion 

          that in one fashion or another "God" might represent the final cause 

          of natural organization.<SUP><a href="#65">65</a></SUP> It is significant that Wallace 

          later looked back at himself as being an agnostic--rather than an atheist--during 

          this period.<SUP><a href="#66">66</a></SUP> "God" was a concept that, in his own words, 

          he "cared and thought nothing about."<SUP><a href="#67">67</a></SUP> As of 1870, of course, 

          he undoubtedly accepted that behind all "universal forces and laws" 

          there lay "the will or power" of a "Great Mind" or "Supreme Intelligence";<SUP><a href="#68">68</a></SUP> 

          it seemed, however, that the "law" of such a will or entity, probably 

          being "connected with the absolute origin of life and organization," 

          was likely "too deep for us to discover."<SUP><a href="#69">69</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such "law" was not, 

          it need be emphasized, to be interpreted as one operating through event-specific 

          Godly intervention: "I reject the hypothesis of 'first causes' for any 

          and every special effect in the universe, except in the...sense that 

          the action of man or of any intelligent being is a first cause."<SUP><a href="#70">70</a></SUP> 

          Wallace would thus have nothing of a "supranatural" God that had created--and 

          was personally supervising--an essentially unprogressing (or, for that 

          matter, progressing) natural reality. Rather, the "Great Mind" represented, 

          in some sense, a universal source of will as an expression of which 

          the laws of the universe operated, in fully uniformitarian fashion, 

          to evolve "special" (<i>i.e.</i>, individual) effects.<SUP><a href="#71">71</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, within this 

          framework, a final cause was in theory operating, but probably was too 

          remote from human appreciation ever to be fully understood. Nonetheless, 

          the "will" of the "Supreme Intelligence" was manifest as an ordered, 

          changing existence encompassing all of reality (including itself), and 

          operating according to describable laws of interaction (<i>e.g.</i>, 

          natural selection and gravitational attraction). These laws combined 

          in such a fashion--quite possibly itself formally describable, and at 

          the least recognizable--making ordered change the necessary consequence 

          of their operation.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that Wallace's 

          intellectual evolution between 1845 and 1870 consisted largely of a 

          shift in opinion as to how these fundamental laws of nature were integrated 

          as a function of final causation. Whereas in the late 1840s and most 

          of the 1850s he believed biological/social evolution might be explained 

          on the basis of laws of interaction directly analogous to--and working 

          alongside of--those governing the physical world (note the first italicized 

          passage in the 'Advantages...' selections presented earlier), he would 

          eventually decide: (1) that (at least) three, rather than two, general 

          domains of interaction pursuant to such laws existed, and (2) that the 

          interaction among these domains defined a nested hierarchy of causal 

          organization.<SUP><a href="#72">72</a></SUP> Otherwise put, while at first Wallace felt 

          that biological and social evolution were forced by physical (<i>i.e.</i>, 

          geological/geographical) relationships analogous to, but of greater 

          complexity than, say, gravitational attraction, later he would conclude 

          that a "push-pull" kind of mutual causality prevailed.<SUP><a href="#73">73</a></SUP> 

          Within the confines of three dimensional space, pre-biological forces 

          laid the foundation for conditions that could support biological organization; 

          the latter, in turn, eventually co-evolved to a point permitting the 

          increasing involvement of a domain of psychic organization.<SUP><a href="#74">74</a></SUP> 

          The growth of the psychic domain within human consciousness coincided 

          with (and depended on) our increasing transcendance of the "everyone 

          for himself" sentiments rooted in the survival instinct necessary to 

          biological success. Such transcendance represented an accelerating "pull" 

          effect within the operation of the hierarchy, because consciously-willed 

          acts by human beings increasingly enhanced the chain of causation enacted 

          by rotely-operating physical and biological laws alone.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we look into 

          the development of these ideas in more detail, it will be helpful to 

          take special notice of a feature of Wallace's views on evolutionary 

          causation that makes them fully distinct from Darwin's. Darwinian natural 

          selection defines a process: one in which the selection of characters 

          apropos to environmental circumstances supports eventual divergences 

          in species lines. The influence of prior causes, both internal and external 

          (loosely, genetic and environmental) to the actors involved is acknowledged, 

          and left open for consideration, identification, and clarification.<SUP><a href="#75">75</a></SUP> 

          The Darwinian approach is to accept historical continuity of form as 

          direct evidence of continuity of process; thus, both natural selection 

          specifically and evolution in general are considered demonstrated if 

          speciation can be synonymized with spatial-temporal chronology of adaptive 

          change.<SUP><a href="#76">76</a></SUP> In short, the focus is on the process of divergence: 

          "process yields structure yields process..."; <i>i.e.</i>, what is now 

          often referred to as "tree-thinking."<SUP><a href="#77">77</a></SUP> In contrast, at no 

          time during his life did Wallace recognize a <i>necessary</i> connection 

          between process and particular structure. Wallace considered natural 

          selection a law of natural interaction rather than a process. There 

          is no generalizable "process" of adaptation implicit in Wallace's realization 

          of natural selection, only the result of being adapted.<SUP><a href="#78">78</a></SUP> 

          For many years Wallace used the term "accumulate" to describe how he 

          felt favorable variations were added to a population as a function of 

          entirely idiosyncratic associations between individual and environment.<SUP><a href="#79">79</a></SUP> 

          Characters were selected, for whatever reasons, and this fact he termed 

          "natural selection."<SUP><a href="#80">80</a></SUP> "Evolution," on the other hand, he 

          regarded as a process fueled by the simultaneous operation of all such 

          laws of interaction, any of which might be secondarily influencing natural 

          selection (or each other) over long periods of time in any number of 

          ways. Thus, each such law could be observed to produce certain classes 

          of immediate effects, but no one actor on the evolutionary stage could 

          be considered "caused" in its entirety by any of these laws individually.<SUP><a href="#81">81</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Wallace 

          found it easier in practice to defend the fundamental proposition that 

          biological evolution occurred at all by yielding to the Darwinian notion 

          that evolution was largely a matter of character divergence. This was 

          not a difficult concession, as he could identify many adaptive features 

          that could be related, in a relatively immediate sense, to particular 

          classes of natural selection-mediated causation. Mimetic resemblance, 

          for example, "accumulated" as the enhanced survival potential accruing 

          from looking like something--anything--else that was inedible or dangerous. 

          In analogous fashion, gravity yielded "accumulations" of particles under 

          a variety of domain-limited physical conditions: to produce, for example, 

          talus slopes, moraines, fluvial deposits, etc.<br>

          Diversification</font></b>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early 1856 Wallace 

          composed the essay 'On the habits of the orang-utan of Borneo,' within 

          which the following commentary appeared:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "Naturalists are too apt to imagine, when they cannot discover, a use 

          for everything in nature: they are not even content to let "beauty" 

          be a sufficient use, but hunt after some purpose to which even that 

          can be applied by the animal itself, as if one of the noblest and most 

          refining parts of man's nature, the love of beauty for its own sake, 

          would not be perceptible also in the works of a Supreme Creator. The 

          separate species of which the organic world consists being parts of 

          a whole, we must suppose some dependence of each upon all; some general 

          design which has determined the details, quite independently of individual 

          necessities. We look upon the anomalies, the eccentricities, the exaggerated 

          or diminished development of certain parts, as indications of a general 

          system of nature, by a careful study of which we may learn much that 

          is at present hidden from us..."<SUP><a href="#82">82</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expressed in these words 

        are thoughts that would be fully mature in Wallace's mind only by the 

        mid-1860s. The first, and more straightforward, is the concept that there 

        exists a "general design which has determined the details, quite independently 

        of individual necessities." In this statement is reflected, simultaneously, 

        (1) Wallace's rejection of the idea that first causes exist "for any and 

        every special effect in the universe," and (2) his acceptance that there 

        yet existed a confining "general design." At that point, however, he undoubtedly 

        believed that the "general design" could be understood to directly explain 

        specifics of diversification and adaptation (<i>i.e.</i>, in a manner 

        similar to the way Newtonian physics modelled individual gravitational 

        relationships in the heavens).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also contained in the 

          passages above is the germ of the idea that man's love of beauty should 

          itself be perceptible as a work of the Supreme Creator. The "Supreme 

          Creator" is here viewed as being both: (1) further removed from the 

          efficient cause of each modification than was assumed by Creationists; 

          and (2) more encompassing in its operation than were it merely acting 

          to meet the immediate material needs and/or conscious desires of each 

          individual organism (<i>i.e.</i>, both the material structure of lower 

          organisms and the conscious/emotional faculties of higher ones fell 

          within its influence, whether such influence could be perceived as operating 

          or not).<SUP><a href="#83">83</a></SUP> As early as 1856, therefore, Wallace was arguing 

          that the "general design" of nature called for a model of its productions 

          recognizing not merely the place of material things within it, but: 

          (1) man's emotional and intellectual response to material things, and 

          (2) the possibility of higher causes altogether. And, although he was 

          ready to accept that we might be ignorant of the greater forces that 

          were at work, he was not willing to grant that such forces were necessarily 

          unsystematic in their enaction (<i>e.g.</i>, were the product of unpredictable 

          Godly "first causes").<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well known that 

          Wallace's disenchantment with the simple model of causality offered 

          by both conventional theism and then-existing natural science was considerable 

          well before 1858--certainly back to 1845, and probably even into the 

          late or mid-1830s. His excitement over <i>Vestiges</i> foreshadowed 

          many remarks he would later make, as Chambers had argued that "progressive 

          development" was the underlying theme of existence. McKinney, Brooks, 

          Browne, Malinchak, and Turner<SUP><a href="#84">84</a></SUP> have explained how this would 

          have appealed to Wallace's social views at that point. At the time he 

          read the book, Wallace had long since adopted progressive ideas regarding 

          societal evolution; he was a disciple of the idealist reformer Robert 

          Owen even as a teenager, believing that most of the wrongs of society 

          could be eliminated through consciously (and, especially, conscientiously) 

          applied programs of social reform. It was Chambers's position that evolution 

          proceeded toward the development of "godly" beings, an idea that inherently 

          accepted the notion of societal advance. His position on organic change, 

          however, was primarily based on a Lyellian, uniformitarian, approach 

          to geology. Through this approach it was possible to imagine that generally 

          acting physical laws implicitly gave rise to progressive biological 

          change--otherwise put, that the general design of nature depended on 

          the operation of uniformitarian laws that supported what have been more 

          recently called "deviation-amplifying" processes.<SUP><a href="#85">85</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chambers's position, 

          in fact, were most of the seeds of Wallace's later synthesis.<SUP><a href="#86">86</a></SUP> 

          If we believe his later reference to the subject in 'On the law...,'<SUP><a href="#87">87</a></SUP> 

          Wallace quickly settled on a means of transforming these "progressive 

          development" leanings into the set of ideas expressed ten years later 

          in that paper. His focus became the description of divergence in species 

          lines. But this emphasis--on large scale spatial/historical relations--turned 

          out to be something of a mistake. In his effort to avoid a first causes-based 

          viewpoint, Wallace almost threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. 

          Creationists argued that the Creator had specially provided all the 

          earth's creatures with just what they needed to survive. Wallace rejected 

          this notion outright, agreeing with Chambers that the natural progression 

          had to be self-regulating to conserve an intelligible relation of cause 

          to effect.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, despite words 

          he later wrote that might be interpreted as indicating the contrary,<SUP><a href="#88">88</a></SUP> 

          it is quite clear that prior to 1858 Wallace even rejected the argument 

          that there was necessary functional utility to adaptation. He did not 

          yet see that the assumption of utility would be necessary to establish 

          a generalization regarding the immediate causes of biological change; 

          <i>i.e.</i>, to explain how population change (though not necessarily 

          the long term "accumulations" of change) was self-regulating. In 1856, 

          he incorporated the following comments into the already-cited 'On the 

          habits of the orang-utan of Borneo':<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "...Do you mean to assert, then, some of my readers will indignantly 

          ask, that this animal, or any animal, is provided with organs which 

          are of no use to it? Yes, we reply, we do mean to assert that many animals 

          are provided with organs and appendages which serve no material or physical 

          purpose. The extraordinary excrescences of many insects, the fantastic 

          and many-coloured plumes which adorn certain birds, the excessively 

          developed horns in some of the antelopes, the colours and infinitely 

          modified forms of many flower-petals, are all cases for an explanation 

          of which we must look to some general principle far more recondite than 

          a simple relation to the necessities of the individual. We conceive 

          it to be a most erroneous, a most contracted view of the organic world, 

          to believe that every part of an animal or of a plant exists solely 

          for some material and physical use to the individual--to believe that 

          all the beauty, all the infinite combinations and changes of form and 

          structure should have the sole purpose and end of enabling each animal 

          to support its existence--to believe, in fact, that we know the one 

          sole end and purpose of every modification that exists in organic change, 

          and to refuse to recognize the possibility of there being any other. 

          Naturalists are too apt to imagine, when they cannot discover, a use 

          for everything in nature... ...we believe that the constant practice 

          of imputing, right or wrong, some use to the individual, of every part 

          of its structure, and even of inculcating the doctrine that every modification 

          exists solely for some such use, is an error fatal to our complete appreciation 

          of all the variety, the beauty, and the harmony of the organic world..."<SUP><a href="#89">89</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vague strains of this 

        kind of thinking can also be found in other writings Wallace produced 

        before 1858.<SUP><a href="#90">90</a></SUP> This leaning cannot be passed off as a simple<i> 

        a priori</i> bias, however, as Wallace's preconceptions were being fortified 

        by a modestly convincing process of reasoning by exclusion. To begin with 

        (and given Wallace's rejection of Lamarckian thinking), no compelling 

        non-Creationist arguments existed which provided any good reasons for 

        thinking that every adaptation had to be useful. Importantly, moreover, 

        the "every species has come into existence coincident in time and space 

        with a pre-existing closely allied species" model expressed in 'On the 

        law...' had ramifications that seemed incompatible with a point of view 

        embracing necessary adaptive utility. In 'On the law...' Wallace notes 

        that most authorities agree that most rudimentary organs "have no special 

        function in the animal economy,"<SUP><a href="#91">91</a></SUP> and that such organs seem 

        entirely inexplicable in the absence of forces yielding slow, gradational 

        changes in organisms (forces so pervasive, one supposes, as to override 

        the non-function of those structures having no immediate utility). In 

        'On the natural history of the Aru Islands' he rejects the idea that immediate 

        conditions of climate regulate the distribution of existing species, as 

        "we should not see countries the most opposite in character with similar 

        productions, while others almost exactly alike as respects climate and 

        general aspect, yet differ totally in their forms of organic life."<SUP><a href="#92">92</a></SUP> 

        The same conclusion is implicit in his comparisons of insect size and 

        color in the temperate versus tropical regions in 'Observations on the 

        zoology of Borneo';<SUP><a href="#93">93</a></SUP> <i>i.e.</i>, local physical conditions 

        apparently sponsored the same manner of adaptation in physically separated, 

        unrelated forms.<SUP><a href="#94">94</a></SUP> This fact seemed to suggest that adaptation 

        <i>per se</i> was a result, rather 

        than the cause, of the "progressive development" of organisms (<i>i.e.</i>, 

        some more general set of influences must determine how new characters 

        combined to effect "progress").<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thus very unlikely 

          that before 1858 Wallace was basing any of his thoughts on the supposition 

          of necessary character utility. He may well have believed (and probably 

          did), as McKinney<SUP><a href="#95">95</a></SUP> observes, that adaptations "occurred" 

          while species evolved, but this association was merely correlative; 

          <i>i.e.</i>, derivative. As early as 1853, Wallace implied that it was 

          futile to pursue the "red herring" of adaptation-based causality any 

          further: "...In all works on Natural History, we constantly find details 

          of the marvelous adaptation of animals to their food, their habits, 

          and the localities in which they are found. But naturalists are now 

          beginning to look beyond this, and to see that there must be some other 

          principle regulating the infinitely varied forms of animal life..."<SUP><a href="#96">96</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's belief that 

          the "necessary utility" argument was an explanatory red herring must 

          have been reinforced by his experiences with the native peoples he encountered 

          over the course of his travels. It should be kept in mind that Wallace 

          had been considering man's place in evolution right from the beginning 

          of his attention to the subject.<SUP><a href="#97">97</a></SUP> Although many of the activities 

          of people in primitive societies bespoke adaptation forced by local 

          peculiarities of environment, there were yet as many that seemed unrelated. 

          There appeared to be little connection between morality and survival, 

          for example, and even less between the latter and mathematical, artistic 

          or musical abilities. He could only conclude that however evolution 

          operated, it appeared to enlist adaptations/abilities that were in some 

          combinations directly functional and in others not so, at least with 

          respect to survival <i>per se</i>. 

          This is the reason for Wallace's great interest in the orangutan: he 

          viewed it as an important bridge between animals and human beings in 

          this respect. Judging from his comments in 'On the habits of the orang-utan...,' 

          his study of this animal only served to confirm his then-existing thoughts 

          regarding non-utility.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "principle" to 

          which Wallace alludes in the last passage quoted undoubtedly extended 

          beyond the concepts set out in 'On the law...' He realized that the 

          "law" expressed in that paper was incapable of doing more than stating 

          the essential results of species divergence in time and space. Here, 

          only, was a description of continuity of effects.<SUP><a href="#98">98</a></SUP> His problem 

          narrowed to identifying a kind of "self-regulation" that caused such 

          a continuity of effects.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In attempting to substantiate 

          the view expressed in <i>Vestiges</i> that evolution consisted of a 

          "progressive" succession of animal forms, Wallace needed to come up 

          with three kinds of proof. First, he had to prove that evolution in 

          fact took place. Nontrivial as this problem was, it was the easiest 

          one to deal with--assuming, of course, that it was true. Second, he 

          had to provide a model of how it took place; that is, he had to demonstrate 

          those conditions immediate to the life and activities of living things 

          that led to irreversible forms of change in them. Third, and most difficult, 

          he had to identify not only these immediate causes, but the way his 

          assumed final cause operated on them to produce "progress." He very 

          quickly saw how to approach the first problem--through careful study 

          of the spatial-temporal links between the present distribution of organisms 

          and their fossil record. This thinking is summarized in the 'On the 

          law...' essay.<p> 

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had made no progress 

          whatsoever on the second problem as of 1855, however. Arguably, in fact, 

          he had regressed. The reason for this is probably that he thought a 

          solution would be implicit in the solution to the third problem; <i>i.e.</i>, 

          he was approaching the problem from the "top-down." Once he had examined 

          enough "facts" and had confirmed the spatial-temporal relations of geography 

          and geology suggesting that evolution really took place, he set his 

          sights on solving the final cause issue, in so doing avoiding for the 

          moment the matter of immediate causation at the biological level (whose 

          individual components, he believed at that time, were "unconceivable"<SUP><a href="#99">99</a></SUP>).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, Wallace's pre-1858 

          efforts indicate that he had adopted a rather unconventional form of 

          teleology. Following Chambers, Wallace had allowed the concept of progress 

          to permeate his thinking, probably to the extent that he believed such 

          progress represented movement toward a system-level goal: the development 

          of higher, "godly," beings. Whereas the goal-centered Lamarckian model 

          had dwelled on the immediate causes and specific effects of organic 

          change, however, Wallace's tacitly denied a causal role to adaptation. 

          Instead, the confining/promoting influences imagined were ostensibly 

          of grander scale, overriding individual effects through continuity of 

          influence, just as Newtonian forces had supported the original consolidation 

          of the solar system.<SUP><a href="#100">100</a></SUP> In short, he thought the direction 

          of the continuing "accumulation" of characters was being influenced 

          by very general--and prior--properties of environmental organization.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest on this basis 

          that Wallace's pre-1858 activities indicate his search for a geographical 

          Bauplan. Perhaps as a function of his youthful involvements with trigonometry, 

          mechanics, and geodesy,<SUP><a href="#101">101</a></SUP> he anticipated that the details 

          of animal distribution would reveal to him, in their organized relations, 

          those ever-present, unformly-acting laws that conspired to guide evolution, 

          much as the interrelations of the heavenly bodies had revealed the nature 

          of gravity.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's commitment 

          to a search for a geographical kind of Bauplan--rather than a physiological/morphological 

          one--is not puzzling. To begin with, all of his pre-1845 nature-oriented 

          activities had had a distinctly geographical side: plant and insect 

          collecting, surveying, land use study and evaluation, and informal study 

          of the economics of agriculture. About the same time, moreover, he read--and 

          was very favorably impressed with--several works containing strongly 

          geographical themes.<SUP><a href="#102">102</a></SUP> Further, he lacked the formal training 

          (and interest) in physiology and morphology that would have been necessary 

          to support a laboratory investigation of adaptive trends--which, in 

          any case, did not seem the right direction for exploration, giving into, 

          as it appeared, adaptationist lines of reasoning. Finally, and very 

          significantly, a geographical framework was less remote from an understanding 

          of how societal change took place. As mentioned earlier, Wallace was 

          much taken with Herbert Spencer's <i>Social Statics</i>--especially 

          with that writer's views on how social problems were created by injustices 

          stemming from the then-existing conditions of land ownership.<SUP><a href="#103">103</a></SUP> 

          Over the period 1853-1858, geographical determinism--as related to the 

          explanation of both biological and social evolution--was a subject at 

          the very front of his mind.<SUP><a href="#104">104</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period 

          Wallace obviously regarded species diversification as the distinguishing 

          feature of biological advance. Adaptation was a derivative, or even 

          incidental, process. Nonetheless, he realized that character states 

          could be used to distinguish between varieties, and that an understanding 

          of the manner of emergence of varieties was crucial to an appreciation 

          of the process of speciation. Thus it would be necessary, in one fashion 

          or another, to relate his law of geographical/geological influence to 

          the adaptive characteristics of individual organisms.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as the years passed, 

          Wallace could not recognize any way in which the greater conditions 

          of environment imposed an influence of the kind he was anticipating. 

          Again, important characteristics of animals--their size and color, for 

          example<SUP><a href="#105">105</a></SUP>--seemed more relatable to immediate causal agencies. 

          There was, further, the persisting problem of how to fit social evolution 

          into the picture. Man passed on innovations--in the form of mathematics, 

          art, music, moral teachings, etc.--and did so regardless of whether 

          there seemed to be any apparent survival value involved. How could organic 

          evolution proceed in a fashion responding to environmental constraints 

          and opportunities, yet produce adaptive structures whose persistence 

          was not necessarily a direct and exclusive function of those constraints 

          and opportunities?<SUP><a href="#106">106</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The natural selection 

          concept reinforced his belief that this question could be answered within 

          the general framework of final causes he had set out for himself. Admitting 

          character variation, natural selection could be viewed as operating 

          to yield <i>whatever</i> new adaptations that could come about and differentially 

          persist. This was a model through which one could understand the process 

          of diversification, as long as one accepted that selection itself (in 

          contradistinction with the "accumulation" of character states) was the 

          generalizable law, the necessary result of interaction between life 

          and its environment. As has been pointed out by Browne,<SUP><a href="#107">107</a></SUP> 

          Wallace envisioned a selection process operating at the group level, 

          and producing new populations characterized by distinct adaptive suites. 

          Browne notes that Wallace was thinking in terms of statistical generalizations; 

          this appears to be consistent with the rules for systematic revision 

          (multiple character trait-based analysis, etc.) he was applying at the 

          time.<SUP><a href="#108">108</a></SUP> If single characters were untrustworthy distinguishers 

          of species from one another taxonomically, neither were they likely 

          to mirror the only relevant population-dividing forces. Suites of peculiarities 

          defined species.<SUP><a href="#109">109</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significantly, it was 

          still possible to admit that certain individual characteristics might 

          have no adaptive value--as long as their presence was correlated, for 

          reasons yet unknown, with ones that did. This suited Wallace perfectly: 

          he could now explain how new forms came into existence, but could still 

          avoid the assumption that structural continuities over time necessarily 

          implied single causal continuities.<SUP><a href="#110">110</a></SUP> At the same time, 

          of course, natural selection shed no light on the prior problem of why 

          some characters maintained themselves indefinitely despite their apparent 

          non-utilitarian nature, and an unceasing, biological utility-refining 

          selection pressure.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears to me that 

          Wallace never thought that all levels of adaptive function could be 

          attributed to the action of natural selection. Those that could were 

          to be contextualized in simple survival terms as responses to the immediate 

          (causal) constraints of environment--but the utility function of the 

          rest had to be referred to associations with causes not yet understood. 

          This conclusion, not natural selection itself, was the real breakthrough 

          in Wallace's thinking. It allowed him a position consistent with his 

          continuing aversion to "first causes" thinking, but conducive to explaining 

          one-to-one associations between environment and biological structure.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relationship that 

          apparently helped Wallace sort all this out was that existing between 

          man and domesticated animals. Consider the following passages from pages 

          59-61 of 'On the tendency...':<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "The essential difference in the condition of wild and domestic animals 

          is this,--that among the former, their well-being and very existence 

          depend upon the full exercise and healthy condition of all their senses 

          and physical powers, whereas, among the latter, these are only partially 

          exercised, and in some cases absolutely unused... ...Half of [the domestic 

          animal's] senses and faculties are quite useless; and the other half 

          are but occasionally called into feeble exercise, while even its muscular 

          system is only irregularly called into action. Now when a variety of 

          such an animal occurs, having increased power or capacity in any organ 

          or sense, such increase is totally useless, is never called into action, 

          and may even exist without the animal ever becoming aware of it... ...in 

          the domesticated animal all variations have an equal chance of continuance; 

          and those which would decidedly render a wild animal unable to compete 

          with its fellows and continue its existence are no disadvantage whatever 

          in a state of domesticity... ...We see, then, that <i>no inferences 

          as to varieties in a state of nature can be deduced from the observation 

          of those occurring among domestic animals</i>. The two are so much opposed 

          to each other in every circumstance of their existence, that <i>what 

          applies to the one is almost sure not to apply to the other</i>..." 

          [my italics]</font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's arguments here 

        seem to be directed toward exposing an exception to the rule. The point 

        of interest, however, is that it is not altogether clear which discussion 

        he is posing as the exception, and which the rule. Earlier in the same 

        work, on page 54, he straightforwardly states:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "...it is the object of the present paper to show that [the] assumption 

          ["that varieties occuring in a state of nature are in all respects analogous 

          to or even identical with those of domestic animals"] is altogether 

          false, that there is a general principle which will cause many varieties 

          to survive the parent species, and to give rise to successive variations 

          departing further and further from the original type, and which also 

          produces, in domesticated animals, the tendency of varieties to return 

          to the parent form.</font>"</blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the same essay 

        he notes that his theory explains "the remarkable persistence of unimportant 

        parts such as colour, texture of plumage and hair, form of horns or crests, 

        through a series of species differing considerably in more essential characters."<SUP><a href="#111">111</a></SUP> 

        His ideas have progressed--ever so subtly--from the non-utilitarian position 

        expressed in the orangutan essay to one in which he views characters varying 

        in being "the more or the less" "essential" (the characters he lists are, 

        of course, among the easiest to modify through selective breeding practices).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passages I have 

          italicized in the selections above are of especial interest. From the 

          last it is apparent that, in contrast with Darwin, Wallace did not view 

          domestication as a process paralleling natural selection--rather, it 

          was its antithesis.<SUP><a href="#112">112</a></SUP> Why? Because no biological "self-regulation" 

          was operating in the case of artificial selection. The latter produced 

          changes "without the animal ever becoming aware of it" or leaving it 

          at any "competitive disadvantage." These concepts were the key: traits 

          that could be passed on, for no apparent reason of utility (that is, 

          with respect to "natural" environment), yet produce no "disadvantage." 

          By inference, biological utility was a valid concept only to the extent 

          that it supported characters whose regulation (or further development) 

          in a population might well be guaranteed only through the intervention 

          of additional, but not yet known, causal agencies.<SUP><a href="#113">113</a></SUP> This 

          flexibility of interpretation was necessary, because it would be very 

          difficult in any given instance to prove that an immediate "one cause-one 

          effect" determinism actually existed.<SUP><a href="#114">114</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These connections explain 

          Wallace's continuing interest in the study of character utility and 

          why, as he grew older, he was able to maintain his strong defense of 

          natural selection while developing an increasingly teleological cosmological 

          position. As of 1858 he could not guage to what extent the immediate 

          physical/biological environment determined utility function (and, in 

          fact, in later years he abandoned some of his earlier arguments regarding 

          particular "non-necessary" physical traits, as Kottler<SUP><a href="#115">115</a></SUP> 

          and others have pointed out).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest, therefore, 

          that the purpose of 'On the tendency...' has never been entirely recognized. 

          It was not intended in the main as the revelation of a "new theory of 

          evolution" (<i>i.e.</i>, natural selection), but as an interim statement 

          clearing the ground for an interpretation of evolutionary change that 

          was not bound <i>a priori</i> by the assumption that all adaptive characters 

          are directly related to the program of the immediate environment. Natural 

          selection thus in effect became the "rule" that distinguished between 

          those characteristics that were so related, and those for which additional 

          explanation was necessary. That Wallace sent the manuscript to Darwin 

          was predictable: how to treat the domestication process had been one 

          of the main subjects of their earlier exchanges of letters. One surmises 

          that he felt Darwin would be interested in both parts of his argument. 

          As mentioned earlier, however, Darwin recognized no logical difference 

          between "artificial" and "natural" selection processes. To be sure, 

          the immediately operating influences in each instance were quite different; 

          the common thread for him, however, was that both kinds of selection 

          produced the result of changes in biological form. Wallace, by contrast, 

          still holding the view that changes in form were no more than correlative 

          to process, was coming at the matter from a totally different starting 

          point.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1870 Wallace wrote:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "I have also endeavoured to show, how the same power which has modified 

          animals has acted on man; and have, I believe, proved that, as soon 

          as the human intellect became developed above a certain low stage, man's 

          body would cease to be materially affected by natural selection, because 

          the development of his mental faculties would render important modifications 

          of its form and structure unnecessary. It will, therefore, probably 

          excite some surprise among my readers, to find that I do not consider 

          that all nature can be explained on the principles of which I am so 

          ardent an advocate; and that I am now myself going to state objections, 

          and to place limits, to the power of "natural selection." I believe, 

          however, that there are such limits; and that just as surely as we can 

          trace the action of natural laws in the development of organic forms, 

          and can clearly conceive that fuller knowledge would enable us to follow 

          step by step the whole process of that development, so surely can we 

          trace the action of some unknown higher law, beyond and independent 

          of all those laws of which we have any knowledge."<SUP><a href="#116">116</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same essay he adds:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "The inference I would draw from this class of phenomena is, that a 

          superior intelligence has guided the development of man in a definite 

          direction, and for a special purpose, just as man guides the development 

          of many animal and vegetable forms. The laws [note plural "laws"!] of 

          evolution alone would, perhaps, never have produced a grain so well 

          adapted to man's use as wheat and maize; such traits as the seedless 

          banana and bread-fruit; or such animals as the Guernsey milch cow, or 

          the London dray-horse. Yet these so closely resemble the unaided productions 

          of nature, that we may well imagine a being who had mustered the laws 

          of development of organic forms through past ages, refusing to believe 

          that any new power had been concerned in the production, and scornfully 

          rejecting the theory (as my theory will be rejected by many who agree 

          with me on other points), that in these few cases a controlling intelligence 

          had directed the action of the laws of variation, multiplication, and 

          survival, for his own purposes. We know, however, that this has been 

          done; and we must therefore admit the possibility that, if we are not 

          the highest intelligences in the universe, some higher intelligence 

          may have directed the process by which the human race was developed, 

          by means of more subtle agencies than we are acquainted with. At the 

          same time I must confess, that this theory has the disadvantage of requiring 

          the intervention of some distinct individual intelligence, to aid in 

          the production of what we can hardly avoid considering as the ultimate 

          aim and outcome of all organized existence--intellectual, ever-advancing, 

          spiritual man. It therefore implies, that the great laws which govern 

          the material universe were insufficient for his production, <i>unless</i> 

          [my italics] we consider (as we may fairly do) that the controlling 

          action of such higher intelligences is a necessary part of those laws, 

          just as the action of all surrounding organisms is one of the agencies 

          in organic development."<SUP><a href="#117">117</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see no reason why Wallace 

        might not just as easily have written the preceding words in 1864--or 

        even 1858--as 1870: he merely would have felt a good deal less confident 

        in doing so before he had collected evidence supporting the notion that, 

        in parallel with domesticated animals, man was evolving without "ever 

        becoming aware of it." The essential element of Wallace's cosmology with 

        respect to man--that forces extending beyond his immediate awareness of 

        their operation and impact were influencing his overall development--remained 

        intact between at least as early as 1856 (the year of the orangutan essay) 

        and his 1870 publication of <i>Contributions to the Theory of Natural 

        Selection.</i> It must have been in good 

        part for this reason that Wallace wanted to hear what Darwin and Lyell 

        had to say about his theory before he attempted to publish in 1858: he 

        believed it identified no more than the critical efficient cause of the 

        process named in the paper's title. It did not yet explain, however, why 

        some characters, once in existence, could be <i>maintained</i> despite 

        their apparent inutility. Would others (especially Lyell, who Wallace 

        must have known was not an evolutionist) object to this weakness?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironically, Wallace 

          was probably afraid that his new theory would be criticized on the grounds 

          that it attempted to explain "too much"; <i>i.e.</i>, the dynamics of 

          emergence of all purely biological structures.<SUP><a href="#118">118</a></SUP> But the 

          pendulum swung the other way, and with the premature reading of the 

          paper and Darwin's publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i> 

          the next year, Wallace's initial worry became academic. With no proof 

          of more remote causes at hand, it would have been futile to press the 

          issue at that point, and Wallace turned his attention to defending ground 

          already gained. He accelerated his study of the connections between 

          biological change and (1) adaptation<SUP><a href="#119">119</a></SUP> and (2) geological/geographical 

          distribution;<SUP><a href="#120">120</a></SUP> clearly, it was crucial to the more immediate 

          cause to develop a better appreciation of these two critical relationships, 

          and in turn to get others thinking about related subjects and contributing. 

          Just as clearly, no attempts could be made to raise specific objections 

          to Darwin's more open-ended position on evolutionary causality until 

          he had taken the time to consider in detail the limits of the explanatory 

          domain of natural selection.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is surely for this 

          reason that Wallace had almost nothing to say about the evolution of 

          man between 1858 and 1864: he had little to add to what he had already 

          said in 1856 regarding the relationship of continuity to utility, and 

          there was no point in speculating further until a solution to the hierarchical 

          causality issue presented itself.<br>

        <p><b><a name="path6"></a><font color="#993366">The Completion of Wallace's 

          "Theory of Evolution"</font></b>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Wallace returned 

          to England in 1862, he was a man in an awkward position. Despite the 

          fact that in the four preceding years he had written virtually nothing 

          regarding Darwinian concepts,<SUP><a href="#121">121</a></SUP> on the basis of the Ternate 

          essay he was considered a "Darwin supporter." This was true enough; 

          what was not appreciated, however, was that the emergence of natural 

          selection as a viable concept merely meant that he now had to concentrate 

          on figuring out how, specifically, human beings were evolving "without 

          ever becoming aware of it."<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially encouraged 

          by the success of the (Darwinian) materialist formulation of natural 

          selection, Wallace turned to the work of another famous materialist, 

          Herbert Spencer, for inspiration. In 1862 he read Spencer's <i>First 

          Principles</i> and, around the same time, apparently re-read <i>Social 

          Statics</i>.<SUP><a href="#122">122</a></SUP> In <i>My Life</i>, 

          Wallace writes:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "Soon after my return home, in 1862 or 1863, Bates and I, having both 

          read <i>First Principles</i> and been immensely impressed by it, went 

          together to call on Herbert Spencer... Our thoughts were full of the 

          great unsolved problem of the origin of life--a problem which Darwin's 

          <i>Origin of Species</i> left in as much obscurity as ever--and we looked 

          to Spencer as the one man living who could give us some clue to it. 

          His wonderful exposition of the fundamental laws and conditions, actions 

          and interactions of the material universe seemed to penetrate so deeply 

          into [the] nature of things...that we both hoped he could throw some 

          light on that great problem of problems..."<SUP><a href="#123">123</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a January 2, 1864, 

        letter to Darwin, Wallace says of Spencer: "He appears to me as far ahead 

        of John Stuart Mill as J. S. M. is of the rest of the world, and, I may 

        add, as Darwin is of Agassiz. The range of his knowledge is no less than 

        its acuracy... in his forthcoming volume on Biology he is I understand 

        going to show that there is something else besides Natural Selection at 

        work in nature. So you must look out for a 'foeman worthy of your steel'!"<SUP><a href="#124">124</a></SUP> 

        In this letter Wallace also suggests that Darwin read <i>Social Statics</i>. 

        Spencer's influence on Wallace's thinking was undoubtedly strong during 

        this period: the combined arguments of <i>Social Statics</i> and <i>First 

        Principles</i> probably convinced him once and for all that evolution 

        occurred as the result of "persistently directed force." Spiritualism 

        would provide support for the conclusion that such force was a manifestation 

        of a universal will.<SUP><a href="#125">125</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's "experiment" 

          in materialist (Wallace usually employed the word "individualist" rather 

          than "materialist") thinking culminated in two important position papers 

          he presented at scientific meetings in early 1864. These were 'The origin 

          of human races...,' read to the Anthropological Society of London on 

          March 1, 1864, and 'On the phenomena...,' presented sixteen days later 

          to the Linnean Society of London.<SUP><a href="#126">126</a></SUP> The first paper represented 

          the first time Wallace combined his historical 'On the law...' model 

          with his ecological 'On the tendency...' arguments to treat man's evolution;<SUP><a href="#127">127</a></SUP> 

          the second, the first time he applied these in combination to a discussion 

          of animal evolution. Wallace was uncharacteristically proud of both 

          works, and intent on making sure Spencer knew of them: he sent him a 

          reprint copy of 'The origin of human races...,' probably as soon as 

          one was available,<SUP><a href="#128">128</a></SUP> and specially composed an article-length 

          abstract of 'On the phenomena...' for the journal <i>Reader</i>,<SUP><a href="#129">129</a></SUP> 

          with which Spencer was connected in an advisory capacity.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace was not entirely 

          happy with the individualism-influenced arguments presented in 'The 

          origin of human races...,' however (see later discussion). Still, by 

          1865 he was certainly convinced that natural selection was, at least 

          within the general limits he had always conceived for it, an absolutely 

          valid concept. Just as certainly, he believed that natural selection 

          could do no more than provide a general label for the proximate causes 

          of organic diversification. Wallace was apparently still trying to work 

          out a hierarchical causal model accounting for the evolutionary function 

          of ostensibly survival-unrelated characters when he began to digest 

          the spiritualism literature sometime between 1862 and 1865.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his many later 

          writings on the subject (including those sampled earlier), it can be 

          seen that he soon came to the conclusion that the spirit realm described 

          by spiritualist prophets such as Stainton Moses constituted a natural 

          domain within which the function of organic evolution was continued--in 

          the same way the latter continued, was intimately linked with, and depended 

          on, the impetus of continuing forms of inorganic evolution. The critical 

          connection for Wallace would have been his recognition that, given the 

          supposed nature of the spirit realm, the higher faculties of man did 

          in fact have utility. But this was not a function contributing only 

          to biological survival, and thus devolving from causes dictated by conditions 

          of the immediate physical environment. Rather, the refinement of the 

          higher faculties made possible a continuing elevation of function after 

          the biological death of the individual within a purely psychic (or "will-expressed") 

          domain of organization. Higher spiritual development meant a greater 

          capacity for identifying (and setting into action) new causal forces 

          contributing to the overall evolutionary progression (much as biological 

          evolution had modified the evolution of physical systems such as the 

          atmosphere).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace apparently 

          felt that the formal languages of thought--logic and mathematics, for 

          example--did no more than to serve belief. Both logic and mathematics 

          could be called upon to help identify and characterize any evidence 

          adjudged, of course, but ultimately a belief consistent with the reality 

          of the senses--including others' beliefs--was the final object of learning, 

          not a detached logical shorthand. Wallace's style of thinking is therefore 

          perhaps more relatable to pragmatism than it is to naturalism. Will 

          existed prior to force, which itself was prior to matter (and thus "nature"). 

          Causal continuity was best addressed in terms of will, not matter; thus, 

          coincidence of structure and function should not be held to offer proof 

          that the former "caused" the latter.<SUP><a href="#130">130</a></SUP> The brain, for example, 

          was not to be construed as the "cause" of conscious awareness; rather, 

          it was a structure that had evolved pursuant to consciousness.<SUP><a href="#131">131</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace's approach 

          to spiritualism itself seems little different from that he applied to 

          the consideration of any other subject he took up.<SUP><a href="#132">132</a></SUP> His 

          attraction to automatic slate-writing, apparitions, and so forth almost 

          assuredly had nothing to do with a "religious conversion" occasioned 

          by "disappointment" over natural selection. Rather, he considered spiritualism 

          what might be termed "evolutionary psychology"--a "new branch of anthropology."<SUP><a href="#133">133</a></SUP> 

          In sum, Wallace "believed" in the tenets of spiritualism for exactly 

          the same reason he "believed" in natural selection (or, for that matter, 

          any other concept he had come to accept as being valid within certain 

          limits)--they were substantiated by "facts":<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "...I have reached my present standpoint by a long series of experiences 

          under such varied and peculiar conditions as to render unbelief impossible. 

          As Dr. W. B. Carpenter well remarked many years ago, people can only 

          believe new and extraordinary facts if there is a place for them in 

          their existing "fabric of thought." The majority of people to-day have 

          been brought up in the belief that miracles, ghosts, and the whole series 

          of strange phenomena here described cannot exist; that they are contrary 

          to the laws of nature; that they are superstitions of a bygone age; 

          and that therefore they are necessarily either impostures or delusions. 

          There is no place in the fabric of their thought into which such facts 

          can be fitted. When I first began this inquiry it was the same with 

          myself. The facts did not fit into my then existing fabric of thought. 

          All my preconceptions, all my knowledge, all my belief in the supremacy 

          of science and of natural law were against the possibility of such phenomena..."<SUP><a href="#134">134</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it is apparent 

        that Wallace came to believe that creative diversification was in the 

        broadest sense purposeful (<i>i.e.</i>, was part of a universal process 

        evolving enlightened spirituality), there is nothing to suggest that he 

        thought the alleged "spirit realm" itself was constituted in a fashion 

        necessitating fundamentally exceptional treatment in a conceptual/analytical 

        sense:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "...Now, modern Spiritualism rests solely on the observation and comparison 

          of acts in a domain of nature which has been hitherto little explored, 

          and it is a contradiction in terms to say that such an investigation 

          is opposed to science. Equally absurd is the allegation that some of 

          the phenomena of Spiritualism "contradict the laws of nature," since 

          there is no law of nature yet known to us but may be apparently contravened 

          by the action of more recondite laws or forces. Spiritualists observe 

          facts and record experiments, and then construct hypotheses which will 

          best explain and co-ordinate the facts, and in so doing they are pursuing 

          a truly scientific course."<SUP><a href="#135">135</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within this cosmology, 

        natural science as we usually conceive it was effectively restricted to 

        the study of special origins; that is, to those classes of causes that 

        could be attached to specific immediate results, whether these led to 

        permanent structural divergences or reversible ecological relationships.<SUP><a href="#136">136</a></SUP> 

        When one began to look beyond the fact of change (and toward the overall 

        context of its "accumulations"), however, Wallace preferred to view the 

        forms of interaction (notably, gravity, natural selection, and spiritualization) 

        propelling the whole process as operating in conjunction with one another. 

        Wallace would probably have agreed that gravity could not explain why 

        dogs have eyes and choose to walk uphill some of the time for the same 

        general reasons that natural selection could not provide a reason for 

        the creation of a great symphony or the acts of a martyr. At the same 

        time, he believed there was nothing in his approach that either contradicted 

        or discouraged working within a conventional materialistic framework (which, 

        in its own fashion, filled in the pieces one at a time by concentrating 

        on the elucidation of increasingly subtle efficient causes).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems little 

          reason to complain that Wallace's natural science studies (<i>e.g.</i>, 

          in biogeography, glaciology, and the individual applications of natural 

          selection) "suffered" after 1865 from any apparent spiritualism-related 

          concepts. Nor should they have. When Wallace felt that the subject of 

          interest could be analyzed adequately on the basis of efficient causes 

          (<i>i.e.</i>, the framework of interaction within which its origin was 

          implicit), there was no need to bring questions regarding indeterminate 

          functions into the discussion. For man, cosmological subjects (<i>i.e.</i>, 

          "beginnings" and "ends," in both a spatial and temporal sense), and 

          all social issues, however, the extenuating circumstances of the "more 

          recondite forces" operating became directly relevant. Mankind, for example, 

          was increasingly to become the architect of its own further evolutionary 

          diversification (<i>i.e.</i>, as a spiritual being):<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "...we Spiritualists must feel ourselves bound to work strenuously for 

          such improved social conditions as may render it possible for all to 

          live a full and happy life, for all to develop and utilise the various 

          faculties they possess, and thus be prepared to enter at once on the 

          progressive higher life of the spirit-world. We know that a life of 

          continuous and grinding bodily labour, in order to obtain a bare existence; 

          a life almost necessarily devoid of beauty, of refinement, of communion 

          with Nature; a life without adequate relaxation, and with no opportunity 

          for the higher culture; a life full of temptation and with no cheering 

          hope of a happy and peaceful old age, is as bad for the welfare of the 

          soul as it is for that of the body..."<SUP><a href="#137">137</a></SUP></font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace viewed social 

        cooperation as the road to the development of higher awareness in the 

        individual. Society was thus pictured as an evolving collective will that 

        was slowly but surely transcending the constraints imposed by environment 

        and restrictive historical customs. In the early stages of this process 

        scattered civilizations had arisen, their eventual declines being more 

        attributable to a lack of collective social wisdom in not recognizing 

        the need for establishing non-materialistic goals than to any blatant 

        physical, moral, or intellectual inferiorities on the part of their citizens 

        individually.<SUP><a href="#138">138</a></SUP> Wallace reasoned that evolution of the "collective 

        will" would accelerate only once the physical necessities of life had 

        been made equally available to all, allowing people the leisure time to 

        pursue more varied and consciousness-expanding interests. Not surprisingly, 

        therefore, most of his social criticism was aimed at what he felt were 

        the institutions standing in the way of "equality of opportunity" for 

        the general populace.<SUP><a href="#139">139</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace despised the 

          many crude attempts to apply Darwinism to social analysis by analogy; 

          in his view, an over-emphasis on individualistic forms of competition 

          within society led, among other things, to wars, a discriminatory distribution 

          of wealth, and addiction to a consumptive materialism that was both 

          individually and collectively counter-evolutionary.<SUP><a href="#140">140</a></SUP> While 

          spiritualist philosophy helped him recognize a transitory function in 

          existing imperfections (these forced a process of moral advance through 

          "character-building": mankind's own route of changing without being 

          "aware of it"), human progress in general was measured through their 

          absolute rate of elimination (at least, to the extent that society came 

          to recognize they <i>should</i> be eliminated!). Such progress could 

          not be contextualized within simplistic material "one cause-one effect" 

          frameworks: the more "human" the problem, the more its just solution 

          lay in terms of evolutionarily-consistent goals, as opposed to reactions 

          arising from the consumptive inertia of tradition or habit.<SUP><a href="#141">141</a></SUP><br>

        <p><b><a name="path7"></a><font color="#993366">A Change of Mind?</font></b>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preceding discussion 

          shows how a different reading of what Wallace wrote up through 1858 

          leads us to anticipate certain continuities in his positions after 1858. 

          Ample references are given to show that after that date his position 

          on most subjects did, in fact, remain consistent with his earlier stated 

          opinions. (To trace this out in any further detail, though fully possible, 

          would require much more space than can be allowed at present.) Significantly, 

          it can hardly be viewed as inconsistent with his earlier-stated views--indeed, 

          the earliest-stated ones of which we have a record--that he became a 

          spiritualist. The entire progression of his views on the special problem 

          of biological evolution, moreover, can be attributed to his changing 

          position on the concept of biological utility.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These connections, 

          I submit, provide a more than adequate prior argument as to why Wallace's 

          views on natural selection should not have reversed at any time after 

          1858. It has long been maintained that they did, however, and we must 

          now therefore briefly notice three related subjects: (1) whether Wallace 

          himself later admitted to a "change of mind"; (2) whether, in fact, 

          Wallace ever actually stated a position that demanded such a change 

          later; and (3) whether certain things he did write that have been pointed 

          to as signifying a change might be more reasonably explained in other 

          ways.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first subject can 

          be disposed of rather quickly. As far as I am aware (and I have now 

          read nearly everything Wallace wrote for publication), Wallace never 

          specifically admitted to a "change of mind" in print--for example, to 

          the effect that "Before 1865 and my introduction to spiritualism, I 

          believed natural selection accounted for the development of all human 

          attributes." Neither, so far as I am aware, has anyone ever claimed 

          he did write anything to this effect.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second subject 

          is a rather more difficult one to approach. As explained earlier, Wallace's 

          lack of specific mention of man in 'On the tendency...' is at the least 

          just as easy to contextualize as the initiation of a "special case" 

          argument as it is evidence he considered man's situation as being the 

          same as that of animals. Additional considerations, moreover, appear 

          to make the first interpretation the more probably correct one.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schwartz,<SUP><a href="#142">142</a></SUP> 

          Kottler,<SUP><a href="#143">143</a></SUP> and others have stated as if it were unequivocal 

          fact that before 1864 Wallace felt natural selection accounted for man's 

          evolution in the same fashion it did other living things. The detailed 

          researches of Beddall, McKinney, Brooks, and others referred to earlier 

          (notes 1-4) have sustained this belief with their establishment that 

          at the time of his recognition of the principle Wallace was giving as 

          much consideration to the problem of human development as he was animal 

          origins. But again, this simple fact of correlation does not substantiate 

          the conclusion that he believed the two problems could be disposed of 

          through a model of proximate causes alone. As shown earlier there is 

          reason to think he did not so believe. Further reason exists as well.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Browne has written: "At the head of his 1858 paper 

          on organic change he stated that wild varieties had a 'tendency to depart 

          indefinitely from the original type' and proceeded to set out his reasons 

          for believing this to be the case. The theory of evolution and the concept 

          of Malthusian selection of varieties were introduced as explanations--as 

          the efficient cause--of this biological tendency."<SUP><a href="#144">144</a></SUP> But 

          in truth, the situation was just the opposite--at least with respect 

          to evolution "as the efficient cause." Wallace in reality thought he 

          had identified an "efficient cause" of evolution, was describing how 

          this operated, and how it accounted for certain characteristics of adaptation 

          and change in organisms. Nowhere in the essay does he in any way infer 

          that this "biological tendency" is synonymous with evolution. In fact, 

          no mention whatsoever is made of the 1855 paper 'On the law...' or its 

          undeniably evolutionary orientation. Considering the fact that a number 

          of the studies he published between 1855 and 1858<SUP><a href="#145">145</a></SUP> dwell 

          heavily on points made in that work, this is to say the least rather 

          peculiar--that is, if the one is to be viewed as a conceptual extension 

          of the thinking set out in the other. Moreover, and just as strangely, 

          no reference is made in 'On the tendency...' to any of these other studies 

          either. And, though we know that Wallace did have man's evolutionary 

          development very much on his mind just prior to writing 'On the tendency...,' 

          neither is there any reference, in one fashion or another, to the evolution 

          of man in the paper. One should conclude from these facts that at the 

          time of writing 'On the tendency...' Wallace strongly distinguished 

          between his newly discovered principle and evolution <i>per se</i>. 

          This impression is further strengthened by the fact that he certainly 

          had connected man to the arguments of 'On the law...,' as is plainly 

          evident from commentary presented in 'On the habits of the orang-utan...,' 

          his letters to Bates,<SUP><a href="#146">146</a></SUP> and his 'Species notebook.'<SUP><a href="#147">147</a></SUP> 

          Nor should one ignore the otherwise puzzling fact that all of his evolution-oriented 

          writings between early 1858 and late 1863, including one long paper 

          on man,<SUP><a href="#148">148</a></SUP> reflect extensions of the line of thought present 

          in 'On the law...' rather than that evident in 'On the tendency...'. 

          In short, the obvious sometimes goes unappreciated: the species divergence 

          discussion in 'On the tendency...' was never intended for application 

          to man--that is, to the extent of explaining his uniquely human "higher 

          nature."

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On reading <i>On 

          the Origin of Species</i> while still in 

          the East, and after further communications with Darwin, Wallace certainly 

          must have surmised that Darwin intended natural selection to account 

          equally for the development of man's higher faculties and the development 

          of his purely biological structure. With this application of the theory 

          he surely disagreed, but until he had clarified his own thoughts on 

          the matter it would be pointless to object. On this view, it is therefore 

          hardly surprising that Wallace published not a single word between 1858 

          and 1864 that connected the Darwinian model of natural selection to 

          man,<SUP><a href="#149">149</a></SUP> much less anything suggesting that he felt natural 

          selection accounted for the evolution of man's higher faculties.<SUP><a href="#150">150</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of any 

          direct positive evidence, we are reduced to examining some Wallace writings 

          that might secondarily be interpreted as supporting the "change of mind" 

          hypothesis. A thorough review of this subject is not possible here, 

          but two especially well-known passages, at least, should be looked at 

          briefly.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kottler has stated 

          that "Wallace wrote to Darwin in 1869 that his new view was solely the 

          result of his new belief in spiritualism."<SUP><a href="#151">151</a></SUP> The source 

          of this impression is a letter from Wallace to Darwin dated April 18, 

          1869.<SUP><a href="#152">152</a></SUP> In this letter Wallace says:<blockquote><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          "I can quite comprehend your feelings with regard to my "unscientific" 

          opinions as to Man, because a few years back I should myself have looked 

          at them as equally wild and uncalled for... My opinions on the subject 

          have been modified solely by the consideration of a series of remarkable 

          phenomena, physical and mental, which I have now had every opportunity 

          of fully testing, and which demonstrate the existence of forces and 

          influences not yet recognised by science."</font></blockquote>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I submit, Wallace 

        says no more than what he says: that the now "fully tested" phenomena 

        have led him to a theory which "a few years back" he would have considered 

        "wild and uncalled for" (<i>i.e.</i>, in the absence of relatable evidence). 

        In presenting this as evidence of a change of mind, Kottler has assumed 

        that prior to 1864 Wallace believed that natural selection could be applied 

        to man's evolution in exactly the same fashion it could to other living 

        things. There is no reason to doubt that Wallace's opinions were, as he 

        put it, "modified" (rather than "reversed") from an earlier position, 

        but the nature of that earlier position must be established, not assumed 

        as a function of a correlation in time.<SUP><a href="#153">153</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main evidence that 

          has been used to support the "change of mind" hypothesis, however, consists 

          of certain passages in 'The origin of human races...' and the particular 

          additions and changes in wording that were made for the 1870 version 

          of that paper entitled 'The development of human races under the law 

          of natural selection.'<SUP><a href="#154">154</a></SUP> When Wallace included the 1864 

          paper in his <i>Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection</i>, 

          he made many revisions. Most were relatively minor and are easily accounted 

          for; some, however, are suggestive of a change in position. In the Preface 

          to <i>Contributions...</i> he states: "I had intended to have considerably 

          extended this essay, but on attempting it I found that I should probably 

          weaken the effect without adding much to the argument. I have therefore 

          preferred to leave it as it was first written, with the exception of 

          a few ill-considered passages which never fully expressed my meaning."<SUP><a href="#155">155</a></SUP> 

          Note Wallace's deliberate use of the word "extended"--not "reversed" 

          or "changed"--and the fact that he is apparently more worried about 

          "weakening" the effect than "not adding" to it. The inference is that 

          he considered the existing argument sound, and was reluctant to do anything 

          that would draw attention away from it. He finally decided to end the 

          book with the entirely new essay 'The limits of natural selection...'. 

          Why, if his opinion had "changed": (1) would he have decided to leave 

          the essay more or less as it was; or (2) chosen to include it in <i>Contributions...</i> 

          at all? Obviously, Wallace himself did not feel his position had changed.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also the matter 

          here of what his "meaning" was, and which passages were "ill-conceived." 

          In 1864 the individualist thinking of Spencer was consuming his attention;<SUP><a href="#156">156</a></SUP> 

          on this basis he appears to have extended Darwinian natural selection 

          as far as he felt he could to account for the manner of human evolution. 

          But this discussion pointedly avoided any explanation of the reasons 

          behind the <i>emergence</i> of intellect or moral behavior. That their 

          presence <i>influenced</i> man in ways that would be subjected to the 

          workings of natural selection he did not doubt (nor did he in 1870<SUP><a href="#157">157</a></SUP>). 

          Again, Wallace had for many years recognized that man exhibited many 

          "above nature" qualities; 'The origin of human races...' was his attempt 

          to describe how these qualities, once in existence, could be expected 

          to aid or retard natural selection. The manner of their own origin and 

          the connection of this to evolution in general, however, he still had 

          no handle on and deliberately avoided.<SUP><a href="#158">158</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1864 essay on 

          man, Wallace writes "But while these [physical] changes had been going 

          on, his mental development had correspondingly advanced, and had now 

          reached that condition in which it began powerfully to influence his 

          whole existence, and would, therefore, become subject to the irresistible 

          action of 'natural selection.'"<SUP><a href="#159">159</a></SUP> In the 1870 version this 

          passage was changed to "But while...mental development had, from some 

          unknown cause, greatly advanced, and had now... 'natural selection.'"<SUP><a href="#160">160</a></SUP> 

          The subtle but important substitution for "correspondingly" indicates 

          that Wallace had settled on a model for the origin of man's higher faculities. 

          The emergence of intellect and morality-based decision-making signalled 

          the beginning of humankind's participation in the causal domain of a 

          higher level of existence. This emergence was implicit in the evolutionary 

          scheme, much as life had been when physical conditions had reached a 

          satisfactory degree of complexity and stability. The immediate impact 

          of intellect was to produce certain kinds of "above nature" behavior, 

          but eventually most such behaviors generated kinds of negative feedback 

          that would ultimately cause society to reject them (failure of that 

          entire society being the consequence if it did not). Materialism was 

          one such behavior. Though counterproductive as an all-consuming individual 

          or societal goal, it had the vital effect of producing a gradual societal 

          increase of knowledge, and through the latter a greater understanding 

          of others leading to an elevation of tolerance and the moral sense.<SUP><a href="#161">161</a></SUP> 

          Eventually, man's moral capacity would "catch up" with his intellectual 

          excesses, at which point natural selection could again act in a fully 

          positive fashion (rejecting, for example, those self-serving, "others-neglecting" 

          materialistic tendencies that remained).<SUP><a href="#162">162</a></SUP><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Wallace used the 

          wording "modification" of position rather than "change" of position 

          in his April 18, 1869 letter to Darwin, therefore, he was stating the 

          situation as a matter of record. He had been unable to associate the 

          meaning of the origin of man's intellectual and moral capacities with 

          a general evolutionary model since he had taken up the question in the 

          1840s; the concepts stated in 1855's 'On the law...,' 1858's 'On the 

          tendency...,' and 1864's 'The origin of human races...' show that his 

          formulation of natural selection had not solved--or even addressed--this 

          problem. The 1864 version of the essay on man was "ill-conceived" to 

          the extent that it still did not address the problem of hierarchical 

          causation; <i>i.e.</i>, like 'On the law...,' it dwelled on results 

          whose efficient causes could be directly inferred, but whose final causes 

          could not. Thus, Wallace's "modification of position": to one in which 

          both final and efficient causes for man's higher faculties were specified.<SUP><a href="#163">163</a></SUP><br>

          &nbsp;

        <p><b><a name="path8"></a><font color="#993366">Conclusion</font></b>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of Wallace's work has been seriously hindered by a general unwillingness to view 

          it on its own terms. Has it ever been demonstrated, for example, that 

          spiritualism (or, more realistically, some other understanding invoking 

          a general form of psychic causality) is incompatible with a conventionally 

          materialistic understanding of evolution? Is Wallaceian natural selection 

          really as naive and undevelopable as writers such as Gould<SUP><a href="#164">164</a></SUP> 

          would have us believe, or has its updating in more modern terms merely 

          been delayed by a chronic reluctance of evolutionary biologists to think 

          in other than "process yields structure yields process" terms?<SUP><a href="#165">165</a></SUP> 

          In short, are Wallace's ideas really a threat to Darwinian materialism, 

          or might they be after all, as he claimed in his book <i>Darwinism</i>, 

          its logical conclusion?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That many of Wallace's 

          ideas were presented inchoate, with too much emphasis on argument and 

          too little on formal proofs, and at times anthropomorphically, is not 

          disputed here. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the cosmology 

          he worked out is fundamentally unsound--logically, or descriptively.<p><br>

          beginning of Wallace's interest to the year 1865, stating: "...from 

          1862 to 1865 there is no evidence of any interest by Wallace in spiritualism," 

          but Wallace himself specifically pointed to the year 1862 on at least 

          one occasion: <i>Light</i> (1907) 27, pp. 208-9 (as part of his testimony 

          in the 1907 fraud trial of medium J.N. Maskelyne); he also vaguely refers 

          to 1862 in a late interview: <i>Outlook</i> (1913) 105, pp. 618-622, 

          on p. 621. In <i>My Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (11), ii. 276, moreover, 

          he notes that he was aware of spiritualist writings even while travelling 

          in the East. On the other hand, on p. 132 of 'Notes of personal evidence' 

          in <i>Miracles...</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (8), he cites 1865; further, in 

          his November 1876 testimony in the Henry Slade fraud trial, he states 

          "I have been investigating this subject for eleven years" (<i>The Spiritualist</i> 

          (1876) 9, pp. 161, 164, on p. 161). Probably his investigations did 

          begin in 1862, but reached a consuming level only by 1865, at which 

          point his natural history collections would have been demanding less 

          of his time (as Malinchak, <i>op.cit.</i> (1) points out; I have determined 

          that between May 1862 and December 1864 Wallace published seventeen

          &amp; 785-807, written at the request of editor John Morley after the 

          leadership of the journal <i>The Spiritualist</i> appealed to him to 

          invite Wallace to discuss the subject, this work was apparently written 

          at Wallace's own initiation. It first appeared in print in installments 

          in the weekly secularist publication <i>The English Leader</i> in August 

          and September 1866 (2, pp. 59-60, 75-6, 91-3, 107-8, 123-5, 139-40,

          see Malinchak, <i>op.cit.</i> (1), pp. 80-2. Wallace's writings on spiritualism--including 

          'The scientific aspect of the supernatural'--do, in fact, display the 

          same commanding knowledge of the related literature evident in his treatments 

          of other subjects.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="21"></a>21. "The spiritualist, though he does not claim infallibility, 

          believes he is dealing with facts; he insists that his faith is constructed 

          to conform to the facts, as contrasted with a change of facts to conform 

          to faith." --J.P. Williams, 'Spiritualist groups,' <i>Encyclopaedia 

          Britannica, Macropaedia</i> 17 vols. (Fifteenth ed., Chicago, 1975), 

          17, pp. 511-3, on p. 513.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="22"></a>22. <i>Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary</i> 

          (Springfield, MA, 1966), p. 916, defines "theosophy" in the more specific 

          sense as "the beliefs of a modern movement originating in the United 

          States in 1875 and following chiefly Buddhist and Brahmanic theories 

          especially of pantheistic evolution and reincarnation."<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="23"></a>23. Wallace and other spiritualists argued that the 

          evidence for at least some of the "miracles" that have allegedly occurred 

          throughout human history is quite satisfactory, but that such events 

          represent products of continuing interaction with "spirit beings" rather 

          than otherwise wholly inexplicable first causes. Miracles were thus 

          assigned natural causes--if one made a leap of faith and accepted that 

          casual continuity in this instance was maintained by yet poorly understood, 

          but nonetheless generalizable, influences.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="24"></a>24. Most spiritualists undoubtedly adopted the belief 

          on faith (<i>i.e.</i>, that observable "spirit manifestations" indicated 

          that the "spirit realm" actually existed) and on the strength of its 

          moral teachings. The more personal experiences some claimed to have 

          had (involving, for example, Swedenborgian out-of-body "projection") 

          did not seem to lend themselves to scientific investigation.<br>

          suffering exists. He discusses his early fascination with the problem 

          in <i>My Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (11), i. 87-9. See his 'Two Darwinian

          1910 he was still commenting on related matters: see 'Is nature cruel?,' 

          Chapter 19 of <i>The World of Life</i> (London, 1910). Wallace considered 

          it one of spiritualism's strongest philosophical points that it offered 

          a logical response to this question.<br>

          of the Malay Archipelago,' read to the Royal Geographical Society on 

          8 June 1863 (<i>J. Roy. Geogr. Soc. Lond.</i> (1863) 33, pp. 217-234), 

          with the following words: "If...[the European powers do not undertake 

          comprehensive natural history collecting programs in the areas they 

          are colonizing]...future ages will certainly look back upon us as a 

          people so immersed in the pursuit of wealth as to be blind to higher 

          considerations. They will charge us with having culpably allowed the 

          destruction of some of these records of Creation which we had it in 

          our power to preserve; and while professing to regard every living thing 

          as the direct handiwork and best evidence of a Creator, yet, with a 

          strange inconsistency, seeing many of them perish irrecoverably from 

          the face of the earth, uncared for and unknown." These sentiments are 

          very close to those expressed in this section of 'Advantages...'. H.L. 

          McKinney ('Alfred Russel Wallace,'<i> D.S.B.</i>, 14, p. 137) interprets 

          this passage as possibly signifying a pre-1864 religious conversion 

          on Wallace's part, but I feel it is probably better to regard it as 

          a simple re-statement of a philosophical position he had adopted much 

          earlier.<br>

          paper was first presented publicly in September 1863 at the annual meeting 

          of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Here Wallace 

          extends his views on how individuals "progress" (<i>i.e.</i>, as the 

          function of a many-directioned learning process) to a parallel prescription 

          for success at the societal level. This theme is present in many other 

          of his writings, <i>e.g.</i>: 'The origin of civilization,' <i>Spectator</i> 

          (1869) 42, pp. 1072-3; 'Difficulties of development as applied to man,'

          there is a degree of environmental control over the nature of organic 

          change, but this understanding does not demand outright determinism.

          human society, and thus has a broad foundation in the laws of nature."<br>

          biologist to George Rolleston reproduced in <i>My Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (11), ii. 94-5. Wallace specifically re-affirmed his acceptance of the 

          "no merit to belief" tenet as late as 1908 in a speech to the Linnean 

          Society: see 'The origin of the theory of natural selection,'<i> Popular

          (1872b, <i>op.cit.</i> (16)) and <i>The Daily News</i>, London (11 December

          and again, just as pointedly, in a note added to the version of 'On 

          the tendency...' included in <i>Natural Selection and Tropical Nature</i> 

          (London, 1891); in Wallace 1903, <i>op.cit.</i> (25); and in <i>My Life</i>, 

          <i>op.cit.</i> (11), i. 363, in 1905. Considering the spectacular success 

          of the paper, it is odd that Wallace continued to draw attention to

          forces and laws have I spoken of the will or power of 'one Supreme Intelligence'."<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="72"></a>72. Smith, <i>op.cit.</i> (1), p. 190, has also referred 

          to the fundamentally hierarchical nature of Wallace's cosmology.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="73"></a>73. "Push-pull," because a coupling of positive and 

          negative feedback relations to produce irreversible forms of change 

          is involved. See M. Maruyama's important paper 'The second cybernetics: 

          deviation-amplifying mutual causal processes,' <i>Am. Scient.</i> (1963) 

          51, pp. 164-79.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="74"></a>74. Wallace probably believed that this domain existed 

          prior to earth's/mankind's involvement with it, a position inherently 

          accepting that there might have been "past evolutions."<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="75"></a>75. As is well know, Darwin himself believed that 

          agencies such as the transmission of acquired characters were also helping 

          evolution along.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="76"></a>76. Wallace discusses Darwin's position on continuity 

          and the origin of man's higher faculties on p. 463 of his <i>Darwinism</i> 

          (London, 1889).<br>

          philosophy for evolutionary biology,' <i>Syst. Zool.</i> (1988) 37, 

          pp. 142-55.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="78"></a>78. In a letter sent to Darwin on 2 July 1866 (Marchant, 

          <i>op.cit.</i> (4), pp. 140-3, on p. 142), Wallace complained that Darwin 

          had been using the term "natural selection" to mean two things: "survival 

          of the fittest," and the changes produced through survival of the fittest. 

          Wallace himself associated natural selection with only the first of 

          these two meanings. See Wallace's 'The origin of species and genera,' 

          <i>Nineteenth Century</i> (1880) 7, pp. 93-106, especially pp. 93-6, 

          for a discussion of some of his reasons for contrasting the two concepts. 

          This understanding is consistent with Wallace's continuing observation 

          that the "causes" <i>per se</i> of variation were unknown.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="79"></a>79. Wallace actually never really abandoned the idea 

          that adaptation and organic change were but correlatively associated. 

          He uses the imagery that favorable variations are "accumulated" in at 

          least seven places that immediately come to mind: 'Natural selection--Mr. 

          Wallace's reply to Mr. Bennett,' <i>Nature</i> (1870) 3, pp. 49-50, 

          on p. 50; 'Remarks on the habits, distribution, and affinities of the 

          genus Pitta,' <i>Ibis</i> (1864a) 6, pp. 100-14, on p. 110; 'The origin 

          of human races and the antiquity of man deduced from the theory of "natural 

          selection",' <i>J. Anthro. Soc. Lond.</i> (1864b) 2, pp. clviii-clxxxvii, 

          on p. clxiv; 'Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's paper on the bee's cell,' 

          <i>Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.</i> (1863) ii. 12, pp. 303-9, on pp. 304 &amp; 

          308; 'Sir Charles Lyell on geological climates and the origin of species,' 

          <i>Quart. Rev.</i> (1869) 126, pp. 359-94, on p. 384; and Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (78), on p. 103. "Accumulation" implies haphazard addition--allowably, 

          however, under the influence of ordered forces, as when the planets 

          came into being as the result of a process of "particle accumulation" 

          operating under the law of gravity. In his later years, Wallace discarded 

          the term "accumulated" in favor of "preserved," perhaps a concession 

          to Darwinian thinking (or at the least, to tree-thinking).<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="80"></a>80. Note Wallace's attempt at "logical demonstration" 

          of the "law" of natural selection on p. 302 of <i>Contributions...</i>, 

          <i>op.cit.</i> (69).<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="81"></a>81. Wallace's portrayal of natural selection seems 

          to indicate he viewed it as the key operator in a negative feedback 

          loop--one in which the ecological disequilibrium created by the combination 

          of organic growth and limited space is resolved by removal of the less 

          fit. Wallace felt that the positive feedback processes setting up the 

          continuing reaction were poorly understood, and was unwilling to ignore 

          the possibility that they themselves changed with time in such a manner 

          as to have a powerful cumulative effect on structural change. See Smith, 

          <i>op.cit.</i> (50), for related discussion.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="82"></a>82. Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (1856)
          ii. 18, pp. 26-32, 

          on pp. 30-1.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="83"></a>83. Wallace may merely be trying to dramatize a point 

          here in his reference to a "Supreme Creator," but the implication, allegorical 

          or not, is that there are causes further removed from the immediate 

          results of nature than those that can be expressed in proximate terms 

          alone. In a note at this point in the essay he refers approvingly to 

          "the talented author of the <i>Plurality of Worlds</i> [William Whewell]," 

          quoting the following passage from that work: "In the structure of animals, 

          especially that large class best known to us, vertebrate animals, there 

          is a general plan, which, so far as we can see, goes beyond the circuit 

          of the special adaptation of each animal to its mode of living; and 

          is a rule of creative action, in addition to the rule that the parts 

          shall be subservient to an intelligible purpose of animal life. We have 

          noticed several phenomena in the animal kingdom, where parts and features 

          appear rudimentary and inert, discharging no office in their oeconomy, 

          and speaking to us not of purpose, but of law." Wallace integrated these 

          very concepts into several of his later writings; see 'Creation by law,' 

          <i>Q. J. Science</i> (1867) 4, pp. 471-488; and 'Darwinism and design,' 

          <i>Spectator</i> (1874) 47, pp. 535-6; for two particularly good illustrations. 

          Further, all of Wallace's arguments concerning the function of beauty 

          in nature emanate from such thinking; see, for example: Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (82), on pp. 30-1; 'A theory of birds' nests,'<i> J. Travel &amp; Nat. 

          Hist.</i> (1868), 1, pp. 73-89; Wallace 1867, <i>op.cit.</i> (83), on 

          pp. 471, 473, 480-2; 'The colours of animals and sexual selection,' 

          Essay V of <i>Tropical Nature and Other Essays</i> (London, 1878), pp.

          As late as 1905, Wallace was still speaking approvingly of <i>The Plurality 

          of Worlds</i>: see Wallace 1905, <i>op.cit.</i> (11), ii. 288; and <i>Man's

          he comments "The principle of 'utility,' which is one of [natural selection's] 

          chief foundation stones, I have always advocated unreservedly..." He 

          does not specifically say (either here or in any other writings, as 

          far as I am aware), however, what his exact thoughts on the subject 

          of utility were before the principle of natural selection occurred to 

          him.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="90"></a>90. Notably, in 'On the law which has regulated the 

          introduction of new species,' <i>Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.</i> (1855) ii. 

          16, pp. 184-196, on pp. 191, 195; Wallace, 1856, <i>op.cit.</i> (46), 

          pp. 196, 204; Wallace 1857, <i>op.cit.</i> (36), p. 204; and <i>A Narrative 

          of Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro</i> (London, 1889), pp. 58-9.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="91"></a>91. Wallace's views on rudimentary organs, perhaps 

          originating with his reading of Whewell, seem to have paralleled his 

          thoughts on a variety of other subjects, though the exact connections 

          remain unclear. For example, he apparently held the view that the history 

          of such structures in some manner resembles that of residual island 

          populations, an impression that would be strengthened by his later (1857) 

          visit to the Aru Islands (see Brooks, <i>op.cit.</i> (3), p. 172). Wallace 

          would later come to regard man's entire biological existence as "rudimentary" 

          with respect to his spiritualization, as discussed in Part II of 'A 

          defence of modern spiritualism' ('Moral teachings of spiritualism'),

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="94"></a>94. As in his discussion of what constitute useful 

          characters for classification in Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> (46); the "differs 

          in degree versus differs in nature" argument in 'Note on the theory 

          of permanent varieties,' <i>Zoologist</i> (1858) 16, pp. 5887-8; and 

          the anti-Lyellian geological/geographical arguments of Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (92). Even after the emergence of natural selection, Wallace continued 

          to feel that some peculiarities of adaptation were most likely relatable 

          to subtle environmental dictates. This position is best summed up in 

          the first half of his 1876 Presidential Address to the Biological Section 

          of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (see<i> Tropical 

          Nature and Other Essays</i> (London, 1878), Essay VII, 'By-paths in 

          the domain of biology,' pp. 249-303). When he later saw how Fritz M&uuml;ller's 

          discoveries regarding mimicry explained many of these or analogous phenomena, 

          however, he practically gave up on environmental determinism altogether 

          (see 'Dr. Fritz M&uuml;ller on some difficult cases of mimicry,' <i>Nature</i> 

          (1882) 26, pp. 86-7; and 'Difficult cases of mimicry,'<i> Nature</i> 

          (1883) 27, pp. 481-2).<br>

          (ed. H.L. McKinney, New York, 1972), p. xii.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="96"></a>96. Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> (95), p. xii. On pp. 

          58-9 of the same edition Wallace goes on: "It must strike every one, 

          that the numbers of birds and insects of different groups, having scarcely 

          any resemblance to each other, which yet feed on the same food and inhabit 

          the same localities, cannot have been so differently constructed and 

          adorned for that purpose alone. Thus the goat-suckers, the swallows, 

          the tyrant fly-catchers, and the jacamars, all use the same kind of 

          food, and procure it in the same manner: they all capture insects on 

          the wind, yet how entirely different is the structure and the whole 

          appearance of these birds!... What birds can have their bills more peculiarly 

          formed than the ibis, the spoonbill, and the heron? Yet they may be 

          seen side by side, picking up the same food from the shallow water on 

          the beach; and on opening their stomachs, we find the same little crustacea 

          and shell-fish in them all. Then among the fruit-eating birds, there 

          are pigeons, parrots, toucans, and chatterers,--families as distinct 

          and widely separated as possible,--which yet may be often seen feeding 

          all together on the same tree... It has been assumed by some writers 

          on Natural History, that every wild fruit is the food of some bird or 

          animal, and that the varied forms and structure of their mouths may 

          be necessitated by the peculiar character of the fruits they are to 

          fee on; but there is more of imagination than fact in this statement: 

          the number of wild fruits furnishing food for birds is very limited, 

          and the birds of the most varied structure and of every size will be 

          found visiting the same tree." This suggestive discussion can only be 

          interpreted as indicating Wallace's disapproval of assuming one-to-one 

          cause and effect between particular environmental influences and particular 

          adaptations, and between particular adaptations and particular evolutionary 

          lineages.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="98"></a>98. Note Wallace's direct statement to this effect 

          in <i>My Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (11), i. 355. Browne, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (4), p. 172, elaborates on this matter.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="99"></a>99. In <i>My Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (11), i. 360, 

          Wallace writes: "My paper written at Sarawak [<i>i.e.</i>, 'On the law...,' 

          <i>op.cit.</i> (90)] rendered it certain in my mind that the change 

          had taken place by natural succession and descent--one species becoming 

          changed either slowly or rapidly into another. But the exact process 

          of the change and the causes which led to it were absolutely unknown 

          and appeared almost unconceivable." This statement is easiest to understand 

          under the assumption that he still believed that adaptations <i>per 

          se</i> were more derivative than causal. On p. 359 he adds: "[In early 

          1858 the] solution flashed upon me, <i>and to a large extent marked 

          out a different line of work from that which I had up to this time anticipated</i>" 

          [my italics].<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="100"></a>100. Wallace never gave up the idea that biological 

          processes operated in a manner paralleling physical ones. Note: (1) 

          the very last sentence in 'On the law...,' <i>op.cit.</i> (90): "Granted 

          the law, and many of the most important facts in Nature could not have 

          been otherwise, but are almost as necessary deductions from it, as are 

          the elliptic orbits of the planets from the law of gravitation"; (2) 

          p. 62 of &nbsp;'On the tendency...,' <i>op.cit.</i> (38), on which appears: 

          "The action of this principle is exactly like that of the centrifugal 

          governor or the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities 

          almost before they become evident..."; (3) the first italicized sentence 

          in the series of quotations referred to note 32; and (4) the much later 

          written "To me it appears that, just as gravitation rules the whole 

          material universe, so natural selection rules, and has ruled, the whole 

          organic world..." (from Wallace 1908, <i>op.cit.</i> (36), p. 22). S.A. 

          Kleiner, in 'Darwin's and Wallace's revolutionary research programme,' 

          <i>Brit. J. Philos. Sci.</i> (1985) 36, pp. 367-92, has remarked on

          Wallace discusses his approach to this question in terms of what was, 

          for him, its most significant immediate component: how divergence into 

          "well-defined and constant species" takes place. See Browne, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (4), pp. 174-182, for one detailed analysis; also McKinney, <i>op.cit.</i>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="110"></a>110. In 'On the tendency...,' <i>op.cit.</i> (38), 

          p. 59, Wallace states "Here, then, we have progression and continued 

          divergence deduced from the general laws which regulate the existence 

          of animals in a state of nature...." On the same page he continues "Variations 

          in unimportant parts might also occur, having no perceptible effect 

          on the life-preserving powers; and the varieties so furnished might 

          run a course parallel with the parent species, either giving rise to 

          further variations or returning to the former type."<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="112"></a>112. In Marchant, <i>op.cit.</i> (4), p. 192, the 

          reproduction of an exchange of letters between Wallace and Darwin highlights 

          their difference in perspective. Darwin writes that his "deception" 

          as to the possible significance of single variation was brought about 

          by "simple illustrations, as when man selects." Wallace apparently was 

          already promoting the "antithesis" argument well before the concept 

          of natural selection occurred to him, judging from comments offered 

          by Darwin in a letter of 1 May 1857 responding to an earlier Wallace 

          communication, now lost (see Marchant, <i>op.cit.</i> (4), p. 108): 

          "I have acted already in accordance with your advice of keeping domestic 

          varieties, and those appearing in a state of nature, distinct, but I 

          have sometimes doubted the wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to 

          be backed by your opinion." Browne, <i>op.cit.</i> (4), pp. 176-7, discusses 

          this early Darwin-Wallace exchange.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="113"></a>113. In 1870, in the essay 'The limits of natural 

          selection as applied to man' (in Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> (69), pp. 332-371, 

          on p. 358) Wallace in part qualifies those characteristics that can 

          only be maintained through such an additional causal agency as being 

          ones that "transcend time and space." Immediately thereafter, he notes 

          parenthetically that "all of [these] were occasionally manifested at 

          such an early period of human history as to be far in advance of the 

          few practical applications which have since grown out of them." His 

          various treatments of mediumistic abilities (<i>e.g.</i>, as related 

          to witchcraft: see Wallace 1888, <i>op.cit.</i> (26), pp. 5-6, and an 

          interview printed in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> (1904) 34, pp. 73-9, 

          on p. 78-9) later followed both lines of thought. But he also applied 

          the first line of thinking, at least, to strictly animal-directed considerations 

          of utility (e.g., in Wallace 1891, <i>op.cit.</i> (34), pp. 338-9). 

          A striking example of how he applied the "additional causal agency" 

          concept to animal evolution is afforded by his remarkable conclusion, 

          developed in Chapter 9 of <i>The World of Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (30), 

          that the protective/mimetic coloration of many insects arises strictly 

          from selective effects imposed <i>on</i> them by animals of higher organization 

          than themselves.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="114"></a>114. For an example of how Wallace handled this aspect 

          of "one cause-one effect" thinking in the crucial 'The origin of human 

          races...' discussion in 1864, see pp. clxxxiii-clxxxiv of that work 

          (Wallace 1864b, <i>op.cit.</i> (79)). In this, he points out that some 

          correlations, at least, seem to exist between the varying physical nature 

          of man and the varying characteristics of the environment. He does not 

          argue, however, that all characteristics of man must be treated in this 

          fashion.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="118"></a>118. Some critics of Wallace's theory of natural 

          selection have argued that it explained too much (<i>i.e.</i>, is "panselectionist"); 

          others, that it explained too little (<i>i.e.</i>, irrationally put 

          human change outside the causal realm of the "survival of the fittest"). 

          Wallace accepted neither objection, arguing that natural selection was 

          no more nor less than the logically inescapable result of the acting 

          out of individually organized forces within a limited domain. Many times 

          he objected to "judgment being passed on a theory of nature by its power 

          to explain all mysteries": for some early examples of related commentary

          all he does) to Darwinian natural selection in Wallace 1860, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (119), published in April 1860. The subject did not come up again in 

          his writings--and obliquely at that--until his short discussion of mimicry 

          in 'List of birds collected in the island of Bouru,' <i>Proc. Zool. 

          Soc. Lond.</i> (1863), pp. 18-36, on pp. 26-8. In Wallace 1863, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (46), it is referred to in passing. Not until Wallace 1863, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (79), in October 1863--incredibly, over five and one half years after 

          the Ternate essay was written--did Wallace actually develop any natural 

          selection-related ideas in print. Evolutionary--but not natural selection-based--arguments 

          regarding man initially appear in his 'On the varieties of man in the 

          Malay Archipelago,' <i>op.cit.</i> (44), first presented publicly in

          and 1866.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="130"></a>130. Wallace's possible incidental contribution to 

          the evolution of pragmatism lies unassessed. Charles Peirce and William 

          James were in their impressionable twenties when the debates on evolution 

          and spiritualism were at their height, and both men later spoke very 

          appreciatively of Wallace's powers of logical argumentation. James became 

          a spiritualist, and shortly after his discovery of the famous medium 

          Mrs. Piper attended at least one seance with Wallace during the latter's 

          Lowell Institute lectures visit to Boston in 1886 ('Letter re Mrs. Ross,' 

          <i>Banner of Light</i> (1887) 60, p. 4d-e)--was the famous psychologist 

          actually responsible for Wallace coming to America, in a behind-the-scenes 

          kind of way? James's first known publication was an approving review 

          of 'The origin of human races...' (<i>North American Review</i> (1865) 

          101, pp. 261-3); other ties exist as well. Peirce apparently followed 

          Wallace's career rather closely, and his remarkable reviews of Wallace's 

          <i>Studies Scientific and Social</i> and <i>My Life</i> in <i>Nation</i> 

          ((1901) 72, pp. 36-7, and (1906) 111, pp. 160-1, respectively) suggest 

          he held a practically reverential respect for him. The many connections--and 

          differences--among the three men would be well worth looking at in detail.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="131"></a>131. In a note published in <i>Light</i> ('Harmony 

          of spiritualism and science,' (1885) 5, p. 352), Wallace offers the 

          following remark "[To the question] 'Does mortality give consciousness 

          to spirit, or does spirit give consciousness for a limited period to 

          mortality?' I would reply, 'Neither the one nor the other; but, mortality 

          is the means by which a permanent individuality is given to spirit'."<br>

          (1) also take this position.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="133"></a>133. Note his comments to this effect in a letter 

          to Thomas Huxley reproduced in Marchant, <i>op.cit.</i> (4), p. 418.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="136"></a>136. In a letter (Marchant, <i>op.cit.</i> (4), p. 

          341) referring to the then recent publication of his book <i>The World 

          of Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (30), in 1910, Wallace notes: "Hardly one 

          of my critics (I think absolutely not one) has noticed the distinction 

          I have tried to draw between Evolution on the one hand, and the fundamental 

          powers and properties of Life--growth, assimilation, reproduction, heredity, 

          etc.--on the other. In Evolution I recognize the action of Natural Selection 

          as universal and capable of explaining all the facts of the continuous 

          development of species from species, 'from amoeba to man.' But this...has 

          nothing whatever to do with the basic mysteries of life--growth, etc., 

          etc." In 1909, in another letter (Marchant, <i>op.cit.</i> (4), p. 337) 

          he writes: "Another point I am becoming more and more impressed with 

          is, <i>a teleology of fundamental laws and forces rendering development 

          of the infinity of life-forms possible (and certain) in place of the 

          old teleology applied to the production of each species</i>" [my italics]. 

          "Growth, etc., etc." are thus recognized as properties of nature "more 

          recondite" than natural selection <i>per se</i>, though the latter is 

          still viewed as a law of interaction supporting a progression of changing 

          life forms within the constraints of these properties.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="137"></a>137. Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> (31), p. 335.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="138"></a>138. One should not underestimate the weight of these 

          ideas on Wallace's thoughts in general. Given his very early-developed 

          Owenite ideals, it is just as likely--perhaps more likely--that his 

          acceptance of the degeneracy theory of social evolution shaped his biological 

          theorizations as <i>vice versa</i>. In this regard it should be noted 

          that he refers to the concept of social degeneracy as early as 1843 

          in a work (<i>op.cit.</i> (44)) that reached publication only in 1905 

          as part of <i>My Life</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> (11). The basic idea of the 

          degeneracy theory appears in many different aspects of his writing (see 

          note 113). He continued to defend the idea in print right to the end--see 

          Wallace 1913, <i>op.cit.</i> (36); Wallace 1908, <i>op.cit.</i> (36); 

          'Dr. A.R. Wallace &amp; Sir W.M. Ramsay's theory,' <i>Public Opinion</i> 

          (1907) 92, p. 336; and 'The spectre of poverty' (anonymous interview),

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="139"></a>139. Typical of Wallace's efforts in this direction 

          was his leadership of the land nationalization movement. For summaries 

          of his views on this subject, see his <i>Land Nationalisation</i> (London,

          of immediate- and final causes-based reasoning in a social theory context 

          related natural selection to the women's rights movement. On a number 

          of occasions (most notably 'Human selection,' <i>Fortnightly Review</i> 

          (1890) 48 (n.s.), pp. 325-37; Wallace 1892, <i>op.cit.</i> (44); Wallace 

          1908, <i>op.cit.</i> (36); and Wallace 1913, <i>op.cit.</i> (36)) he 

          opined that natural selection would only reassume an important role 

          in human evolution when women no longer needed to marry for reasons 

          of economic security, and could instead select mates purely on consideration 

          of their moral qualities.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="149"></a>149. Recall that during this period Wallace wrote 

          only one article in which natural selection itself is the focus of attention 

          in any respect: 'Remarks on the Rev. Haughton's paper on the bee's cell,' 

          <i>op.cit.</i> (79), in late 1863.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="150"></a>150. At the 19 January and 2 February 1864 meetings 

          of the Anthropological Society of London, however, he did contribute 

          some discussion referring to human evolution <i>per se</i>: see <i>J. 

          Anthr. Soc. Lond.</i> (1864) 2, pp. cx-cxi, cxxix-cxxx.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="151"></a>151. Kottler, <i>op.cit.</i> (5), p. 163.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="152"></a>152. Marchant, <i>op.cit.</i> (4), pp. 199-200.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="153"></a>153. Again, it should be emphasized that Wallace 

          himself directly denied this interpretation in print (see note 8).<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="154"></a>154. Wallace, <i>op.cit.</i> (69), pp. 303-31 (as 

          discussed by McKinney, <i>op.cit.</i> (33), Kottler, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (5), and Schwartz, <i>op.cit.</i> (5)).<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="155"></a>155. <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. viii.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="156"></a>156. <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 321.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="157"></a>157. <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 303-31.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="158"></a>158. Wallace's basic model of the physical evolution 

          of mankind--including the chronology of racial differentiation, the 

          emergence of the higher characters, and the cessation of physical bodily 

          change--remained utterly unchanged between 1864 and 1876. Compare Wallace 

          1864b, <i>op.cit.</i> (79), 'The development of human races under the 

          law of natural selection' in <i>Contributions...</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (154), and the portion of his 1876 British Association address dealing 

          with human evolution (<i>op.cit.</i> (44)).<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="159"></a>159. Wallace 1864b, <i>op.cit.</i> (79), p. clxvi.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="160"></a>160. Wallace 1870, <i>op.cit.</i> (69), pp. 320-1.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="161"></a>161. In a review of Benjamin Kidd's <i>Social 

          Evolution</i> (<i>Nature</i> (1894) 49, pp. 549-51), Wallace speaks 

          approvingly of Kidd's idea that religious belief produced an influence 

          fundamental to the development of civilization through its support of 

          centralization of power. Nevertheless, at no point in his life did Wallace 

          demonstrate more than a nominal respect for the idea of religious belief 

          as a goal of itself.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="162"></a>162. This last concept was integrally connected 

          to the "equality of opportunity" idea Wallace supported in such works 

          as 'Human selection,' <i>op.cit.</i> (141). In a letter printed in <i>Nature</i> 

          in 1903 (67, p. 296), Wallace dubbed this entirely "positive" form of 

          selection, destined to "supercede" natural selection, "perpetuation 

          of the fittest."<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="163"></a>163. It should be noted that 'The origin of 

          human races...' was not the only pre-1869 writing into which Wallace 

          incorporated discussion to the effect that man was to a certain degree 

          "above nature." 'Creation by law,' <i>op.cit.</i> (83), and 'Mr. Wallace 

          on natural selection applied to anthropology,' a letter printed in <i>Anthr. 

          Review</i> (1867, 5, pp. 103-5), contain similar, though less directly 

          stated, ideas. These works and 'The origin of human races...,' <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (79), in fact represent a direct continuation of the line of thought 

          introduced in 'On the habits of the orang-utan,' <i>op.cit.</i> (82), 

          in 1856. Compare all three works with the later Wallace 1874, <i>op.cit.</i> 

          (83), and differing little in point of view.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="164"></a>164. S.J. Gould, 'Wallace's fatal flaw,' <i>Natural 

          History</i> (1980) 89, pp. 26-40.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="165"></a>165. Gould's "panselectionism" criticism of 

          Wallace's approach, for example, does not really address the issue. 

          As a statement about environmental interaction--not specifics of adaptation--its 

          proper vehicle for test should be spatial analysis of a biogeographical 

          or ecological type; just because Wallace treats adaptation as an outcome 

          rather than a process doesn't mean that the spatial and temporal conditions 

          of environment and distribution attached to the outcome cannot be studied 

          on their own terms. See Smith, <i>op.cit.</i> (50), and the author's 

          'Historical biogeography: geography as evolution, evolution as geography,' 

          <i>New Zealand J. Zool.</i> (1989) 16, pp. 773-85.</font></p>

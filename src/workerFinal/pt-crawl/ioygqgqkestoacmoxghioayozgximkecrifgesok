<p>Playing time: 44'</p>

<p>Recording date: July 1996</p>

<p>The present recording is one of the major attempts to seriously
recreate this repertory in depth.  All of the &quot;classic&quot;
surviving musical sources from Ancient Greece are included here,
presented (mostly) chronologically.  The scores were studied for
years to determine their pitches and rhythms, all other available
evidence was considered and the instruments were eventually made
to authentic specifications.  As such, this is a very serious and
scholastic effort which took several years.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is fascinating music.  I personally find it hard
to believe that the techniques of singing are authentic, as they
sound distinctly modern to me.  Nonetheless, the diction is engaging.
It should also be noted that the &quot;sound&quot; of this singing
will not seem relaxing to those used to medieval (i.e. French)
sonorities.  The instrumental sonorites are very nice.  Finally,
I should add that perhaps the only drawback to this release is its
pretentious insistence that it is <i>authentic</i>, as other than
that it is quite stimulating.</p>

<p>The instruments include the lyre, the cithare (zither), as well
as the transverse aulos and two percussions the tympanon (large
tambourine) and kroupeza (a foot-activated device).  Unfortunately,
while the liner notes describe the care taken to construct them,
they do not really describe the results.  I also do not understand
where the trumpet is supposed to fit in (appearing only in the
opening seconds of the program).</p>

<p>Regarding the volume of sources, this recording contains all of
the 14 items typically listed in older references, plus a newer
discovery (track #3).  Recent pushes for completeness have turned
up some more fragments, primarily from the Roman period, bringing
the total number to 48.  In <i>Die Musik in Geschichte und
Gegenwart</i>, Egert Poehlmann lists 48 fragments of ancient Greek
music, as follows:  Classical Era - 3, Early Hellenistic - 8, Late
Hellenistic - 4, Early Roman Emperors - 33.  This seems to be the
most recent number, although it is unclear to me if this includes
multiple &quot;fragments&quot; (i.e.  track #8, etc.) as one or
more items.</p>

<p>A more recent high-profile program:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Melpomen</dt>
<dd>Musique de la Gr&egrave;ce antique<br>
Conrad Steinmann et al.<br>
<i><a href="hmu5263.htm">Harmonia Mundi &quot;Documenta&quot;
905263</a></i></dd>
</dl>

<p>A classic recording, featuring a similar program in a different
articulatory style:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Musique de la Gr&egrave;ce Antique</dt>
<dd>Atrium Music&aelig; de Madrid - Gregorio Paniagua<br>
<i><a href="hmu11015.htm">Harmonia Mundi musique d'abord
1901015</a></i></dd>
</dl>

<p>Another idea on this repertory, incorporating more of what are
now Middle-Eastern sonorities along with some improvisatory ideas:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Music of the Greek Antiquity</dt>
<dd>Petros Tabouris<br>
<i><a href="fmr653.htm">F.M. Records 653</a></i></dd>
</dl>

<p>An American ensemble:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Music of the Ancient Greeks</dt>
<dd>De Organographia<br>
<i><a href="pnd1001.htm">Pandourion 1001</a></i></dd>
</dl>

<p>Perhaps the earliest citation:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Hymn to Apollo / Veni creator / Te Deum</dt>
<dd>Palestrina Choir - Nicola Aloysius Montani<br> 
<i><a href="vic20896.htm">Victor 20896</a></i> [78rpm]</dd>
</dl>

<p>And the first volume in another series which attempts to
reconstruct some of the surprisingly large medieval (&amp; ancient)
Greek repertory:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Greek medieval songs</dt>
<dd>Christodoulos Halaris<br>
<i><a href="ora1.htm">Orata ORMS 1</a></i></dd>
</dl>

<p>The latter series has little to no scholarly documentation.</p>

<p>Reissued from: <a href="dga14068.htm">Archiv LP 14068</a> (Leonin
&amp; Perotin), <a href="dga14063.htm">Archiv LP 14063</a> (Machaut),

<p>This performance of Machaut's Messe de Nostre Dame has long been
named one of the best, and indeed I continue to meet people who believe
it is the best recording through the 1990s, yet I did not hear it until
1997.  Clearly, it belongs among the best group, and does not sound
dated.  Although the sound is Mono, it has been re-edited expertly here
and is very pleasant.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing for me is that the voices are so
rich &amp; sonorous.  Although not as strong as the modern EM singer,
they are both full-throated and free of vibrato.  Occasional passages
show some weakness in tone, but these are the exception.  Although
instrumentalists participate, doubling is discreet, leaving the voices
to fully dominate the texture.  The result is even sumptuous.</p>

<p>In terms of both intellectual understanding of the work, and
passionate involvement, Cape is clearly in the front rank.  I fully
believe this would be the preferred version for many listeners coming
to it for the first time today.  There is a wonderful richness of
detail, combined with a powerful sweep.</p>

<p>The Dufay performances are well worth consideration.  "Vergine
bella" is especially spacious in conception compared to later
renditions, although a bit thin sonically.  The motet "Flos florum" is
similarly spacious in performance and perhaps overly episodic
architecturally.  The harmonized hymns are engaging, although simpler
compositions and definitely toward the ethereal end.</p>

<p>Perotin &amp; Leonin are also given interesting performances in
major works.  Here my impression is that the rendition can be aimless
sometimes, but with a pleasant floating quality.  The former can
perhaps be attributed to the fact that the interpretation does not use
the "cell" approach to rhythmic organization which has become current
for this repertory.  Nonetheless, there is a definitely mystical
quality conveyed in these performances, especially for Perotin.  It
is a powerful performance, if superseded musicologically.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that in terms of contemporary relevance, it is
the Machaut performance which dominates this important reissue.</p>

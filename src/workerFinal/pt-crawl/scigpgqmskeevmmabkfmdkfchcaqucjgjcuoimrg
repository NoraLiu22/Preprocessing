  <p>Opposed vaccination on the ground that we have already too many maladies; that it affords no security against small pox; and that it was frequently followed by injurious consequences, in support of which conclusions he instanced thirty-nine cases.... </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN BIRCH</strong>, Surgeon Extraordinary to the Prince of Wales, and Surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, 1804-7[:]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have thought it a duty to publish my answer to the questions of the College of Surgeons, and my letter to the College of Physicians.&nbsp; In the last of these I have adduced no less than seven cases of death caused by vaccination.&nbsp; I could add more, but the cases adduced are enough to refute the assertions made to the House of Commons, that vaccination might be safely adopted because it was never fatal. </p>
  <p>I have known several bad effects occur in consequence of vaccination.&nbsp; The case of REBECCA LATCHFORD is published:&nbsp; spring and fall she is usually visited with some eruption or suppuration about the face or arm.&nbsp; I have also seen more than two cases similar to that of JOWLES, in which the face has been principally attacked.&nbsp; By some vaccinators these eruptions are called scrofula [<font size="-1">tuberculosis of the neck</font>]:&nbsp; but how can this be reconciled with the positive assurance of a justly celebrated surgeon, on which parliament relied; that neither scrofula, nor any other disease, was excited by vaccination. </p>
  <p>Besides the singular eruptions above mentioned, I have seen many others of a very itching nature, and some shrivelled scaly skins consequent on cow-pox.... </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MR. BIRCH</strong> concludes as the result of observation and experience: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1.&nbsp; That cow-pox has in more than one instance proved fatal.
  <br>2.&nbsp; That cow-pox is productive of new appearances of disease, unknown before in the catalogue of human impurities.
  <br>3.&nbsp; That cow-pox is not by any means to be depended on as a security against the natural small-pox. </p>

<p>EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE FIRST VACCINE INSTITUTION:.... </p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM ROWLEY</strong>, a Member of the University of Oxford, and of the Royal College of Physicians in London; Physician Extraordinary to Her Majesty's Lying-in-Hospital, 1805; Public Lecturer on the Theory and Practice of Medicine, &amp;c. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In 1805, wrote :--It results from the general resume of all these authentic facts, that out of 504 persons vaccinated in England, 75 died from the consequences, and almost all have had the small-pox, some sooner, some later, after their vaccination.&nbsp; There is no question here of supposition or calculation of probability, <em>it is truth!</em>&nbsp; It is evidence which seems to speak and leaves no doubt.&nbsp; Now, if in the space of 7 or 8 years, (from 1798 to 1805,) vaccination has shown itself so grievous to society, what may we not fear for the future?&nbsp; It will scarcely be imagined that the facts mentioned are all that might be cited to prove the inefficiency and dangers of the practice.&nbsp; Alas! it is too certain that on all sides we meet with new instances of maladies such as those already detailed.&nbsp; Consider England, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries, where vaccination has been received; penetrate into the interior of houses, into the bosom of families; interrogate fathers and mothers, and you will be surprised, shocked, and even enraged to see, not only tolerated but maintained, a murderous practice, which carries desolation into families, and compromises the reputation of those who protect or practise it. </p>

in its wake and which only a decade ago was rampant in Africa, Asia, and

<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and Russia's Research

<li>
Should the last remaining samples of the organism responsible for the world's
deadliest disease be destroyed?</li>
</ul>

Should smallpox vaccination once again be required of everyone?</li>

Is smallpox a good candidate for use as a biological weapon?</li>

Would wiping out a species, even one as despised as smallpox, set a dangerous
precedent?</li>

Will cracking the virus's genetic code tell researchers all they need to
know, or will killing smallpox mean burying important scientific secrets
forever?</li>

Could there be some beneficial use for the virus that we cannot foresee?</li>

How can you become more informed about these questions?</li>

How do you think historians in 2502 will assess the wisdom of our deliberations,
decisions, and actions with respect to the disposition of the smallpox
virus?</li>

1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

  <span class="style16"><font size="+2">Wallace on Conservation</font></span>
</center>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace is not usually much remembered for 
        his views on conservation or influence on later workers in this arena, 
        but this doesn't mean that he took no interest in related matters. Indeed, 
        as in so many other subjects he explored, he was a pioneer here as well--perhaps 
        not in the same league as a George Perkins Marsh or a John Muir, but nevertheless 
        a figure worthy of some notice. Wallace's contributions may be summarized 
        under the following headings:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) His quasi-poetic musings on the place 
        of nature, and the plea that humankind better familiarize itself with 
        its workings if it expects to plot a responsible trajectory into its own 
        future. This line of thinking speaks directly to the moral-ethical underpinnings 
        of the current biodiversity conservation movement.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) His collecting and systematics work, 
        which brought to professionals and laypersons alike a wealth of knowledge 
        on the basic characteristics of biodiversity. In addition to being one 
        of the most prolific specimen collectors of any time, he is increasingly 
        being recognized both as history's pre-eminent tropical naturalist, and 
        as one of its leading field biologists.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The conservation of natural resources. 
        On several occasions Wallace wrote on the conservation of nonrenewable 
        resources, especially in the context of international trade.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The degradation of landscape and climate. 
        Wallace's knowledge of physical geography was very extensive, and he was 
        a pioneer in recognizing how various synergies might result in the deterioration 
        of surface processes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The protection of technologically inadvanced 
        peoples. No one in his own time was more vocal in his insistence that 
        culturally unsophisticated native peoples were yet our equals so far as 
        intelligence and morality go. In practice, this implicitly became a plea 
        for their fair and humane treatment.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Land planning. Wallace's ideas and 
        plans for land nationalization and other land conservation programs were 
        ahead of their time, featuring suggestions for &quot;rural renewal&quot; such as 
        the preservation of ancient monuments and commons grounds, <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the 
        conservation of nonrenewable resources, geographically-graded property 
        rental rate plans, and </font>the construction of greenbelts.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following I have brought together 
        the better part of Wallace's writings on conservation subjects and arranged 
        them in simple chronological order, adding a few introductory notes along 
        the way. Abbreviated source references are given as needed for each item; 
        full citations can be found in the &quot;Wallace Bibliography&quot; section. We 
        begin with his earliest notable commentary, a passage that has become 
        one of the most frequently cited calls to arms of the biodiversity studies 
        movement.</p>
    
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">_________________________</font></p>
      
      <p><em><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1863 Wallace made a spectacularly successful 
        presentation on the physical geography of the Malay Archipelago to the 
        Royal Geographical Society. The paper concludes (<a href="S078.htm">S78</a>, 
        pp. 233-234) with some now famous words:</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . In 
        dwelling upon this subject--which I trust I have succeeded in making intelligible--my 
        object has been to show the important bearing of researches into the natural 
        history of every part of the world upon the study of its past history. 
        An accurate knowledge of any group of birds or of insects, and of their 
        geographical distribution, may assist us to map out the islands and continents 
        of a former epoch; the amount of difference that exists between the animals 
        of adjacent districts being closely dependent upon preceding geological 
        changes. By the collection of such minute facts alone can we hope to fill 
        up a great gap in the past history of the earth as revealed by geology, 
        and obtain some indications of the existence of those ancient lands which 
        now lie buried beneath the ocean, and have left us nothing but these living 
        records of their former existence.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for 
        such inquiries the modern naturalist collects his materials; it is for 
        this that he still wants to add to the apparently boundless treasures 
        of our national museums, and will never rest satisfied as long as the 
        native country, the geographical distribution, and the amount of variation 
        of any living thing remains imperfectly known. He looks upon every species 
        of animal and plant now living as the individual letters which go to make 
        up one of the volumes of our earth's history; and, as a few lost letters 
        may make a sentence unintelligible, so the extinction of the numerous 
        forms of life which the progress of cultivation invariably entails will 
        necessarily obscure this invaluable record of the past. It is, therefore, 
        an important object, which governments and scientific institutions should 
        immediately take steps to secure, that in all tropical countries colonised 
        by Europeans the most perfect collections possible in every branch of 
        natural history should be made and deposited in national museums, where 
        they may be available for study and interpretation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is 
        not done, future ages will certainly look back upon us as a people so 
        immersed in the pursuit of wealth as to be blind to higher considerations. 
        They will charge us with having culpably allowed the destruction of some 
        of those records of Creation which we had it in our power to preserve; 
        and while professing to regard every living thing as the direct handiwork 
        and best evidence of a Creator, yet, with a strange inconsistency, seeing 
        many of them perish irrecoverably from the face of the earth, uncared 
        for and unknown.</p>

      <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1873, in one of his first extended 
        writings on a political question, Wallace expressed concern for free trade 
        principles in their relation to the conservation of natural resources:</em></p>

      <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following excerpt, concerning land 
        degradation, comes from pages 18-21 of the first essay, &quot;The Climate and 
        Physical Aspects of the Equatorial Zone&quot; (<a href="S288.htm">S288</a>), 
        in Wallace's 1878 collection <u>Tropical Nature and Other Essays</u> (S719):</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Whether we are at Singapore or Batavia; 
        in the Moluccas, or New Guinea; at Para, at the sources of the Rio Negro, 
        or on the Upper Amazon, the equatorial climate is essentially the same, 
        and we have no reason to believe that it materially differs in Guinea 
        or the Congo. In certain localities, however, a more contrasted wet and 
        dry season prevails, with a somewhat greater range of the thermometer. 
        This is generally associated with a sandy soil, and a less dense forest, 
        or with an open and more cultivated country. The open sandy country with 
        scattered trees and shrubs or occasional thickets, which is found at Santarem 
        and Monte-Alegre on the lower Amazon, are examples, as well as the open 
        cultivated plains of Southern Celebes; but in both cases the forest country 
        in adjacent districts has a moister and more uniform climate, so that 
        it seems probable that the nature of the soil or the artificial clearing 
        away of the forests, are important agents in producing the departure from 
        the typical equatorial climate observed in such districts. The almost 
        rainless district of Ceara on the North-East coast of Brazil and only 
        a few degrees south of the equator, is a striking example of the need 
        of vegetation to react on the rainfall. We have here no apparent cause 
        but the sandy soil and bare hills, which when heated by the equatorial 
        sun produce ascending currents of warm air and thus prevent the condensation 
        of the atmospheric vapour, to account for such an anomaly; and there is 
        probably no district where judicious planting would produce such striking 
        and beneficial effects. In Central India the scanty and intermittent rainfall, 
        with its fearful accompaniment of famine, is no doubt in great part due 
        to the absence of a sufficient proportion of forest-covering to the earth's 
        surface; and it is to a systematic planting of all the hill tops, elevated 
        ridges, and higher slopes that we can alone look for a radical cure of 
        the evil. This would almost certainly induce an increased rainfall; but 
        even more important and more certain, is the action of forests in checking 
        evaporation from the soil and causing perennial springs to flow, which 
        may be collected in vast storage tanks and will serve to fertilise a great 
        extent of country; whereas tanks without regular rainfall or permanent 
        springs to supply them are worthless. In the colder parts of the temperate 
        zones, the absence of forests is not so much felt, because the hills and 
        uplands are naturally clothed with a thick coating of turf which absorbs 
        moisture and does not become over-heated by the sun's rays, and the rains 
        are seldom violent enough to strip this protective covering from the surface. 
        In tropical and even in south-temperate countries, on the other hand, 
        the rains are periodical and often of excessive violence for a short period; 
        and when the forests are cleared away the torrents of rain soon strip 
        off the vegetable soil, and thus destroy in a few years the fertility 
        which has been the growth of many centuries. The bare subsoil becoming 
        heated by the sun, every particle of moisture which does not flow off 
        is evaporated, and this again reacts on the climate, producing long-continued 
        droughts only relieved by sudden and violent storms, which add to the 
        destruction and render all attempts at cultivation unavailing. Wide tracts 
        of fertile land in the south of Europe have been devastated in this manner, 
        and have become absolutely uninhabitable. Knowingly to produce such disastrous 
        results would be a far more serious offence than any destruction of property 
        which human labour has produced and can replace; yet we ignorantly allow 
        such extensive clearings for coffee cultivation in India and Ceylon, as 
        to cause destruction of much fertile soil which generations cannot replace, 
        and which will surely, if not checked in time, lead to the deterioration 
        of the climate and the permanent impoverishment of the country. (For a 
        terrible picture of the irreparable devastation caused by the reckless 
        clearing of forests see the third chapter of Mr. Marsh's work <em>The 
        Earth as Modified by Human Action</em>.) . . .</p>

        largest work on land reform was his book <u>Land Nationalisation</u> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS722">S722</a>), 
        published in 1882. From this work the following excerpts may be noted:</em></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [from Chapter 
        Five]<em> . . . </em>the free appropriation 
        of land for dwellings as now proposed offers, perhaps, the only possible 
        check to the undue growth of large towns. In all the more beautiful and 
        healthful parts of the country land would be taken for dwellings, and 
        these would become new centres of rural populations, forming in time country 
        villages and small towns. All land and building speculation being abolished, 
        the growth of towns, now mainly caused by such speculations, would be 
        checked, and hundreds who now take houses from speculative builders merely 
        because they have no real freedom of choice will then choose for themselves, 
        will occupy much more land, and will thus spread themselves more generally 
        over the country. Other checks might be applied by local authorities, 
        which would tend greatly to the healthiness and enjoyability of our larger 
        towns, such as the interposition of belts of park and garden at certain 
        intervals around dense centres of population--a class of improvement which 
        the ruinous competition prices of land held by private owners now renders 
        impossible.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Enclosure 
        of Commons and Mountain Wastes as Affecting the Public</em>.--Next in 
        importance to the power of securing pleasant and healthy houses, the general 
        public have most interest in the right to free passage about the country--to 
        roam over the commons, heaths, and woods; to search out the grand and 
        beautiful scenes afforded by our rivers, moors, and mountains; to have 
        preserved for them the ruins which are landmarks of our written history, 
        as well as those more ancient monuments which tell us of pre-historic 
        ages. In each and all of these directions they suffer injury from the 
        powers claimed and exercised by landlords. As we have already seen, enormous 
        areas of common land have been enclosed and appropriated by the surrounding 
        owners, often without provision even of foot-paths by which the public 
        may enjoy any of the land they once freely roamed over. Owing to inordinate 
        game-preservation, the woods and copses are almost always rigidly shut 
        up, and thus the public are deprived of one of the greatest enjoyments 
        of country life--the power to wander freely under the shade of trees, 
        in places where the choicest wild flowers blossom, and where the living 
        denizens of the woods may be seen in their native haunts. Were it not 
        for the ancient foot-paths crossing the country from village to village, 
        many parts of our land would be almost shut out from the great body of 
        its inhabitants. Fortunately these are tolerably numerous. But however 
        great may be the need of fresh centres of population, we rarely hear of 
        new paths being formed, while old ones are occasionally shut up or diverted, 
        or so enclosed by fences that all their picturesque beauty and rural enjoyability 
        is destroyed.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another injury 
        to the public and deprivation of their rights is the frequent and constantly 
        increasing enclosure of those roadside strips of green sward which add 
        so much to the charm of rural walks. Everywhere we find roads and lanes 
        now bounded between parallel hedges or fences at a regular distance apart, 
        while a few yards inside the fields on either side an old bank or an irregular 
        row of trees show the distance to which the road formerly extended. We 
        are assured by the Commons Preservation Society &quot;that all such absorptions 
        are illegal, the general rule of law being that the public have a right 
        of way over the whole space between the hedges.&quot;<sup> </sup>And in a later 
        report they repeat that such encroachments &quot;are almost invariably illegal, 
        and may be abated by the ordinary remedies provided in the case of the 
        obstruction of a highway.&quot; It appears, therefore, that all over the country 
        the public have for many years past been systematically robbed by means 
        of these encroachments; and few more striking proofs can be given of the 
        great evil of landlordism and the injurious power and influence of landlords 
        than that such systematic robbery, though contrary to law, should have 
        been almost always effected with impunity.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, or 
        perhaps even more, injurious to the interests of the public is the extensive 
        appropriation by individual landlords of enormous areas of wild mountain 
        country in Wales, Ireland, and especially in Scotland, whereby Englishmen 
        are forbidden in many cases to visit and enjoy some of the most beautiful 
        and picturesque scenery of their native land--spots where nature exhibits 
        her full grandeur, and where alone the choicest and rarest examples of 
        our native flora and fauna are to be met with. The right to these enormous 
        tracts of land as private property appears to be of very recent and very 
        doubtful origin. The Highland chiefs had certainly no such right to the 
        land in fee, with the concomitant power to evict all the rest of the clan 
        and sell or let the land to the highest bidder. Yet this is what the successors 
        to those chiefs claim, and what they have in some cases actually done; 
        and the law, ever on the side of the landlords and against the people, 
        appears to have endorsed their claim, and has thus given to them complete 
        and despotic power over the lives and liberties of the native inhabitants 
        of the district. The result has been that terrible depopulation and pauperisation 
        of the country which has been described in the last chapter, and the replacement 
        of men and human habitations by sheep, cattle, and deer, for a parallel 
        to which we must go back to the days of the Norman conquerors of England 
        in the height of their despotic power. Some of the wildest and grandest 
        mountain scenery of Scotland is now as rigidly shut up as if it were in 
        a private pleasure ground. Hundreds of square miles of glen and rock and 
        mountain-side are given up to deer and grouse for the pleasure and profit 
        of a few individuals, while the public are thereby deprived of a means 
        of enjoyment and healthful relaxation which hardly any country in Europe 
        denies them but their own. . . .</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>. . .</em></font><em>Permanent 
        Deterioration of the Country by the Export of Minerals</em>.--I have already 
        given an example of a landlord denying the free exercise of their religion 
        to his tenants, and cases in which sites for chapels have been refused 
        are not uncommon; but I shall pass on to an example of the power of landlords 
        which appears to me to go far beyond what should be allowed to any citizens 
        of a densely populated country. I allude to the possession as private 
        property of the minerals beneath its surface, and the power to work, sell, 
        export, and totally exhaust them for their individual benefit.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not 
        been sufficiently considered that the minerals of a country are in a totally 
        different category from its agricultural products or even the agricultural 
        land, inasmuch as man can neither produce them nor hasten their production 
        by nature, while in the process of use they are completely destroyed. 
        They are, besides, a portion of the very land itself; and their export 
        to such an extent as to render the remainder more difficult of access, 
        and therefore more costly, is <em>a permanent and irretrievable deterioration 
        of the country</em>, rendering it less valuable to its future inhabitants. 
        The power of doing this injury to the community should never have been 
        permitted to individuals (any more than the right to sell their estates 
        to a foreign Government), but it has become so great a source of wealth 
        and is so firmly established as one of the &quot;sacred rights of property&quot; 
        that only by the complete nationalisation of the land does it seem possible 
        to abolish it.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be 
        remembered that almost every extensive country in the world possesses 
        coal and iron, besides many other minerals, and there is therefore no 
        adequate reason for permanently impoverishing our country by sending its 
        minerals all over the world and thus robbing future generations; and this, 
        <em>not</em> for the benefit of the whole community, but for that of the 
        few individuals who have been allowed to monopolise the land.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be 
        said that the price of coal and iron has not yet been raised by the exhaustion 
        of our supplies; but this is very doubtful. It is an admitted fact that 
        the enormous consumption of coal, both for export and in the manufacture 
        of exported iron, has led to coal being now worked at much greater depths 
        than formerly, and this necessarily implies greater cost of working, and 
        consequently a higher price than would be necessary at less depths; and 
        this extra cost must go on increasing as more and more of the coal at 
        moderate depths is worked out. But there is another way in which the community 
        suffers by this excessive export of minerals. The areas devoted to mining 
        and smelting are thereby increased far beyond what is necessary for supplying 
        our own wants, and this leads directly to the sterilising of large tracts 
        of land, and besides renders whole districts hideous and unfit for any 
        enjoyable human habitation. Many thousands of acres of good land are covered 
        up with the &quot;waste&quot; from mines and the &quot;slag&quot; from furnaces, and are thus 
        rendered permanently barren; while the extent of black country over which 
        all natural beauty is destroyed must be reckoned by hundreds or even by 
        thousands of square miles. Whatever part of this destruction and disfigurement 
        is absolutely needed to supply our own wants we must submit to; but that 
        more extensive portion which owes its origin to the excessive export of 
        the very vitals of our land for the aggrandisement of landlords and speculators 
        is a serious loss which should be checked, and a public nuisance which 
        should be abated. . . .</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[from Chapter 
        Eight] . . . <em>Free-selection would Check the Growth of Towns</em>,<em> 
        and Add to the Beauty and Enjoyability of Rural Districts</em>.--There 
        can be no doubt whatever that the power of obtaining land where and when 
        required would lead to a steady flow of population from the towns to the 
        country. Villages in all the more picturesque parts of the country which, 
        at the will of great landowners, have remained for generations stationary, 
        would steadily increase in population; but, as building speculation would 
        be almost impossible, they would grow in the most picturesque manner by 
        the addition here and there of single houses, of every size and cost, 
        but never crowded together, so that the rural beauty of the district would 
        not be marred. We should never see then (as we may often see now) noble 
        old trees ruthlessly cut down, because they interfere with building on 
        the narrow strips into which the land-speculator cuts up his lots, while 
        no further additions would be made to those unsightly rows of hideous 
        cottages which the farmer, the manufacturer, or the local speculative 
        builder now provides for the labouring population.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity 
        of land, even in the smallest lots, would enable the occupier to dispose 
        of all the house sewage, in the only natural and economical manner, by 
        applying it to the fertilisation of his own ground; and this application 
        should even be made compulsory, so that no further pollution of streams 
        and no more gigantic drainage works would be necessary. It may, perhaps, 
        be said that the owner of an acre lot would cut it up into three or four 
        smaller lots to dispose of at a profit; but it may safely be predicted 
        that this would not be done. The working man is too anxious to obtain 
        land, and is too keenly alive to the inestimable benefits it confers upon 
        him, to take a smaller quantity than his acre when the amount to be paid 
        for that acre would be merely its agricultural value. No compulsory enactment 
        against the subdivision of lots would be needed, because their subdivision 
        would rarely or never be profitable.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>How Commons 
        may be Preserved and Utilised</em>.--Some reference has been made in the 
        fifth chapter to the way in which so many of our commons have been enclosed, 
        for the sole aggrandisement of landlords and to the injury of all other 
        residents and of the whole community. In some parts of the country, however, 
        extensive commons still remain unenclosed, but usually where there is 
        a very scanty rural population to benefit by them. Such is the case on 
        the borders of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, and there are enormous tracts 
        in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland which, though claimed as private property, 
        have never been enclosed, but remain in an absolute state of nature. On 
        all such lands there can be no claim for <em>tenant-right</em>, and they 
        would therefore become the property of the State on payment of annuities, 
        in the one case to the Lords of the Manor, in the other to the present 
        owners, of an amount equal to the average annual proceeds.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these 
        commons are not very extensive they would, of course, be preserved as 
        common pasture land for the surrounding occupiers and cottagers, who might 
        also have the customary rights of cutting fern or gorse, digging sand, 
        gravel, or peat, under proper supervision of some local authority. All 
        the more extensive of these wastes, however, would afford the opportunity 
        for cultivation by labourers or small farmers, who might have choice of 
        sites, on areas marked out as open to selection, on payment of a low quit-rent, 
        which might be higher than the value of the land as unenclosed pasture, 
        but much lower than that of the surrounding enclosed fields. A limit should 
        be placed to the quantity allowed to be taken by one person, and this 
        need not be high, because the holder would have extensive rights of pasturage 
        over the whole common in addition. Ten acres might be a proper <em>first</em> 
        limit, but when this quantity was brought into good cultivation and a 
        house built, another ten acres might be granted on the same terms. In 
        this way the more fertile and sheltered portions of all the great commons, 
        heaths, and mountain wastes of the country might be gradually covered 
        with small farms and cheerful homesteads, while still retaining extensive 
        tracts of unenclosed land as common pasture, and as recreation ground 
        and health-resorts for our ever-growing population. The numerous cases 
        of the reclamation of the worst mountain land in Ireland by tenants with 
        only a temporary occupancy afford us some idea of the beneficial results 
        to our pauperised and landless population of the right to improve and 
        cultivate waste land for their own exclusive benefit, with no fear of 
        the interference of lords of the land or of the manor. . . .</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</font></p>
      <p><em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of his presidential address 
        to the Land Nationalisation Society in 1885, Wallace spoke the following 
        words on land economics:</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . In arguing 
        against the nationalisation of the land and the more equable distribution 
        of capital which it would certainly bring about, Mr. Harrison maintains 
        that there is &quot;<em>a universal tendency of organised industry, rural or 
        urban, towards the massing and not the dispersion of capital</em>;&quot; and 
        that &quot;<em>increased concentration of capital is an indispensable condition 
        of modern successful industry</em>.&quot; And he concludes thus:--&quot;<em>In the 
        face of this universal law of modern industry, a law the more conspicuous 
        the more free and virgin be the field of industry, how idle would it be 
        to look for any regeneration of the industrial system to a natural dispersion 
        of capital or land! In the teeth of universal tendencies such as these 
        it is rather unnatural to struggle for the revival of the equable distribution 
        of capital and land which marks the ruder types of society</em>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, such 
        general propositions as this as to &quot;<em>universal tendencies and laws</em>&quot; 
        are utterly valueless, unless you can first prove that they exist and 
        have arisen under a social system <em>founded on justice and freedom</em>, 
        and no such proof has been attempted. To illustrate what I mean, let us 
        suppose Mr. Harrison to have been a Roman of the Augustan period. What 
        would then have been his argument as to universal &quot;social tendencies and 
        laws?&quot; Arguing with an advocate of free labour and enterprise, as against 
        a system of slavery, he might probably have said:--&quot;The universal tendency 
        of modern progress is to divide men into <em>freemen</em> and <em>slaves</em>. 
        Under this system alone is civilisation possible. Without slavery you 
        cannot have a highly-cultivated, leisured class, able to produce those 
        works of literature, art, and construction which are the marks of true 
        civilisation. All history tells us the same story. Wherever you have civilisation 
        you have slavery as its essential foundation. Look at the old civilisations 
        of Egypt, India, Assyria, and Greece, all alike dependent on the existence 
        of a small, cultured class, the possessors of myriads of slaves. To this 
        system we owe all the grand monuments and works of art which those countries 
        have produced, and whose ruins still exist. To this system we owe the 
        splendours of Rome, the mistress of the world, and all that noble literature 
        and art and refinement which has never yet been equalled.&quot; And he might 
        have concluded almost in the very words he has used to-day--&quot;<em>In the 
        teeth of universal tendencies such as these it is rather unnatural to 
        struggle for a revival of the universal personal freedom and equality 
        of condition which marks the ruder types of society</em>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one argument 
        is just as good, or as bad, as the other. Both, in fact, are equally bad, 
        because they both rest upon the assumption that men have <em>not</em> 
        equal rights to participate in the free gifts of nature to man. When one 
        portion of society possess the Land, with all the powers and natural forces 
        which it contains, and the other, and far larger portion, cannot even 
        work or live, cannot obtain a particle of food or clothing, except on 
        such conditions as the landholders collectively impose, they are--as Mr. 
        George has so well shown--as truly slaves as were those who worked for 
        Roman nobles or Southern planters. A system which has grown up under these 
        conditions, and which is founded upon them, cannot set itself up as a 
        guide as to what are the &quot;<em>universal laws and tendencies</em>&quot; of unfettered 
        human industry.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some respects, 
        even, the modern slave is worse off than his predecessor in the ancient 
        world, for he is the slave of machinery and capital, and to serve the 
        purposes of his master is forced to live in huge cities far removed from 
        the health-giving influences and spontaneous gifts of nature, and thus 
        when, as so often happens, the capitalist has no immediate need for his 
        labour, he must starve or live as a pauper. Much is asserted of the <em>economy</em> 
        of this division of labour and production on the most gigantic scale, 
        but it is not <em>true economy</em>, inasmuch as its results are to produce 
        inordinate wealth for the few, incessant labour with widespread poverty 
        and disease for the many. True economy is that which not only produces 
        wealth freely but distributes it fairly; true economy must tend to the 
        equalisation of both wealth and labour; true economy will not force men 
        to be the slaves of machinery day after day, with no opportunity for that 
        relaxation produced by change of labour, and that mental and physical 
        invigoration which result from spending some portion of their time in 
        tilling the soil the fruits of which they are themselves to gather. It 
        is not true economy to place men in such a position that when work for 
        an employer fails they are utterly unable to work for themselves. All 
        this is false economy; and yet this is the system which Mr. Harrison tells 
        us is founded upon &quot;<em>universal law and tendency</em>&quot;!</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he 
        descends from the heights of rhetoric and attempts to support his argument 
        by an appeal to facts he is not accurate. He says: &quot;<em>The ancient controversies 
        as to the great and little culture of land have now ended in this: that 
        for the largest production of cereals and stock and for the highest scientific 
        farming the big-scale culture at least is indispensable</em>.&quot; This no 
        doubt is what is repeated over and over again by men who claim to be authorities, 
        but it is simply untrue, as I will prove to you by incontrovertible evidence. 
        Lord Carrington has recently stated that his 800 allotment tenants in 
        Buckinghamshire get a nett produce from the land of &#163;40 an acre, while 
        the <em>most</em> that a farmer can make out of the same land is &#163;7 an 
        acre. Here is big and small farming compared by the landlord, and his 
        facts are supported by independent official evidence. It was proved before 
        the Women's and Children's Employment Commission in 1868 that cottagers 
        obtained an average return of &#163;16 an acre above the farm rent. The Rev. 
        Mr. Stubbs shows that his allotments at Granborough, in Buckinghamshire, 
        cultivated by common labourers, produced 60 per cent. more wheat than 
        the farmers' average, and 11 per cent. more than the average of the highest 
        scientific farming. Thus a million labourers working for themselves would 
        produce far more wheat than the same land does when cultivated by the 
        most scientific farmers. Here is an actual fact, carefully recorded, worth 
        a whole volume of assertions that the thing cannot be. And as to stock, 
        Mr. Little, the Assistant Commissioner to the Royal Commission on Agriculture, 
        in his account of Penstrase Moor in Cornwall--barren land entirely reclaimed 
        by the labour of peasants and miners--shows that those little peasant 
        holdings produce more than double the number of cattle and pigs per 100 
        acres than either the County of Cornwall or the Truro Union in which they 
        are situated. Here, then, whether tested by the value of the total produce, 
        by the quantity of wheat, or by the number of live stock, we see that 
        small holdings beat large farms, not by a small margin, but by 50 or 100 
        up to 500 per cent.; while the moral and social advantages are so great 
        that even if the produce were only the same or even less, the small culture 
        system should be preferred. We see, therefore, that in the one case in 
        which we can test it by an appeal to facts, the general statement as to 
        the superior economy of large as against small-scale industry is shown 
        to be absolutely untrue; and it is highly probable that when applied to 
        other industries than agriculture it will be found equally untrue, because 
        we have yet to see the value of diversity of occupation, of utilising 
        spare time now wasted, and of that magic power of property which enables 
        a man working for himself in his own house or shop to do half as much 
        again as when working for a master, with little pleasure and no direct 
        interest either in the quantity or the quality of his work.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come 
        to the next point--the question of fact. Mr. Harrison maintains, and reiterates 
        over and over again, that Land, as it now exists, is a manufactured article--that 
        &quot;<em>an ordinary farm is as much artificial as a house or a factory</em>.&quot; 
        There is, he says, &quot;<em>hardly an acre of cultivated land in England which 
        has not been made cultivated by a great outlay of labour and capital. 
        It has really been as much built up as a railway or a dock.</em>&quot; And 
        thence he argues that even if the people of England have a right to the 
        land of England, they have only a right to it as it was originally. &quot;<em>To 
        seize it</em>,&quot; he says, &quot;<em>after centuries of labour have been expended 
        to utterly changing its very face and nature would be monstrously unjust</em>.&quot; 
        And further on he argues that the whole labour expended on reclaiming 
        the land is so great that it often represents more than its present value; 
        and concludes thus:--&quot;<em>Mr. George might as well claim the coats off 
        our backs, on the ground that God made the sheep, as the farms which have 
        been made by human capital and skill</em>.&quot; And very much more in the 
        same brilliant, but I think superficial, style.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in all 
        this there are two underlying fallacies: 1. The improvement to the land 
        by culture is not, on the whole, nearly so great as is alleged, since 
        in many cases it has been deteriorated and impoverished instead of being 
        improved; and 2. The bulk of the improvement that has been made has been 
        made by successive generations of tenant-cultivators, <em>as an incident 
        of cultivation</em>, and the result, whatever it may be, is the heritage 
        of the nation, not of the landlords, who have in most cases done <em>nothing</em>.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the 
        last point first, Mr. Harrison argues as if the whole process of reclamation 
        from forest or moorland, from marsh or mountain side, had been done by, 
        or at the cost of, the landlords. But by far the larger part of the land 
        now under cultivation has been so for many centuries, and was certainly 
        brought under cultivation by successive generations of actual cultivators. 
        This is proved by the fact that in 1557 wheat was <em>exported</em> from 
        this country, which, taking into account the system of agriculture then 
        pursued, the small crops raised, and the estimated population of England, 
        shows that the amount of arable land was then nearly as great as now, 
        if not greater. Of course we are speaking only of the <em>land itself</em>. 
        Many farmhouses and buildings have been erected by landlords, and some 
        other permanent improvements made by them, but neither we nor Mr. George 
        have ever even proposed to take these away from their owners. The land 
        itself, however, in so far as its value has been increased, has been improved 
        bit by bit, by successive generations of <em>tenants</em> from Saxon times 
        downwards, and we claim that the people of England, not the landlords 
        only, are the true inheritors of that improvement.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr. Harrison 
        is equally in error in his estimate of the enormous amount of this increased 
        value. On the contrary, it is very doubtful if the land of England, as 
        a whole, is so inherently valuable now as it was three or four hundred 
        years ago. There are two reasons for this opinion. In the first place, 
        population was formerly distributed pretty uniformly over the whole country, 
        and as there was then no system of sewerage (by which the fertilising 
        refuse of men and animals are now carried away to the sea), almost the 
        whole of the manurial products were returned to the land, and thus, with 
        a regular system of fallows, its fertility was kept up. Now, on the contrary, 
        almost all the vegetable and animal produce of the country is consumed 
        in great cities far away from the land which produces it, and the manure 
        is not returned to the land. Hence a progressive deterioration, only partially 
        checked by the use of artificial manures. Again, we find, almost all over 
        England, extensive tracts of poor pasture land which, by the ridges on 
        its surface, show that it has formerly been ploughed. Much of this was 
        probably once natural pasture, which, when on a good subsoil, is the most 
        fertile of all land. During the periods when wheat was dear, under the 
        old <em>r&eacute;gime</em> of the Corn Laws, this fine old pasture was 
        everywhere broken up, and the top soil, rich in humus and vegetable fibre 
        which had accumulated by thousands of years of grazing, gave for a few 
        years immense crops of grain. Then, when its fertility diminished, fresh 
        land was broken up and the other was allowed to go back into pasture. 
        But its natural fertility had been irretrievably ruined. It now bears 
        large crops of thistles and other noxious weeds, and is in many cases 
        not worth half or a third of what it was before it was broken up. This 
        was the work of the landlords, who got high rents for this corn-producing 
        land; and if this, and the thousands of acres of chalk and limestone downs 
        which have been similarly broken up and deteriorated, are taken into account, 
        I think it very probable that instead of the landlords having improved 
        the land, they have, by their greed for high rents, distinctly deteriorated 
        it; and for this deterioration the people of England may perhaps present 
        their <em>bill</em> when accounts come to be settled between them both.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the English 
        language bears witness against Mr. Harrison's contention, for what word 
        do we use when we want to express the best and richest undeteriorated 
        land? We call it &quot;virgin soil&quot;--soil in a state of nature. How often do 
        we hear of the difficulties of our farmers competing by means of the exhausted 
        soil of England against the &quot;virgin soil&quot; of America! Yet, according to 
        Mr. Harrison, this &quot;virgin soil&quot; is worthless, and only becomes good for 
        anything after centuries of cultivation! Not only the English language, 
        but history and experience alike bear testimony against this stupendous 
        fallacy.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 
        numerous other statements and arguments in Mr. Harrison's paper which 
        appear to me to be equally unsound, but I have no time now to enter upon 
        them. But I thought it essential to say a few words on this theory of 
        &quot;land being a manufactured article,&quot; because it was the main point in 
        a lecture delivered by Mr. Harrison at Newcastle-on-Tyne last year, and, 
        as I was informed by a person who heard it, produced much impression owing 
        to the authoritative manner in which the proposition was laid down. .

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . .</font>The 
        struggle for wealth, and its deplorable results, as sketched in the preceding 
        chapter, have been accompanied by a reckless destruction of the stored-up 
        products of nature, which is even more deplorable because more irretrievable. 
        Not only have forest-growths of many hundreds of years been cleared away, 
        often with disastrous consequences, but the whole of the mineral treasures 
        of the earth's surface, the slow products of long-past eons of time and 
        geological change, have been and are still being exhausted, to an extent 
        never before approached, and probably not equalled in amount during the 
        whole preceding period of human history.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our own 
        country, the value of the coal exported to foreign countries has increased 
        from about three to more than sixteen millions sterling per annum, the 
        quantity being now about thirty millions of tons; and this continuous 
        exhaustion of one of the necessaries of existence is wholly in the interest 
        of landlords and capitalists, while millions of our people have not sufficient 
        for the ordinary needs or comforts of life, and even die in large numbers 
        for want of the vital warmth which it would supply. Another large quantity 
        of coal is consumed in the manufacture of iron for export, which amounts 
        now to about two millions of tons per annum. A rational organization of 
        society would ensure an ample supply of coal to every family in the country 
        before permitting any export whatever; while, if our social organization 
        was both moral and rational, two considerations would prevent any export; 
        the first being that we have duties toward posterity, and have no right 
        to diminish unnecessarily those natural products which cannot be reproduced; 
        and the second, that the operations of coal-mining and iron-making being 
        especially hard and unpleasant to the workers, and at the same time leading 
        to injury to much fertile land and natural beauty, they should be restricted 
        within the narrowest limits consistent with our own well-being.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, 
        and some other countries, an equally wasteful and needless expenditure 
        of petroleum oils and natural gas is going on, resulting in great accumulations 
        of private wealth, but not sensibly ameliorating the condition of the 
        people at large. Such an excellent light as that afforded by petroleum 
        oil is no doubt a good thing; but it comes in the second grade, as a comfort, 
        not a necessity; and it is really out of place till everyone can obtain 
        ample food, clothing, warmth, house room, and pure air and water, which 
        are the absolute necessaries of life, but which, under the conditions 
        of our modern civilization--more correctly barbarism--millions of people, 
        through no fault of their own, cannot obtain. In these respects we are 
        as the Scribes and Pharisees, giving tithe of mint and cummin, but neglecting 
        the weightier matters of the law.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally disastrous 
        in many respects has been the wild struggle for gold in California, Australia, 
        South Africa, and elsewhere. The results are hardly less disastrous, though 
        in different ways, than those produced by the Spaniards in Mexico and 
        Peru four centuries ago. Great wealth has been obtained, great populations 
        have grown up and are growing up; but great cities have also grown up 
        with their inevitable poverty, vice, overcrowding, and even starvation, 
        as in the Old World. Everywhere, too, this rush for wealth has led to 
        deterioration of land and of natural beauty, by covering up the surface 
        with refuse heaps, by flooding rich lowlands with the barren mud produced 
        by hydraulic mining; and by the great demand for animal food by the mining 
        populations leading to the destruction of natural pastures in California, 
        Australia, and South Africa, and their replacement often by weeds and 
        plants neither beautiful nor good for fodder.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also 
        a well-known fact that these accumulations of gold-seekers lead to enormous 
        social evils, opening a field for criminals of every type, and producing 
        an amount of drink-consumption, gambling, and homicide altogether unprecedented. 
        Both the earlier gold-digging by individual miners, and the later quartz-mining 
        by great companies, are alike forms of gambling or speculation; and while 
        immense fortunes are made by some, others suffer great losses, so that 
        the gambling spirit is still further encouraged and the production of 
        real wealth by patient industry, to the same extent diminished and rendered 
        less attractive. For it must never be forgotten that the whole enormous 
        amount of human labor expended in the search for and the production of 
        gold; the ships which carry out the thousands of explorers, diggers, and 
        speculators; the tools, implements, and machinery they use; their houses, 
        food, and clothing, as well as the countless gallons of liquor of various 
        qualities which they consume, are all, so far as the well-being of the 
        community is concerned, absolutely wasted. Gold is not wealth; it is neither 
        a necessary nor a luxury of life, in the true sense of the word. It serves 
        two purposes only: it is an instrument used for the exchange of commodities, 
        and its use in the arts is mainly as ornament or as an indication of wealth. 
        Nothing is more certain than that the appearance of wealth produced by 
        large gold-production is delusive. The larger the proportion of the population 
        of a country that devotes itself to gold-production, the smaller the numbers 
        left to produce real wealth--food, clothing, houses, fuel, roads, machinery, 
        and all the innumerable conveniences, comforts, and wholesome luxuries 
        of life. Hence, whatever appearances may indicate, gold-production makes 
        a country poor, and by furnishing new means of investment and speculation 
        helps to keep it poor; and it has certainly helped considerably in producing 
        that amount of wretchedness, starvation, and crime which, as we have seen, 
        has gone on increasing to the very end of our century.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the extraction 
        of the mineral products stored in the earth, in order to increase individual 
        wealth, and to the same extent to the diminution of national well-being, 
        is only a portion of the injury done to posterity by the &quot;plunder of the 
        earth.&quot; In tropical countries many valuable products can be cultivated 
        by means of cheap native labor, so as to give a large profit to the European 
        planter. But here also the desire to get rich as quickly as possible has 
        often defeated the planter's hopes. Nutmegs were grown for some years 
        in Singapore and Penang; but by the exposure of the young trees to the 
        sun, instead of growing them under the shade of great forest-trees, as 
        in their natural state, and as they are grown in Banda, they became unhealthy 
        and unprofitable. Then coffee was planted, and was grown very largely 
        in Ceylon and other places; but here again the virgin forests were entirely 
        removed, producing unnatural conditions, and the growth of the young trees 
        was stimulated by manure. Soon there came disease and insect enemies, 
        and coffee had to be given up in favor of tea, which is now grown over 
        large areas both in Ceylon and India. But the clearing of the forests 
        on steep hill slopes, to make coffee plantations, produced permanent injury 
        to the country of a very serious kind. The rich soil, the product of thousands 
        of years of slow decomposition of the rock, fertilized by the humus formed 
        from decaying forest trees, being no longer protected by the covering 
        of dense vegetation, was quickly washed away by the tropical rains, leaving 
        great areas of bare rock or furrowed clay, absolutely sterile, and which 
        will probably not regain its former fertility for hundreds, perhaps thousands 
        of years. The devastation caused by the great despots of the Middle Ages 
        and of antiquity, for purposes of conquest or punishment, has thus been 
        reproduced in our times by the rush to obtain wealth.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the lust 
        of conquest, in order to secure slaves and tribute and great estates, 
        by means of which the ruling classes could live in boundless luxury, so 
        characteristic of the early civilizations, is reproduced in our own time. 
        The Great Powers of Europe are in the midst of a struggle, in order to 
        divide up the whole continent of Africa among themselves, and thus obtain 
        an outlet for the more energetic portions of their populations and an 
        extension of their trade. The result, so far, has been the sale of vast 
        quantities of rum and gunpowder; much bloodshed, owing to the objection 
        of the natives to the seizure of their lands and their cattle; great demoralizations 
        both of black and white; and the condemnation of the conquered tribes 
        to a modified form of slavery. Comparing our conduct with that of the 
        Spanish conquerors of the West Indies, Mexico, and Peru, and making some 
        allowance for differences of race and of public opinion, there is not 
        much to choose between them. Wealth, and territory, and native labor, 
        were the real objects of the conquest in both cases; and if the Spaniards 
        were more cruel by nature, and more reckless in their methods, the results 
        were much the same. In both cases the country was conquered, and thereafter 
        occupied and governed by the conquerors frankly for their own ends, and 
        with little regard to the feelings or the material well-being of the conquered. 
        If the Spaniards exterminated the natives of the West Indies, we have 
        done the same thing in Tasmania, and almost the same in temperate Australia. 
        And in the estimation of the historian of the future, the Spaniards will 
        be credited with two points in which they surpassed us. Their belief that 
        they were really serving God in converting the heathen, even at the point 
        of the sword, was a genuine belief shared by priests and conquerors alike--not 
        a mere sham, as is ours when we defend our conduct by the plea of introducing 
        the &quot;blessings of civilization.&quot; And, in wild romance, boldness of conception, 
        reckless daring, and the successful achievement of the well-nigh impossible, 
        we are nowhere when compared with Cortez and his five hundred Spaniards, 
        who, with no base of supplies, no rapid steam communication, no supports, 
        imperfect weapons and the ammunition they carried with them, conquered 
        great, populous, and civilized empires. It is quite possible that both 
        the conquests of Mexico and Peru by the Spaniards, and our conquests of 
        South Africa, may have been real steps in advance, essential to human 
        progress, and helping on the future reign of true civilization and the 
        well-being of the human race. But if so, we have been, and are, unconscious 
        agents, in hastening the great</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1">&quot;far-off, divine 
        event<br />
        To which the whole creation moves.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        deserve no credit for it. Our aims have been, for the most part, sordid 
        and selfish; and if, in the end, all should work out for good, as no doubt 
        it will, much of our conduct in the matter will yet deserve, and will 
        certainly receive, the severest condemnation.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our whole 
        dealings with subject races have been a strange mixture of good and evil, 
        of success and failure, due, I believe, to the fact that, along with a 
        genuine desire to do good and to govern well, our rule has always been 
        influenced, and often entirely directed, by the necessity of finding well-paid 
        places for the less wealthy members of our aristocracy, and also by the 
        constant craving for fresh markets by the influential class of merchants 
        and manufacturers. Hence the enormous fiscal burdens under which the natives 
        of our Indian Empire continue to groan; hence the opium monopoly and the 
        salt tax; hence the continued refusal to carry out the promises made or 
        implied on the establishment of the Empire, to give the natives a continually 
        increasing share in their own government, and to govern India solely in 
        the interest of the Indians themselves.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the 
        influence of the two classes above referred to that has urged our governments 
        to perpetual frontier wars and continual extensions of the Empire, all 
        adding to the burdens of the Indian people. But our greatest mistakes 
        of all are, the collection of revenue in money, at fixed times, from the 
        very poorest cultivators of the soil; and the strict enforcement of our 
        laws relating to landed property, to loans, mortgages, and foreclosures, 
        which are utterly unsuited to the people, and have led to the most cruel 
        oppression, and the transfer of numbers of small farms from the ryots 
        to the money-lenders. Hence, the peasants become poorer and poorer; thousands 
        have been made tenants instead of owners of their farms; and an immense 
        number are in the clutches of the money-lenders, and always in the most 
        extreme poverty. It is from these various causes that the periodical famines 
        are so dreadful a scourge, and such a disgrace to our rule. The people 
        in India are industrious, patient, and frugal in the highest degree; and 
        the soil and climate are such that the one thing wanted to ensure good 
        crops and abundance of food is water-storage for irrigation, and absolute 
        permanence of tenure for the cultivator. That we have built costly railways 
        for the benefit of merchants and capitalists, and have spent upon these 
        and upon frontier-wars the money which would have secured water for irrigation 
        wherever wanted, and thus prevented the continued recurrence of famine 
        whenever the rains are deficient, is an evil attendant on our rule which 
        outweighs many of its benefits.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final 
        and absolute test of good government is the well-being and contentment 
        of the people--not the extent of empire or the abundance of the revenue 
        and the trade. Tried by this test, how seldom have we succeeded in ruling 
        subject peoples! Rebellion, recurrent famines, and plagues in India; discontent, 
        chronic want, and misery; famines more or less severe, and continuous 
        depopulation in our sister-island at home--these must surely be reckoned 
        the most terrible and most disastrous failures of the nineteenth century.</font></p>

      <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace's 
        most vocal denouncement of air pollution appears in a somewhat unlikely 
        place: on pages 254-257 of the chapter on planetary meteorology in the 
        book <u>Man's Place in the Universe</u> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS728">S728</a>), 
        written in 1903:</em></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . We thus 
        find that the vast, invisible ocean of air in which we live, and which 
        is so important to us that deprivation of it for a few minutes is destructive 
        of life, produces also many other beneficial effects of which we usually 
        take little account, except at times when storm or tempest, or excessive 
        heat or cold, remind us how delicate is the balance of conditions on which 
        our comfort, and even our lives, depend.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sketch 
        I have here attempted to give of its varied functions shows us that it 
        is really a most complex structure, a wonderful piece of machinery, as 
        it were, which in its various component gases, its actions and reactions 
        upon the water and the land, its production of electrical discharges, 
        and its furnishing the elements from which the whole fabric of organic 
        life is composed and perpetually renewed, may be truly considered to be 
        the very source and foundation of life itself. This is seen, not only 
        in the fact of our absolute dependence upon it every minute of our lives, 
        but in the terrible effects produced by even a slight degree of impurity 
        in this vital element. Yet it is among those nations that claim to be 
        the most civilised, those that profess to be guided by a knowledge of 
        the laws of nature, those that most glory in the advance of science, that 
        we find the greatest apathy, the greatest recklessness, in continually 
        rendering impure this all-important necessary of life, to such a degree 
        that the health of the larger portion of their populations is injured 
        and their vitality lowered, by conditions which compel them to breathe 
        more or less foul and impure air for the greater part of their lives. 
        The huge and ever-increasing cities, the vast manufacturing towns belching 
        forth smoke and poisonous gases, with the crowded dwellings, where millions 
        are forced to live under the most terrible insanitary conditions, are 
        the witnesses to this criminal apathy, this incredible recklessness and 
        inhumanity.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last 
        fifty years and more the inevitable results of such conditions have been 
        fully known; yet to this day nothing of importance <em>has</em> been done, 
        nothing <em>is</em> being done. In this beautiful land there is ample 
        space and a superabundance of pure air for every individual. Yet our wealthy 
        and our learned classes, our rulers and law-makers, our religious teachers 
        and our men of science, all alike devote their lives and energies to anything 
        or everything but this. Yet <em>this</em> is the one great and primary 
        essential of a people's health and well-being, to which <em>everything</em> 
        should, for the time, be subordinate. Till this is done, and done thoroughly 
        and completely, our civilisation is naught, our science is naught, our 
        religion is naught, and our politics are less than naught--are utterly 
        despicable; are below contempt.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been 
        the consideration of our wonderful atmosphere in its various relations 
        to human life, and to all life, which has compelled me to this cry for 
        the children and for outraged humanity. Will no body of humane men and 
        women band themselves together, and take no rest till this crying evil 
        is abolished, and with it nine-tenths of all the other evils that now 
        afflict us? Let <em>everything</em> give way to this. As in a war of conquest 
        or aggression nothing is allowed to stand in the way of victory, and all 
        private rights are subordinated to the alleged public weal, so, in this 
        war against filth, disease, and misery let nothing stand in the way--neither 
        private interests nor vested rights--and we shall certainly conquer. This 
        is the gospel that should be preached, in season and out of season, till 
        the nation listens and is convinced. Let this be our claim: Pure air and 
        pure water for every inhabitant of the British Isles. Vote for no one 
        who says &quot;It can't be done.&quot; Vote only for those who declare &quot;It shall 
        be done.&quot; It may take five or ten or twenty years, but all petty ameliorations, 
        all piecemeal reforms, must wait till this fundamental reform is effected. 
        Then, when we have enabled our people to breathe pure air, and drink pure 
        water, and live upon simple food, and work and play and rest under healthy 
        conditions, they will be in a position to decide (for the first time) 
        what other reforms are really needed.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember! 
        We claim to be a people of high civilisation, of advanced science, of 
        great humanity, of enormous wealth! For very shame do not let us say &quot;We 
        <em>cannot</em> arrange matters so that our people may all breathe unpolluted, 
        unpoisoned air!&quot; . . .</font></p>

        1906 Wallace ended an essay on imperialism (<a href="S630.htm">S630</a>) 
        with a lament for our unconcern over a wholly different kind of conservation:</em></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . So long 
        as we possess colonies in which a considerable native population still 
        exists we should, I think, always retain our guardianship of those natives 
        in order to protect them from the oppression and cruelty which always 
        occurs when a young, and mainly wealth-seeking community has absolute 
        power over them. Where these natives are numerous and energetic, and are 
        rapidly acquiring our education, our religion, and the outward form at 
        all events of our civilisation, things cannot remain as they are. What 
        the ultimate condition of such mixed communities may be it is difficult 
        to say, but, whatever the future may have in store for us, it is certain 
        that a method which recognises that the coloured races are men of fundamentally 
        the same nature as ourselves, and which aims at developing the best that 
        is in them, by granting them some at least of the elementary rights of 
        men and citizens, is more likely to bring about a satisfactory solution 
        of this difficult problem, than that system of contemptuous superiority 
        and denial of all political and social claims that has hitherto so largely 
        prevailed.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no 
        personal knowledge of the country more particularly referred to in this 
        article, I only put forward my views in a suggestive form. Forty years 
        ago I had the privilege of enjoying the friendship of Sir James Brooke, 
        and, during more than a year's residence in Sarawak, of observing the 
        mode and results of his beneficent and sympathetic rule over antagonistic 
        native races. A little later I spent several months in North Celebes, 
        in Java, and in East Sumatra, where I had full opportunity of noticing 
        the effects of the judicious rule of the Dutch, almost wholly exerted 
        through native chieftains. For nearly twelve years I travelled and lived 
        mostly among uncivilised or completely savage races, and I became convinced 
        that they all possessed good qualities, some of them in a very remarkable 
        degree, and that in all the great characteristics of humanity they are 
        wonderfully like ourselves. Some, indeed, among the brown Polynesians 
        especially, are declared by numerous independent and unprejudiced observers, 
        to be both physically, morally, and intellectually our equals, if not 
        our superiors; and it has always seemed to me one of the disgraces of 
        our civilisation that these fine people have not in a single case been 
        protected from contamination by the vices and follies of our more degraded 
        classes, and allowed to develope their own social and political organism 
        under the advice of some of our best and wisest men and the protection 
        of our world-wide power. That would have been indeed a worthy trophy of 
        our civilisation. What we have actually done, and left undone, resulting 
        in the degradation and lingering extermination of so fine a people, is 
        one of the most pathetic of its tragedies.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        *</font></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps 
        the most ennobling--and to the point--of all of Wallace's writings on 
        conservation comes from pages 278-280 of his late work <u>The World of 
        Life</u> (<a href="bib4.htm#zS732">S732</a>) in 1910:</em></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Already 
        in the progress of this work I have dwelt upon the marvellous <em>variety</em> 
        of the useful or beautiful products of the vegetable and animal kingdoms 
        far beyond their own uses, as indicating a development for the service 
        of man. This variety and beauty, even the strangeness, the ugliness, and 
        the unexpectedness we find everywhere in nature, are, and therefore were 
        intended to be, an important factor in our mental development; for they 
        excite in us admiration, wonder, and curiosity--the three emotions which 
        stimulate first our attention, then our determination to learn the how 
        and the why, which are the basis of observation and experiment and therefore 
        of all science and all philosophy. These considerations should lead us 
        to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested 
        with a certain sanctity, to be <em>used</em> by us but not <em>abused</em>, 
        and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or 
        a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences 
        and as social crimes; while all who profess religion or sincerely <em>believe</em> 
        in the Deity--the designer and maker of this world and of every living 
        thing--should, one would have thought, have placed <em>this</em> among 
        the first of their forbidden sins, since to deface or destroy that which 
        has been brought into existence for the use and enjoyment, the education 
        and elevation of the human race, is a direct denial of the wisdom and 
        goodness of the Creator, about which they so loudly and persistently prate 
        and preach.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet during 
        the past century, which has seen those great advances in the <em>knowledge</em> 
        of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development 
        of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before has there been 
        such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native 
        vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement 
        of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers 
        the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all 
        the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion! 
        And what is worse, the greater part of this waste and devastation has 
        been and is being carried on, <em>not</em> for any good or worthy purpose, 
        but in the interest of personal greed and avarice; so that in every case, 
        while wealth has increased in the hands of the few, millions are still 
        living without the bare necessaries for a healthy or a decent life, thousands 
        dying yearly of actual starvation, and other thousands being slowly or 
        suddenly destroyed by hideous diseases or accidents, directly caused in 
        this cruel race for wealth, and in almost every case easily preventable. 
        Yet they are <em>not</em> prevented, solely because to do so would somewhat 
        diminish the profits of the capitalists and legislators who are directly 
        responsible for this almost world-wide defacement and destruction, and 
        virtual massacre of the ignorant and defenceless workers.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nineteenth 
        century saw the rise, the development, and the culmination of these crimes 
        against God and man. Let us hope that the twentieth century will see the 
        rise of a truer religion, a purer Christianity; that the conscience of 
        our rulers will no longer permit a single man, woman, or child to have 
        its life shortened or destroyed by any preventable cause, however profitable 
        the present system may be to their employers; that no one shall be allowed 
        to accumulate wealth by the labour of others unless and until every labourer 
        shall have received sufficient, not only for a bare subsistence, but for 
        all the reasonable <em>comforts</em> and <em>enjoyments</em> of life, 
        including ample recreation and provision for a restful and happy old age.

<h3>THE  ANTICLOCKWISE  SOLAR  SYSTEM</h3>

If we could stand outside the solar system and look down upon it from 
above the north pole of the Sun (or the Earth), we would see that
nearly all the bodies in the solar system have motions that are
 anticlockwise.
<p>
The Sun rotates on its axis in an anticlockwise direction.  The Earth 
also rotates on its axis in an anticlockwise direction.  And the Earth 
revolves around the Sun in an anticlockwise direction.  All the other 
major planets, and most of the minor planets (asteroids) also orbit the 
Sun in an anticlockwise direction.  (A few comets orbit in the 
opposite, or clockwise, direction).
<p>
Most of the planets rotate about their own axes in an anticlockwise 
direction.  This is called prograde rotation.  Venus and Neptune are 
exceptions.  Venus has a very slow clockwise rotation (termed 
retrograde), and Uranus, although it rotates every 15.5 hours, has its 
equator inclined at almost a right angle to its orbital plane.  It is thus 
difficult to know whether to describe the rotation of Uranus as 
prograde with an equatorial inclination of 98<sup>o</sup> or 
retrograde with an inclination of 82<sup>o</sup>.

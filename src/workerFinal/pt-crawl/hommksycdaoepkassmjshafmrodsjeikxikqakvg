1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p align="center"><br /><font size="+1"><b>The Glacier Theory of Alpine Lakes 
        (S462: 1893)</b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 437]]</font> The letter 
        of the Duke of Argyll against the theory of the formation of alpine lakes 
        by glacial action shows such an amount of misconception of the theory 
        itself, and so completely ignores the great weight of evidence in its 
        favour, that a few words on the other side seem desirable.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke says that glaciers &quot;do not dig out,&quot; 
        do not &quot;act like a ploughshare,&quot; but, when moving down a slight incline 
        do &quot;scoop,&quot; as well as rub down and abrade. No observer of glaciers has 
        ever stated, so far as I know, that they do &quot;dig out,&quot; and it is equally 
        erroneous to say that they &quot;scoop,&quot; for that implies that it is the end 
        of the glacier that acts. But the end is its weakest point, where it is 
        melting above and below, and where consequently it can do practically 
        nothing. The whole action of a glacier is a grinding action, and its grinding 
        power is greatest where it is thickest, and where, consequently, it presses 
        on the rocks with the greatest weight. The result of this grinding is 
        seen in the muddy stream issuing from all existing glaciers; while the 
        well-known &quot;till&quot; is the product of the rock grinding mill of ancient 
        glaciers and ice-sheets.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the Duke's disbelief in ice-sheets 
        I venture to think that their former existence has been demonstrated both 
        in Scotland and Ireland; but leaving this point, I wish to make a few 
        remarks on the extreme inadequacy of the earth-movement theory to account 
        for the facts. In the first place it is certain that no alpine lake can 
        possibly have a long life, geologically speaking. In the course of a few 
        thousands of years, certainly in less than a hundred thousand, all alpine 
        lakes would be filled up by the sediment brought into them. It follows 
        that all the existing lakes must have been formed about the same period, 
        and that, geologically, a very recent one, and corresponding approximately 
        with that of the well-known glacial epoch. But if these lakes were all 
        formed by earth movements, either just before the glacial epoch came on, 
        or during its continuance, or afterwards we have to explain the remarkable 
        fact that such movements only occurred within the limits of glaciation, 
        never beyond those limits. In Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland, in the 
        Alps, in Scandinavia, in Finland, in the northern United States and Canada, 
        in Mongolia and Thibet, in Tasmania and New Zealand, we have thousands 
        of rock-basin lakes, amid palpable signs of glaciation. But the moment 
        we pass beyond the glaciated districts, mountain lakes abruptly cease. 
        There are hardly any in Spain, none in the Great Atlas, none in Sardinia 
        or southern Italy, except in the volcanic areas and away from the mountains, 
        none in any of the West Indian islands with their fine mountain-ranges, 
        none in the peninsula of India or in Brazil. And there is exactly the 
        same distribution of fiords. We have them in Norway, in West Scotland, 
        in Alaska, in South-West America, and in New Zealand, all characterised 
        by deeper water within than at their outlets, and all in glaciated countries, 
        but nowhere else in the world.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is simply impossible to believe that 
        at a very recent period there should have been earth-movements of such 
        a character as to produce lakes, but always in glaciated districts and 
        never beyond them, unless the movements were a result of the glaciation. 
        This has not, I believe, been yet suggested; but, in view of the modern 
        theory that any considerable loading of the surface produces subsidence, 
        it is at least a possible explanation. But there are some important facts 
        that seem more in favour of the grinding out of the lake-basins by the 
        enormous weight of ice accumulated over their sites during the height 
        of the ice-age. Looking at a geological map of the Alps it will be seen 
        that most of the lakes are more or less bordered by tertiary or secondary 
        rocks. Lakes Annecy and Bourget are in miocene <font color="990000">[[p. 
        438]]</font> and eocene; the lake of Geneva on the north side is miocene 
        or jurassic; the lake of Neuchatel, miocene; lakes Thun and Brienz, eocene 
        or jurassic; lake Lucerne, eocene and miocene; lakes Zug and Zurich in 
        miocene; lake Constance miocene; lake Maggiore is mostly in gneiss, but 
        it is very suggestive that it is here comparatively shallow, but becomes 
        suddenly deeper and reaches its maximum depth in its lower portion where 
        it is bordered on the east by the jurassic beds; lake Como also has its 
        greatest depth in triassic rocks, the upper portion, where gneiss prevails, 
        deepening gradually southward as in a submerged valley. Equally suggestive 
        is the fact that in the eastern Alps of Tyrol and Carinthia, where gneiss, 
        porphyry, and the older stratified rocks prevail, and where glaciers are 
        not now so extensive, there are hardly any lakes, except on the northern 
        borders, where a considerable number occur in eocene, cretaceous, jurassic, 
        or triassic formations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These various facts as to the distribution of 
        alpine lakes--their almost total absence in all parts of the world outside 
        of glaciated districts, and within glaciated districts their prevalence 
        in the newer and more easily denuded rocks--are what have to be explained 
        by the advocates of the theory of earth-movements, and this, so far as 
        I am aware, they have never attempted to do. Equally important, and equally 
        difficult to explain on the earth-movement theory, is the fact that alpine 
        lakes are almost always situated just at those spots where, by means of 
        converging valleys, the glaciers would become heaped up and attain their 
        maximum thickness, or where there is good evidence that they have been 
        very thick; and it is the grinding power of this enormous weight of ice, 
        acting differentially as regards the softer and harder rocks, that has 
        worn out hollows in pre-existing valleys now occupied by lakes. In almost 
        every case, too, it will be seen that there is a constriction or narrowing 
        of the valley towards or beyond the lower end of the lake, which, by preventing 
        the free escape of the ice, has increased its thickness and grinding power.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the presence of such important series of 
        facts as those here referred to, mere opinions, or even small and detailed 
        cases of difficulty, can have no weight; but there is yet another consideration, 
        which most geologists will admit is antagonistic to the earth-movement 
        theory. The whole tendency of geological observation is in favour of the 
        usually very slow rate of earth-movements, while it is equally in favour 
        of the comparatively rapid action of denudation by running water. But 
        in order that earth-movement could form a lake, it would be necessary 
        that the rate of elevation or depression should be so great that the river 
        could not keep pace with it by cutting down its channel; and, considering 
        that all the rivers in question are rapid mountain streams carrying great 
        quantities of sediment, this will be admitted to be a very improbable 
        supposition. But when we add to this the still greater improbability that 
        such rapid earth movements have occurred in scores and hundreds of cases, 
        all at about the same time, geologically speaking, and all just in those 
        spots where it can be shown that during the glacial period ice must have 
        accumulated, and where the rocks were of such a character as to admit 
        of being ground away; and yet further, that no similar earth movements 
        producing similar results have recently occurred in any part of the globe 
        beyond the limits of glaciation, the whole assumption becomes so hugely 
        improbable as to render the theory of lake-formation by ice-grinding easy 
        in comparison.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Charles Lyell considered that the gravest 
        objection to the glacial-erosion theory was the entire absence of lakes 
        where they ought apparently to exist; and he instanced the valley of Aosta 
        and the Dora Baltea, the glacier of which produced the enormous moraines 
        of Ivrea. The valley of the Rhone above Martigny may be adduced as another 
        example of the absence of lakes where they might be expected. But this 
        kind of difficulty will apply to many other valleys, and can only be answered 
        by general considerations. In both these cases the valleys are comparatively 
        broad and open, and have a rather rapid descent. It is probable, therefore, 
        that the ancient glacier in both was of a nearly uniform thickness, so 
        that its wearing action on the floor of the valley would be tolerably 
        uniform. To produce a lake we require essentially a differential action. 
        There must be much more rapid degradation in one part than in another, 
        due either to greater ice-accumulation or to softer rocks in one part 
        than in another. In both the valleys referred to there is much uniformity 
        in the rock-formations throughout, and even if some lakes or chains of 
        lakes had been formed, the enormous amount of debris still brought down 
        may well have filled up and altogether obliterated them. The absence of 
        lakes in certain valleys cannot be considered an argument of any value 
        until it is ascertained by borings that none have been formed and filled 
        up again. It must also be shown that the whole conditions are such as 
        to produce that amount of differential grinding down, without which no 
        lake can be expected to have been formed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly seems to me that all the facts, 
        all the probabilities, all the converging lines of evidence, are in favour 
        of the glacial theory, to which the only serious objection is the assumption 
        that glaciers cannot move uphill. But that they can do so, and have done 
        so, is now admitted by most students of glacier-motion. Mr. Jamieson, 
        and other Scotch geologists, have proved that glaciers, over 2000 feet 
        thick, have travelled up lateral valleys, and up the slopes of many hills 
        and mountains; and when we consider that the Rhone glacier was 5000 feet 
        thick just above the lake of Geneva, and more than 2000 feet thick where 
        it abutted against the Jura, we can have no difficulty in admitting that 
        it might have travelled up the very gentle slope of the lake bottom, which 
        appears to be less than 100 feet in a mile in its steepest parts.</p>

        having given me the opportunity of reading Mr. Graham Officer's interesting 
        letter, I will make a few remarks upon it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that, without further information 
        as to the nature of the search for drift, erratics, or ice-worn surfaces, 
        and judging from the statement that the plateau studded with lakes and 
        tarns was only looked down upon from an adjacent mountain summit, we can 
        hardly give much weight to the positive statements, &quot;I am confident that 
        evidences of glaciation do not exist,&quot; and--&quot;as I have shown, the glacier 
        theory will not account for by far the greater number of the Alpine lakes 
        on the great central greenstone plateau.&quot; Some light may perhaps be thrown 
        on the matter by the consideration that the undoubted marks of glaciation 
        in many parts of Australia are believed to have been caused by, comparatively, 
        very ancient glaciers, since some of the glaciated surfaces are overlain 
        by pliocene deposits, while others are believed to be of pal&aelig;ozoic 
        age. If the Tasmanian glaciation was also of pliocene age, most of the 
        superficial indications may have been destroyed by denudation, or, if 
        preserved, may be hidden by vegetation or by alluvial deposits. We must 
        therefore wait for a much more thorough examination of the district and 
        of other parts of Alpine Tasmania before it can be positively stated that 
        no evidences of glaciation exist.</p>

        (S482: 1893)</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 3]]</font> In a paper 
        read before the Royal Society of Tasmania in June last, Mr. R. M. Johnston, 
        F. L. S., gives a sketch of what is known of the glaciation of the island, 
        or rather of the western portion of it, for no indications of glaciers 
        appear to have been discovered in the eastern half. This difference is 
        supposed to be due to the fact that on the western side of the island 
        the rainfall is from 50 to 76 inches annually, while in the central valley 
        it is but little over 20 inches. Indications of glaciation among the western 
        mountains were noticed by Mr. Charles Gould, Government geologist, about 
        forty years ago, and from information received from him through the late 
        Chief Secretary of Tasmania, the Hon. J. R. Scott, Mr. Johnston took up 
        the inquiry, and for many years has made explorations in the western plateaus 
        and mountains. Mr. C. P. Sprent was another explorer who published some 
        account of the glacial phenomena in 1886, while more recently Mr. T. B. 
        Moore and Mr. Dunn have recorded similar observations. Mr. A. Montgomery, 
        the present Government geologist, has also just published a paper on the 
        same subject.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Johnston tells us that he has personally 
        explored the whole of the western mountains, from the Picton and Craycroft 
        Rivers, southern branches of the Huon, in the extreme south, along the 
        mountain ranges forming the western border of the central plateau, quite 
        through to Emu Bay on the north coast; and that he has found the clearest 
        evidences of glaciation in almost every valley throughout this great extent 
        of country. From the Arthur Range in the south to Mount Bischoff in the 
        north, are numerous moraines, <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es</em>, tarns 
        and lakes in great abundance, polished and striated rock-surfaces, and 
        numbers of true erratics. Near the sources of the Franklin River, under 
        Mount Hugel, and only six or seven miles west of Lake St. Clair, are Lakes 
        Dixon and Undine, of which Mr. Johnston writes:--&quot;The valley of Lake Dixon 
        is <em>par excellence</em>, the ideal of a perfect glacier valley. No 
        one, however ignorant of glacial action, could in this neighbourhood gaze 
        upon these beautiful scooped, or rather abraded lakes or tarns, the snow-white, 
        polished, billowy, and cascade-like <em>roches moutonn&eacute;es</em>, 
        composed of quartzites, on the upper margin of Lake Dixon, together with 
        the tumbled moraines and large erratics on the lower banks--at a level 
        of about 2000 feet--without being impressed with the idea that its singularly 
        characteristic features must have been produced by the slow rasping flow 
        of an ancient river of ice.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further north, the Murchison, Macintosh and Huskisson 
        rivers, all branches of the Pieman River, contain similar glacial markings; 
        and Mr. Dunn has recently described others of the same character about 
        Lake Dora, nearer to the west coast. The latter observer lays special 
        stress on the rounded planed and scored rocks, on hard quartzite and conglomerate 
        rocks rounded and polished, on numerous tarns in rock-basins, on moraines 
        covering hundreds of acres, and on numerous huge erratics and perched 
        blocks. (See Annual Report of the Secretary for Mines, Victoria, 1893, 
        p. 21.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. T. B. Moore states that he found the rocks 
        polished and striated within 25 feet of the top of Mount Tyndall, or 3850 
        feet above the sea, a sufficient indication that the great central plateau 
        at an average elevation of nearly 4000 feet must have been buried in ice 
        or <em>n&eacute;v&eacute;</em> to a considerable depth, and have formed 
        the feeding ground for the glaciers, whose effects are so visible in the 
        adjacent western valleys. The Tasmanian geologists are united in the belief 
        that the glaciers never reached the coast or descended much below the 
        2000 feet level, and that the ice did not extend to the central valley 
        or the eastern side of the island. They therefore speak of it as a <em>glacier</em>, 
        not a <em>glacial</em> period, the conditions being somewhat similar to 
        those of the Alps at the present time; but, owing to the great difference 
        in the rainfall, there was a more marked contrast between the western 
        and eastern districts, while the lofty central plateau afforded a much 
        more extensive snow-field than Switzerland now possesses.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts here stated on the authority of Mr. 
        Johnston, <font color="990000">[[p. 4]]</font> supported by those of three 
        other observers, two of them being the Government geologists, render more 
        singular the statements of Messrs. Officer and Spencer (<em>Nature</em>, 
        June 29, p. 198) as to their not finding any traces of glaciation in the 
        country around Lake St. Clair, which they explored for a month. Lake Dixon, 
        which Mr. Johnston describes as presenting all the evidences of glaciation 
        in their fullest development, appears to be less than ten miles from the 
        lower end of Lake St. Clair, according to the best map I can refer to; 
        while Lake Petrarch, which Mr. Officer describes as seeing from the top 
        of Mount Olympus, lies between the two in the Cuvier valley, and is also 
        mentioned by Mr. Johnston as being within the highly-glaciated region. 
        It is quite possible that the lakes on the great plateau may be due to 
        damming up, owing to movements of the superficial gravels and clays by 
        the ice or <em>n&eacute;v&eacute;</em> sheet; but there are evidently 
        an abundance of small valley-lakes and tarns in the western valleys so 
        surrounded by all the marks of extensive glaciation as to render it almost 
        certain that they are true ice-eroded rock basins. It is much to be wished 
        that a more detailed account of this interesting district, with a good 
        map showing all the mountains, lakes, and valleys referred to, would be 
        given us by one of the local geologists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 52]]</font> Having 
        given my views on glacial geology in the current issue of the <em>Fortnightly 
        Review</em>, to be followed by one dealing at some length with the ice-origin 
        of lake-basins, I should not have thought any reply to Sir Henry Howorth's 
        &quot;Appeal&quot; necessary except for the consideration that my articles may not 
        be seen by many readers of <em>Nature</em>. And first, I would remark, 
        that the mental attitude which Sir H. Howorth imputes to extreme glacialists 
        I have myself been unable to detect in their writings. In fact, I was 
        under the impression that the &quot;scoffing&quot; and &quot;jeering&quot; was chiefly from 
        the other side; but it seems I was mistaken, and I must apologise for 
        my ignorance. Those who read my articles will see that I make no appeal 
        to &quot;transcendental ice,&quot; but judge of its powers and properties by its 
        admitted effects. Sir H. Howorth says that &quot;ice is known to crush under 
        moderate pressure,&quot; implying that a glacier a mile or perhaps half a mile 
        thick is impossible. But will he or anyone else tell us what happens to 
        the ice after it is crushed, and the pressure that crushed it is continued 
        and slowly increased? Will it not suffer re-gelation and become denser 
        ice; and if by sudden increase of pressure it is again crushed, will it 
        not by still further pressure again suffer re-gelation? He stops at the 
        first &quot;crushing,&quot; as if that were the end of all things so far as a glacier 
        is concerned. All this, however, is beside the question from my point 
        of view. The work of ice on the rocks is as clear as that of pal&aelig;olithic 
        man on the flints; all the difficulties that may be suggested as to how 
        he lived, or how he shaped the flints do not in the slightest degree affect 
        our conclusion that the pal&aelig;olithic flint implements are the work 
        of <em>man</em>; and there is equally clear evidence that ice <em>did</em> 
        march a hundred miles, mostly uphill, from the head of Lake Geneva to 
        Soleure, whatever transcendental qualities it must have possessed to do 
        so.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to &quot;perhaps the largest and most remarkable 
        collection of rock-basins in the world&quot;--the largest being of 50 acres 
        and the deepest 30 feet deep--I must really decline to occupy your space 
        in showing how simply these may have been produced by ordinary denuding 
        agencies, or in denying that any glacialist, even of &quot;the most extreme 
        and aggressive school,&quot; would claim them as proofs of glaciation. As regards 
        the question of Tasmanian glaciation, my last communication to <em>Nature</em> 
        (Nov. 2) seems to me to render any further observations unnecessary. No 
        doubt the conclusions of the various writers will be fully harmonised 
        by a more complete study of the whole region.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point touched on by Sir H. Howorth--whether 
        the advocates of the ice-origin of certain groups of lakes are &quot;extravagant&quot; 
        in their views, following the methods of Aristotle rather than those of 
        Bacon, and founding their beliefs on &quot;purely hypothetical properties of 
        matter and forces of nature&quot;--I will leave to the judgment of those who 
        do me the honour of reading my forthcoming article in the <em>Fortnightly 
        Review</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 101]]</font> Sir Henry 
        Howorth wishes to continue the discussion of glaciation in the pages of 
        <em>Nature</em>, but I find in his last letter very good reason why this 
        cannot be done. No discussion can lead to definite results unless the 
        parties to it accept as data what they themselves have recently and deliberately 
        admitted. But when I stated that the Rhone glacier <em>did</em> reach 
        the Jura, and deposit on it erratic blocks between Geneva and Soleure, 
        I did so because it was one of the data already admitted by Sir H. Howorth. 
        In his &quot;Glacial Nightmare,&quot; pp. 169-173, he gives a full summary of Charpentier's 
        first memoir on the erratic blocks of Switzerland, describing the glacial 
        phenomena exhibited along the whole course of the old glaciers from the 
        Alps to the Jura, and showing that they &quot;even climbed that range and went 
        over to the other side of it.&quot; Sir H. Howorth then says: &quot;I have quoted 
        at considerable length from this excellent memoir, because I look upon 
        it as having definitely applied <em>inductive methods to this question</em> 
        with results which are for the most part <em>sound and unanswerable</em>.&quot; 
        (Italics mine.) In the same chapter (pp. 195-202) Charpentier's second 
        memoir is summarised still more fully, and his general conclusion is thus 
        quoted: &quot;It goes without saying that not only all the valleys of the Valais 
        were filled with ice up to a certain height, but that all lower Switzerland, 
        in which we find the erratic d&eacute;bris of the Rhone valley, must have 
        been covered by the same glacier. Consequently all the country between 
        the Alps and the Jura, and between the environs of Geneva and those of 
        Soleure has been the bed of a glacier.&quot; Agassiz and other writers are 
        quoted as giving further evidence of the same kind. Nowhere in the whole 
        of this chapter can I find a single objection to the conclusions of the 
        chief writers quoted, and the concluding paragraph, at p. 208, frankly 
        accepts them. It declares that they are supported by &quot;every form of converging 
        evidence,&quot; and that--&quot;So far there is no question at issue.&quot; Yet, when 
        I take these same conclusions of Charpentier as admitted data, Sir H. 
        Howorth says: &quot;This form of dogmatic argument is assuredly incomprehensible!&quot; 
        Charpentier's proof that the Rhone glacier reached Soleure, was, a year 
        ago, &quot;sound and unanswerable,&quot; and was an example of &quot;definitely applied 
        inductive methods&quot;; but when I accept these same results as something 
        to reason upon, I am told that I am making use of &quot;hypotheses outside 
        the laws of nature.&quot; I have now justified my opening statement that a 
        discussion carried on in this manner can serve no useful purpose.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 197]]</font> In his 
        last communication Sir Henry Howorth makes two statements which are so 
        erroneous and so misleading that I cannot allow them to pass without correction. 
        The first is, that Mr. Deeley &quot;repudiates Dr. Wallace's notion that regelation 
        can in some way act as a compensating element when crushing supervenes 
        in ice.&quot; Here is a double misstatement. Mr. Deeley &quot;repudiated&quot; no notion 
        of mine, or he would, I am sure, have said so plainly, and he said nothing 
        whatever about &quot;crushing.&quot; Neither did I say a word about regelation acting 
        as a &quot;compensating element,&quot; for I do not believe in the crushing of glaciers 
        by their own pressure. I asked Sir Henry what would happen to the ice 
        after it was crushed, the pressure continuing; and I get no reply but 
        the above double misstatement.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, further on, Sir Henry says: &quot;Mr. Wallace 
        confesses he does not like to face these mechanical issues.&quot; This is simply 
        untrue. I &quot;confessed&quot; nothing of the kind, and I challenge Sir Henry Howorth 
        to quote any words of mine which will bear such a meaning. I maintain 
        that his &quot;mechanical issues&quot; are pure theories, and are beside the question 
        of the actual facts of glacier motion. Lastly, he attempts to evade the 
        real issue between us, which is, that he himself accepted Charpentier's 
        conclusions as to the extent of the Rhone glacier, but refuses to allow 
        me to use these same conclusions as a datum in the discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now shown ample reason why further discussion 
        of this matter with Sir Henry Howorth must be unprofitable.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 220]]</font> I welcome 
        the criticism of my article on the glacial origin of a certain class of 
        lakes by an experienced geologist like Mr. Oldham, because it probably 
        embodies the strongest argument that can be adduced on the other side--at 
        all events as regards <font color="990000">[[p. 221]]</font> the one aspect 
        of the problem which he alone touches upon. He urges that my paper contains 
        a fallacy and a misrepresentation. The alleged fallacy is, that because 
        the lakes in question are found in glaciated and not in otherwise similar 
        non-glaciated regions, &quot;therefore the rock-basins in which the lakes lie 
        were excavated by glaciers.&quot; But this is not my argument, and therefore 
        not my fallacy. What I say is--&quot;there must be <em>some</em> causal connection 
        between glaciation and these special types of lakes. What the connection 
        is we shall enquire later on.&quot; That there is a &quot;causal connection&quot; Mr. 
        Oldham asserts as strongly as I do myself, though it is a different, and 
        as I have endeavoured to show, an untenable one.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us to the alleged misrepresentation, 
        which is, that I have imputed to the opponents of the ice-erosion theory, 
        the view that the earth movements which, as they allege, produced the 
        lakes, occurred in the period just before the ice-age came on. Mr. Oldham 
        says, this is an unreasonable and unfounded limitation, since the movements 
        in question probably occurred throughout the glacial period itself. I 
        quite admit the validity of this criticism, and that I should have added, 
        &quot;or during the glacial period itself,&quot; to, &quot;immediately before&quot; it. I 
        certainly had this probability in my mind, and the reason I did not express 
        it was twofold. In the first place, all the advocates of the earth-movement 
        theory appeared to assume, either directly or implicitly, the preglacial 
        origin of the lakes; and secondly, this assumption gave them the strongest 
        argument against my views, and I therefore gave them the benefit of it. 
        Mr. Oldham appears to have overlooked this. Yet it is clear that the shorter 
        you make the time since the formation of lake basins by earth-movements 
        the more difficulty there is in explaining the total absence of valley-lakes 
        from all the non-glaciated mountain regions of the world, since there 
        is less time for them to have been all silted up. When arguing this point 
        I said--in the passage evidently referred to by Mr. Oldham--&quot;The only 
        way to get over the difficulty is to suppose that earth-movements of this 
        nature occurred only at that one period, just before the ice-age came 
        on, and the lakes produced by them in all other regions have since been 
        filled up.&quot; I thus gave my opponents the benefit of an extreme supposition 
        which was all against myself; while the more reasonable view, that earth-movements 
        are just as likely to have occurred during and since the glacial epoch 
        as before it, renders my argument from the geographical distribution of 
        lakes much stronger, since it is impossible to believe that, if lake basins 
        as large and as deep as those of Geneva, Maggiore, Como, Constance, and 
        Garda, were formed in non-glaciated regions as recently as the middle 
        or latter part of the glacial epoch, a considerable number of them would 
        not be still in existence.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if it can be shown that filled up 
        lake-basins exist in tropical and subtropical regions, corresponding in 
        number, position, size, and depth, with those of glaciated areas, the 
        argument from geographical distribution will break down. At present I 
        am not aware of any evidence that such is the case. But even if it were 
        so, there remains the singular correlation between the size and depth 
        of lake basins and the known size of the glaciers that occupied these 
        valleys; together with the surface and bottom contours of the lakes themselves, 
        so strongly opposed to their production by any form of valley-subsidence 
        or earth-movements.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend has pointed out an unsound argument 
        in my article on the above subject in the <em>Fortnightly Review</em>, 
        and I therefore ask to be allowed to state what it is, and thus avoid 
        its being possibly made the subject of discussion in the pages of <em>Nature</em>. 
        As a proof of the very great erosive power of ice I have adduced Dr. Helland's 
        estimate of the quantity of Scandinavian <em>d&eacute;bris</em> in Northern 
        Europe. But it is evident that this only proves the great carrying power 
        of the ice, since the rock and gravel would be mostly of sub-aerial origin. 
        It, however, indicates a very long period during which the ice-sheet was 
        at work, while the clayey element in it would be due to erosion. The larger 
        part of this, however, would certainly have been carried away into the 
        North Sea during the passage of the ice-sheet across the Baltic. The enormous 
        quantity of boulder-clay in North America, which I have also referred 
        to, is a better indication of true ice-erosion.</p>

<h2> The Keyboard Tuning of Domenico Scarlatti</h2>
<p>
Music is about sound. The interplay of consonance and dissonance is central to musical sound.
<p>
What is consonance? &nbsp; What is dissonance?
<p>
Our ears evolved to aid us in survival - to help us to find food and mates, avoid predators, and
such. Music as we know it today had no role in the evolution of how we perceive sound - it is too
recent in our genetic history. Reduced to fundamentals, I submit that consonant sounds are those
which tend in nature to come from single natural sources: prey, mate, predator.
Dissonant sounds tend to come from multiple sources.
Recognition of the difference is built into our neural sound processing at all levels.
The world in which we evolved was complex, and so are consonance and dissonance.
<p>
Numerous musical scales (organised collections of defined pitches) have been used over the years
by various human cultures. All are designed to maximise consonance among their members in some way.
(These ways are artificial and extremely limited - string ensembles ignore them!) The 12-note
scale now used for Western music has itself been optimised in several different ways with the aim
of maximizing the quality and musical flexibility of sound produced by fixed-pitch instruments
such as the harpsichord.
<p>
These optimisations are of two main types: open and circular. In open tunings, such as those
based on the meantone system, A&nbsp;flat is not the same pitch as its enharmonic G&nbsp;sharp;
in circular tunings they are the same. An open tuning requires that a fixed-pitch instrument be
retuned for each key; any use of enharmonics requires a keyboard with more than 12 keys. I believe
that <a href="byrd.html">William Byrd</a> was the first composer to write successfully for a
keyboard with only 12 keys.
<p>
A primary interval in all musical traditions is the octave, which is defined as a factor of two in
frequency (but can differ slightly from this with non-harmonic sounds). It sounds more consonant
to our ears than any other interval. (Any single object, mouse or tiger, that interacts with a
non-linear source of sound produces a harmonic series of partials, which begins with the octave.)
Other "pure" intervals are defined as those formed by small integer ratios. Such intervals
have maximum overlap of harmonic partials in the same way as the octave and also tend to sound
consonant. Even in cases where non-harmonic partials are produced by an instrument (gongs, bells
and drums, for example), musicians invariably select and use
them so that their sounds resolve in our ears as closely to pure intervals as possible.
<p>
Given that octaves are to sound exactly in tune as our ears demand, only a few of the other
intervals can be pure in any circular tuning. The modern preference is to make all intervals somewhat
impure by using 12 equal semitones. There is then no difference between various musical keys and
there are no restrictions on modulation. Unfortunately, this also removes key tonality as a
significant structure in music. In Scarlatti's world this was not the case.
<p>
Until the late 1800's, the European preference was to tune keyboard instruments so that
commonly used intervals were purer than those less used. The resulting slightly non-equal semitones
gave a different harmonic character to each musical key. These harmonic colours were part of
the musical language of the time, philosophically and practically. In particular, the variations
in consonance of intervals were used by composers to shape phrases. When a musical phrase is repeated
in a descending or ascending sequence, each one sounded different, nothing like modern
equal-temperament where such sequences sound repetitive and boring. Scarlatti is full of them, and
he was incapable of saying anything boring!
<p>
So, if one wishes to understand
the musical language of early keyboard composers, the tuning in which their music was conceived
and heard is important. Much early music relies on the strong consonance patterns of quarter-comma
meantone tuning to shape phrases, and becomes dull and lifeless without it. Use of the tuning known
today as Werkmeister III for J.S.Bach reveals many patterns in the Well Tempered Klavier that are
hidden by modern equal temperament.
<p>
However, few composers documented the tunings used in their music. Although there is sufficient
historical evidence that the period and nationality of a composer can narrow the choice considerably,
there are often significant variances between historically-justifiable tunings for any specific piece
of music. The tuning preferences of Domenico Scarlatti are particularly uncertain, since he was born
and trained in Italy, but spent most of his career in Portugal and Spain, and did all of his
significant composing while under strong Spanish influence.
<p>
My JASA paper referenced below discusses a quantitative method to approximate human judgements of
consonance. It is based on a measure of the perceived consonance of each interval in a tuning and
its frequency of occurrence in the compositions of Scarlatti. The presumption of all consonance
methods is that Scarlatti would avoid passages using intervals that were markedly
out-of-tune or dissonant in his tuning (such as wolf fifths) except in passing, and would tend on
average to emphasize those intervals and keys which were relatively pure. Unlike traditional approaches
to this question (cf. Barnes), which are based upon the same assumption but rely upon culture-dependent
interval selection and classification, the JASA method is based directly upon experimentally-determined
psychoacoustic properties of human hearing.
<p>
The method used in this paper cannot be used blindly. Although it gets many things right, it does not
correspond with human perception in one important respect - "background" dissonance. The difference
between the consonance numbers for a good and a poor tuning are much smaller than what our ear judges.
One reason is that the method is linear, and our neural perception is very non-linear. Our perception
involves successive pattern optimisations that evolved to maximise the likelihood of identifying the
source of a sound. Temporal consistency patterns, the consistency of the sound of a lion's cough over
the period of its utterance, are at least as important to our ears as harmonic
overlap. And, the consonance number gain from making the most commonly used interval of a
piece perfectly pure is often greater than that from balancing consonance across a piece of music, so
the method favours over-specialized tunings with short samples of music.
<p>
Nonetheless, the method worked for Domenico Scarlatti. It alerted me to a match between French
tunings of the period and his music that no one had suspected, and that stood up to musical judgement.
And, with the large volume of Scarlatti's music available for analysis, it successfully optimised that
tuning within the constraints set by French tuning instructions of the time.
<p>
The test of music is in the listening. My MIDI recordings use only one tuning for all the Scarlatti
solo sonatas. (Technical limits of the MIDI specification prevented me from tuning the 2-player sonatas.)
The consonance phrasing matches the musical phrasing - the strings talk to each other throughout.
In fact the match is so good that you may not even be aware that a non-equal tuning is being used,
just that the music sounds well. That's what good harpsichord sound is about.

(1997). The paper discusses a quantitative method for the study of historical keyboard instrument
tunings that is based on a measure of the perceived dissonance of the intervals in a tuning and
their frequency of occurrence in the compositions of Domenico Scarlatti. We conclude that the
total dissonance of a large volume of music is a useful tool for studies of keyboard instrument
tuning in a historical musical context, although it is insufficient by itself. Its use provides
significant evidence that Scarlatti used French tunings of his period during the composition of his
sonatas. Use of total dissonance to optimize a 12-tone tuning for a historical body of music can
produce musically valuable results, but must be tempered with musical judgment, in
particular to prevent overspecialization of the intervals.

the spectrum of a sound (its timbre) and a tuning (or scale) in which the timbre will appear most
consonant. Computational techniques are presented to find the most consonant scale for any
timbre, including nonharmonic timbres.

Bach used a temperament similar to Werckmeister III, not equal tempering, even for the WTC.

the transition from consonance to dissonance is related to a frequency-dependent critical
bandwidth of the ear. In addition, for many musical instruments, the density of simultaneous
partials alters as a function of frequency in the same way as does critical bandwidth.

<p>
The format used for my MIDI files is type 0 (single block). Each of the 12 notes of the scale
is placed in its own channel, then a pitch bend applied for that channel appropriate for the
tuning by a computer <a href="miditune.html">program</a>.
This format plays correctly on all General MIDI-compatible players of which I am aware.
However, many sequencer programs insist on modifying it on file output. You are welcome to
modify my files as you wish for your personal use, but I require that solely my originals
be posted or distributed to others.
<p>
The tuning used for my Scarlatti recordings is C=0, 85.6, 193.4,
291.4, 386.3, 498.0, 584.7, 696.8, 787.5, 888.7, 994.9, 1086.5 cents, a
tuning described by a number of French documents of the period, I believe first by d'Alembert.
For Bach, I use C=0, 90.2, 192.3, 294.1, 390.2, 498.1, 588.3, 696.2, 792.2, 888.3, 996.1, 1092.2

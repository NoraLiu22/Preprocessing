I think what we are trying to do is simply trying to understand if the Amazon will have an edge because there is more CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> Every year the forest absorbs more than a billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, slowing global warming. Beto, who is an ecologist at Brazil&rsquo;s National Institute for Amazonian Research, adds that if more CO<sub>2</sub> gives the Amazon an edge, the forest of the future could thrive rather than wilting away from too much heat and too little water. Whether it thrives or wilts could make a big difference in how much the planet warms in the coming decades.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">And that gets us to this episode. Many scientists fear the experiment will show that extra CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is unlikely to give the forest the hoped-for advantage.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/richard-betts">Richard Betts</a>, one of the experiment&rsquo;s scientific advisers, worries that the computer models used to forecast future warming might be based on overly optimistic assumptions about the forest&rsquo;s resilience.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Richard Betts:</b> There&rsquo;s certainly a very big risk that the models may be overestimating the strength of carbon uptake from the atmosphere.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> Richard is a top climate modeler at the U.K.&rsquo;s Met Office Hadley Center.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman (tape):</b> What would that mean?</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Betts:</b> If the extraction of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by ecosystems, including the Amazon, if that is not as strong as the models think in the future, that means we can&rsquo;t get away with emitting so much; we have to emit less.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> Richard worries that the models might be programmed with unrealistic assumptions about how much of an advantage more CO<sub>2</sub> might give the forest.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/richard-j-norby">Richard Norby</a>, another scientific adviser, says the question of how the Amazon will respond to more CO<sub>2</sub> has been studied in carbon fertilization experiments in labs, greenhouses and small chambers that look like roofless greenhouses. Seedlings and small trees have been fed extra CO<sub>2</sub> in these experiments, but such conditions might fail to produce the response of an actual tropical forest.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">To know for sure how a forest will behave with extra CO<sub>2</sub>, researchers need to run fertilization experiments, such as AmazonFACE, that are believed to give the best results. Carbon fertilization experiments have never been done among towering tropical trees like those in the Amazon.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Richard Norby:</b> We know a lot about how individual leaves respond to CO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;even individual plants growing alone. But that doesn&rsquo;t project how a whole ecosystem responds. Lots of stuff changes when that leaf and that whole plant is in the entire environment.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> One part of an ecosystem that it definitely makes more sense to study in a real forest is the soil. Richard, a leading expert on carbon fertilization, says that although greenhouse plants grow better with more CO<sub>2</sub>, <i>Amazon jungle</i> might not because of the lack of phosphorus in much of its soil. He says that experiments in the lab to test this are too artificial to get good results even if you bring in a load of jungle soil. To really understand how this works, you need field experiments in actual forests.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">[CLIP: Faint forest sounds and bird noises]</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> Scientists have long known that much of the Amazon&rsquo;s soil is naturally low in phosphorus. But until recently no one had run an experiment in a jungle plot there to see if this gets in the way of plant growth.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">At a jungle site roughly 40 miles north of Manaus, Beto and a bevy of collaborators are conducting the first experiment to find out. The research is considered an important complement to AmazonFACE. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raffaello-Ponzio">Raffaello Di Ponzio</a>, a Ph.D. student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, tramps through a thicket of vines and slender trees. He casts handfuls of phosphorus-rich fertilizer pellets onto the ground.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">[CLIP: Sound of rustling bags and hand spreading of fertilizer]</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Raffaello Di Ponzio (speaking in Portuguese with English translation):</b> Watch closely. I&rsquo;ve got to ensure an even spread across the entire portion, so I just toss it like this. It&rsquo;s all about covering the ground uniformly. I keep an eye on the boundaries, toss, and then when I see the leaves moving, I know the fertilizer&rsquo;s been distributed there.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> Since 2017 Raffaello, who manages this experiment, and several of his colleagues have spread fertilizer in 32 plots, each about half the size of a football field. The experiment relies on a concept pioneered in the 19th century for improving crop productivity.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Plants need many inputs, such as sun, water, carbon dioxide and various nutrients. Researchers believe that for any given combination of inputs available to a forest, at least one of them hinders growth&mdash;that&rsquo;s called a <i>limiting factor</i>. To test if an input&mdash;say, for instance, the phosphorus content of a forest&rsquo;s soil&mdash;is a limiting factor, you simply provide more of it and watch if plants grow better.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Recently Beto&rsquo;s international team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05085-2">published two years of results</a>. Compared with control plots, phosphorus-fertilized jungle grew substantially better. Beto is one of six principal investigators for the experiment and oversees its operations. He says the results are clear.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Quesada:</b> It shows one thing that we hypothesize for a very long time: that these forests are strongly limited by phosphorus.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> The jungle has been contending with phosphorus issues for millennia.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">[CLIP: <a href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/0KWHmZa8MH/">&ldquo;Let There Be Rain,&rdquo; by Silver Maple</a>]</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Most of the phosphorus in the Amazon originated in the bedrock of surrounding regions. For millions of years mountains and other elevated areas there rose up and then were eroded by rain and wind. Elements such as phosphorus were then blown and washed down to their current locations. Most of the phosphorus subsequently became bound up in chemically inaccessible forms or got rinsed out of the soil in countless rainstorms, and very little is being added anymore. Plant researchers have known all this for decades.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">But this experiment is the best scientific evidence yet that phosphorus could be the forest&rsquo;s limiting factor.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">And that means that in the future, the forest would likely be influenced by two diametrically opposing forces.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">On the one hand, higher temperatures combined with more carbon dioxide would accelerate the process of photosynthesis that powers plant growth. On the other hand, phosphorus limitation would apply the brakes. And Richard Norby&rsquo;s hunch is that the brakes would win out. Richard is the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization expert we met earlier.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Norby:</b> I think the phosphorus limitation is likely to be a lot more important than the temperature response.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> If he&rsquo;s right, phosphorus limitation will prevent carbon dioxide from helping the forest grow better, meaning increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere will not save the Amazon from global warming.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">But he <i>also</i> says his hunch could be wrong&mdash;the jungle might have a trick up its sleeve.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Norby:</b> On the other hand, there are mechanisms that we can easily propose whereby elevated CO<sub>2</sub> would alleviate some of that phosphorus limitation.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> What are those mechanisms?</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Scientists have proposed that trees exposed to more CO<sub>2</sub> could somehow acquire untapped phosphorus in the soil and overcome current phosphorus limitations.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Perhaps some trees would produce roots that could mine phosphorus from deeper soil or stimulate microbial activity that could make the otherwise chemically inaccessible phosphorus compounds available.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">The AmazonFACE researchers will watch for these and other possible responses to additional CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">In that way, they&rsquo;ll learn how the forest works and make predictions about how it will behave in the future, Beto says.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Quesada:</b> So what an experiment like ours do is simulating one single factor, changing one single factor&mdash;which is the CO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;to understand its impact in the rain forest.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> Beto says it might seem like scientists seeking to determine future carbon uptake could simply expose a forest patch to some future date&rsquo;s specific conditions: the precipitation level, temperature range and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of, say, 2050. But that would be a fool&rsquo;s errand, Beto says, because they can&rsquo;t be sure what the conditions will be in 2050. It&rsquo;s actually what we all want to know.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Quesada:</b> We are not simulating the future climate; we are not simulating temperature, we are not simulating what's happening in terms of reducing precipitation. So this would be very nice to do, but it would be really complex&mdash;and even complex to understand the results.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> Instead they study one factor at a time to learn how the forest works. In one experiment it&rsquo;s drought. In AmazonFACE it&rsquo;s carbon dioxide. Then they monitor every possible element that might influence carbon uptake: Did trees produce more or fewer leaves or roots? Did the trees&rsquo; water usage change?</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Thorsten Grams:</b> We&rsquo;re trying to understand the responses of an ecosystem in a mechanistic way.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> By <i>mechanistic</i>, ecophysiologist <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xEOzqm0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Thorsten Grams</a> means treating the forest like a machine with interconnected parts&mdash;like a car.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">You can predict how a car will perform under untested conditions if you know what it&rsquo;s made of and how its parts relate to each other. How will it handle a steep mountain drive? That&rsquo;s something you can predict if you know the grip of the tires, the response time of the brakes and the car&rsquo;s turning radius. The same principles apply to ecosystems, says Thorsten, another AmazonFACE scientific adviser.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grams:</b> And then we&rsquo;re trying to implement these mechanisms into a model, then use the model to calculate, &ldquo;Okay, how will the ecosystem respond in 100 years or 200 years? And how will it respond to different increases in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations?&rdquo;</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Grossman:</b> AmazonFACE members want a model for predicting the health of the Amazon forest in the decades to come under the conditions global warming might cause.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">Right now the key piece they need to complete their climate puzzle is information about how the forest responds to increased carbon dioxide.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">But after more than a decade of waiting, the piece won&rsquo;t be missing for much longer.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2SOat6UAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">David Lapola</a>&mdash;remember, he&rsquo;s one of the project leads we first met in Episode One&mdash;says the researchers will turn on the gas for a trial run in a matter of months.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph">And by early next year all six plots&mdash;three receiving extra CO<sub>2</sub> and three controls&mdash;should be up and running.</p><p class="article__block-KZIY9" data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>David Lapola:</b> All the infrastructure we needed&mdash;all the conditions&mdash;are gathered.

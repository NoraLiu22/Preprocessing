amid Mad Cow Disease scare!</strong><br />
Such headlines arise when there is concern that cattle in some
region may have been exposed to Mad Cow Disease. What exactly is Mad Cow
Disease and why should humans care about sick cows? Let's take a closer
look at this disease as well as some related ones.</p>

<h3>What is Mad Cow Disease?</h3>

<p>Mad Cow Disease (or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) is an infectious
disease of cattle transmitted not by a virus or bacteria, but by an
abnormal form of a type of protein called a prion. The disease is
associated with progressive damage to the brain accompanied by changes in
motor control and behavior. The affected parts of the brain develop a
spongy appearance. </p>

<h3>How Do Cows Catch This Disease?</h3>

<p>

Prions are not transmitted through the air by a cough or a sneeze or other 
casual contact. They can be transmitted, however, by consuming or directly 
contacting infected tissues. Eating infected tissue? How would that 
happen? One theory that has gained fairly wide acceptance is that Mad Cow 
Disease first developed when cattle were given feed containing meat and 
bone meal from sheep infected with a similar prion disease called 
scrapies. The cattle developed worsening problems with movement and 
balance as well as erratic behavior. The abnormal prions seem to be nearly 
indestructible, able to pass on the disease even after the commercial 
processing of the feed, cooking, boiling, or even irradiation. Once cattle 
were infected then byproducts from these cattle, also used in animal feed, 
could also transmit the disease. </p>

<h3>How Common is Mad Cow Disease?</h3> <p>The largest outbreak occurred
in the United Kingdom in 1993, when the cause and transmission of Mad Cow
Disease was just beginning to be understood. About 185,000 cases in cattle
have been identified in the U.K.  and surrounding countries since then.
Only about a dozen cases have been identified in North America in that
time period. It is hoped that changes in the use of animal byproducts in
cattle feed will prevent further outbreaks of the disease.</p>

<h3>Can Other Species Catch Prion Diseases?
<img src="gif/deer.jpg" alt="cc" width="169" height="143" class="flr" 
/></h3>

<p>
Prion diseases (or "transmissible spongiform encephalopathies") similar 
to Mad Cow Disease have been discovered in a wide variety of species:  
goats, sheep, mink, squirrels, elk, deer, cats, rhesus monkeys, lemurs, 
cheetahs, puma, lions, tigers, and a variety of exotic zoo ungulates like 
kudu and elands. Even humans can develop a prion disease known as 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.  </p>

<h3>Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease - A Prion Disease in Humans</h3>
<p>
<img src="gif/cjdtissue.gif" alt="cc" width="150" height="98" class="fl" />

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is normally a rare, but fatal brain
disorder. In the United States, typically only 200-300 new cases are
identified each year, mostly in individuals in their late fifties or
older. About 5-15% of these cases are familial; a mutated gene leading to
the production of abnormal prions is passed on from generation to
generation. Most other cases are considered "sporadic CJD" for which the
cause is not yet known. There may be a long incubation period before the
first signs of CJD, but once symptoms appear the disorder usually
progresses at a rate much faster than other dementias such as Alzheimer's
disease. The spongiform changes in brain tissue cause the brain to shrink
and can impair all the various functions of brain - motor coordination,
memory, judgment, personality, speech, vision, and, eventually, basic
life-sustaining processes. </p>

<h3>Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease</h3>

<p>
<img src="gif/prion.gif" alt="cc" width="300" height="189" class="flr" />

The spread of Mad Cow Disease was associated with an unusual increase 
in cases of CJD. Unlike sporadic CJD, these cases appeared to be linked to 
the consumption of beef from cattle with undiagnosed BSE and involved 
individuals much younger than the typical CJD patient. This new form of 
CJD became known as "variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease" (vCJD).  Because 
appearance of the symptoms of CJD is sometimes delayed, additional CJD 
cases related to the Mad Cow Disease outbreak in the United Kingdom may 
surface in the future. </p>

<h3>Treatment </h3>

<p>No treatment that can cure or prevent the progression of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease has yet been discovered. Currently treatment
focuses on alleviating symptoms and making an individual with CJD as
comfortable as possible.  </p>

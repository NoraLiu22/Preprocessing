<title>Thirteenth-Century Polyphony - Two-voice intervals</title>
</head><body>
<h1 align="center">Thirteenth-Century Polyphony</h1>

<h2>2. Two-voice intervals and progressions</h2>

<p>Rather as 3-D graphics can be seen as a logical extension of
2-D drawing techniques, so music in any period for three or more
voices reflects certain artistic assumptions about the nature of
elementary two-voice intervals.  The 13th century is no exception.</p>

<a name="1"></a>
<h3>2.1. A subtle continuum of tension</h3>

<p>Two-voice intervals range along a subtle scale of tension from
the most purely blending to the most strongly discordant.  While
such distinctions are often relative, the absolute distinction
between stable and unstable intervals is vital:</p>

<p><strong>Stable:</strong></p>

<pre>
Purely blending         (1, 8)
Optimally blending      (5, 4)
</pre>

<p><strong>Unstable:</strong></p>

<pre>
Relatively blending     (M3, m3)
Relatively tense        (M2, m7, M6)
Strongly discordant     (m2, M7, tritone - and often m6)
</pre>

<p>Stable intervals, and especially the fifth, represent points of
ideal concord and rest, often serving as goals of directed cadences.
The more tense an unstable interval, the more urgently it suggests
resolution to a stable concord - an expectation often but not
always immediately fulfilled.</p>

<p>In two-voice music, the fifth is both optimally euphonious and
conclusive, while the fourth is relatively stable but somewhat less
conclusive.  However, two-part pieces often begin or end with a
purely blending (although less sonorous) unison or octave.</p>

<h3>2.2. Directed cadences</h3>

<p>The most powerful two-voice progressions in this period involve
moving from an unstable interval to a stable one by stepwise or
near-stepwise contrary motion.  Either both voices move by step,
or one moves by step and the other by a third.  Here are examples
illustrating some of the most important resolutions:</p>

<pre>
m2-4   m2-5      M2-4   M2-5     m3-1   m3-5     M3-1   M3-5
---   ----      ----   ----     ----   ----     ----   ----
c'-d'  f-g       b-c'   g-a      g-f    g-a      a-g    a-b
b -a   e-c       a-g    f-d      e-f    e-d      f-g    f-e

m6-8   m6-4      M6-8   M6-4     m7-5   M7-5
---   ----      ----   ----     ----   ----
c'-d'  f'-e'     e'-f'  a'-g'    d'-c'  e'-d'
e -d   a -b      g -f   c'-d'    e -f   f -g
</pre>

<a href="ex/13c-2.2.07.gif">M3-1</a>,
<a href="ex/13c-2.2.08.gif">M3-5</a>,
<a href="ex/13c-2.2.09.gif">m6-8</a>,
<a href="ex/13c-2.2.10.gif">m6-4</a>,
<a href="ex/13c-2.2.11.gif">M6-8</a>,
<a href="ex/13c-2.2.12.gif">M6-4</a>,
<a href="ex/13c-2.2.13.gif">m7-5</a>,
<a href="ex/13c-2.2.14.gif">M7-5</a>)</small></p>

<p>In two-voice music, these progressions give a sense of directed
and unifying motion.  In music for three and four voices, they
serve as the elementary building blocks of many powerful and
beautiful cadences, as we shall see.</p>

<h3>2.3. Obliquely resolving sonorities</h3>

<p>Additionally, unstable intervals have standard resolutions where
one voice remains stationary while the other moves by step or by
a third (sometimes with the middle tone filled in).  Here are some
of the most common cases:</p>

<pre>
m2-1   M2-1      m3-1       m3-5         M3-1      M3-5
---   ----     -------   ---------     -------   --------
f-e    a-g      f-(e)-d   c'-(d')-e'    a-(g)-f   b-(c')-d'
e -    g -      d     -   a       -     f     -   g      -

m6-5   M6-5     m7-8        m7-5        M7-8      M7-5
---   ----     ----      ---------     ----    --------
f'-e'  d'-c'    c'-d'     f'-(e')-d'    e'-f'   e'-(d')-c'
a  -   f  -     d  -      g       -     f  -    f       -
</pre>

<p><small>(Notation graphics:

<a href="ex/13c-2.3.02.gif">M2-1</a>,

<h3>2.4. Summary</h3>

<p>The music of the 13th century boldly exploits the entire spectrum
of intervals from the most blending to the most aggressively
discordant.  While the distinction between stable and unstable
intervals is absolute, there are various degrees of tension among
the unstable intervals.  Thus M3 and m3 are relatively blending but
have some tension, while M2 and m7 are rather tense but have some
"compatibility."</p>

<p>Given this approach of flexibility and bold contrast, we should
not be surprised to find an amazing variety and richness of
multi-voice combinations and cadences.</p>

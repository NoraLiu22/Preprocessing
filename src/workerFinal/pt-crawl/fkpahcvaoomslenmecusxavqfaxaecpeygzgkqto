<p><img src="./gif/actionps.gif" class="flr" alt="" /> This page describes
how neurons work.  I hope this explanation does not get too complicated,
but it is important to understand how neurons do what they do.  There are
many details, but go slow and look at the figures.</p>

<p><img src="squid2.gif" class="fl" alt="squid" /> Much of what we
know about how neurons work comes from experiments on the giant axon of
the squid.  This giant axon extends from the head to the tail of the squid
and is used to help the squid move.  How giant is this axon?  It can be
up to 1 mm in diameter - easy to see with the naked eye.</p>

<p>Neurons send messages <strong>electrochemically</strong>. This means
that chemicals cause an electrical signal.  Chemicals in the body are
"electrically-charged" -- when they have an electrical charge, they are
called <strong>ions.</strong> The important ions in the nervous system are
sodium and potassium (both have 1 positive charge, +), calcium (has 2
positive charges, ++) and chloride (has a negative charge, -).  There are
also some negatively charged protein molecules.  It is also important to
remember that nerve cells are surrounded by a membrane that allows some
ions to pass through and blocks the passage of other ions.  This type of
membrane is called <strong>semi-permeable</strong>. </p>

<h3>Resting Membrane Potential</h3>

<p><img src="./gif/ioncon.gif" class="flr" alt="" /> A neuron is at rest 
when it is not sending an an electrical signal.  During this time, the 
inside of the neuron is negative relative to the outside. Although the 
concentrations of the different ions attempt to balance out on both 
sides of the membrane, they cannot because the cell membrane allows only 
some ions to pass through channels (ion channels).  At rest, potassium 
ions (K<sup>+</sup>) can cross through the membrane easily. Also at 
rest, chloride ions (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) 
have a more difficult time crossing.  The negatively charged protein 
molecules (A<sup>-</sup>) inside the neuron cannot cross the membrane.  
<img src="ap1.gif" class="fl" alt="" /> In addition to these selective 
ion channels, there is a <strong>pump</strong> that uses energy to move 
three sodium ions out of the neuron for every two potassium ions it puts 
in.  Finally, when all these forces balance out, and the difference in 
the voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron is measured, 
you have the <strong>resting potential</strong>.  The resting membrane 
potential of a neuron is about -70 mV (mV=millivolt) - this means that 
the inside of the neuron is 70 mV less than the outside.  At rest, there 
are relatively more sodium ions outside the neuron and more potassium 
ions inside that neuron.</p> <p></p>

<h3>Action Potential</h3>
<p class="don"><img src="./gif/actionp1.gif" class="fl" alt="" /></p>
<p>The
resting potential tells about what happens when a neuron is at rest.  
An <strong>action potential</strong> occurs when a neuron 
sends information down an axon, away from the cell body.
Neuroscientists use other words, such as a "spike" or an "impulse" for the 
action potential.  The action potential is an explosion of
electrical activity that is created by a <strong>depolarizing
current</strong>.  This means that some event (a stimulus) causes the
resting potential to move toward 0 mV.  When the depolarization reaches
about -55 mV a neuron will fire an action potential.  This is the 
<strong>threshold</strong>.  If the neuron does not reach this critical
threshold level, then no action potential will fire.  Also, when the
threshold level is reached, an action potential of a fixed sized will
always fire...for any given neuron, the size of the action potential is
always the same.  There are no big or small action potentials in one nerve
cell - all action potentials are the same size.  Therefore, the neuron
either does not reach the threshold or a full action potential is
fired - this is the "ALL OR NONE" principle.</p>

<p><img src="ap3.gif" class="fl" alt="" /> Action potentials are caused 
when different ions cross the neuron membrane.  A stimulus first causes 
sodium channels to open.  Because there are many more sodium ions on the 
outside, and the inside of the neuron is negative relative to the outside, 
sodium ions rush into the neuron.  Remember, sodium has a positive charge, 
so the neuron becomes more positive and becomes depolarized.  It takes 
longer for potassium channels to open.  When they do open, potassium 
rushes out of the cell, reversing the depolarization.  Also at about this 
time, sodium channels start to close.  This causes the action potential to 
go back toward -70 mV (a repolarization).  The action potential actually 
goes past -70 mV (a hyperpolarization) because the potassium channels stay 
open a bit too long.  Gradually, the ion concentrations go back to resting 
levels and the cell returns to -70 mV.</p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Measuring Blood: The American Indian Blood Quantum</H1>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Question:</B> What is a "blood quantum," and why do American Indians argue about it so much?<BR><BR>

Well, the way the government defines whether someone is a "real" Indian or not is they
measure their blood. They have some arcane way of calculating this by dividing the number of
generations since all your ancestors were pure-blood by the number of marriages with
people who aren't pure-blood. By their counting, I think I'm 7/8 Indian. Some of it is
Muskogee instead of Cherokee, but they don't care about that. They're just trying to see how close we are
or are not to white. We argue about this so much because nobody likes it. It's a really 
bad way to define somebody's culture and almost everyone agrees on that, but everyone 
can't agree on a better kind of system, so there's a lot of complaining and it doesn't change.<br><br>

Basically, there are four problems with this. One, it puts pressure on Indians not to
marry white people or their children will lose their heritage, and that bothers a lot of 
people. Two, it means that if some of your ancestors aren't in the records, you can be
denied being an Indian. Three, it's wrong for outsiders to tell you if you can or can't
belong to an ethnic group. Nobody makes African-Americans prove their entire family line
and apply for some governmental Certificate of Degree of African Blood before they can 
get a scholarship from the NAACP or put "Black-owned" on their business
if they want to. And four, most disturbingly: it guarantees the eventual extinction of the American
Indian. By this standard, white is the default, and everyone is approaching whiteness.
Someone who is 1/8 Indian is considered white, and that is the end of their Indianness--
they are white and their children will be white, forever. On the other hand, I am 1/8
white, but that doesn't mean that's the end of whiteness in my line. It keeps sitting there,
just as it has since the 19th century when my white ancestors entered my family. Eventually
one of my descendants will marry a white person again and hah! We will be 1/4 white. A person
can get more white, but not more Indian. Do you see what I mean? Every generation, there are
fewer people this system thinks are full-bloods, and all the blood quantums get smaller.<br><br>

For my part, I think a mixed-blood Indian is just an Indian. Before white people came here,
the tribes all mixed around a lot, and it didn't make anyone's culture disappear. You just
belonged where your mother belonged, or, maybe some tribes did it where your father 
belonged. They didn't need to prove who they were. I'd personally like to see it that way
again. But there's a problem with that, and it's resources. Indian tribes don't have a lot
of resources now. There is hardly enough money for programs for the people we have. If we
let in anybody who wanted to come? It would be very difficult practically. And it would
be impossible to get federal benefits if we couldn't prove anything about blood, and few tribes
are wealthy enough to get by without that. And, too, there are complaints from Indians that
too much intermarriage and 'passing' and leaving the tribe is making us lose our culture.
Certainly it is making us lose our languages. So a lot of people don't want any type of solution that
would encourage more of that. That is why there's disagreement on this issue. Personally,
I would rather see five non-Indians receive Indian status than one Indian be denied it. Not all
Indians agree with that, but it's what I think. The white politicians, of course, want just
the opposite.<br><br>

Actually, the more I think about the non-Indians--or people with very, very tenuous Indian
ancestry who know nothing about the culture--trying to be Indians, the more I think it's 
not so bad. I will admit, I can get very annoyed by wanna-be's. Especially, when I was 
younger they used to think I knew about drugs, and I could get them magic mushrooms or 
something. Now they just think I can get them a spirit guide. I guess that's progress. But
anyway, my point is this: assimilation has devastated us. They took us and sent us to 
boarding schools as children to rob us of our languages. They made our religions illegal.
They turned our culture into something for history class only. Now, some yuppie white girl
finds out she had a Cherokee great-great-great-grandmother, or somebody says she did, and 
she wants to be a Cherokee. Well, why not? In the past, a lot of Indians had rituals 
where you could take the place of the dead. So if someone killed my son, maybe he could
end our families' fighting by giving me one of his sons, to take the place of the one he
killed. Maybe these "wannabes" have come to take the place of what we have lost. Why not
accept them? Not make them citizens of our nations, perhaps, but let's take them in and 
teach them our ways and our languages and help them raise their children to be some of us. 
Maybe they do have a little bit of Indian blood and it's finding its way back to us. That's
what I think. White people assimilated us. Why turn away those who want to assimilate back?

<h3><U>Websites on Native American blood issues</U>:</h3>

There's a lot of Internet material on Indian blood quantum and mixedblood issues, here are some representative ones
illustrating the problems our communities are facing with native identity today<B>:</b> Indians being disenfranchised
or oppressed by blood certificate requirements that are too strict, deceitful non-Indians exploiting requirements that are too lax, 
mixed-blood people caught in the middle. A really <U>good</U> solution isn't going to come until our nations are empowered
enough to make these kinds of decisions ourselves without having to answer to the federal government about it, in my opinion,
but that does not seem likely to happen under a system that keeps splintering away more of us with every passing year. Catch-22.

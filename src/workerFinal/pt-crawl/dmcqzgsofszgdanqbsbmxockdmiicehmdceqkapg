<H2>The new Library</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-lib1.jpg" longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-lib1.jpg" width="500" height="375" ALT="The new Library, 27KB">

<p>In the background, the new addition to the Library under construction.
The existing part of the Library, a three-storey yellow building, is 
obscured by the green tree. In the foreground, the Old Library Building,
the single-storey structure which served as library when UB first
began as a part of the federal University of Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland. The Old Library now contains offices, the Archaeology
Lab, and the Periodicals Library.</p>

<H2>UB cloisters</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-cl1.jpg" longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-cl1.jpg" width="400" height="300" ALT="UB cloisters,28KB">
<p>A fairly typical view of the older parts of UB - single-storey
buildings linked by shaded paths.</p>

<H2>The Main Mall</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-mall1.jpg" longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-mall1.jpg" width="500" height="375" ALT="The Main Mall, 43 KB">
<p>The main shopping mall in the centre of Gaborone. This was one
of the more successful features of the original city design. This
picture was taken on a holiday and is thus uncharacteristically
empty.</p>
<HR><P><A HREF="#contents" NAME="a-afm1.jpg">Back to contents</A></P>
<H2>The African mall</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-afm1.jpg" longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-afm1.jpg" width="500" height="375" ALT="The African Mall, 40KB">
<p>The African Mall is an another shopping centre in the original 1960s
part of the city. A more modest place than the main mall but a 
centre of many practical necessities: resataurants and fast food shops, 
electronics shops, fresh produce, etc.</p>
<HR><P><A HREF="#contents" NAME="a-kh1.jpg">Back to contents</A></P>
<H2>Kgale Hill</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-kh1.jpg" longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-kh1.jpg" width="500" height="375" ALT="Kgale Hill, 24KB">
<p>A Gaborone landmark, located where the main road from the south 
enters the city.</p>

<H2>Sua Pan</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-sua1.jpg" longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-sua1.jpg" width="576" height="432" ALT="Sua Pan, 33KB">
<p>Normally the Makgadikgadi Pans are dry.  But in wet years, like this one,
water enters them. This picture of Sua Pan, taken around the end
of June 2000, shows the Pan transformed into a huge lake stretching
to the horizon. Pelicans and other waterbirds have arrived.</p>

<H2>Approaching Shoshong</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-sh1.jpg" longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-sh1.jpg" width="580" height="380"ALT="Approaching Shoshong, 27KB">
<p>Approaching the hills of Shoshong. Shoshong, in the Central District, was
 once the capital of the BaNgwato under King Sekgoma I in the mid 19th 
 century. Shoshong was a defensible position, which was a prime 
 consideration in Sekgoma's time as he faced a series of threats. 
 It was here that David Livingstone visited Sekgoma, and here that 
 the power struggle between the traditionalist King and his Christian 
 son Khama (later Khama III/the Great) was played out. Khama later 
 moved the capital to Phalatswe and then Serowe, the present seat 
 of the BaNgwato. (See 
 <a href="../bw/oldp.htm">The Abandonment of Phalatswe, 1901-1916</a> by 
 Prof. Neil Parsons.</p> 

<p>This is perhaps a typical view of road travel in Botswana - good 
roads, huge spaces of bush and flat or rolling country, with sudden hills.</p>

<H2>Sunset over the Gaborone Dam</H2>
<IMG SRC="a-suns1.jpg"  longdesc="ab01_ld.htm#a-suns1.jpg" width="576" 
height="432" ALT="Sunset over the Gaborone Dam">
<p>The Gaborone Dam, the water source for Gaborone, is in a sense the
foundation of Gaborone itself. In a dry region water is of crucial
importance, and the fact that a large dam could be successfully created
here was a necessary precondition for the growth of the city. The dam
has a yacht club, and also the splendidly named Kalahari Fishing Club.
Fishers can be seen by the Old Lobatse Road, where it passes the dam,
selling fresh fish to passers-by.</p>

Until about 22&nbsp;000 years ago the Willandra area contained a vast system of freshwater lakes where First Nations people  lived - fishing for Golden Perch and Murray Cod and collecting freshwater mussels, yabbies,bird eggs, animals and bush tucker.<br /><br />Information on how First Nations people fished has been handed down through traditional kknowledge to contemporary First Nations people. European explorers also observed traditional fishing methods of the people who lived near the Murray and Darling Rivers. <br /><br />Over thousands of years First Nations people developed efficient ways of catching fish. Below are examples of fishing methods used throughout the Australian continent.<br /><br />Drugged - crushed toxic leaves and seeds were thrown into the water. This produced a toxin which stunned the fish.<br /><br />Trapped - young trees were used to create a weir in a creek leaving an opening for a net. Large stone fish-trap complexes were also used to dam up small streams. <br /><br />Netted - plant fibres were woven into nets which could be staked out to catch passing fish.<br /><br />Plucked - in times of low water levels fish would become trapped in shallow isolated pools.These fish could be easily speared or simply plucked out of the water.<br /><br />Hooked - line fishing existed in some areas of Australia using fish hooks made from shell.<br /><br />Gathered - while some of the people were off hunting others collected mussels and yabbies.<br /><br />(Source for text above: notice board at Lake Mungo)<br /><br /><h2>Tools of the trade</h2><br /><br /><p><!-- <a href="images12/erosion931med.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images12/erosion931medsm.jpg" alt = "lake mungo lunette" width="302" height="200"  align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />--><p><a href="images36/imgp0931wallsofchina.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/imgp0931wallsofchinasm.jpg" alt = "imgp0931wallsofchinasm" width="800" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>As the interior of Australia gradually dried up between 30&nbsp;000 - 20&nbsp;0000 years ago, the people of Mungo had to increasingly depend on hunting methods other than fishing to survive. They had already developed a variety of stone and wooden tools - examples of which are displayed here. Fire was also to become one of the First Nations people's  most useful hunting and gathering methods.<br /><br />Along the western edge of the lake, silcrete ridges provided the raw material for stone tool production. Silcrete was an important source of stone in an area where few rocky outcrops existed. This stone material was quarried from its source then taken to campsites and made into a variety of multi-functional tools. The remains of some of these 'workshops' can still be seen around Mungo today.</p><br clear = "all"></p>As well as locally obtained material, stone of high quality had been traded into the Willandra region. Many imported stone implements such as axe heads crafted from green stone from Victoria have been found throughout the lakes area. Large slabs of sandstone were also carried into the area to be used for the important task of grinding and processing plant foodstuffs.<br /><br />Razor sharp stone flakes and tools were useful for many day to day activites including cutting, scraping, and shaping with other wooden tools. Stone and wood were not the only form of tool technology used - fire held many uses for First Nations people. It was used for warmth, light, cooking, tool making, communicating and flushing out animals. Its use as a hunting strategy during 'burn offs' promoted new growth - enticing a flurry of wildlife activity.<br /><br />The remains of tool making activities represent the main material left by the early cultures that once thrived there. Many other items of the past have not survived the thousands of years that separate us today.The durability of stone artefacts has ensured that a record of the past has remained. They have provided clues to understanding other aspects of an ancient culture. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2005<br />Text: Display at Lake Mungo NPWS interpretation centre</p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /><p><a href="images43/IMGP0890silcrete05.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMGP0890silcrete05sm.jpg" alt = "silcrete" width="600" height="450"  align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />The raw material for most of the Lake Mungo toolkit is silcrete. <br /><br />Silcretes are very  hard layers of  silica-enriched materials formed  beneath  the surface  in  soils, unconsolidated  sediments, and  permeable rocks.

Over the last 50&nbsp;000 years the Willandra Lakes landscape has been moulded by the powerful forces of the Ice Age. The coming and going of very cold climate conditions brought about a number of changes. <br /><br />The water levels in the Willandra Lakes were influenced by the changing climate. At times the lakes were full, then low, sometimes fresh, sometimes salty, then finally dry. During this entire period the First Nations people were present in the landscape - a remarkable indication of a highly adaptive lifestyle. <h3>Pre 50&nbsp;000 years ago</h3>The climate was slightly colder than today. Snow and ice lay in basins on the Great Dividing Range. Lake Mungo was rimmed on the east by an old lunette made of deep red soil. This is known as the Gol Gol Unit. Vegetation covered the dry lake floor and dunes.<h3>50&nbsp;000 - 30&nbsp;000 years ago</h3>A colder climate produced a large cover of snow and ice on the mountains. The Willandra Creek flowed freely, filling the lakes to overflowing. At Lake Mungo white quartz sand from the eastern beach was blown onto the lunette forming the Mungo Unit. Throughout this period climate conditions were stable enough to allow trees and shrubs to grow on the lunette. <h3>30&nbsp;000 - 15&nbsp;000 years ago</h3>Snow and ice on the mountains built up as the climate became even colder. River and lake levels fluctuated. At times Lake Mungo was shallow and salty and small clay pellets formed on the exposed mud flats. Clay pellets and sand blew onto the lunette forming the Zanci Unit. Water erosion began to create deep gullies and wind blown sand formed large mobile dunes at the rear of the lunette. Salt tolerant plants established themselves on the lake floor. <br clear = "all"><br /><br /><br /><hr size="6"  noshade width="80%" /><br /><h2>Quality of stone available at Lake Mungo for tools</h2><p><a href="images6/blades891.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images6/blades891.jpg" alt = "silcrete blades" width="801" height="589"  align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>These are long blades crafted from silcrete.<br /><br />Although (&#8239;<i>the local&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>) silcrete is not an ideal material for blades, having too much granularity, the tools made by the Lake Mungo people are beautifully and elegantly made, with a minimum of blows in an apparently effortless style.<br /><br />Source and text: Lake Mungo NPWS interpretation centre<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2005</p><br clear = "all"><br /><a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Douglass J. et al.

There are few stone sources in the area of the Willandra Lakes, the result being that the sources in the area of the quarries have attracted the ancestral First Nations  groups to the quarries throughout their occupation of the area.   (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Allen (1998)</span></a>) <br /><br />In the Willandra Lakes region most of the raw material in archaeological sites is silcrete, together with much smaller amounts of quartzite and sandstone. Both types of silcrete found in the quarries were used to make artefacts, 95% of the artefacts were made from the medium-grained silcrete and the remainder from fine-grained silcrete (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Allen (1998)</span></a>). <br /><br />The authors used samples from the quarries for their study reported in Source 2, most of the samples being of a dull yellow orange colour with a thin weathering rind that was grey, with relatively larger inclusions of clay-cemented material that are light grey on the <b>uneven granular fracture surfaces</b>. <br /><br />The medium-grained  Lake Mungo silcrete used for the manufacture of implements consists mostly of a matrix of microcrystalline quartz with quartz clasts that are well-sorted, and sub-angular to sub-round, and mostly medium-sand-sized, and it has a microfabric that is grain-supported (Fig. 2a & Table 1, Source 2). <br /><br />The Lake Mungo medium-grained silcrete was shown by the mechanical tests of the authors (Table 2, Source 2) to have <b>poor flaking properties</b>, with a high fracture toughness that makes it <b>difficult to knap</b>, the fracture toughness being lowered greatly by the inclusions of clay-cemented material. Fracture propagation of Lake Mungo silcrete lacks directional stability because of a low index of stiffness, resulting in <b>a high frequency of step fracture terminations</b> that are also the result of the <b>defects in microstructure</b>, that are represented by the medium-sand-sized quartz grains. <b>As a result of this the Lake Mungo silcrete is much less suitable for narrow flake detachment and resharpening of the working edges.</b> <br /><br />The authors suggest the Lake Mungo medium-grained silcrete was often used for the manufacture of steep-stepped flaked artefacts, such as horsehoof cores and steep-edged scrapers (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">White & O'Connell (1992)</span></a>,  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Cottrell & Kamminga (1987), <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Allen (1998)</span></a>), as <b>the mechanical properties have a less deleterious effect for large, wide flake detachment</b> (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Cottrell & Kamminga (1987), <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Hiscock (1983)</span></a>)<br /><br />		Blocky horsehoof cores and various forms of scraper are common in lithic assemblages from the Late Pleistocene and Holocene in the Willandra Lakes region (Jones & Allen, in  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Bowler et al.

The microliths themselves are sufficiently worked so as to be distinguishable from workshop waste or accidents.<br /><br />Two families of microliths are usually defined: laminar and geometric. An assemblage of microliths can be used to date an archeological site. Laminar microliths are slightly larger, and are associated with the end of the Upper Palaeolithic and the beginning of the Epipalaeolithic era; geometric microliths are characteristic of the Mesolithic  and the Neolithic. Geometric microliths may be triangular, trapezoid or lunate. Microlith production generally declined in Europe following the introduction of agriculture (10&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP) but continued later in cultures with a deeply rooted hunting tradition.<br /><br />Regardless of type, microliths were used to form the points of hunting weapons, such as spears and (in later periods) arrows, and other artefacts and are found throughout Africa, Asia and Europe. They were utilised with wood, bone, resin and fiber to form a composite tool or weapon, and traces of wood to which microliths were attached have been found in Sweden, Denmark and England. An average of between six and eighteen microliths may often have been used in one spear or harpoon, but only one or two in an arrow. The shift from earlier larger tools had an advantage. Often the haft of a tool was harder to produce than the point or edge: replacing dull or broken microliths with new easily portable ones was easier than making new hafts or handles. <br /><br />(&#8239;<i>It may also be noted that such spear heads caused much more laceration of the prey at the site of the wound, resulting in more 'shock' or bleeding, and a quick knock down&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />Collected at Arcoona, South Australia by F.

They are most common in western New South Wales and southern and eastern Queensland, particularly in regions where large-sized stones are available (especially silcrete).  Horsehoof cores were also made in South Australia, including Kangaroo Island, and across the Great Sandy Desert into Western Australia.  They are found in Pleistocene assemblages at Lake Mungo and were made into the Late Holocene, but they are rarely noted in historical accounts of traditional Aboriginal stoneworking.  Horsehoof cores were thought to resemble a horse’s hoof when placed on a surface with the platform down. <br /><br />Horsehoof cores are medium  to large sized cores with a relatively flat platform with flakes struck from around the periphery.  The initial series of flakes propagated the full length of the core face, but the defining characteristic is one or more additional series of much smaller stacked flake removals around part or all of the platform periphery.  These smaller flakes end in step terminations.  Often more than one series of these step-terminated retouching flakes were removed from the core, resulting in a platform periphery that is smaller in diameter than the core’s maximum diameter.  Eventually the step-terminated flakes were cleared from the core by removing one or more larger flakes that run close to the core’s full length.  These ‘resharpening’ flakes allow one or more additional series of step-flaking.  Horsehoof cores were used as relatively heavy core tools, probably for woodworking or food processing, and the step-flaking was an ingenious way to resharpen a dull or clogged working edge while retaining most of the mass of the tool.  An alternative explanation is that these are discarded flake-making cores which were abandoned after flaking mistakes, but this fails to account for the small size and the peripheral extent of the step-terminated retouching which defines these cores. <br /><br />The primary platform on many horsehoof cores is the ventral surface of a very large flake blank.  In fact, these horsehoof cores are a type of very large retouched flake.  They can morphologically grade into smaller retouched flakes with ‘quina’-like step retouching.  Some horsehoof cores have a cortical primary platform, indicating that they were made directly on stone cobbles or chunks.  Far less common are horsehoof cores with the primary platform composed of a large negative flake scar.  A design criteria for these tools appears to have been a flat or slightly convex platform surface, rather than the slightly concave surface created by a negative scar.  Many horsehoof cores have secondary platforms established one the core’s base, where a small number of flakes have been removed.  In many cases, this appears to have been done to remove mass and facilitate the removal of flakes the entire length of the core face from the primary platform.  Many horsehoof cores are single-platform, and although those with secondary platforms are technically multiplatform cores, archaeologists rarely classify them this way.</blockquote><br />Collected on the surface of the Lake Mungo backshore, New South Wales, by H.

'Pirri' referred to pointed engraving tools for woodworking made in the historic period, although similar tools were likely used as armatures for spearthrower darts in the past.  They usually measure between about 20 mm and 40 mm long, although larger examples are known.<br /><br />Pirri points were made by pressure flaking - this manufacturing technique is the type's defining characteristic – and they are the earliest evidence in Australia for the pressure technique.  Retouch was mostly unifacial, towards the dorsal surface of the blank, although the platform and bulb was sometimes reduced by bifacial flaking.  Pirri points typically have a prominent central ridge down the dorsal face with the pressure flake scars terminating at this ridge.  Well-spaced collateral pressure flaking scars are visible on many pirri points.  Some pirri points were made on blade-like flakes.  Pressure flaking spread from Central Australia to the Kimberley region of Northwest Australia by circa 1&nbsp;400&nbsp;BP, where a bifacial variant was innovated and used to make Kimberley points through to the 1970s.<br /><br />Aiston observed a Wangkangurru stoneworker manufacture a pirri point in the 1920s near Oodnadatta.  Aiston's informant was making a pointed tool for engraving wood, rather than a dart point.  The knapper first secured the flake blank at right angles to a stick using pitch and unifacially retouched the exposed margin by percussion with a hammer stone.  Next he took the blank from the pitch, rotated it, re-embedded it into the pitch, and retouched the opposite margin.  After this, the blank was taken from the pitch again, set on a grinding stone anvil, and the distal end was unifacially pressure flaked to a sharp point using the ventral surface of ‘a worn-out scraper that has thickened up into a "bull-nose" through use’.  The combination of percussion  and pressure flaking contrasts with pirri points from the archaeological record, which were made entirely by pressure flaking.  <br /><br />(&#8239;<i>Note that it would seem that the phrase 'at right angles to a stick' may well mean longitudinally along the stick so that it is supported at all points. I believe that only by placing it in this way could the retouching be possible. I have never heard of this method (which could also have worked well used spinifex resin or similar rather than  pitch), but it is obviously a very clever way to work with small flakes. Even carefully prepared mud using clay could be used at a pinch&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)<br /><br />Aiston noted in 1924 that 'the art of making these seems to be lost among the tribes here', and that the ones he saw made did not match the expertly fashioned tools in the archaeological record.  Only one elder was able to demonstrate the pressure flaking method.  Aiston's informants requested that he give to them the ancient pirri points he found so they could re-use them as engraving tools.  The well-spaced pressure-flaking scars on many ancient pirri points suggest that a different technique was used from that observed by Aiston.<br /><br />Collected  at Salt Sea, Western Australia by L.

The first were relatively broad, flat forms, which were used to protect the bearer from projectile weapons, such as spears, throwing clubs, and boomerangs, thrown by an enemy at a distance. <br /><br />The second type were narrow, compact parrying shields,   used to ward off blows from fighting clubs and other handheld weapons during hand-to-hand combat. Originally gripped by the handle visible at the left and held with the narrow edge at the right toward the opponent, this parrying shield is adorned with a series of engraved zigzag motifs. There is virtually no historic information on the significance of the patterns on southeastern shields. However, they possibly represent emblematic designs symbolic of the owner's group affiliation or dreamings, the ancestral beings whose actions created the features of the landscape during the Dreaming (primordial creation period).<br /><br /><!-- Photo:  www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/10/oca/ho_1978.412.865.htm<br /> -->Text:  www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/10/oca/ho_1978.412.865.htm</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images43/IMG_2334club.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2334clubsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2334clubsm" width="850" height="517" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br clear = left><p>Clubs made  by the <i><b>Paakintji</b></i> were usually pointed.

Most tools at Lake Mungo are very simple, not becausethe maker lacked skill, but because the silcrete used was difficult to work with, as noted above.  <br /><br />The local silcrete is a  coarse material, rather like a                                  very hard sandstone, but  in which silica (SiO<sub><small>2</small></sub>) has enriched the rock so that it is very hard.  It is not possible to make fine tools with the local silcrete, and it is not possible to do the 'retouch' of very fine flakes which are typical for fine work in Europe. Where the First Nations people did have good silex/flint to work with, for example in the north of Australia, they made tools which are the equal of the best European tools.<br /><br />You can see in this photo the very coarse nature of the silcrete. The person responsible for the knapping of this tool was a master, working with a difficult material.<br /><br />They would have been justifiably very proud indeed of this work of art.  <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2009<br /></p><br clear = "all"><br /> <p><a href="images43/IMG_1510mungopoint.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1510mungopointsm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1510mungopointsm" width="500" height="649" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />This simple piece, what I think of as a 'point', is much more typical of the sort of tools that weremade. The tool maker had one chance to make a usable tool, and therewas little possibility of further work to refine the shape.<br /><br />It should be realised that all the stone in the area had to be broughtfrom twenty kilometres away on the western side of the lake. If youfind a stone, it was transported there 40&nbsp;000 years ago by First Nations people.There is no local stone, apart from some very small pebbles on thelake edge, of no use for tools, but which were sometimes used in themaking of a hearth.<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2009</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images43/IMG_1422fingermungo.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1422fingermungosm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1422fingermungosm" width="700" height="315" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> </p><br clear = "all"><p><a href="images43/IMG_1423finger1.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_1423finger1sm.jpg" alt = "IMG_1423finger1sm" width="700" height="314" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p><br clear = "all"><p>Two photos of the same tool. <br /><br />Many of the tools at Mungo are of this type - what I think of as a "point" or a "finger".

There are so many that they must have provided a common and useful function. <br /><br />The most likely use is to prise open the mussels which constituted a very large part of the menu when Lake Mungo was full of water.

Directions of magnetization preserved in ovenstones and baked hearths show that wide departures of up to 120 degrees from the axial dipole field direction occurred about 30&nbsp;000 years ago.<br /><br />The geomagnetic excursion of up to 120&deg; recorded between at least 30&nbsp;780&nbsp;±&nbsp;520 and 28&nbsp;140&nbsp;±&nbsp;370 years BP on the conventional radiocarbon time scale is associated with very high field strengths between 1 and 2 Oe (1 Oe ≈ 79.6 A m-1). The field strength subsequently decreased to between 0.2 and 0.3 Oe after the excursion. This main excursion is referred to as the Lake Mungo geomagnetic excursion. There is evidence that a second excursion associated with low field strengths of 0.1-0.2 Oe occurred around 26&nbsp;000 years b.p. A review of geomagnetic excursions less than 40&nbsp;000 years in age shows that it may be premature to assume that these are world-wide synchronous features. The range of ages and their groupings in different parts of the world may indicate they are temporary non-dipole features of continental extent. However, the duration of most excursions (order of 103 years) is very similar to that of polarity transitions and this could indicate they are aborted reversals.<p><a href="images43/IMG_2327hearth.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2327hearthsm.jpg" alt = " Hearth" width="600" height="370" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />Remains of an ancient oven found on the Mungo Lunette. <br /><br />The eroded remains of three varieties of fireplaces found at Mungo National Park are:<br /><br /><b>Ovens</b>: consist of cooking stones (or lumps of baked clay balls or broken termite nests) arranged on top of a thin layer of ash and charcoal in a shallow depression. <br /><br /><b>Hearths</b>: are areas of blackened earth without heat retaining stones, resulting from an open fire. <br /><br /><b>Mounds</b>: consist of baked clay heaped above layers of charcoal and ash below.

These Willandra lakes are now permanently dry, but during the LatePleistocene they contained large quantities of fresh water which attracted some of the earliestresidents. A National Park and World Heritage Area is centred on Lake Mungo, reflecting thewealth of archaeology and environmental history.<br /><br />Large-scale archaeological excavations were carried out in the early 1970s near the south endof the Mungo lunette, penetrating more than 2 metres to sterile sands.  TLdating of heated sediments from under, and heat retainers within, hearths in the Mungo lunetteoverlap with calibrated 14C dates on charcoal from the same fireplaces in the range 34 ± 3 ka. This period of human occupationcoincides with deposition of Arumpo Unit sediments although the hearths are dug intoolder units.<br /><br />The oldest 14C dates on charcoal, emu eggshell, lacustrine shell, and fish otolith at40 ± 3 ka are from locations close to a transition zone in the lunettes, where clay-rich sedimentsderived from the lake floor during times of lower, fluctuating water levels (Upper Mungo Unit)overlie quartz dominant sediments from a high lake level phase (Lower Mungo Unit). TL dateson unheated sediments are widely scattered and not consistent with the 14C record. Ongoing new work suggests that the Upper Mungo occupationhorizons are close to 44 ka.<br /><br /><p><a href="images15/sahulcoastline.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images15/sahulcoastlinesm.jpg" alt = "Sahul Coastline" width="497" height="500" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Map of the Australian region showing the extended Sahul landmass atLast Glacial Maximum (20&nbsp;000–24&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP) and 14&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP (as proxy for Marine Isotope Stage 3), modified after Smith (1998).<br /><br />Photo and caption: <span class="reference">Gillespie (2002)</span></p><br clear = "all"></p><br clear = "all"><br /><br /> <p><a href="images43/IMG_2347otoliths.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2347otolithssm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2347otolithssm" width="500" height="463" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a> <br />Each time strong winds or rain occur in the Willandra region more evidence of the past is uncovered on the lunettes. <br /><br />Some of that evidence is tiny but provides a great story.

These bands also preserve details of water chemistry at the time. So not only can we learn about lake temperatures and salinity, we can even know in which season the fish was caught. <br /><br />Rephotography: Don Hitchcock 2009<br />Source: Display, Lake Mungo NPWS interpretation centre<</p><br clear = "all"><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><hr align="center" width="50%"><br /><br /><h3>Tools and ecosystems from the lunette where the loop road crosses it at the southern end of Lake Mungo</h3>     <p><a href="images43/southernlakemungomap.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/southernlakemungomapsm.jpg" alt = "southernlakemungomapsm" width="950" height="679" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>Map of the south of Lake Mungo,  showing  where the loop road crosses the lunette at the southern end, and continues north behind and to the east of the lunette, towards the Vigars Well picnic area. <br /><br />Photo: Google Maps</p><br clear = "all"><br />  <p><a href="images43/IMG_2163topofdunes.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images43/IMG_2163topofdunessm.jpg" alt = "IMG_2163topofdunessm" width="950" height="713" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a></p> <!-- force left --><br clear = left><p>The area has been badly degraded by erosion.

There are goodexposures of this silcrete type on hilltops 11 km southwest of Armidale....  Thepronounced rounding of pebbles in these silcretes indicates possible transportin streams. Despite the usual strong silicification of these pebbly silcretes,the silica cement in many samples has weathered more rapidly than the pebblesit is binding. For this reason exposures of these cemented poorly sortedsediments often have portions of rounded pebbles standing in relief above thequartz sand matrix. </blockquote> It is also unusual to find a pebble such as this on the former lake shore, of apparently tool quality stone, but unchanged in form. It may have been collected on the western side of the former lake, transported to the eastern shore, and then kept in the toolkit as a core ready for use as necessary.

The workmen finally decided to leave behind off cuts  of wire and broken  insulators at the foot of the poles whenever they went to repair faults in the desert country, and the incidence of line faults dropped by 80% in three months, a fine example of lateral thinking. <br /><br />Text above adapted from: http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1515660.htm<br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2009</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images15/mungoIMG_2178.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images15/mungoIMG_2178sm.jpg" alt = "tool" width="243" height="200" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />This fine scraper was nearby, again made from relatively good quality white silcrete, or at least as good as was available. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2009</p><br clear = "all"><br /><p><a href="images15/mungoIMG_2179.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images15/mungoIMG_2179sm.jpg" alt = "tool" width="235" height="267" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br />This is a well-worn point, no doubt worn from opening hundreds or thousands of mussel shells.

The coolamon contains seeds in this display. <br /><br />The muller referred to on the label is the upper, hand-held grindstone, out of frame in this photo.  <br /> <br />In the semi-arid to arid regions of Australia, seed-foods were a major food staple. First Nations women made flour from a range of different plant seeds, including those of native grasses, some trees, shrubs, succulents and even ferns. The flour made from these seeds was an extremely nutritious high-energy food that was of vital importance in regions where other more easily processed plant foods were not readily available. <br /><br />First Nations women developed an intricate method of processing the seeds they gathered. Collected material was placed in a coolamon (elongated wooden dish) and skilfully rocked and flicked to separate material of different densities (such as leaves, twigs and sand) so the seeds were easily extracted. Seeds were then winnowed by being rubbed together in handfuls and dropped a short height over the coolamon to allow the fine outer husks to blow away. The seeds were then ground into a meal or flour using a millstone (lower grindstone) and muller (hand-held upper stone) set. <br /><br />Text: From the Australian Museum website, <br />http://www.amonline.net.au/snapshots/arid/bakers.htm<br /><br />Display: Lake Mungo NPWS interpretation centre<br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2005</p><br clear = "all"><br /><a name="reference"> </a> <!-- <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Glory (1961)</span></a> --><h3><span class="reference">References</span></h3><ol compact type="1" start="1">		 <li><span class="reference">  <b>Allen H.</b>, 1998.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health.

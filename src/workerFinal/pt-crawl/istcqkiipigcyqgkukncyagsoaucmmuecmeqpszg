We spend about 8 hours/day, 56 hours/week, 240 hours/month and 2,920 
hours/year doing it...that's right...SLEEPING.  We apparently spend one
third of our lives doing nothing.  But is sleep really doing nothing?  It
looks like it...our eyes are closed, our muscles are relaxed, our
breathing is regular, and we do not respond to sound or light.  If you
take a look at what is happening inside of your brain, however, you will
find quite a different situation - the brain is very active.  You are 
doing something!<p>

Scientists can record brain activity by attaching electrodes to the scalp
and then connecting these electrodes to a machine called an <font
color=red>electroencephalograph</font>.  The <font color=red>encephalogram
(or EEG)</font> is the record of brain activity recorded with this
machine.  The wavy lines of the EEG are what most people know as "brain
waves."</td></tr></table><p>

Sleep</u></h1>

Sleep follows a regular cycle each night. The EEG pattern changes in a
predictable way several times during a single period of sleep.  There are
two basic forms of sleep:  rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid REM (NREM) sleep. (<font size =
"-1">REM sleep is sometimes called "paradoxical sleep."</font>)  Infants
spend about 50% of their sleep time in NREM and 50% in REM sleep.  Adults
spend about 20% of their sleep time in REM and 80% in NREM sleep.  
Elderly people spend less than 15% of their sleep time in REM
sleep.</td>

</td><td> Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep.  During REM sleep, a
person's eyes move back and forth rapidly.  Sleep researchers discovered
this when they woke people up during REM sleep.  Often when people in REM
sleep wake up, they say that they were just dreaming.  The EEG pattern
during REM sleep is similar to the EEG pattern when people are awake.  
However, the muscle activity is very quiet during REM sleep.  Muscles are
inactive to prevent us from acting out our dreams.  This also means that
sleepwalkers are not in REM sleep and are not acting out their dreams.<P>

NREM sleep is actually 4 different stages of sleep (Stage 1, Stage 2,
Stage 3 and Stage 4) with different EEG patterns.  Stages 3 and 4 are 
sometimes called slow wave sleep.<P>

asleep, our brains are on a bit of a "roller-coaster" through 
different stages of sleep.  As we drift off to sleep, we first enter stage
1 sleep. After a few minutes, the EEG changes to stage 2 sleep, then stage
3 sleep, then stage 4 sleep.  Then it's back up again:  stage 3, stage 2,
then a period of REM sleep...then it's back down again, and back up again,
and down again...you get the picture.  As shown in the figure below, in an
8 hour period of sleep, the brain cycles through these stages about 4-5
times.<p> <center><img src= "./gif/ssleep.gif"><p></center>

As for dreaming...we enter REM sleep about 5 times in an average 8 hour

periods, then in one year, we will have had 1,825 dreams!  Of course we

<h1><u>Why Sleep?</u></h1>
Why sleep at all?  It seems like a big waste of time.  Think of all
you could be doing if you did not sleep.  Nevertheless, sleep appears
to be necessary.  There is a continuing debate about why we
sleep. Why do most animals sleep?  How much sleep is
required?<p>

Most "higher" <a href = "chasleep.html">animals appear to sleep</A> during
some portion of the day and/or night. - they are quiet;  they rest; they
do not move.<img src = "./gif/dragonf.gif" align=right> Scientists have
recorded sleep-like EEG patterns in birds, reptiles and mammals, but it is 
not clear if insects and other invertebrates also sleep.<p>

No one knows for sure why we sleep, but here are 2 basic theories:
<ol>
<li>Sleep has a <font color=red>restorative function</font>.
<li>Sleep has an <font color=red>adaptive function</font>.
</ol>

<h2>Sleep as a Restorative Process</h2>

<img src = "ideaman.gif" align=right> This theory of sleep suggests that 
sleep helps the body recover from all the work it did while an animal was 
awake.  Experiments have shown that the more physical exercise an animal 
does, the more NREM an animal will have.  Also, if people are deprived of 
NREM by waking them up each time they get to stage 4 sleep, then they 
complain of being physically tired.  If people are deprived of REM sleep 
by waking them up each time the have REM type EEG patterns, they can get 
anxious and irritable.  If animals are deprived of REM for several days 
and then allowed to get an undisturbed period of sleep, animals will go 
into "REM rebound" - this is when REM periods of sleep will happen more 
often and for a longer time than normal. Sleep has also been thought to be 
important for memory and learning.<p>

<h2>Sleep as an Adaptive Process</h2> Sleep may have developed because of
a need of animals to protect themselves.  For example, some animals search 
for food and water during the day because it is easier to see when the sun 
is out.  
When it is dark, it is best for these animals to save energy, avoid
getting eaten, and avoid falling off a cliff that they cannot see.  It is
interesting to note <a href = "chasleep.html">which animals sleep the most
and which sleep the least</a>. In general, animals that serve as food for
other animals sleep the least.<P>

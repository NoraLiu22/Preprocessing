The six colonies became Australia's six states, and have the power to make laws on a much wider range of matters. However, if a valid Commonwealth law is inconsistent with the law of a State, then the Commonwealth law overrides the State law. The Constitution also establishes the Queen as a part of the Parliament (section 1), and allows her powers to be exercised by the <a href="/help-and-resources/understanding-legislation/glossary#gg">Governor-General</a> (section 61).</p></div><!----></frl-markdown-content></section></div><div _ngcontent-ng-c2459568576="" class="row mb-5"><!----></div><!----><!----></frl-overview><!----></main><frl-footer _ngcontent-ng-c1559002980="" _nghost-ng-c1389055932=""><footer _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="footer"><div _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="container"><div _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="row py-3 py-lg-5"><div _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="col order-1 order-lg-0"><frl-zone _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" fragmentname="Footer" class="footer-text" _nghost-ng-c2683500244="" zone="Footer"><frl-html-content _ngcontent-ng-c2683500244="" _nghost-ng-c2908905192=""><div _ngcontent-ng-c2908905192="" frlcontentlinkhandler="" class="frl-content"><p>We acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of country throughout Australia and acknowledge their continuing connection to land, waters and community.</p></div><!----></frl-html-content><!----></frl-zone></div><div _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="col-lg-6 order-0 order-lg-1 mb-5 mb-lg-0 d-print-none"><ul _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="list-unstyled list-pipe-separated justify-content-center justify-content-lg-end"><li _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932=""><a _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="footer-terms-of-use hover-underline" href="/terms-of-use"> Terms of use </a></li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932=""><a _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="footer-help-and-resources/understanding-legislation/glossary hover-underline" href="/help-and-resources/understanding-legislation/glossary"> Glossary </a></li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932=""><a _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="footer-help-and-resources/using-the-legislation-register/feedback hover-underline" href="/help-and-resources/using-the-legislation-register/feedback"> Feedback </a></li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932=""><a _ngcontent-ng-c1389055932="" class="footer-sitemap hover-underline" href="/sitemap"> Sitemap </a></li><!----><!----><!----></ul></div></div></div></footer></frl-footer><frl-spinner-zone _ngcontent-ng-c1559002980="" _nghost-ng-c2857471565="" class="loading-zone-page"><!----></frl-spinner-zone></frl-root>

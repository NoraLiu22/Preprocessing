<title>What is basso continuo?</title>
</head><body>

<h2>What is basso continuo?</h2>

<p>Basso continuo (also &quot;thoroughbass,&quot; &quot;figured
bass,&quot; &quot;basse cifr&eacute;e&quot; (Fr.), &quot;generalbass&quot;
(Ger.) or &quot;continuo&quot;) is the practice of creating (called
&quot;realizing&quot; by specialists) an accompaniment from a
composed bass part by playing the bass notes and improvising harmony
above them.  The term also refers to the composed part itself.
Composers often wrote numbers (&quot;figures,&quot; hence &quot;figured
bass&quot;) on the bass part to indicate the harmony, but the rules
of continuo realization are firm enough that skilled players can
play from an unfigured bass part.  Continuo was standard practice
in <a href="../beginlst/barintro.htm">art music</a> from roughly
1600 to the later 1700s.</p>

<p>Composers typically did not specify continuo instrumentation, but
instruments commonly used included members of the lute family
(the archlute and theorbo in particular), harp, guitar,
instruments of the harpsichord and organ families, and even
bowed-string instruments such as the lirone or viol.  A common
practice is to have several different instruments realize the
continuo line (in the seventeenth century, theorbo and organ seems
to have been a favorite combination; the published score of
<a href="../cds/tld91342.htm">Monteverdi's <i>Orfeo</i></a> lists
three theorbos, two harpsichords, two organs, regal and harp).
The keyboard instruments offer facility, but not much dynamic
variation.  The other instruments offer dynamic expression, but
less agility for fast-moving parts or complex harmonies.</p>

<p>In addition to the chordal instrument(s), melody instruments
(cello, bassoon) can play the bass line, although this is not
necessary and is less common in earlier music.  The 1960s vintage
notion that continuo consists of harpsichord and cello is derived
from C.P.E. Bach's expressed preference for that combination in
chamber music in about 1762, which may be of dubious value for
music earlier than that.  In orchestral music, the chordal
instrument(s) play along with the bass section.</p>

<p>Since the art of continuo playing is not widespread except among
early music specialists, modern editions of early music typically
include a keyboard part that consists of the original continuo part
plus an editor's realization of the harmonies for the right hand.
Knowledgeable players avoid using these parts, to allow the
realization to be more spontaneous.  In addition, earlier continuo
style tends to be more contrapuntally oriented than harmonically
oriented, although this distinction can blur.</p>

<p>The origins of continuo cannot be pinpointed.  Its predecessors
could be said to include such things as songs with written-out lute
accompaniment (which likely can trace their origins in turn to
songs with improvised accompaniment) and organists assisting singers
in liturgical performances.  One common-sense notion is that any
time an instrument capable of playing harmonies joins in an ensemble,
the player will naturally fill in those harmonies.  Another source
of this practice is likely in intabulation, and the reduction of
notation which it implies.</p>

<p>In liturgical music of the late 1500s the organist sometimes
played from a &quot;basso seguente&quot; part which was a compiled
sequence of whatever the lowest note in the composed parts was at
a given point in the score.  Intermedii and operas of the time
included bass parts that were used by players of harmonic instruments,
and it is in the <a href="opera.html">earliest operas</a> that the
first figures appear.  <a href="../cds/svs33339.htm">Emilio
Cavalieri's Rappresentatione di Anima e di Corpo</a> of 1600 and
<a href="../cds/svs33387.htm">Ludovico Viadana</a>'s Cento Concerti
Ecclesiastici of 1602 both contain prefaces that explain how continuo
works and how to read the parts, making it clear that the practice
was not widely familiar to performers at that time.</p>

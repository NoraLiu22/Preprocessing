      <p><span class="speaker">Robert Oxnam ::</span> Confucius often makes reference to what are known as &quot;The Classics,&quot; a body of older literature and history compiled in his time. Confucius had great respect for the preserved wisdom of the past, and these classics became the basis for education in China.</p>
      <p>Over time this canon was augmented by the <i>Analects</i> themselves and
        the writings of Confucius' followers. The Confucian Classics formed the curriculum
        for schools in China down through the nineteenth century. In imperial China
        the most prestigious career, that of government service, was open only to
        those who passed the rigorous examinations in the Classics.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Myron Cohen ::</span> So that in this sense, you can
        say that people imbibed with Confucian thinking and Confucian learning to
        a far greater extent than the ordinary person in China were in fact the rulers
        of China. And in a sense, this matched a basic Confucian value, which said
        that those who are educated have a moral obligation to rule.</p>
      <p>So that, in that sense, you have a very powerful working out of the Confucian
        ideology via the examination system (and I'm referring to later imperial
        China), in terms of the actual ability of the state to govern.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Robert Oxnam ::</span> Familiarity with the Classics was widespread, supporting knowledge of Confucian ideals throughout Chinese society.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Myron Cohen:</span> There were several ways in which these texts were publicized, so to speak.</p>
      <p>First of all, there was the famous examination system in China, which selected both the bureaucrats for the government and also, confirmed people passing the exams at a lower level as being local leaders. In order to pass the exams, you had to have mastery of the Confucian text.</p>
      <p>Therefore, study of the Confucian text was in fact incorporated in the basic
        curriculum of all village schools throughout China. And it's been estimated
        that in the late period of traditional China, approximately 40 percent of
        males had some literacy. This means that a very large percentage of the male
        population did have one or two years of exposure to Confucian texts.</p>
      <p>Also, you had, at least in parts of China, you had traveling chanters who
        could chant Confucian texts, so that even people who were not literate at
        all had some knowledge of them. I don't think it is stretching the point
        to equate familiarity with Confucian texts with the kind of familiarity
        with the Bible that you had in the West in earlier periods.</p>

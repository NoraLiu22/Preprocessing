	</ol></li>
</ol><h3>Order of destruction</h3>

<ol start="28"><li>The order of destruction of chemical weapons production facilities is based on the obligations specified in Article I and the other Articles of this Convention, including obligations regarding systematic on-site verification. It takes into account interests of States Parties for undiminished security during the destruction period; confidence- building in the early part of the destruction stage; gradual acquisition of experience in the course of destroying chemical weapons production facilities; and applicability irrespective of the actual characteristics of the facilities and the methods chosen for their destruction.  The order of destruction is based on the principle of levelling out.</li>
	<li>A State Party shall, for each destruction period, determine which chemical weapons production facilities are to be destroyed and carry out the destruction in such a way that not more than what is specified in paragraphs 30 and 31 remains at the end of each destruction period.  A State Party is not precluded from destroying its facilities at a faster pace.</li>
	<li>The following provisions shall apply to chemical weapons production facilities that produce Schedule 1 chemicals:
	<ol type="a"><li>A State Party shall start the destruction of such facilities not later than one year after this Convention enters into force for it, and shall complete it not later than 10 years after entry into force of this Convention.  For a State which is a Party at the entry into force of this Convention, this overall period shall be divided into three separate destruction periods, namely, years 2-5, years 6-8, and years 9-10.  For States which become a Party after entry into force of this Convention, the destruction periods shall be adapted, taking into account paragraphs 28 and 29;</li>
		<li>Production capacity shall be used as the comparison factor for such facilities.  It shall be expressed in agent tonnes, taking into account the rules specified for binary chemical weapons;</li>

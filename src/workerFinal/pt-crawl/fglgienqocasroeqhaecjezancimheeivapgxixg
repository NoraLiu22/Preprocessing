/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<i>Editor Charles H. Smith's Note: In January 1885 Wallace took 
        part in a conference organized by a wealthy businessman. This paper, delivered 
        at that conference, summarized Wallace's views on the emerging concept 
        of &quot;social economy&quot; (as distinct from &quot;political economy&quot;) in a way he 
        would more fully develop in his short book <u>Bad Times</u> (<a href="S723.htm">S723</a>) 
        later that year. Original pagination indicated within double brackets.

      </p></blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we are met to consider and, if possible, 
        to solve, is to determine what practicable and just changes in our social 
        economy will tend, naturally, to bring about a more equable division of 
        wealth between capitalists and labourers, or perhaps more accurately, 
        between the actual producers of wealth and the rest of the community.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for the wealth they produce, labourers 
        receive <font color="990000">[[p. 369]]</font> wages. The higher class 
        of skilled labourers earn sufficient, when in full work, to provide fairly 
        good food and clothing for themselves and their families, but not sufficient 
        to afford them much leisure for intellectual culture and the refinements 
        of existence. But below these there is the vast class of unskilled or 
        little skilled labourers, who, even when in full work, barely earn sufficient 
        to afford them a decent animal subsistence. Both classes are subject to 
        periods of depression, when thousands and scores of thousands of willing 
        labourers are unable to obtain work, and are forced either to live upon 
        their scanty and hard-earned savings, to become paupers, or to starve. 
        To use the language of the political economists, wages ever tend to the 
        minimum necessary to support bare existence; hence the poverty and pauperism 
        of labourers.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently, in order to bring about that more 
        equal distribution of wealth we all desire, two things are necessary: 
        firstly, that the lowest kind of wages shall be raised, permanently, far 
        above the minimum at which it now always stands; and secondly, that willing 
        hands shall always find remunerative work; and this must be done, not 
        by charity, not by individual or local action, but by social rearrangements 
        which will be self-acting and self-sufficing. I firmly believe that such 
        rearrangements are not only possible but comparatively easy, for I hold 
        with Henry George, that at the back of every great social evil will be 
        found a great political wrong. Let us seek out the wrong thing, and fearlessly 
        put it right; and we shall then find that man is not so completely out 
        of harmony with the universe in which he exists that thousands must starve 
        in the midst of plenty, and that the actual producers of wealth in the 
        wealthiest country in the world must continue to live without enjoying 
        a fair and adequate share of the wealth which they create.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approaching the practical consideration of 
        this great and momentous problem we are at once confronted by a dogma 
        which has full sway over the minds of our economists and public writers, 
        and which in many cases determines legislation. This dogma is that cheapness 
        is a good thing, and is an end in itself; and that when everything or 
        almost everything, including labour, is cheap, the consumers--that is, 
        the entire population-- <font color="990000">[[p. 370]]</font> are benefited 
        all round, and that no one has any right to complain. Some of our public 
        writers refuse to go farther than this, and maintain, implicitly if not 
        explicitly, that to make things cheap is the final outcome of the science 
        of political economy.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general statement I venture to assert not 
        only that this is untrue, but that the very opposite statement would be 
        far nearer the truth. Dearness, I maintain, would be a better thing to 
        aim at than cheapness; and I believe that it may be demonstrated that, 
        in our present phase of social progress, high prices of all manufactured 
        goods, and of all the products of human labour, are absolutely essential 
        to a more equable distribution of wealth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a common opinion that a general rise of 
        wages would be of no use to the labourers, because all goods would correspondingly 
        rise in price. Mill, however, states that this is untrue, but that what 
        a general rise of wages really implies is a diminution of profits. He 
        says, 'There is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves 
        for a high cost of labour through any action on values or prices. It cannot 
        be prevented from taking its effect in low profits. If the labourers really 
        get more, that is, get the produce of more labour, a smaller percentage 
        must remain for profit. From this law of distribution, resting as it does 
        on a law of arithmetic, there is no escape. The mechanism of exchange 
        and price may hide it from us, but is quite powerless to alter it.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the wages of unskilled labour rise without 
        a proportionate rise in that of skilled labour, the labourer will get 
        the fullest benefit from the rise, because most manufactured goods, the 
        produce of skilled labour, will hardly advance at all in price; and it 
        is this increase of the wages of unskilled labour that we especially need 
        in order to abolish those excessive irregularities in the distribution 
        of wealth which now prevail among us.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common error in connection with this 
        subject is, that general high wages would so increase the cost of production 
        of all manufactures that we could no longer compete with <font color="990000">[[p. 
        371]]</font> foreign countries. But this also is a delusion. Mill says, 
        'General low wages never caused any country to undersell its rivals, nor 
        did general high wages ever hinder it from doing so.' And he proceeds 
        to demonstrate this proposition, generally accepted by political economists, 
        at considerable length.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Professor Fawcett, 
        if I remember rightly, gives a simpler and clearer demonstration of the 
        same fact by showing that it is not the absolute, but the relative cost 
        of goods that enables the merchant to exchange them advantageously with 
        foreigners. There would always be some goods that we could manufacture 
        at a lower proportionate rate than other countries, and these goods we 
        should continue to export in exchange for such products of those countries 
        as we required. And he concludes by stating the proposition that, with 
        a general rise of prices, we should continue to export the very same goods 
        in the very same quantities as we do now. The idea that our foreign trade 
        would be injured by a general rise of wages and by a corresponding, though 
        not proportionate, rise of prices, is a bugbear not recognised by the 
        teaching of political economy.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come, therefore, to the difficult problem 
        of how to cause a permanent rise of wages of all kinds, not of skilled 
        labour only, but of unskilled as well, and at the same time to provide 
        that the piteous sight of willing labourers begging for work shall cease 
        to be the ordinary occurrence it is now.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this problem we must first clearly understand 
        why it is that the wages of the great mass of unskilled labourers remain 
        at a minimum, notwithstanding the great and continuous increase of our 
        wealth and productive power. Many crudely imagine that the labourers are 
        too many, and that a decrease of their numbers is the only remedy. But 
        this is not only impracticable, but absurd. Our production of wealth per 
        head of the workers is far greater now than ever it was, yet a large proportion 
        of these workers live in want of the necessaries and comforts of life, 
        and many are in a condition of absolute penury and starvation. What we 
        want is a better distribution of the wealth that is produced. But a diminution 
        of the labourers means a diminution of the wealth produced, not <font color="990000">[[p. 
        372]]</font> necessarily a better distribution of it. If all who are now 
        compulsorily idle were at work, still more wealth would be produced; and 
        with a better distribution of this increased wealth there would be, not 
        only necessaries, but comforts, pleasures, and intellectual enjoyments 
        for all. But with our present social organisation--an organisation which 
        can only be modified very slowly, as human nature advances in knowledge 
        and morality--the most important mode of distributing wealth among labourers 
        is by means of wages, and we thus come to the very essence of our problem--the 
        cause of the inadequate wages of labour. And this cause is not difficult 
        to find. It has been clearly recognised by many economical writers, and 
        may be thus briefly enunciated:--</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages are kept down to a minimum by the competition 
        of labourers who have no resource but daily wages to save them from starvation.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it is to be well noted that it is not the 
        numbers of the labourers, but their complete dependence on their employers, 
        that is the cause of the low wages. And this dependence rises to a maximum 
        in great cities, where man is completely cut off from all access to the 
        bounties of nature, where not only are there no spontaneous fruits of 
        the earth to stand between him and starvation, but where even sufficient 
        air to breathe and water to drink are only to be had in return for hours 
        of toil. It is a suggestive fact, that, while in great cities the wages 
        of skilled labour are always higher than in the rural districts, because 
        the maximum of skill is there demanded to minister to the pleasures and 
        refinements of the wealthy, unskilled labour is often much worse paid; 
        and we find men, women, and children working long days of sixteen hours 
        for a pittance that barely saves them, and often does not save them, from 
        actual starvation. This terrible fact, which has been clearly established 
        by the recent disclosures as to the condition of the very poor in London 
        and other great cities, must, I believe, be considered to be a necessary 
        result of the existence of such huge cities under our present social and 
        political system, and therefore absolutely incurable by any of the remedies 
        usually suggested. It clearly results from the circumstance that a great 
        city consists mainly <font color="990000">[[p. 373]]</font> of an enormous 
        population of wage-earners; and where, owing to fluctuations of trade 
        from any cause whatever, the demand for labour decreases, the workers, 
        having absolutely no resource but daily wages between themselves and starvation, 
        compete for employment at any price and under any conditions. Moreover, 
        in these great cities there is no outlet for the natural increase of the 
        population, and thus year by year the mass of wage-seekers becomes greater, 
        the competition severer, and wages lower.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is a necessary consequence of the 
        increase of great cities is proved not only by reasoning, but by many 
        facts. Nowhere in the world, perhaps, do wages sink so low, estimated 
        in purchasing power, as in London; and there is evidence that they have 
        reached this apparently irreducible minimum by a series of steps parallel 
        with the increase of the population. The well-informed writer of the articles 
        on 'Poor Men's Politics' in the <em>Daily News</em>, stated his belief 
        that the earning power of the great mass of the poor of London had for 
        several years been constantly going down, often with startling rapidity. 
        He gave as instances finishing heavy trousers, which four years back were 
        paid for at 2 3/4 <em>d</em>. a pair; eighteen months back they were reduced 
        to 2 &#189; <em>d</em>., and at the time of writing they were being done at 
        2 1/4 <em>d</em>. Policemen's overcoats used to be made for 5<em>s</em>. 
        They were at time of writing being made for 2<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>. 
        Fifteen or sixteen years ago matchbox makers used to get 7 &#189; <em>d</em>. 
        a gross, and the price has since been falling year by year, till it has 
        come down to 2 1/4 <em>d</em>. In other trades, as that of turners and 
        dockyard labourers, though the daily wages are the same, or may even have 
        increased, the difficulty of finding employment has greatly increased, 
        so that large numbers of men only get two or three days' work per week. 
        And when we add to this that rents, even of the most miserable rooms, 
        have been increasing for many years, we have before us the upper and the 
        nether millstones between which the poor are ground. The question of dwellings, 
        however, to which many worthy people seem to think the whole problem is 
        limited, is a mere symptom; it is the question of work and wages that 
        is the fundamental one. As the writer already quoted well says, 'Sweep 
        away every rookery to-morrow, <font color="990000">[[p. 374]]</font> and 
        put the people into decent houses, and make them all sober and industrious, 
        and you have by that very success immensely increased the tremendous pressure 
        of competition in the labour market. It is here the difficulty lies, and 
        here it must be faced. Do all that, and we shall still go round into the 
        homes of the people and find that they are being driven to crime and suicide 
        for want of work, or else they are working fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen 
        hours a day for wages that they cannot live upon.' And yet this huge, 
        overgrown city is having added to it every year as many houses and people 
        as there are in the whole of the large town of Brighton, thus increasing 
        the vast, unmanageable mass of those who must live by daily wages or starve, 
        and tending ever to increase that fierce competition for work which is 
        the source of their miserable condition. It follows, then, that no solution 
        of our problem can be the true one which does not comprehend and deal 
        with the question of great cities--which does not afford an outlet for 
        their congested populations to the rural districts.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then turn to these districts, and see 
        what is going on there.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first we are met with the startling fact, 
        that while our towns are almost all overcrowded, our rural, and especially 
        our agricultural districts are becoming depopulated. This phenomenon is 
        so amazing, and so vitally connected with our problem, that we must examine 
        it somewhat carefully, both as to the fact itself and as to the causes 
        which lead to it.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diminution of the population of counties 
        was first observed in 1861, when two, Cambridgeshire and Rutlandshire, 
        had decreased since 1851, and Huntingdonshire and Brecknockshire had been 
        almost stationary. In 1871 <em>four counties</em> had decreased; while 
        in 1881 the decrease had extended to <em>thirteen counties.</em> Nine 
        other counties increased less than 2 per cent. each, and this increase 
        is no doubt wholly due to that of the towns. In Norfolk, for instance, 
        I find that the increase of Norwich is greater than that of the whole 
        county; and as Yarmouth and many other towns have also increased considerably, 
        the population of the rural districts must have largely diminished. Again, 
        eight more counties have increased less <font color="990000">[[p. 375]]</font> 
        than 10 per cent., and in most of these the towns will account for the 
        increase, while the purely rural districts are stationary or decreasing. 
        In Lincolnshire, for example, where the increase is 8 per cent., half 
        the divisions of the county show a decrease; so that in thirty counties--nearly 
        two-thirds of England and Wales--the population of the exclusively rural 
        districts is diminishing. Again, agricultural labourers decreased 10 per 
        cent. between 1871 and 1881. The land, too, is going out of cultivation, 
        more than a million acres less arable land being returned in 1884 than 
        in 1873. This turning of arable into pasture is a serious thing, for it 
        implies a great diminution of human food. The most eminent agriculturists 
        have estimated that only five men could live on the animal food produced 
        by 100 acres of average pasture, while no less than 250 men could live 
        on the vegetable food from 100 acres of average arable land.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
        In Ireland the deterioration is still more alarming. Mr. Sullivan states 
        that the agricultural returns show that land under crops has diminished 
        during the last twenty years by 1,200,000 acres, land under grass has 
        diminished nearly half as much, while bog and waste land have proportionally 
        increased!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one who travels about our country with 
        observant eyes will be struck by the entire absence of growth in almost 
        all the villages of the agricultural counties. The general rule is that 
        the village remains altogether stationary, and bears in its whole aspect 
        the appearance of stagnation. The houses almost all date from the last 
        century, or if newer, it can be seen from their situation and surroundings 
        that they occupy the place of some older house. These villages are often 
        delightfully picturesque, and charm the eye of the artist; but they should 
        really fill us with sadness, for they exhibit to us the very source and 
        origin of that teeming mass of wretchedness and want which pervades our 
        overcrowded cities. It may be thought that this is too great a result 
        to come from such an apparently <font color="990000">[[p. 376]]</font> 
        insignificant cause; but we must remember that there are about 10,000 
        rural parishes in England and Wales, each of which contains a village, 
        and many of them several hamlets besides, and that any agency which not 
        only keeps the populations of these places stationary, but causes them 
        actually to diminish, while the population of the whole country is rapidly 
        increasing, is fully adequate to produce the effects imputed to it.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This most abnormal and injurious state of things--the 
        compulsory diversion of the natural increase of population from the country 
        to the towns--is directly traceable to the action of the great body of 
        landowners, who have not thought it either their interest or their duty 
        to provide for, or even to permit, the natural growth of the villages 
        and hamlets of our land. That this is the one and only cause can be proved 
        by an overwhelming mass of evidence, of which I can now only adduce a 
        few examples.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. John Bright, in his speech at Rochdale, 
        on his seventieth birthday, told his hearers that the young people in 
        the rural districts were leaving their parishes in which they were born, 
        and emigrating to the large towns, in hopes of bettering their condition; 
        the reason being that '<em>our landed system cuts off the labourer almost 
        entirely from the possibility of becoming either a tenant or an owner 
        of land</em>.' For 'landed system' it would be more correct to say 'the 
        custom and will of our landowners,' for they certainly have the power 
        to let the people have land if they had the will.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr. F. G. Heath's <em>Peasant Life in the 
        West of England</em> we have the statement of a correspondent from Wiltshire: 
        'It seems to be the design of landed proprietors to have as few people 
        as possible on their estates;' while a Devonshire correspondent writes, 
        'This village at one time could boast of having wheelwrights, blacksmiths, 
        machinists' shops, and a stay factory; and numbers of waggons, carts, 
        ploughs, harrows, and other implements were made here. But all this is 
        changed now, and the work which these things represented is gone to other 
        places.' And light is thrown on the immediate cause of such changes by 
        Mr. Thomas Hardy, who knows English rural <font color="990000">[[p. 377]]</font> 
        life as well as any man living. In his article on the 'Dorsetshire Labourer,' 
        in <em>Longman's Magazine</em>, he says, 'A depopulation is going on which 
        in some quarters is really alarming. Villages used to contain, in addition 
        to the agricultural inhabitants, an interesting and better informed class, 
        ranking distinctly above these--the blacksmith, the carpenter, the shoemaker, 
        the small higgler, the shopkeeper, together with nondescript workers other 
        than farm labourers, who had remained in the houses where they were born. 
        Many of these families had been life-holders, who built at their own expense 
        the cottages they occupied, and as the lives dropped and the property 
        fell in, would have been glad to remain as tenants of the owner. But the 
        policy of all but some few philanthropic landowners is, to disapprove 
        of these petty tenants who are not in the estate's employ, and to pull 
        down each cottage as it falls in, leaving sufficient for the use of the 
        farmers' men and no more. The occupants, who formed the backbone of the 
        village life, have to seek refuge in the towns.' He then speaks of the 
        suffering this causes to people who love their native place in a way town 
        people cannot understand; and he adds this suggestive remark: 'This process, 
        which is designated by statisticians &quot;the tendency of the rural population 
        towards the large towns,&quot; is really the tendency of water to flow uphill--when 
        forced!'</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is no new process, but has been going 
        on for at least a century. Arthur Young described the operation of the 
        old Poor Law as causing, universally, 'an open war against cottages;' 
        and that this practice was not given up under the new Poor Law is proved 
        by the First Report of the Commission on Women and Children employed in 
        Agriculture (1865), which gave numerous details of parishes and estates 
        of 2,000 acres with one or two cottages only, or sometimes none at all. 
        Sir George Grey, writing in 1869, says, 'Whether the labourer shall have 
        house-room on the land he helps to till, whether the house-room he gets 
        shall be human or swinish, whether he shall have the garden ground that 
        so vastly lessens the pressure of his poverty--all this does not depend 
        upon his willingness and ability to pay a reasonable rent, but depends 
        on the use which <font color="990000">[[p. 378]]</font> others may see 
        fit to make of their &quot;right to do what they like with their own.&quot;' And 
        he goes on to state that in innumerable parishes houses are pulled down 
        till a 'model village' is produced, 'in which none but those who are needed 
        as shepherds, gardeners, or gamekeepers are allowed to live.'</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, coming down again to our own day, we have 
        Mr. William Saunders writing to the <em>Daily News</em> from Wiltshire, 
        that there are, close by him, thousands of acres of the best land in England 
        lying uncultivated, as it has lain for years, because the landlord will 
        only let it in large farms and on terms that tenants will not accept. 
        As a consequence the labourers' cottages are closed, and the former occupants 
        are in London, adding to the tremendous congestion there. (<em>D. N.</em>, 
        Oct. 29, 1883?)</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more witness I will call, the Rev. 
        Stopford Brooke, a man who left the Church and the certainty of high preferment 
        for conscience' sake, and has now devoted himself to work among the poor, 
        and who, in a remarkable sermon on December 9 last, gives us the whole 
        history of one of the units of the crowd of victims who are crushed under 
        the wheels of the Juggernaut of landlordism. He says:--</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><font size="-1">
      <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often used to meet, when I was a 
        curate at Kensington, families drifting into London along the Hammersmith 
        road. One day there came along a labourer and his wife, his son and two 
        daughters. Their family had lived for a long time on an estate in the 
        country, and managed, with the help of the common land and their labour, 
        to get on. But the time came when the common was encroached upon, and 
        their labour was not needed on the estate, and they were quietly turned 
        out of their cottage. Where should they go? Of course to London, where 
        work was thought to be plentiful. They had a little savings, and they 
        thought they could get two decent rooms to live in. But the inexorable 
        land question met them in London. They tried the decent courts for lodgings, 
        and found that two rooms would cost 10<em>s</em>. a week. Food was dear 
        and bad, water was bad, and in a short time their health suffered. Work 
        was hard to get, and its wage was so low that they were soon in debt. 
        They became more ill and more despairing with the poisonous surroundings, 
        the darkness, and the long hours of work; and they were driven forth to 
        seek a cheaper lodging. They found it in a court I knew well, a hotbed 
        of crime and nameless horrors. In this they got <font color="990000">[[p. 
        379]]</font> a single room at a cruel rent, and work was more difficult 
        for them to get now, as they came from a place of such bad repute, and 
        they fell into the hands of those who sweat the last drop out of a man, 
        and woman, and child, for wages which are the food only of despair. And 
        the darkness and the dirt, the bad food and the sickness, and the want 
        of water, were worse than before; and the crowding and the companionship 
        of the court robbed them of the last shreds of self-respect. Then the 
        drink demon seized upon them. Of course there was a public-house at both 
        ends of the court. There they fled, one and all, for shelter, and warmth, 
        and society, and forgetfulness. And they came out in deeper debt, with 
        inflamed senses and burning brains, and with an unsatisfied craving for 
        drink they would do anything to satiate. And in a few months the father 
        was in prison, the wife dying, the son a criminal, and the daughters on 
        the streets.</blockquote>
      </font> 
      
      <p>And the preacher truly adds--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiply this history 
        by half a million, and you will be beneath the truth. </font></blockquote>
      <font size="-1"></font> 
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two classes of facts I have now set briefly 
        before you--the compulsory depopulation of the country districts, and 
        the over-population of the towns, with the consequent crowded tenements, 
        competition wages, misery, starvation, and crime--we see cause and effect 
        clearly in action. And when we remember the countless attractions of a 
        rural life, and the almost invariable affection of the settled countryman 
        for his native place, we may be sure that it <em>is</em> compulsion that 
        drives men away from it. Joseph Arch tells us that the labourer's dream 
        is '<em>to secure his homestead to himself.</em>' Let us render this dream 
        a reality, and we shall, I believe, have solved the great problem we have 
        before us. And surely it is no such great thing to do--no such terrible 
        and unimaginable monstrosity--that every English working-man should be 
        able to secure a sufficient plot of his native soil on fair terms, to 
        live and work and die on!</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every one who now writes on the subject, 
        be he Tory, Whig, or Radical, admits that every labourer should have a 
        plot of land, that it would be an immense benefit to himself and to the 
        whole community; and they admit that labourers eagerly long for it, and 
        are both willing and able to pay a fair price for it; but none of them 
        ever propose any means of enabling him <font color="990000">[[p. 380]]</font> 
        to have it, much less give him a right to claim it; and not one in a thousand 
        ever rises above the idea of allotments as the one thing needful. Even 
        so late as October last, and from such a Radical as Sir Charles Dilke, 
        an increase of allotments was the only suggestion for the labourers' benefit! 
        It is necessary, therefore, to say a word or two on this matter.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allotments, I venture to say, are the very worst 
        mode of utilising land for the labourer, and from our point of view absolutely 
        useless. Can their advocates be aware that Mill, in his <em>Political 
        Economy</em>,<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> condemns them absolutely as 
        tending to keep down wages, so that, if general, they would <em>not</em> 
        benefit the labourer? But apart from this they are bad, because (1) they 
        are always too small; (2) they are almost always let at a higher rent 
        than the farmer pays for the same land, often twice, sometimes six, or 
        even ten times as much! (3) they are always let on a yearly tenure, and 
        therefore cannot be permanently improved; (4) they are always at a greater 
        or less distance from the labourer's dwelling, and he cannot therefore 
        utilise all his spare time and that of his family, or apply his house 
        sewage and refuse to them; (5) being unenclosed, he cannot keep pigs or 
        poultry on them, or even cultivate any choice crops. For these reasons 
        I consider the allotment system absolutely condemned so far as any real 
        and permanent elevation of the labourer is concerned; yet the fact that 
        even under these cruelly disadvantageous conditions they are sought after, 
        and so cultivated that a considerable profit is made from them, indicates 
        what would be the result had these men a sufficient plot of land on which 
        to live, at a fair rent and on a secure tenure. From evidence given before 
        the 'Women's and Children's Employment Commission' in 1868, it was proved 
        that cottagers obtained a return from such allotments of 16<em>l</em>. 
        an acre above the ordinary farm rent, and it was estimated that if every 
        agricultural labourer above twenty years of age possessed half-acre or 
        quarter-acre allotments, the annual value of the produce would be between 
        three and four millions of pounds. What, then, would be the value of the 
        produce if they had one or two acre plots on which to live permanently? 
        It may be safely stated <font color="990000">[[p. 381]]</font> that such 
        plots would be made to produce more than double the amount per acre of 
        the allotments; and if a labourer can cultivate in overtime a quarter 
        or half-acre allotment, often at half a mile or more from his cottage, 
        he could cultivate with greater ease an acre or even two acres of garden 
        land at his own door, since he could utilise every quarter-hour, every 
        five minutes even, of spare time, which otherwise would be wasted; he 
        would save the time and labour of walking to and from his allotment, which 
        in the aggregate must be often nearly as great as the time and labour 
        bestowed upon it; besides which, numerous half-hours and spare minutes 
        would be devoted to it by his wife and children, which under the allotment 
        system are necessarily wasted.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of what can be done, take the 
        case of the Annandale Estate in Dumfriesshire, where, as Mr. Brodrick<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> 
        tells us,--</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><font size="-1"> 
      <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leases of twenty-one years were offered 
        at ordinary farm rents to deserving labourers, carefully selected for 
        their character, who built their own cottages, at a cost to themselves 
        varying from 21<em>l</em>. to 40<em>l</em>., exclusive of labour, while 
        the landlord supplied timber, stone, &amp;c., at a cost of about 22<em>l</em>. 
        These houses were not grouped in villages, but chiefly situated along 
        roads, with plots of from two to six acres attached to each, or the addition 
        of grass for a cow. All the work for these little farms was done at by-hours 
        and by members of the family, the cottager buying roots from the farmer, 
        and producing in return milk, butter, and pork, besides rearing calves. 
        Among such peasant farmers pauperism soon ceased to exist, and many of 
        them soon bettered themselves in life. It was also particularly observed 
        that habits of marketing and the constant demands on thrift and forethought 
        brought out new virtues and powers in the wives. In fact, the moral effects 
        of the system in fostering industry, sobriety, and contentment were described 
        as no less satisfactory than its economical success.</blockquote>
      </font> 
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the same writer tells us that on several 
        estates in Cheshire it is the practice to let plots of land ranging from 
        two and a half to three and a half acres with each cottage at an ordinary 
        farm rent. This practice, which is but the revival of a custom once almost 
        universal amongst the peasantry of England, <font color="990000">[[p. 
        382]]</font> is found to be fraught with manifold advantages. The most 
        obvious of these is an abundant supply of milk for the farm labourers' 
        children, who in many districts grow up without tasting the natural diet 
        of childhood. But the habits of thrift and forethought encouraged by cowkeeping 
        and dairying, on however small a scale, constitute a moral advantage of 
        great importance. On Lord Tollemache's estate in Cheshire, where the system 
        has been long established and carefully managed, its results have been 
        eminently beneficial, and attended by none of the drawbacks so often magnified 
        into insuperable difficulties by the opponents of cottage farming.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the amount of land required and the 
        use it was put to would vary according to the soil and local circumstances. 
        Sometimes fruit would be grown, sometimes vegetables; in some cases pig-feeding 
        or poultry-keeping would be most advantageous; and that even wheat may 
        be grown by labourers better than by farmers was shown by the Rev. W. 
        C. Stubbs, in Buckinghamshire, who let out his glebe to labourers in half-acre 
        allotments, and they produced more than one and a half times as much wheat 
        as the surrounding farmers, and actually a higher average than the great 
        experimental farmer, Mr. Lawes!<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general success and great advantages of 
        occupying ownership, whether of small plots or of good-sized farms, have 
        been demonstrated by an overwhelming mass of evidence in most European 
        countries. The celebrated Arthur Young, from his personal observations, 
        deduced the now celebrated axiom, 'The magic of property turns land into 
        gold;' though, as he himself elsewhere shows, and as all economists are 
        aware, it is not 'property,' but 'secure possession,' which has the magical 
        effect. Hence Arthur Young's second axiom, 'Give a man <em>secure possession</em> 
        of a bleak rock, and he will turn it into a garden; give him a nine years' 
        lease of a garden, and he will convert it into a desert.' So that we may 
        be sure that the best examples of what peasant farms can show under a 
        few benevolent landlords, by no means come up to the effects that would 
        be produced by <em>secure occupying ownership</em>.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 383]]</font> But the 
        most important thing we have now to consider is that, along with the well-being, 
        independence, and comfort which the secure possession of a plot of land 
        gives to a labourer, a general rise of wages is sure to follow so soon 
        as the system becomes at all general. In his remarkable work, <em>Six 
        Centuries of Work and Wages</em>, Prof. Thorold Rogers states as an undisputed 
        fact that, 'in a country of small agricultural proprietors, hired labour 
        is always absolutely and relatively dearer;' and it evidently must be 
        so, for the labourer is no longer dependent, day by day and week by week, 
        on wages as his only safeguard against starvation. Not only does he at 
        once become a small capitalist, but he has the means of labouring profitably 
        for himself if equally profitable or more profitable work is not offered 
        him. For the first time in our modern era the labourer, when the land 
        is open to him, will be in a condition to make a really 'free contract' 
        with his employer. He will not, as now, be forced to accept the bare subsistence 
        wages offered him or starve; and, accordingly, wages will rise, and will 
        approach if they do not ever quite reach their natural standard--the whole 
        produce which a labourer, having free access to land, can raise from it.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, then, we have a real solution of the problem 
        before us, because not only will the possession of land benefit the labourers 
        who possess it, but, by raising the rate of wages of unskilled labour, 
        and therefore of all labour, it will benefit to an almost equal extent 
        those who do not possess it. Let us then, before pointing out the exact 
        means by which this great reform can be brought about, consider a few 
        of the objections usually brought against any measure for giving to the 
        people at large that which in individual cases is invariably beneficial 
        to themselves and to the community. Mr. Jefferies, in his amusing and 
        suggestive work, <em>Hodge and his Masters</em>, gives several examples 
        of labourers who tried to live on three or four acres of land, and who 
        almost all failed. But this was to be expected. They had too much to supplement 
        wages, too little to live on. These failures will soon right themselves 
        when men can have land in any quantities that may suit their circumstances. 
        Another labourer mentioned by Mr. Jefferies took thirty acres of <font color="990000">[[p. 
        384]]</font> land at 3<em>l</em>. an acre, for which a farmer had just 
        before paid 30<em>s</em>. an acre, and he failed! No wonder. But it is 
        not so certain that he would have failed if he had paid 30<em>s</em>., 
        and had had the land on a perpetual tenure at that rent. Then say others, 
        'If the labourer has land he will be too independent, and will not work.' 
        That objection is answered by every experiment which has yet been tried. 
        Besides, it is no objection. We want them to be independent. We want them 
        to refuse to work for starvation wages--and that is mostly what the objectors 
        mean; but for adequate wages they are and will ever be the best of workers, 
        and they will be always on the spot, attached to the land, and ready to 
        aid in its cultivation. Let us listen to another of Mr. Jefferies' sayings 
        about 'Hodge:' 'The settled agricultural labourer, of all others, has 
        the least inducement to strike or leave his work. The longer he can stay 
        in one place the better for him in many ways. His fruit-trees which he 
        planted years ago are coming to perfection, and bear sufficient fruit 
        in good years not only for food, but to bring him in a good sum of hard 
        cash. The soil of the garden, long manured and dug, is twice as fertile 
        as when he first disturbed the earth. The hedges have grown high and kept 
        off the bitter wind. In short, the place is home, and he sits under his 
        own vine and his own fig tree. It is not to his advantage to leave this 
        and go miles away.'</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this was written, remember, of a yearly 
        tenancy, with all its disadvantages and uncertainties! How much more forcibly 
        does every word of it apply when the home thus created is the man's own, 
        and he feels as secure and independent in it as the parson in his glebe 
        or the squire in his hall.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another objection is, that we want to get people 
        away from the overcrowded towns, and these people would starve if put 
        upon land in the country. But it is forgotten that the overcrowding of 
        towns is due very largely to the influx of countrymen for the last ten 
        or twenty years; and it is certain that were land now open to them in 
        their native parishes, numbers of these would return to take advantage 
        of it. And if at first only those who had saved a little money went back, 
        these would decrease the competition among those who remained, and before 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 385]]</font> many years had passed I venture 
        to say that a considerable proportion of the countrymen who have been 
        forced into towns would find their way back again to the country.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it is objected, capital is required to 
        farm on however small a scale, and how are the labourers to obtain it? 
        This is the weakest of all objections. Labour creates capital, and it 
        is certain that nothing induces the labourer to save like the prospect 
        of being thereby enabled to secure land and 'a homestead of his very own.' 
        In my opinion nothing is so likely to make peasant farming a failure as 
        any scheme to enable peasants to borrow capital with which to commence. 
        They would then begin work on a scale to which they had not been accustomed, 
        they would not have learnt by experience the innumerable economies and 
        details of management which alone make farming a success, and in many 
        cases they would soon fall hopelessly into debt. I ask for the labourer, 
        not charity or loans, but fair opportunity and equal justice. Let him 
        always begin on a small scale, with an acre of land to occupy his overtime 
        and the spare hours of his family. When this succeeds, and he has saved 
        a little capital or built a cottage, let him, if he wishes, have an acre 
        more. The few who show exceptional skill, and industry, and thrift, and 
        who save money enough to stock a small farm, of say ten or fifteen acres, 
        should be able to obtain such a farm, always paying for it the fair agricultural 
        rent, but having it on a secure--practically on a perpetual tenure.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to bring about this great system of 
        free occupying ownership, which would certainly raise wages over the whole 
        country and thus greatly diminish pauperism, while the increased production 
        of food and elevation of the labourers would do more to renovate trade 
        than any extension of foreign markets, we have only to give the labourer 
        and the public generally the benefit of that principle which the Legislature 
        always applies in the case of great industrial undertakings--viz. <font color="990000">[[p. 
        386]]</font> empower land to be taken for the purpose, whenever required, 
        at a fair valuation.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without attempting to dictate any special method 
        of doing this as being exclusively the right one, I will sketch out a 
        mode of proceeding which appears to me at once simple and practical, reducing 
        officialism to a minimum, and giving the fullest play to local authority.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After enacting that, in order that the maximum 
        amount of labour may be expended on the land, and the greatest amount 
        of produce be obtained from it, every British subject of adult age may 
        (once only) claim a portion of land for personal occupation, at a fair 
        rent and on a secure tenure; the vestry or other local authority in every 
        rural parish will be directed to appoint annually four men of knowledge 
        and integrity to act as land assessors, two of them to be chosen from 
        the class of farmers, and two from that of labourers. Any labourer or 
        other person wanting a plot of land for personal occupation shall send 
        in a form of notice (to be obtained gratis at the post office) to the 
        person then occupying the land desired to be taken, naming the assessor 
        chosen to represent him, and requesting the said occupier to name an assessor 
        as his representative, and to fix a day for them all to meet upon the 
        land in question and settle the matter. Each party will thereupon state 
        his wishes and objections, and the assessors will decide--(1) the exact 
        site of the plot of land to be allotted; (2) its quantity; (3) the annual 
        rent to be paid for it on the basis of the average rental paid for similar 
        land on the same farm or in the immediate neighbourhood; (4) the amount 
        of compensation due to the present occupier for unexhausted improvements 
        upon the plot of land in question. If the two assessors are unable to 
        agree upon any of these points, the clergyman of the parish is to act 
        as umpire, and to give a final decision, unless the vestry have appointed 
        a special umpire to act in all such cases. A fixed fee (say 10<em>s</em>. 
        each) to be paid the assessors for each award. Their decision to be inserted 
        in a reference book kept for the purpose by the umpire, and the plot to 
        be marked out on the ground and on the parish copy of Ordnance map by 
        the district surveyor. The rents of all such plots may be collected by 
        the rate-collector of the district, and <font color="990000">[[p. 387]]</font> 
        the amount, less a small percentage for collection, paid to the landowner.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain general principles would be laid down 
        for the guidance of the assessors, subject to which the greatest possible 
        freedom should be allowed in the choice of land, since no one can decide 
        the situation and quality of land most useful to a labourer or mechanic 
        so well as the man who is to occupy it and make it his home. The chief 
        limitations necessary would be, that all pieces thus allotted should be 
        ordinary agricultural land adjoining some public highway, and that they 
        should not be granted very near to an existing farmhouse or other dwelling, 
        if the occupier or owner thereof has any valid objection, and if land 
        equally suitable can be had a little further away. Any trade or occupation 
        constituting a nuisance might also be forbidden. The usual size of the 
        lots at first granted should be one acre, with a frontage to the road 
        about half, and not less than one-third the depth, but lots of two or 
        more acres up to five might be taken, if special reasons existed why such 
        lots would be more useful to the applicant. The amount assessed as compensation 
        for improvements would have to be paid before entering on the land, and 
        the rent should be collected half-yearly. The assessor's fees should be 
        paid out of the rates, on the ground that every labourer thus settled 
        on the land would be an insurance against pauperism, and in many ways 
        a benefit to the whole community. The holdings would be perpetual so long 
        as the rent was paid; and the rents would be fixed for, say, thirty-three 
        years, and then only raised if the general agricultural rent of the locality 
        had risen, and in the same proportion. The actual occupier of the land 
        would be responsible for the rent, and no subtenancy or mortgage on the 
        land would be valid, but the right of occupancy might be transferred, 
        bequeathed or sold with the house or other improvements, just as an improved 
        leasehold or copyhold may be transferred now. Under this arrangement the 
        tenant would have the most perfect security for all his improvements and 
        the full enjoyment of all the products of his labour, while the landlord 
        would have his rent amply secured and regularly paid, and would, moreover, 
        receive whatever 'unearned increment' might accrue to the land from social 
        development <font color="990000">[[p. 388]]</font> until such time as 
        this unearned increment, in the case of all land whatever, is taken by 
        the State for the benefit of those who create it, or until complete nationalisation 
        of all land is effected. On this point my own opinions are well known, 
        but the great question we are now discussing cannot wait for so vast and 
        so radical a change in public opinion as is necessary to bring it about. 
        But by the method now advocated no attack whatever is made on private 
        property in land, and no new principle is introduced. Every petty branch 
        railway, even if calculated only to put money into the pockets of promoters, 
        lawyers, engineers, and land speculators, has powers given it of compulsorily 
        taking land; and we only ask that the same power may be granted to the 
        people at large in order to bring about a more healthy and natural distribution 
        of the population, and a greater and more varied production from the soil.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is absolutely no difference of opinion 
        as to this being a good thing in itself, but no one has yet ventured to 
        point out how it may be brought about--not here and there on isolated 
        patches of charity lands, nor on estates purchased by land associations 
        for the purpose, and which, besides being miserably inadequate, would 
        almost certainly fail--but over the whole length and breadth of the country, 
        enabling every labourer to have his acre of land, and his home near to 
        his native village, or to the farm on which he labours, and affording 
        to every man who has been obliged to leave his native place the opportunity 
        of returning to it under new and happier auspices. And this can all be 
        done without taking away any man's property, or interfering with his legal 
        and equitable rights, without any loans or advances of public money, without 
        calling to our aid the obstructive powers of a single commissioner at 
        a salary of 5,000<em>l</em>. a year, or requiring the expenditure of a 
        yard of red tape, or the assistance of a single lawyer in any part of 
        the operation. Moreover, the plan would ensure its own success by its 
        selective action on the men who would benefit by it. A little money would 
        be required to pay for the improvements and to secure payment of the first 
        half-year's rent, and this would ensure that only the industrious and 
        thrifty labourers would first take land, and these would be certain to 
        convert even <font color="990000">[[p. 389]]</font> the barrenest acres 
        into fertile gardens. In order to have more land, a man must have saved 
        more money; and if it is objected that it is not the already well-to-do, 
        but the miserable and the starving that we want to get on to the land, 
        the reply is, that the only sure and permanently successful way to get 
        them there is to let those who are better off and more experienced go 
        first; for by their going the fierce competition for work will be lessened, 
        wages will rise, those who were out of work or on starvation wages will 
        find their condition improved; and having in the now bright future the 
        glad vision of a 'homestead of their own,' many will work and save until 
        they too can join their friends in the old native village, and end their 
        lives amid the scenes of their early youth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the objections often made against any 
        proposal to raise general wages is that, if better off, the poor will 
        multiply more rapidly, will thus increase competition for work, and soon 
        become as bad off as before. But there never was a more superficial or 
        a more unfounded objection than this, since the universal testimony of 
        all inquirers is, that by improving the status of the labourer, and raising 
        his standard of comfort, you increase his morality and delay the period 
        of marriage. When a 'homestead of his own' is within reach of every young 
        labourer by a few years of industry and self-denial, and when in every 
        part of the country many have attained to it, no decent country girl will 
        marry a man who has not secured it; and thus the period of marriage will 
        be put off, at first two or three, and soon, as wages and the standard 
        of comfort rise, perhaps four or five years. Now this will check the increase 
        of population in two distinct ways. By delaying the average period of 
        marriage, say, five years, the average length of each generation is increased 
        to that extent, and the time required to double the population is greatly 
        lengthened. Even, therefore, if the average productiveness of such marriages 
        remained the same, the mere later marriage-period would materially check 
        the rate of increase. But Mr. Francis Galton<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> 
        has shown, by a careful series of observations among healthy country families, 
        that a delay of the age of marriage from 17 to 22 diminishes the average 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 390]]</font> fertility of such marriages in 
        the proportion of 6 to 5. Combining these two effects together, there 
        will be a very considerable diminution of the rate of increase, an object 
        of great importance in itself, but rendered doubly important when it is 
        brought about by an increase of material well-being, and an elevation 
        at once in the social and moral status of society.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another objection will no doubt be made to these 
        proposals in the form of the time-honoured dogma--'You cannot abolish 
        poverty by Act of Parliament;' and with extreme inconsistency the fierce 
        opponents of <em>laissez-faire</em> as a general doctrine will uphold 
        it now, and ask to have the relations of the land and the people 'let 
        alone.' But I, who am an upholder of the true doctrine of <em>laissez-faire</em>, 
        am quite ready to agree that Parliament can do little or nothing by positive 
        compulsory enactments, by ordering people to do this and not to do that, 
        by limiting their freedom to work and live as they please within the limits 
        of equal freedom to others. But when an Act of Parliament is a great liberating 
        act, when it strikes the shackles from the slave and sets him free to 
        labour for himself, when it throws down the artificial and immoral barriers 
        that have long kept willing arms from labouring on their native soil, 
        when it enables the thousands who have been driven from the country to 
        the overcrowded towns to return again to the scenes of their youth, and 
        secures to every industrious labourer the possession of a fair share of 
        the wealth which he creates, such an Act is almost unlimited in its power 
        of doing good to suffering humanity.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, then, is my solution of the problem of 
        the unequal distribution of wealth that prevails among us. I have traced 
        it to its roots in the power which one part of the community is allowed 
        to possess of forbidding to all the rest the free use of their native 
        soil. This is the great political injustice which, as I anticipated would 
        be the case, is the fundamental cause of the widespread poverty in the 
        midst of our abounding wealth, and of almost all the crying evils of our 
        complex society. Like all injustice in the primary relations of man and 
        man, its evil influence is universal in its range and appalling in its 
        amount. <font color="990000">[[p. 391]]</font> It permeates our whole 
        civilisation, and so contaminates it that all the powers of nature which 
        during the past century science has enlisted in our service, have intensified, 
        rather than diminished, the sum of human labour; and have done so little 
        to improve the condition of our labourers, that one in fifteen of our 
        whole population and one in nine of the population of our capital city 
        actually die in union workhouses! And this can represent only a fraction, 
        probably a small fraction, of the pauperism in our midst!</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly to sum up: I claim for the proposal 
        now made--</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That it goes to the very root of the matter, 
        since by rendering a large number of labourers less dependent on daily 
        wages as their only means of obtaining food, it would immediately and 
        necessarily raise the standard of wages; and this is absolutely the only 
        means (except charity pure and simple) by which the labouring classes 
        may at once be enabled more fully to share in the products of industry.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It does this in the simplest conceivable 
        way, by throwing down the barriers which now prevent labour from flowing 
        over the land.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) It would enable every labourer, by industry 
        and thrift, to realise his highest aspiration--'a homestead of his own.'</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) It would largely increase the food-supply 
        of the country, especially in dairy-produce, poultry, fruit, and vegetables, 
        now to the amount of thirty-eight millions annually imported from abroad.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) It would, by a self-acting gradual process, 
        withdraw the congested populations of the towns back to the rural districts 
        from which they have so largely come; and would at the same time benefit 
        those who remained by both raising their wages and lowering their rents.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It would completely settle both the Irish 
        and the Highland land questions, by satisfying the just claims of the 
        labourers and cottiers in one country, and the crofters in the other; 
        and would open up to human industry extensive areas of both countries, 
        once cultivated, but now devoted exclusively to cattle, sheep, or game.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) It would also bring about a great moral 
        reform, since all <font color="990000">[[p. 392]]</font> experience proves 
        that the possession of land on a secure tenure is the best incentive to 
        sobriety, industry, and thrift.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) And, lastly, all this can be effected without 
        any financial operation or increased taxation, and with no greater interference 
        with landed property than is allowed to many of the speculations of capitalists 
        of far less general utility.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore confidently submit to this Conference 
        that the object we all have at heart may be best attained by taking the 
        necessary steps to instruct the working classes, and especially the two 
        and a half millions of labourers who are now enfranchised, as to the only 
        means, at once effectual and equitable, by which they may more fully share 
        in the products of industry. It will then be in their power to return 
        representatives who will give effect to their just demands, to the extent 
        and in the manner here indicated, and thus, in all probability, save our 
        country from a social revolution which may bring misery and ruin to thousands, 
        and whose end, whether for good or evil, it is impossible to foresee.</p>

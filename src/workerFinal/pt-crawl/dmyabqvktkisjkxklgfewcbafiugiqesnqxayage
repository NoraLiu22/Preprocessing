<br>
<b>Despite a daffy new theory, it's not just a guy in touch with his inner caveman 
</b><br>
BY BARBARA EHRENREICH <br>
<i>Time Magazine</i> <br>
January 31, 2000 VOL. 155 NO. 4 
<p>
It was cute the first time around: when the president lost his head over Monica's 
thong undies, that is, and the evolutionary psychologists declared that he was 
just following the innate biological urge to, tee-hee, spread his seed. Natural 
selection favors the reproductively gifted, right? But the latest daffy Darwinist 
attempt to explain male bad behavior is not quite so amusing. Rape, according 
to evolutionary theorists Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer, represents just 
another seed-spreading technique favored by natural selection. Sure it's nasty, 
brutish and short on foreplay. But it gets the job done. 
<p>
Thornhill and Palmer aren't endorsing rape, of course. In their article in the 
latest issue of the <i>Sciences</i>--which is already generating a high volume 
of buzz although their book, <i>A Natural History of Rape</i>, won't be out until 
April--they say they just want to correct the feminist fallacy that "rape is not 
about sex," it's about violence and domination. The authors argue, among other 
things, that since the majority of victims are women of childbearing age, the 
motive must be lust and the intent, however unconscious, must be to impregnate. 
Hence rape is not an act of pathology, but a venerable old strategy for procreation. 
What's "natural" isn't always nice. 
<p>
Now, there are people who reject any attempt to apply evolutionary theory to human 
behavior, and, as far as I'm concerned, they can go back to composing their annual 
letters to Santa Claus. Obviously, humans have been shaped by natural selection 
(though it's not always so obvious how). We are not the descendants of the kindest 
or wisest of hominids--only of those who managed, by cunning or luck, to produce 
a few living offspring. But is rape really an effective strategy for guys who, 
deep down in their genes, just want to be fruitful and multiply? 
<p>
There are plenty of evolutionary psychologists who would answer with a resounding 
no. They emphasize the evolutionary value of the human male's "parental investment"--his 
tendency to stick around after the act of impregnation and help out with the kids. 
Prehistoric dads may not have read many bed-time stories, but, in this account, 
they very likely brought home the occasional antelope haunch, and they almost 
certainly played a major role in defending the family from four-legged predators. 
In contrast, the rapist generally operates on a hit-and-run basis--which may be 
all right for stocking sperm banks, but is not quite so effective if the goal 
is to produce offspring who will survive in a challenging environment. The children 
of guys who raped-and-ran must have been a scrawny lot and doomed to end up on 
some leopard's lunch menu. 
<p>
There's another problem with rape--again, from a strictly Darwinian perspective. 
Even if it isn't "about violence," as feminists have claimed, it almost always 
involves violence or at least the threat thereof; otherwise it isn't rape. Thornhill 
and Palmer downplay the amount of physical violence accompanying rape, claiming 
that no more than 22% of victims suffer any "gratuitous" violence beyond that 
necessary to subdue them. But we are still talking about appalling levels of damage 
to the mother of the rapist's prospective offspring. Most rape victims suffer 
long-term emotional consequences--like depression and memory loss--that are hardly 
conducive to successful motherhood. It's a pretty dumb Darwinian specimen who 
can't plant his seed without breaking the "vessel" in the process. 
<p>
Thornhill and Palmer's insistence that the rapist isn't a psychopath, just an 
ordinary fellow who's in touch with his inner caveman, leads to some dubious prescriptions. 
They want to institute formal training for boys in how to resist their "natural" 
sexual impulses to rape. Well, sure, kids should learn that rape is wrong, along 
with all other forms of assault. But the emphasis on rape as a natural male sexual 
impulse is bound to baffle those boys--and I would like to think there are more 
than a few of them out there--whose sexual fantasies have never drifted in a rape-ward 
direction. 
<p>
As for the girls, Thornhill and Palmer want them to realize that since rape is 
really "about sex," it very much matters how they dress. But where is the evidence 
that women in mini-skirts are more likely to be raped than women in dirndls? Women 
were raped by the thousands in Bosnia, for example, and few if any of them were 
wearing bikinis or bustiers. 
<p>
Yes, rape is "about sex," in that it involves a certain sexlike act. But it's 
a pretty dismal kind of "sex" in which one person's pain, and possible permanent 
injury, is the occasion for the other one's pleasure. What most of us mean by 
sex is something mutual and participatory, loving and uplifting or at least flirty 
and fun. In fact, making the world safe for plunging necklines and thong undies 
is a goal that enlightened members of both sexes ought to be able to get behind. 
As for those guys who can't distinguish between sex and rape, I don't care whether 
they're as "natural" as granola, they don't deserve to live in the company of 
women. <br>

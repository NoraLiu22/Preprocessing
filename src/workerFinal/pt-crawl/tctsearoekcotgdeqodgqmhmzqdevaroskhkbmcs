His sheer pace also put the full-back onto the back foot and forced him into uncomfortable situations facing his own goal.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">The one time Adeyemi switched off, PSG nearly slipped in for an equaliser, but Ousmane Dembele couldn't finish. It goes to show how important his role was to Edin Terzić's gameplan.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Sancho supported his team in a more subtle way in the first half, before absolutely running the show in the second.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">His excellent dribbling and calmness in possession initially stopped opportunities for PSG to apply pressure on the break. As the game progressed, he kept the ball moving and continued to find small pockets of space, marching forwards with real confidence.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Only a poor Füllkrug miss and last-ditched Marquinhos tackle stopped him having two deserved assists. A really mature performance that highlights his improvement since returning on loan from Manchester United.</p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide2"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-10119467-2" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_02" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>Losers: PSG&#x27;s Forward Line</h2><div class="slideData">2 of 3</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="DORTMUND - Ousmane Dembele of Paris Saint Germain during the UEFA Champions League semi-final match between Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint Germain at Signal Iduna Park on May 1, 2024 in Dortmund, Germany.

On Wednesday, they might as well not have been on the pitch at times in the opening 45 minutes and couldn't take advantage of major opportunities in the second.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">To be fair to Mbappé, he showed two moments of real quality, hitting the post and playing an excellent ball to Dembele as the game wore on. But Dembele looked sloppy all night, the kind of form that saw him not score in 18 games before his recent flurry of goals.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Many questioned whether PSG would have looked so sharp against Barca if the Catalans hadn't gone down to 10 men early in the second leg. Tonight wasn't a confident reply to that and puts major pressure on Luis Enrique's men when the second leg arrives in Paris.</p></div></ol></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide3"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-10119467-3" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h2>Winner: Mats Hummels</h2><div class="slideData">3 of 3</div><ol><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><div class="atom articleLeadImage blurUp"><img alt="DORTMUND - (l-r) Bradley Barcola of Paris Saint Germain, Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund during the UEFA Champions League semi-final match between Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint Germain at Signal Iduna Park on May 1, 2024 in Dortmund, Germany.

We also saw his tremendous ability to spray passes that set his team forward at speed. We're talking outside of the boot pingers to feet.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Dortmund are arguably the least favoured side left in the competition.

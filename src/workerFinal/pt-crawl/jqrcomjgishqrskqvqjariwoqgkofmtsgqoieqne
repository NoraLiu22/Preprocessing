ORLANDO, FLORIDA--May 5,1998
<P>
On Friday, May 8, Al Krulick will officially declare his candidacy for Central Florida's <A HREF="fl08map.gif">8th Congressional District</A> seat. The announcement will take place at a press conference amid Krulick's friends and supporters in the Butler Room of The Raddison Plaza Hotel in downtown Orlando, near Lake Ivanhoe, at 12 noon.<BR>
<P>
Without a primary challenger, Krulick will automatically become the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House, running in November against Republican incumbent Bill McCollum in a rematch of their '96 race.<BR>
<P>
Krulick will speak on the issues he plans to put before the voters, including: <BR>
- declaring an end to the cold war and profligate military spending;<BR>
- a renewed call for universal, comprehensive national health insurance;<BR>
- fair treatment and economic security for the middle class and working poor;<BR>
- enhanced access to education and training for all who want to learn and earn;<BR>
- fighting for a clean and unpolluted environment;<BR>
- preserving a woman's right to choose.<BR>
<P>
Krulick will continue his fight for real, substantive campaign finance reform, an issue a clear majority of Americans want Washington to address, and one which he championed early in 1996, well ahead of the pack.<BR>
<P>
Most important, Krulick intends to challenge McCollum and the Republican majority in Congress over their endless and escalating "War on Drugs," a policy that has been, and will continue to be, an expensive and disastrous failure. Krulick will explain how this policy, born in hysteria and ignorance, on the one hand: <BR>
- tramples our Constitutional rights;<BR>
- makes "war on people," mostly the poor, young, and non-white;<BR>
- clogs our courts and fills our prisons with non-violent users;<BR>
while on the other hand: <BR>
- creates and fosters a high-profit, untaxed, murderous criminal class;<BR>
- corrupts officials and our legal system;<BR>
- diverts our law enforcement agencies;<BR>
- distorts our foreign policy.<BR>
<P>
Krulick will discuss rational alternatives to the failed policy of prohibition and imprisonment, and suggest a sound and workable way out of one of society's most pressing and seemingly intractable problems.<BR>
<P>
Krulick will vigorously attack McCollum's lackluster political record, including: <BR>
- his questionable ties to the banking industry and corporate interests;<BR>
- his continued votes in Congress against working people;<BR>
- his frightening call for a military solution in the "War on Drugs." <BR>
<P>
Finally, Krulick will call upon all 8th District Democrats, Independents, and progressive Republicans to elect a representative responsible only to the will of the voters, who will challenge the powerful Washington elites, and who will fight for sanity and compassion in our public policy for the good of our families, our district, and our country.<BR>

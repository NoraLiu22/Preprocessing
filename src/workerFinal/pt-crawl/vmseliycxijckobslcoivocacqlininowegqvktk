</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">How far is Campus East from Campus West?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>The <a href="/about-us/new-building/">Department of Computer Science</a> is located on&nbsp;Campus East.</p>
<p>Campus East is approximately a ten minutes' walk away from Campus West. Traffic-free cyclepaths, footpaths and a free and frequent bus service across the University allow students to move easily between Campus East and Campus West.</p>				
</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">What computer facilities do you have in the Department?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>Our modern, purpose-built building is home to dedicated undergraduate software and hardware laboratories, with the software labs open to students 24/7.&nbsp;The Department also has its own social learning space, The Pod, with comfortable seating and plenty of desk space with power sockets.</p>
<p>All staff and students in the Department of Computer Science have access to the University's <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/">IT Services</a>. This includes the provision of wifi connection on campus, advice on how to access services off campus, and printing, copying and scanning facilities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="courses"></a>Our courses</h2>
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">Do I need to have previously studied Computer Science?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>You do not need to have previously studied Computer Science before you join us at York. The first year lays the foundation for the study of Computer Science, and will help to bring everyone to the same level.</p>
<p>We are, however, aware that many new undergraduate students come to us having previously studied Computer Science. If this applies to you, you can rest assured that you will learn something new and we're sure you will enjoy the new challenge that this will bring!</p>
<p>To help you make the transition to university, we've put together some <a href="/undergraduate/undergraduate-preparing-to-study/">resources</a> which we hope you will find useful. These include links to free courses, tips on brushing up your skills and recommended reading.</p>				
</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">Can I transfer between courses?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>All our single-subject courses in Computer Science share a common first year, which provides you with the flexibility to transfer to another course, if you wish.</p>
<p>If you are looking to transfer from one of our Bachelors courses (BSc/BEng) to an Integrated Masters course (MEng), then we recommend that you contact the <a title="Email the admissions team" href="mailto:cs-ug-admissions@york.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Science Admissions Team</a> in the first instance. Depending on your A level grades (or international equivalent), we may advise you to wait until you have completed your first set of end-of-module assessments.</p>
<p>Transfers from our combined courses in Computer Science &amp; Mathematics (BSc / MMath) to one of our single subject courses in Computer Science (or vice versa) is not always possible, unless it is done at the very start of your first year. This is because you are likely to have missed too much teaching and it can be difficult to catch up. In these cases, we recommend that you speak to the <a title="Email the Admissions Team" href="mailto:cs-ug-admissions@york.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Science Admissions Team</a> or your supervisor in the first instance.&nbsp;</p>				
</div>
</div>	
<div class="faq">
<h3 class="q">What will my workload be like?</h3>
<div class="a clear-self">
<p>The number of hours scheduled for lectures, programming classes, laboratory periods and tutorials is between 15 and 20 hours a week. However, much of the required learning is achieved outside the scheduled timetable. This means that will be need to be self-motivated, self-disciplined and willing to learn outside your contact hours. You will be supported by your <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/progress/supervisor/">supervisor</a>, who can provide pastoral and academic guidance to support your studies.</p>

<p><a NAME="P124_16715"></a><font face="Times New Roman">The CDP first
emerged during a period of political thaw in China that some publications
referred to as a "Beijing Spring." Over a period of roughly a year, from
September 1997 to mid-November 1998, Chinese authorities relaxed official
control over intellectual debate and expression of political views. The
thaw may have been linked to the relatively trouble-free passing of three
key events: the death of Deng Xiaoping in February 1997, the return of
Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997, and the Fifteenth Party&nbsp;<a NAME="P124_17227"></a>Congress
in September 1998. None of the events had triggered social unrest or political
power struggles, despite predictions to the contrary.</font>
<p><a NAME="P126_17370"></a><font face="Times New Roman">The easing of
controls may also have been part of an attempt to create international
goodwill in advance of planned visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton in
June 1998 and U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson in
September 1998. On October 27, 1997, China signed the International Covenant
for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and hinted that the signing
of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) would
follow. Leading dissident Wei Jingsheng, sentenced to fourteen years in
prison in 1996, was released on medical parole on November 16, 1997 and
sent into exile. In this more relaxed climate, dissidents began to organize
once again.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In March 1998, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
formally announced China's decision to sign the ICCPR.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P129_18157">5</a></font></sup>
Almost immediately, veteran dissident Xu Wenli applied in Beijing to register
a human rights organization, China Human Rights Watch<i> </i>(<i>Zhongguo
renquan guancha</i>).<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P130_18402">6</a></font></sup><i>
</i>At the end of March, Mao Guoliang and Wang Donghai, two dissidents
based in the eastern province of Anhui, sent an application to the Ministry
of Justice for permission to register a newsletter called <i>China Human
Rights News (Zhongguo renquan)</i>. In the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei
province, meanwhile, Qin Yongmin, a worker and former political prisoner,
set up a human rights fax-letter called<i> Human Rights Watch</i> (<i>Renquan
guancha</i>). It issued eighty-six reports before authorities stopped it
in May 1998 as part of the yearly tightening of control before the June
4 anniversary of the 1989 massacre in Beijing.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P131_19351">7</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Throughout this period, dissidents sent
petitions to the central government in Beijing, and open letters to U.S.
President Clinton and U.N. High Commissioner Mary Robinson, asking for
international attention to China's human rights situation. At the same
time, Beijing's intellectuals discussed political change more and more
openly. The government also allowed the publication of books such as <i>Zhengzhi
zhongguo</i> (<i>Political China</i>), an appeal for political reform by
thirty-four authors. These included veteran party cadres such as Li Rui,
a former secretary of Mao Zedong; Li Shenzhi, a former secretary of Zhou
Enlai; and Zhu Houze, a former director of the Chinese Communist Party's
propaganda department.</font>
<p><a NAME="P135_20188"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Founding
Of The CDP</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Concrete ideas for creating an opposition
party originated in late 1997.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P137_20283">8</a></font></sup>
Wang Youcai, a former student activist who had been jailed for two years
for involvement in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, discussed the formation
of an opposition party with a group of other dissidents.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P138_20647">9</a></font></sup>
The idea had come to him while he was still in prison, but it was not until
well after his release that he acted upon it. Initially, he proposed to
create a party called the "China Justice Party" (<i>Zhongguo zhengyi dang</i>),
but then changed the name to "China Democracy Party" (<i>Zhongguo mains
dang</i>) because, he believed, people would be more familiar with the
term "democracy" than "justice."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P139_21254">10</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Chinese dissidents abroad took a close
interest in the establishment of the CDP. Some had already had the same
idea. For example, before the CDP's creation, Wang Bingzhang, a dissident
living in the U.S. who had been active during the Democracy Wall period,
slipped into China on January 26, 1998. He planned to form an opposition
party and distribute a manual for democracy activists, but he was detained
on February 6, 1998 in Bengbu, Anhui province, and sent back to the U.S.
three days later. Several of the dissidents he met during his visit were
briefly detained, including Wang Donghai, Yang Qinheng, Zhang Rujun and
Zhang Yuxiang. All later became active in the CDP, perhaps reinforcing
the authorities' conviction that "foreign hostile forces" were involved
in the organization.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The CDP was to be based on the principles
of "openness" (<i>gongkai</i>), "peace" (<i>heping</i>), "reason" (<i>lixing</i>),
and "legality" (<i>an falu</i>). Its aim was to establish direct elections
and the formation of a multiparty system. In early 1998, its founders decided
that their general strategy would be to form local preparatory committees
to test the response to this by local government authorities. The preparatory
committees would be in close contact with each other. In any province where
there were enough members to form a group, an application would be made
to the local civil affairs bureau to register it as a preparatory committee
of the CDP. Since no formal procedures existed to provide for new political
parties to apply for legal status, CDP members chose the civil affairs
option on the grounds that this appeared most closely to approximate a
system for lawful registration. Once preparatory committees had been established
in a number of provinces, a national preparatory committee would be formed.
Meanwhile, individual pro-democracy activists who did not belong to local
preparatory committees would be able to join the national committee. That
committee role would pave the way for the formation of a national opposition
party which would engage directly in politics, including by putting up
candidates for the National People's Congress.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P144_23539">11</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Early meetings of the CDP were kept secret.
On the eve of the Clinton visit, however, members of the Hangzhou Preparatory
Committee, led by Wang Youcai, decided to go public, believing that the
Chinese government would not act against them while the visit was taking
place.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P147_23979">12</a></font></sup> On June
25, 1998, therefore, they signed the "Open Declaration of the Establishment
of the CDP Zhejiang Preparatory Committee" and circulated it over the Internet.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P148_24208">13</a></font></sup>
This was the group's founding document. They also published a draft party
constitution. On the same day, they requested the Zhejiang Province Civil
Affairs Bureau (<i>Zhejiang sheng minzhengting</i>) to approve the party's
application for formal legal status for the preparatory committee. It was
the first time that dissidents had tried to register a committee that intended
to work towards the formation of an opposition party in the People's Republic
of China.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The "Open Declaration" declared that:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">all political power can come only
from the public and can only be [used] in the service of the public; a
government can only come into being according to the wishes of the public
and [can only] act according to the wishes of the public; a government
is the servant of the public and not the one which controls it.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P153_25135">14</a></font></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">It went on to criticize the ruling party for
not allowing the existence of opposing groups:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The CDP forcefully condemns the
behavior of ruling groups which suppress political opposition groups by
force; forcefully condemns the application of methods such as torture and
reform-through-labor against those who carry differing political views;
and forcefully demands the authorities release all persons detained for
differing political views. <sup><font size=-1><a href="#P158_25842">15</a></font></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The declaration also openly asserted that
political power obtained through the use of "violence and violent intimidation"
was "illegal without exception."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P161_26003">16</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As other preparatory committees were formed,
the same basic text was used, though with local modifications as members
saw fit.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P164_26136">17</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Lacking a secure communication system and
without the funds to invite potential members to assemble at one place,
the founding members called upon dissidents nationwide to take action themselves:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The CDP calls upon persons of
the democracy movement in the various regions nationwide to enter the CDP,
to prepare and establish local committees of the CDP in the various provinces
and cities, to elect and appoint delegates, to take part in the National
Delegates Congress and to organize a nationwide committee.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P169_27348">18</a></font></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">After the CDP was formally launched in Hangzhou,
Wu Yilong, one of the founding members and author of its "Guidelines for
Activities," made a sixteen-day nationwide tour and was instrumental in
the formation of other local preparatory committees. He did not contact
potential members by telephone for fear that their phones were bugged,
and he did not sleep in hotels to avoid registering his name, as hotel
registers are routinely checked by officials.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P172_27969">19</a></font></sup>
By December 1998, his efforts had contributed to the formation of some
twenty-four provincial preparatory committees. The party also had some
200 individual members whose telephone numbers and addresses were posted
on Internet websites.</font>
<p><a NAME="P174_28270"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">Efforts to
Register the Party</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">The authorities took their first action
against the CDP on July 10, 1998, shortly after President Clinton left
China. They detained Wang Youcai, who had invited dissidents to attend
a "tea party" in Hangzhou to discuss strategy, and fourteen others. On
August 7, Wang was officially arrested and charged with "inciting to overthrow
state political power."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P176_28654">20</a></font></sup>
In an unusual move, however, the government released him on August 31,
apparently into a form of house arrest known as residential surveillance.
The Chinese authorities rarely release indicted suspects from detention;
his "release" was seen as a breakthrough brought about by international
pressure and open letters and petitions from dissidents within China. CDP
members then decided that the time was ripe for another preparatory committee
to go public.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Accordingly, on September 10, 1998, Xie
Wanjun and Liu Lianjun, two CDP members in Shandong province, went to the
Office for Social Groups under the Shandong provincial Civil Affairs Bureau
and sought to register the CDP Shandong Province Preparatory Committee.
Xie and Liu saw this action as a means of showing authorities that the
committee had been established, and to make clear that they intended to
proceed openly and legally.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P179_29695">21</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Two deputy directors and a clerk received
them and read from what the CDP activists said looked like a prepared statement.
The statement said:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">[T]he central government is considering
the establishment of the China Democracy Party, but there are four conditions:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. There must be a registered capital of
RMB50,000 [approximately U.S.$6,098].</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">2. An office space carrying the name of
China Democracy Party must be applied for in written form.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">3. Resumes of the chairperson, vice chairperson,
and secretary must be submitted.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">4. A list of fifty members of the China
Democracy Party must be submitted.<sup><font size=-1> <a href="#P189_30615">22</a></font></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The officials added that the registration
of the party must be "according to the Regulations Concerning the Registration
and Administration of Social Groups." Therefore, approval should be sought
first from the <i>danwei</i> or work unit, the basic building block of
the Chinese administrative structure. But with this case, the officials
said, as the "China Democratic Party" was a fully independent group, it
presented a "new situation," and it would have to be solved according to
"new considerations." They made no effort to clarify what these might be,
but added that the registration procedures should all proceed "according
to the law."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P192_31395">23</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">CDP members in Shandong took it as a good
sign that local authorities had received, but not immediately rejected,
their application. Encouraged, CDP members in Hubei province tried to register.
Chen Zhonghe, Lu Xinhua, and Ren Qiuguang, representing the seven-member
preparatory committee, were received by officials of the Hubei Provincial
Civil Affairs Bureau and were given the same explanation that their Shandong
colleagues had received the day before.<font size=-1><sup><a href="#P195_32028">24</a></sup>
</font>The next day, however, a Beijing official from the Ministry of Civil
Affairs said during a press conference for international media that provincial
bureaus of civil affairs had no authority to permit the establishment of
political parties.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P196_32282">25</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After that, local authorities became more
careful and refused even to consider registering groups that they perceived
as politically problematic. For example, when two CDP members, An Fuxing
and Leng Wanbao, tried to register a group unrelated to the CDP with the
Jilin provincial Civil Affairs Bureau in mid-September, they were turned
away. The group, called the Economic and Social Rights Promotion Association
(<i>Jingji shehui quanli cujinhui</i>), was set up to monitor China's compliance
with the International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<font size=-1><sup><a href="#P199_32894">26</a></sup>
</font>An official told the two CDP members that the National People's
Congress was revising the "Regulations Concerning the Registration and
Administration of Social Groups" to bring them into conformity with the
ICESCR, so their application to register the new group<i> </i>could not
proceed.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P200_33271">27</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">CDP members then decided on another tactic.
On September 13, activists from Jilin and two other northeastern provinces,
Heilongjiang and Liaoning, announced that they had established a Northeast
Preparatory Committee of the CDP and that, as it involved more than one
province, they would seek official registration directly from the Ministry
of Civil Affairs in Beijing. They sent the application by mail. With Wang
Wenjiang, a lawyer based in Anshan, Liaoning province, acting as the committee's
representative, they invoked both the PRC constitution and the new Regulations
Concerning the Registration and Management of Social Groups in support
of their application.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P203_35703">28</a></font></sup></font>
<p><a NAME="P205_35884"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Screws
are Tightened</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">After these first attempts, the authorities
became less tolerant. On September 16, five well-known dissidents in Beijing
-- Ren Wanding, Ma Shaohua, Zhao Xin, Yang Qing, and Wang Linhai -- all
veterans of the pro-democracy movement, established the CDP Beijing Preparatory
Committee.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P207_36192">29</a> </font></sup>They
planned to try to register the party officially with the Civil Affairs
Bureau on September 18, but on the evening of September 16 two of them,
Ma Shaohua and Wang Linhai, were called to a local police station and interrogated
for up to three hours. Meanwhile, the home of Zhao Xin, who was out of
town, was ransacked. The next day, police told Ren Wanding to give up his
plans to register the party. "We're still under the Communist Party's leadership,"
they said. "Setting up political parties is not permitted."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P208_37447">30</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">On September 18, the Shanghai branch submitted
its petition for registration. Signed by Han Lifa, Zhou Jianhe, Xu Hong,
Yao Zhenxian and Li Guotao,<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P211_37690">31</a></font></sup>
the petition was delivered to the Beijing municipal Civil Affairs Bureau
by Han Lifa. As the relevant officials were in a meeting, he left it with
a note attached. At the same time, the Shanghai group sent the petition
through the post. It was sent back.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P212_38699">32</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The day after Han delivered the petition,
police came to Zhou Jianhe's house. He told Human Rights Watch:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Around 8:00, or 9:00 in the evening, police
came looking for the five signatories, that is how important they considered
the matter. So many people came to [the] house that they couldn't all fit
in. Two were from the Civil Affairs Bureau. They introduced themselves.
They were very polite and explained their jobs. They said that the registration
submitted had been received, that as those responsible for registration
they had to inform [the signatories] that the application was not accepted,
not approved, and that it was thereby returned. The officials of the Civil
Affairs Bureau then left, but the police stayed behind and told the activists,
"You can't go on like this - we'll take you in. This is a directive from
above. This is political activity, political thought."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P217_39642">33</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Police also told Han Lifa, who was questioned
separately, that he and his colleagues would be held "fully responsible
if anything else happened," and that they would not agree to register the
CDP even if its members "made a hundred applications."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P220_39897">34</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of September, police in Changchun,
capital of Jilin province, issued a warning to the CDP Northeast Preparatory
Committee, saying the committee was "an illegal organization (<i>feifa
zuzhi</i>)." Tang Yuanjuan, a prominent dissident and CDP member who had
just been released from imprisonment, was again detained on September 18,
although it was not clear whether this was because of his CDP affiliation
or because of his activities to promote labor rights. His detention, however,
underscored the fact that many CDP members were engaged in a variety of
dissident actions, some of them outside the scope of the CDP itself.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The five preparatory committees that had
tried to register -- Zhejiang, Shandong, Hubei, Northeast and Shanghai
-- issued an open statement on September 23 to protest against the term
"illegal organization" used by the Changchun police and against the detention
of Tang Yuanjuan.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P225_40900">35</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">On September 24, 1998, Liu Lianjun, one
of the founders of the CDP Shandong province preparatory committee, was
detained, thirteen days after he and his colleagues had attempted to register.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P228_41191">36</a></font></sup>
He described a discussion on the definition of "political party" he had
with the police:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">"[T]he police said, "A political
party is not a social group."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"No?" I asked. "The definition of a social
group includes political parties."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">They said, "That is the broad meaning.
The narrow meaning is that a political party is not a social group."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I said, "In a narrow meaning, a political
party is also a social group."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">They said, "Then our understanding is not
the same." [...]</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I said, "If it is not possible to establish
a political party according to the current Law of [Social]Groups, I can
only conclude that the Law on [Social] Groups has problems."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P241_41924">37</a></font></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">On October 5, 1998, China signed the International
Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. Marking the occasion, Qin Huasun,
China's permanent representative to the United Nations, said that "to realize
human rights is the ideal of all humanity. It is also a goal that the Chinese
government has long been striving for."<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P244_42460">38</a>
</font></sup>Ten days later, the CDP's Sichuan Preparatory Committee, led
by Liu Xianbin, She Wanbao, and Huang Xiaomin, attempted to register at
the Sichuan Provincial Civil Affairs Bureau's Office for Registration of
Social Groups. The application was refused on the grounds that a political
party was not within the scope of social groups. "The Sichuan provincial
Civil Affairs Bureau only accepts registration by social groups involved
in arts and sports," they were told.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P245_42975">39</a></font></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The last two CDP preparatory committees
to attempt to register with the authorities were in Guizhou and Henan provinces.
On October 21, 1998, Zeng Ning and Wei Dengzhong submitted an application
to the Guizhou Civil Affairs Bureau's Office for Registration of Social
Groups, declaring that the committee "recognizes the position of Jiang
Zemin as head of state" and was willing to cooperate with any political
parties and social groups in China.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P248_43531">40</a></font></sup>
On October 24, Cui Weimin, Wang Bing, An Ning, Li Zongshang, and Liu Shangguang
mailed the registration of the CDP Henan provincial preparatory committee
to the authorities. There was no immediate reaction.<sup><font size=-1><a href="#P249_44067">41</a></font></sup>

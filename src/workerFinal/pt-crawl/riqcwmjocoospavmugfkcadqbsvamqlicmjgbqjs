<b>Hominids or Hominins?<br /><br />

The most commonly used recent definitions are:<br /><br />

Hominid – the group consisting of all modern and extinct Great Apes (that is, modern humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans plus all their immediate ancestors).<br /><br />

Hominin – the group consisting of modern humans, extinct human species and all our immediate ancestors (including members of the genera Homo, Australopithecus, Paranthropus and Ardipithecus).<br /><br /></b>

We have evolved over millions of years, through a slow and complex process of change. The fossil record shows that the human family tree is made up of many ancient relatives, and that ape-like ancestors evolved into us. <br /><br />
This wall shows the ancient relatives we know about so far, and when they lived. These species evolved after our human branch split from the line that led to the chimpanzee and the bonobo. This split is estimated to have happened about seven million years ago. <br /><br />

<i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i><br /><br />
All fossils of this species have been recovered from Toros-Menalla in the Djurab desert of Chad, Africa.<br /><br />
Age has been established as 7&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP&nbsp;-&nbsp;6&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP. This is a key date, as it is about the time that scientists believe the human line diverged from the ape line. The site lacked volcanic ash layers so was not suited to using radiometric dating techniques. Faunal analysis was used instead. This was possible because many of the fossil animals found at the site were identical to specimens that had been radiometrically dated elsewhere.
 <br /><br /> 
 Dimensions: 183 x 105 x 97 mm.<br /><br />
 Discovered in 2001 by Alain Beauvilain, Fanone Gongdibe, Mahamat Adoum and Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye, the original is now located at 	Musée National N'Djamena, N'Djamena (Chad), BEAC.<br /><br />

This may be the earliest hominin. <br /><br />

This species probably lived close to the time human ancestors and the ancestors of other apes split on the family tree. Like us, it has small canines and a flat face. However, it had a thick brow ridge and a small brain, more like a chimpanzee. <br /><br />

4&nbsp;400&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP&nbsp;-&nbsp;4&nbsp;200&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP<br /><br />

Hundreds of pieces of fossilised bone were recovered during 1992-1994, by a team led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie, all from localities west of the Awash River, in Aramis, Ethiopia. The finds number over 110 specimens and represent about 35 individual members of this species. Most of the remains are dental, but some skull and limb bones were also found. A partial humerus (arm bone) indicates that this species was smaller than the average <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>.<br /><br />

In 2005, the remains of 9 individuals were recovered from As Duma in northern Ethiopia. The remains mostly consist of teeth and jaw fragments, but also some bones from the hands and feet.

ARA-VP-6/1 teeth: This is the holotype for this species. It consists of teeth and jaw bone and was found in Aramis in 1993.<br /><br />
'Ardi' ARA-VP-6/500: A partial skeleton found in 1994, consisting of about 125 pieces, was described and published in 2009. It is the oldest known skeleton of a human ancestor. The individual is believed to be a female and is nicknamed 'Ardi'. She weighed about 50kg and stood about 120cm tall.The skeleton was in extremely poor condition and it took the team 15 years to excavate, scan, make virtual reconstructions, assemble and then analyse. The results were hugely significant in terms of how we view the evolution of the earliest hominins and the physical appearance of the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The skeleton does not look much like a chimp or gorilla or have the expected 'transitional' features. Instead, it may well preserve some of the characteristics of the last chimp-human ancestor. Analysis of the skeleton reveals that humans did not evolve from knuckle-walking apes, as was long believed.

The oldest hominin skeleton<br /><br />

Scientists have found examples of almost every part of the skeleton of this small-brained species. Aspects of the pelvis and feet suggest that they could stand upright, but also climb. Uniquely shaped hands supported their body weight on their palms as the clambered through the trees, probably in woodland. <br /><br />

3&nbsp;800&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP<br /><br />
About 3.8 million years ago, a distant human relative took his final steps. Swept into a river delta, his head was buried in sand that, over time, hardened into a stone helmet. The skull fossilised within the sandstone, to the delight of the scientists who discovered the cranium in 2016.<br /><br />
Excavations at Woranso-Mille in Ethiopia, the site of an ancient river and lake system where anthropologists found the fossil, have produced a trove of bones from ancient primates. Yet this skull is 'one of the most significant specimens we've found so far' Yohannes Haile-Selassie, an anthropologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and a member of the international team that studied the remains, told reporters on Tuesday.
</p><br clear = "all"><p>
	
The first piece of MRD, the upper jaw, was found by Ali Bereino (a local Afar worker) on February 10, 2016, at a locality known as Miro Dora, Mille District of the Afar Regional State. The specimen was exposed on the surface, and further investigation of the area resulted in the recovery of the rest of the cranium. 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I spotted the rest of the cranium. It was a eureka moment and a dream come true,' said Haile-Selassie.<br /><br />	
The skull, probably a male's, is from a species called <i>Australopithecus anamensis</i>, as Haile-Selassie and his colleagues report in a pair of papers published Wednesday in the journal Nature. When compared with other ancient bones, the cranium could change how anthropologists view a critical point in the evolution of humanlike primates.<br /><br />
The primates sported a mixture of traits both primitive and humanlike. The species almost certainly walked on two legs, yet they had long arms and strong hands, suggesting they were capable climbers. The fossil  is now at the National Museum in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

KNM-KP 29281 is an adult mandible that includes all teeth, but lacks the rami. The teeth show canines that have long and very robust roots, and thick molar enamel. This specimen reflects similarities to older fossil specimens from Laetoli in the size of the canines, as well as the flare of the molars and the vertically implanted maxillary canines.

<i>Australopithecus anamensis</i>,  KNM-KP 29285<br /><br />
<!--https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/knm-kp-29285  http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/hominidfossils/items/show/42 -->

This 4.1 million year old upper tibia (shin bone) fossil, KNM-KP 29285, comes from <i>Australopithecus anamensis</i>, an early human species that lived near open areas and dense woods. Their bodies had evolved in ways that enabled them to walk upright most of the time while still being able to climb trees. As a result, they could take advantage of both habitats. The top part of the tibia (where the lower leg meets the knee) is concave, or depressed from stress. This shows that the individual often put weight on the bone—evidence of standing upright. The lower part of the tibia (where the lower leg meets the ankle) is wider or thicker—evidence that it acted as a type of shock absorber as this individual walked .
<br /><br />
This specimen, which consists of the proximal and distal ends of a right tibia, provides the earliest evidence for bipedalism in <i>Australopithecus anamensis</i>. The proximal condyles, which articulate with the distal end of the femur, are concaved like the condyles seen in anatomically modern Homo sapiens. Additionally, similar to modern humans, the proximal tibia is wider near the knee joint to allow the deposit of extra spongy bone, which acts as a shock absorber during bipedal locomotion. This extra deposit of spongy bone can also be seen in the medial malleolus, which articulates with the ankle.
<br /><br />
Overall, the partial tiba is more human-like than it is ape-like. The fact that the shock-absorbing mechanisms in Au. anamensis so closely mirror the same mechanisms seen in modern humans is what led Leakey, Kimeu, and other paloeanthropologists to believe that this species was a habitual biped.

3&nbsp;500&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP&nbsp;-&nbsp;3&nbsp;200&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP<br /><br />
Discovered at Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1999 by Justus Erus, who was part of Meave Leakey's team.<br /><br />

Leakey   proposes that the fossil represents an entirely new hominin species and genus, while others classify it as a species of Australopithecus, Australopithecus platyops, others as a species of Homo, Homo platyops, and yet others interpret it as an individual of Australopithecus afarensis.<br /><br />

Fragments of a skull (KNM-WT 40000) and teeth were found in 1999 and reconstructed. Another specimen tentatively classified into this species is a partial left upper jaw (KNM-WT 38350), which  was discovered in 1998.
</p><br clear = "all"><p>

The finders believe the skull shares similarities with a later species, <i>Homo rudolfensis</i>, including the relatively flat face and the lack of a depression behind the brow ridge, indicating it may be an ancestor of <i>Homo</i>. If this analysis is correct then it challenges the place of <i>Australopithecus</i> as a direct human ancestor. However, the acceptance of this new species is unresolved. Many experts argue that this skull was extremely distorted and has been badly reconstructed. They claim it is a Kenyan variant of <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>.
<br /><br />
More material needs to be recovered, especially a skull with no apparent distortion, in order to resolve this debate.

A.L. 442-2, Cranium, facsimile, Hadar, Ethiopia<br /><br />

This skull of a male is much bigger than the skull of Lucy and other females of this species, indicating that there was sexual dimorphism in this hominin. 
<br /><br />

This species is one of the best known of our ancestors due to a number of major discoveries including a set of fossil footprints and a fairly complete fossil skeleton of a female nicknamed 'Lucy'.
<br /><br />
During the 1970s, two fossil hunting teams began uncovering evidence of ancient human ancestors in east Africa. One team, co-led by Donald Johanson, was working at Hadar in Ethiopia. The other team led by Mary Leakey, was over 1&nbsp;500 kilometres away at Laetoli in Tanzania. Fossils discovered at the two sites were found to have very similar features and ages but they did not match the fossils of any species known at that time. A new species name, <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>, was therefore created for them in 1978. This species is now represented by several hundred fossils from east Africa.

<i>Australopithecus bahrelghazali</i>  is the only Australopithecus found outside East Africa. Found at Koro-Toro,  It is named after the Bahr-el-Ghazal oasis in Chad. Dated circa 3&nbsp;500&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP.<br /><br />

<i>Australopithecus bahrelghazali</i> is an extinct species of australopithecine discovered in 1995 at Koro-Toro, Bahr el Gazel, Chad, existing around 3.5 million years ago in the Pliocene. It is the first and only australopithecine known from Central Africa, and demonstrates that this group was widely distributed across Africa as opposed to being restricted to East and southern Africa as previously thought.  <br /> <br />

<b>The validity of <i>Australopithecus bahrelghazali</i> has not been widely accepted, in favour of classifying the specimens as  <i>Australopithecus  afarensis</i></b>.<br /><br />

 <i>Australopithecus  afarensis</i> is a better known Pliocene australopithecine from East Africa, and the doubts over naming are because of the anatomical similarity and the fact that <i>Australopithecus bahrelghazali</i> is known only from 3 partial jawbones and an isolated premolar.<br /> <br />

 The Australopithecine, KT-12/H1, but known as 'Abel',  inhabited a lakeside grassland environment with sparse tree cover, possibly similar to the modern Okavango Delta, and similarly predominantly ate C4 savanna foods—such as grasses, sedges, storage organs, or rhizomes—and to a lesser degree also C3 forest foods—such as fruits, flowers, pods, or insects. However, the teeth seem ill-equipped to process C4 plants, so its true diet is unclear.<br /> <br />

The jaw fragment was found at the edge of a shallow gully exposing a mixture of coarse sand, gravel and small fragments of ironstone. The ground surface at the site is constituted of 5 cm of detrital deposits washed down slope by flowing water and then subjected to the action of wind. At KT 12, the slope of the land and the occurrence of violent rain storms at irregular intervals result in severe fluvial erosion.

<i>Australopithecus bahrelghazali</i> ('Abel) discovered at KT12 by Mamelbaye Tomalta, January 23, 1995 (Alain Beauvilain, photographs of January 26, 1995, after the original, reserved rights), dated around 3.5 million years.
<br /><br />
The dark brown color of teeth is due to the minerals present in the geological layer that stained the  enamel during fossilisation.
<br /><br />

	
The size of canine, barely longer than the adjacent teeth, and the absence of diastema (space existing in all monkeys between canines and bicuspids for receiving the protruding portion of the opposite canine) are the criteria for humanisation. The incisor of quasi-human form and the profile of the mandibular symphysis is almost vertical, as is the chin in humans, indicating a relatively flat surface. On the other hand, the presence of three roots of the premolars (one in man today, sometimes two, rarely three) is rather a primitive character.
<br /><br />The wear facets of teeth indicate permanent teeth of a young adult. The horizontal stripes visible on the base of the teeth are dysplasias due to a defect in the mineralization of enamel during the growth of the teeth due to a dietary deficiency or disease. Abel would have had such problems at least twice as evidenced by the two canine dysplasia. Given the context, Abel may have had hunger during droughts, causing  dietary deficiencies and thus defects in the enamel. 

 
<br /><br />
X-rays revealed a thick enamel, human in nature, while in monkeys, it is thinner.

The Taung Child is  a partial skull and brain endocast discovered in 1924 in Taung, South Africa by Raymond Dart. This 2.3 million-year-old skull of a young child is the 'type specimen' or official representative of this species. It was the first fossil of a human ancestor ever found in Africa and was also the first to be classified in the genus <i>Australopithecus</i>. We know this individual was a young child because its first molar teeth were in the process of erupting from the jaw.

Humans' distant ancestor <i>Australopithecus africanus</i> had a unique approach to raising their young, as shown in new research published  in Nature.<br /><br />

Geochemical analysis of four teeth shows they exclusively breastfed infants for about 6-9 months, before supplementing breast milk with varying amounts of solid food until they were 5-6 years old. The balance between milk and solid food in this period varied cyclically, probably in response to seasonal changes in food availability.
<br /><br />
This knowledge is useful on several fronts. From an evolutionary point of view, it helps us understand the particular biological and behavioural adaptations of Australopithecus africanus compared to other extinct human ancestors and modern humans.
<br /><br />
However, breastfeeding for up to 5-6 years is metabolically expensive – it requires a certain input of calories for the lactating mother. Using milk as a supplemental food for older offspring may have hampered the ability of the <i>A. africanus</i> species to successfully survive during a period of substantially changing climate.
<br /><br />
Perhaps this way of life hastened the extinction of <i>A. africanus</i> around 2 million years ago.

<i>Australopithecus garhi</i><br /><br />

Circa 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP<br /><br />

The type specimen (BOU-VP-12/130) is a partial cranium discovered in 1997 by Yohannes Haile-Selassie in Bouri, Ethiopia. A second cranium, lower jaws and a partial skeleton have been found at nearby sites. These may represent the same species, however the discoverers point out that the skeletal remains need not belong to the same species as the skulls. This species was announced in 1999.<br /><br />




Brain size about 450 cc, similar to other australopithecines. Body size and shape probably slightly larger than <i>A. afarensis</i>.  Very large canines, molars and premolars, thick tooth enamel,  rectangular or U-shaped dental arcade diastema (gap between canines and incisors) often present in the upper jaw. This is a primitive feature. Like many australopithecines, including some <i>A. afarensis</i>, it has a sagittal crest for anchoring large jaw muscles
</p><br clear = "all"><p>

A changing climate had thinned the forests that once dominated this region, and savannah grasslands were becoming widespread.
 It most likely ate plant material and possibly some meat. If the antelope bones found at the site were butchered by this species, then they must have included significant amounts of meat and marrow in their diet.<br /><br />

The skeletal remains were found associated with antelope bones bearing cut marks, apparently from stone tools. Stone tools were not found at this site, but at the nearby, contemporaneous site Gona. These are the earliest dated stone tools that have been found, but may have been left by another species.
<br /><br />

The term Oldowan for  choppers is taken from the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where the first Oldowan stone tools were discovered by the archaeologist Louis Leakey in the 1930s. <br /><br /> 
It is not known for sure which hominin species created and used Oldowan tools, but its emergence is often associated with   <i>Australopithecus garhi</i>. <br /><br />

<i>Paranthropus aethiopicus</i> is considered a megadont archaic hominin,  the term megadont referring to the huge size of the postcanine tooth crowns. The initial discovery was a toothless adult mandible in the Shungura formation of the Omo region of Ethiopia in 1967 (Omo 18.18). The ash layers above and below the fossils give an approximate date of 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;300&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP. There is only one mostly complete skull for this hominin, so it is hard to make proper inferences about physical characteristics. However, it can be said that the available skull is similar to <i>Paranthropus boisei</i>, although the incisors are larger, the face more prognathic (projecting), and the cranial base less flexed.

These differences may have been developed during the evolution of aethiopicus, but it may also suggest that <i>Australopithecus aethiopicus</i> has a different phylogenetic history than <i>Australopithecus robustus</i> and <i>Australopithecus boisei</i>.

This lower jaw was discovered in  1967 by  Camille Arambourg and Yves Coppens at the Omo River location, Omo Valley, Ethiopia.<br /><br />

<i>Paranthropus aethiopicus</i> was first proposed in 1967 to describe a toothless partial mandible (Omo 18) found in Ethiopia by French palaeontologists.  Lower jaw and teeth fragments have been uncovered. <i>Paranthropus aethiopicus</i> had a large sagittal crest and zygomatic arch adapted for heavy chewing (as in gorilla skulls).</p><br clear = "all"><p>
	
Not much is known about this species since the best evidence comes from the 'Black Skull' and this jaw. There is not enough material to make an assessment of how tall they were, but they may have been as tall as <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>.<br /><br />

Discovered in 1959 in	Tanzania by	Mary Leakey.<br /><br />

Koobi Fora  refers primarily to a region around Koobi Fora Ridge, located on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana. 
The ridge itself is an outcrop of mainly Pliocene/Pleistocene sediments. It is composed of claystones, siltstones, and sandstones that preserve numerous fossils of terrestrial mammals, including early hominin species. Presently, the ridge is being eroded into a badlands terrain by a series of ephemeral rivers that drain into the northeast portion of modern Lake Turkana. In 1968 Richard Leakey established the Koobi Fora Base Camp on a large sandspit projecting into the lake near the ridge, which he called the Koobi Fora Spit. </p><br clear ="all"> <p>
A subsequent survey and numerous excavations at multiple sites established the region as a source of hominin fossils shedding light on the evolution of man over the previous 4.2 million years. Far exceeding the number of hominin fossils are the non-hominin fossils which give a detailed view of the fauna and flora as far back as the Miocene.
<br /><br />

 
 KNM-ER 406 is a nearly complete adult male Paranthropus boisei. It has the facial and cranial features typical of the species such as massive cheek teeth, and the widely flaring zygomatic arches with a forward placed connection to the other facial bones, and large cheek bones supported powerful chewing muscles - the latter two features giving it a 'dish-shaped' face. Other muscles extended from his jaw to the sagittal crest at the top of his head. The cranial capacity of this skull has been estimated at 510 cc.

 The original complete skull (without mandible) of  <i>Paranthropus robustus</i> (SK-48 Swartkrans (26°00'S 27°45'E), Gauteng) was discovered in Kromdraai, South Africa. <br /><br />Collection of the Transvaal Museum, Northern Flagship Institute, Pretoria South Africa.<br /><br />

Discovered by R. Broom and J.T. Robinson, 1947<br /><br />
</p><br clear = "all"><p>
The species <i>Australopithecus robustus</i> was first discovered and named by the eminent Dr. Robert Broom. Broom made a habit of buying fossil remains from a lime quarry worker, and on a particular visit on June 8, 1938, Broom bought a maxillary fragment containing a first molar. The shape and the size of the molar convinced Broom that this was a different species than <i>Australopithecus africanus</i> (Broom’s <i>transvaalensis</i>), and upon further investigation, found that the specimen had been found by a young boy who worked in the cave as a guide on Sundays. Broom searched for the boy (Gert Terblanche) and found him at school. Broom lectured the boy’s class on the cave sites of the area, and was then led to the place of the specimen’s discovery, Kromdraai. Broom found several more cranial and mandibular fragments associated with the original maxillary specimen, and this partial cranium (TM 1517) became the type specimen for <i>Australopithecus robustus</i>.<br /><br />

 Particularly regarding cranial features, the development of <i>Paranthropus robustus</i> seemed to be in the direction of a 'heavy-chewing complex'. On account of the definitive traits associated with this 'robust'  line of australopithecine, anthropologist Robert Broom established the genus <i>Paranthropus</i> and placed this species in it.<br /><br />
<i>Paranthropus robustus</i> is generally dated to have lived between 2.0 and 1.2 million years ago. It had large jaws and jaw muscles with the accompanying sagittal crest, and post-canine teeth that were adapted to serve in the dry environment they lived in.<br /><br />

<i>Homo naledi</i> is a previously-unknown species of extinct hominin discovered within the Dinaledi Chamber of the Rising Star cave system, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa. This species is characterised by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of <i>Homo naledi</i> is unique, but most similar to early <i>Homo species</i> including <i>Homo erectus</i>, <i>Homo habilis</i> or <i>Homo rudolfensis</i>.<br /><br />

While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. <i>Homo naledi</i> has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominin yet discovered in Africa.

<i>Homo habilis</i> was a species of the tribe Hominini, during the Gelasian and early Calabrian stages of the Pleistocene period, which lived between roughly 2.1 and 1.5 million years ago.  The type specimen is OH 7, discovered in 1960 at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, associated with the Oldowan lithic industry; the fossils were identified as a separate species of Homo with the proposed binomial name of <i>Homo Habilis</i>('handy man') in 1964.  In its appearance and morphology, <i>Homo Habilis</i> is the least similar to modern humans of all species in the genus Homo (except the equally controversial  <i>Homo rudolfensis</i> ), and its classification as Homo has been the subject of controversial debate since its first proposal in the 1960s.

<i>Homo habilis</i> was not yet able to catch such a large animal as  a hippo,  and therefore in the drying environment of Africa, had a mostly  herbal diet, supplemented by  small animals and the found carcasses of dead animals.

The most famous <i>Homo erectus</i> find is the 'Turkana Boy', KNM WT 15000, a young male discovered in Kenya by 	Kamoya Kimeu in 1984. The original is now kept at the Kenya National Museum.<br /><br />

His reconstructed skeleton - with a narrow pelvis and tall, thin body - is interpreted as showing adaptation to the hot climate and the need to run long distances. 
<br /><br />



In comparison, a  new find from Gona  (see: <A HREF ="erectus.html#gona"><i>Homo erectus</i></A>) is from a shorter female with a wider chest - a feature more commonly found now in humans from colder, even Arctic climates. The wide pelvis suggests the birth canal and brain size were co-evolving, as H. erectus adapted to the need to give birth to larger babies above the need to adapt to the pressure of external environmental factors.<br /><br />

<i>Homo erectus</i>
<br /><br />
Sculpture of the female from Koobi Fora, Kenya, probably KNM-ER 3733.<br /><br />
KNM-ER 3733  is a fossilised hominid cranium of the extinct hominid <i>Homo ergaster</i>, which is interchangeably referred to as <i>Homo erectus</i>. It was discovered in 1975 in Koobi Fora, Kenya, right next to Lake Turkana, by Bernard Ngeneo, a field worker for Richard Leakey.  Its geographic location is not to be confused with that of KNM-WT 15000, Turkana Boy, also known as Nariokotome Boy, who was also found near Lake Turkana nine years later in 1984.<br /><br />
KNM-ER 3733 is one of the oldest Homo ergaster skulls in the world. Recent research using magnetostratigraphy has determined the age of KNM-ER 3733 to be circa  1&nbsp;600&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP

KNM-ER 3733 is a find of a near-complete cranium. Its brain size is about 850  cm<small><sup>3</sup></small>.   KNM-ER 3733 was compared to male fossils KNM-ER 3833 and KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy), who were also found at the Koobi Fora site, and because of this, is said to be female. The features of KNM ER 3733 are less robust compared to the two male crania. It is considered to be an adult because of the extensive wear of its teeth, the fact that its third molars were present before the individual died, and because its cranial sutures were fully fused, which is only possible in an adult specimen.

<i>Homo rudolfensis</i> - This early human lived about 2 million years ago, but its place on our family tree is debated.<br /><br />
Age: 2&nbsp;400&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP to 1&nbsp;800&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP.<br /><br />

The key specimen of this species is skull KNM-ER 1470. When it was discovered by Richard Leakey's team in 1972, it was not attributed to a species, only a member of the genus Homo. In 1986, a Russian anthropologist gave the skull the species name <i>Pithecanthropus rudolfensis</i>. The genus name of <i>Pithecanthropus</i> was later dropped and replaced with <i>Homo</i>.<br /><br />

Other cranial remains attributed to this species include the KNM-ER 1802, 1590, 1801 and 3732. Possible limb remains may include KNM-ER 1472 and 1481, but these were not found with skulls so attribution is questionable. The species name <i>rudolfensis</i> comes from the location where the type specimen KNM-ER 1470 was found - Lake Turkana, East Rudolph, Kenya. Fossils have been found in Urhara, Malawi, and Lake Turkana in Kenya.<br /><br />

<i>Homo antecessor</i>  
<br /><br />
Cranial fragments from Gran dolina, Atapuerca, Spain. <br /><br />

Circa 780&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP<br /><br />

Fossils from the Gran Dolina railway cut in northern Spain's Sierra Atapuerca are from a hitherto unknown species of early human, according to the site's excavator José Bermúdez de Castro of the National Museum of Natural Sciences, Madrid, and his colleagues. They named the newly identified species <i>Homo antecessor</i> (from the Latin for pioneer or explorer), and claim that it is directly ancestral to both modern humans and Neanderthals. The Gran Dolina fossils - nearly 80 postcranial, cranial, facial, and mandibular bones as well as teeth of at least six individuals - were excavated between 1994 and 1996. 
</p><br clear = "all"><p>

A key specimen is a partial facial skeleton of a juvenile, estimated to be ten to eleven years old, recovered in 1995. The fossils exhibit both seemingly modern features, such as sunken cheekbones with a horizontal rather than vertical ridge where upper teeth attach and a projecting nose and midface, and more primitive ones, including prominent brow ridges and premolars with multiple roots. The level in which the fossils were found, TD6, is dated by a reversal in the earth's magnetic field to more than 780&nbsp;000 years ago. So far this level has been exposed only in a test pit of six square metres, but the excavators are confident that many more human fossils will be found when  larger excavations reach the level some years in the future.<br /><br />
(&#8239;The Australian museum at https://australianmuseum.net.au notes that although many experts consider these remains to be part of an early and variable <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> population, the discoverers believe the fossils are different enough to be given a new species name <i>Homo antecessor</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)

<br /><i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> mandible.<br /><br />
Mauer is the type site of <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i>.<br /><br />


This is  Mauer 1, a lower jaw discovered in 1907 in Mauer, near Heidelberg, Germany. This jaw is the 'type specimen' or official representative of this species. It was discovered by workers at a gravel quarry which had previously yielded many fossils of extinct mammals. Lying at a depth of about 24 metres, its age is estimated to be between 400&nbsp;000 and 600&nbsp;000 years old.
<br /><br />


This species had a strongly built lower jaw for the attachment of strong chewing muscles. As with earlier hominins, the lower jaw did not have a protruding, pointed chin. The teeth were arranged in the jaw so that they formed a parabolic shape (curved at the front then splayed out toward the back) and were smaller than those of earlier species (but larger than those of modern humans). <br /><br />

Abigail Tucker, 'A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces', Smithsonian.com, February 25, 2010 writes:<br /><br />
Appearing 700&nbsp;000 years ago, <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> is closely related to our own species. 'It has huge brow ridges,' Gurche notes. 'A lot of people think that’s kind of a shock absorber for the face, that it dissipates pressure put on teeth at the front of the skull, if you are using your mouth as a clamp to grip implements or a skin.'

Cast of Arago 21 and Arago, a skull and lower jaw discovered in Arago Caves, Tautavel, France. Excavations since 1964 have revealed a number of human fossils at Arago including this skull and jaw from different individuals. Thousands of stone tools and the bones of many types of animals have also been uncovered at this site. The Arago 21 skull is relatively complete but it was distorted either before or during fossilisation. Its features are typical of this species but its size and robust facial features suggest that it is the skull of a young male. It has been dated as being between 250&nbsp;000 and 400&nbsp;000 years old.

<i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>, type specimen, circa  40&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP
<br /><br />


Kleine Feldhofer Grotte  was a karstic limestone cave and a palaeoanthropologic site in the Neandertal Valley in western Germany. In August 1856, the Neanderthal type specimen was unearthed from the cave. Miners uncovered a skull cap and a number of skeletal bones to be labeled Neanderthal. The bones belong to at least three distinct individuals. Johann Carl Fuhlrott, a German schoolteacher,  was the closest scientist to the scene in 1856. By the time Fuhlrott saw it, there was not much left but a few limb bones and the top of the skull, but the skullcap alone  was enough to tell him that this was a different kind of human - low forehead, prominent brow ridges, and with sturdier bones than normal.<br /><br />

The cave was situated in a limestone gorge with the interior dimensions of 3 m (9.8 ft) in width by 5 m (16 ft) in length by 3 m (9.8 ft) in height, and a 1 m (3.3 ft) opening 20 m (66 ft) above the valley floor in the south wall which was 50 m (160 ft) high. The cave got its name from the nearby large farm of the Feldhof. The cave was completely destroyed during the 19th century as a result of industrial-scale limestone quarrying which widened the gorge. The location of the cave was soon forgotten and by 1900, unknown.<br /><br />
In 1997 a successful search for the site of the cave and its deposits yielded 24 fragments of human bone, one of which, identified as NN 13, fit exactly onto the left lateral femoral condyle of the Neanderthal 1 fossil. The 2000 excavation resulted in the recovery of thousands of artefacts. The mitochondrial DNA of two bone samples were fully sequenced, and completed in 2009. <br /><br />

The new specimens are all smaller and/or more fragmentary than the bones recovered in 1856. This is not surprising, because these specimens were thrown down an approximately 20 metre high rock face and subjected to breakage by subsequent quarrying activity while on the valley floor. Although fragmentary, many pieces of bone have been refitted to form more complete elements.

<b>Denisovans / <i>Homo sapiens denisova</i></b><br /><br />

The Denisovans or Denisova hominins  are an extinct species or subspecies of archaic humans in the genus Homo. Pending its status as either species or subspecies, it currently carries the temporary names Homo sapiens [subspecies] denisova. In March 2010, scientists announced the discovery of a finger bone fragment of a juvenile female who lived about 41&nbsp;000 years ago, found in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia, a cave that has also been inhabited by Neanderthals and modern humans. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the finger bone showed it to be genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. The nuclear genome from this specimen suggested that Denisovans shared a common origin with Neanderthals, that they ranged from Siberia to Southeast Asia, and that they lived among and interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans, with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians and around 6% in Papuans deriving from Denisovans. <br /><br />

A 2013 comparison with the genome of another Neanderthal from the Denisova cave revealed local interbreeding with local Neanderthal DNA representing 17% of the Denisovan genome, and evidence of interbreeding with an as yet unidentified ancient human lineage. Analysis of DNA from two teeth found in layers different from the finger bone revealed an unexpected degree of mtDNA divergence among Denisovans. Two teeth belonging to different members of the Denisova cave population have been reported. In November 2015, a tooth fossil containing DNA was reported to have been found and studied. <br /><br />

Denisovans and Neanderthals split from Homo sapiens around 600&nbsp;000 up to 744&nbsp;000 years ago and diverged from each other about 200&nbsp;000 years later<br /><br />

The story of man is being rewritten. Australian and Indonesian scientists have dug up skeletons of a previously unknown human species - real 'hobbits' that stood only a metre tall - that lived on the Indonesian island of Flores, west of Timor, until relatively recently. <br /><br />

The scientists found the first skeleton in September 2003 in Liang Bua, a large limestone cave on the island. The one-metre-tall female, aged about 30 and dubbed 'Hobbit', lived about 18&nbsp;000 years ago. <br /><br />

Six similar skeletons were later found, some of whom lived in the cave just 13&nbsp;000 years ago. The scientists have speculated that the species may have lived on Flores - which they dubbed the "lost world" - until the 16th century. <br /><br />

<h1><i>Homo luzonensis</i> - the most recent living human relative</h1>
<br />



<b><i>Homo luzonensis</i>,  is an extinct, possibly pygmy, species of archaic human from the Late Pleistocene of Luzon, the Philippines. Their remains, teeth, and phalanges, are known only from Callao Cave in the northern part of the island dating to before 50&nbsp;000 years ago. They were initially identified as belonging to modern humans in 2010, but in 2019, after the discovery of more specimens, they were placed into a new species based on the presence of a wide range of traits similar to modern humans as well as to <i>Australopithecus</i> and early <i>Homo</i>.</b>

Excavations at Callao Cave. <br /> <br />
In 2007, archaeologist Armand Salvador Mijares found a curious bone buried in Callao Cave in the Philippines island of Luzon. Shortly after, he and his colleagues concluded it was a third metatarsal from a human that lived some 67&nbsp;000 years ago. Together with other findings, it demonstrated that humans could cross the open ocean and reach isolated islands very early on in our history.
</p><br clear ="all"><p>
But whether that bone belonged to <i>Homo sapiens</i> or another species of our genus was a mystery. Mijares, of the University of the Philippines, and his colleagues have since discovered twelve additional bones and teeth from the same site. Their analysis has revealed that the remains are unlike any other hominin fossils known, and likely represent a distinct species of the Homo genus. The researchers named it <i>Homo luzonensis</i>.

The Omo River  in southern Ethiopia is the largest Ethiopian river outside the Nile Basin. Its course is entirely contained within the boundaries of Ethiopia, and it empties into Lake Turkana on the border with Kenya. 

<br /><br />
The lower valley of the Omo is currently believed by some to have been a crossroads for thousands of years as various cultures and ethnic groups migrated around the region. To this day, the people of the Lower Valley of the Omo, including the Mursi, Suri, Nyangatom, Dizi and Me'en, are studied for their diversity.

Early <i>Homo sapiens</i><br /><br />
With its high, rounded braincase, this is one of the oldest modern human fossils found so far. Along with modern human skulls discovered in Herto, Ethiopia, it suggests that East Africa was a key area in the emergence of modern humans. 

<br /><br />

The Omo Kibish Formation or simply the Kibish Formation is a geological formation in the Lower Omo Valley of southwestern Ethiopia.   Omo Kibish and the neighboring formations (Shangura and Usno) have produced a rich palaeoanthropological record with many hominin (e.g. Paranthropus boisei) and stone tool (e.g. Oldowan tools) finds dating to over millions of years. The Kibish formation, in particular, is most notable for Richard Leakey's work there in 1967 during which he and his team found one of the oldest remains of anatomically modern Homo sapiens. Known as Omo Kibish 1 (Omo I), the fossil is circa 196&nbsp;000 years old and is among two other Omo remains (Omo II and Omo III) that were found in Member I of the Omo Kibish formation.

This young adult's skull was found at a site in Israel. It provides some of the earliest fossil evidence of modern humans outside Africa. This individual was probably part of the first wave of modern human migration out of Africa. <br /><br />

(&#8239;<i>note that this wave towards Western Europe stalled at the Levant, probably died out there, or perhaps retreated back to Africa, and probably did not gain firm access to Western Europe until much later, perhaps 50&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP or later according to many researchers, but the matter is still in hot dispute. However modern humans may have gotten to Asia within this time frame, and there is evidence of </i>Homo sapiens<i> in Australia by around 60&nbsp;000&nbsp;BP&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don&nbsp;</i>)

<i>Homo sapiens</i>
 <br /><br />
This modern human child, Qafzeh 11,  was about 13 years old when he or she died. Their skull was found in a burial site with red deer antlers placed on the body. Intentional burial has also been documented in the Neanderthals. 
<br /><br />
From Qafzeh Cave, Israel, 90&nbsp;000&nbsp;-&nbsp;120&nbsp;000&nbsp;years&nbsp;old. 
<br /><br />

It is believed that the <i>Homo sapiens</i> fossils found at Qafzeh Cave are from an early migration out of Africa by modern humans around 125&nbsp;000 lyears ago. When this occurred, they must have encountered Neanderthal groups who were already living there. 
<br /><br />

Of special interest in this case is, first,  the fact that it was at the <b>bottom of the Mousterian sequence</b>, a further indication that <i>Homo sapiens</i> made a number of efforts to migrate into the Levant from Africa, but for whatever reasons, was not successful at first.  <br /><br />
<!-- see: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102822 -->
 
Further, this child has now been found  (<a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Coqueugniot et al. 2014</span></a>) to have had a healed trauma to the skull. The healing process led to a thin bone remodelling of the skull, the frailty of it explaining its post-mortem loss.
<br /><br />
The child suffered a frontal bone depressed fracture, associated with brain damage. Furthermore the endocranial volume, smaller than expected for dental age, supports the hypothesis of a growth delay due to traumatic brain injury. This trauma did not affect the typical human brain morphology pattern of the right frontal and left occipital petalia. It is highly probable that this young individual suffered from personality and neurological troubles directly related to focal cerebral damage. Interestingly this young individual benefited from  a unique funerary practice among the south-western Asian burials dated to the Middle Palaeolithic.
<br /><br />

The  adolescent was  found in a pit dug in the bedrock. The skeleton was lying on its back, with the legs bent to the side and both hands placed on either side of the neck, and in the hands were the antlers of a large red deer clasped to the chest.<br /><br />

(left) LM3 - The oldest skeletal evidence of modern humans in Australia was found at Lake Mungo in the state of NSW. Lake Mungo 3 (LM3) was discovered by ANU geomorphologist Dr. Jim Bowler on 26 February 1974 when shifting sand dunes exposed the remains. LM3 was found near Lake Mungo, one of several dry lakes in the southeast part of the continent and 500 metres east of the LM1 site. The body had been laid out in great ceremony on its back, with knees bent and hands positioned at the groin with the fingers interlocked. Next to the body were the remains of fire. The body had been sprinkled with red ochre, in the earliest known example of such a sophisticated and artistic burial practice. This ritual burial aspect of the discovery has been particularly significant to Indigenous Australians, since it indicates that certain cultural traditions have existed on the Australian continent for much longer than previously thought.

(right) Kow Swamp 1 - This skull has larger and more robust features than the Lake Mungo skull. Modern humans may have developed physical differences as they dispersed across the Australian continent, adapting to their surroundings and continuing to evolve. 
<br /><br />
The Kow Swamp archaeological site comprises a series of late Pleistocene burials within the lunette of the eastern rim of a former lake known as Kow Swamp. The site is located 10 km south-east of Cohuna in the central Murray River valley, in northern Victoria, at 35.953553°S 144.318123°E. The site is significant for archaeological excavations by Alan Thorne between 1968 and 1972 which recovered the partial skeletal remains of more than 22 individuals.

East African modern <i>Homo sapiens</i>.<br /><br />
Gemma Conroy writes (at https://www.abc.net.au) that the Middle Stone Age grave  of a three year old child who lived 78&nbsp;000 years ago  has been found in a cave in Kenya. In a paper in the journal Nature,  <a href="#reference"><span class="reference">Martinón-Torres et al. (2021)</span></a>, the researchers who studied the fragile, ancient remains described how its head appeared to have been laid on a pillow. Scientists have named the child Mtoto, meaning 'child' in Swahili.

The international team of archaeologists carefully cast the entire grave in plaster in order to preserve the arrangement of surviving bone fragments. This enabled them to transport the body safely to a laboratory for detailed study.
<br /><br />

The researchers were able to study the teeth to confirm that this was the tiny body of a human child - between two and three years old. Scans revealed that the body had been laid in a fetal position.
<br /><br />
And the bones had moved in a way that suggested it had been wrapped tightly when buried, with its head originally resting on something like a cushion of leaves, which subsequently decomposed.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div>

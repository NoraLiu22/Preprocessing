/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        Wallace because he has provided an invaluable service to Wallace and Darwin 
        scholars as well as historians of science in general with this remarkable 
        archival achievement. My biography of this most fascinating scientist 
        and scholar benefited greatly from Smith's important work, for which I 
        am grateful.]</i></p>
<p align="center"><br /><strong><font size="+1">Bibliography of Wallace Archival 
        Sources</font></strong>      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, briefly, fifteen primary-source archives 
        in England that contain varying amounts of Wallace material, ranging from 
        a couple, to a couple of thousand letters. A few comments here may help 
        the reader understand the general historiography of this book, and direct 
        future historians of Wallace to the specific source they may need. First 
        of all it should be noted that there is, as yet, no central clearing house 
        for Wallace archival materials. Unlike the Darwin industry where virtually 
        all the correspondence (or copies thereof) are at the Cambridge University 
        Library (and most of his personal artifacts and library are at his home 
        in Down), Wallace's correspondences are scattered hither and yon. The 
        British Library contains the most at approximately 1,400 letters, seven 
        book manuscripts, and thirteen journal article manuscripts, while the 
        Wellcome Institute, the Imperial College of Science and Technology, and 
        University College, London house the least, with just a handful of letters 
        each.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working approximately eight to ten hours a day, 
        six days a week, it took my wife and I five and a half weeks to read thoroughly 
        through all the primary source materials. It was a surprisingly easy task, 
        enhanced by Wallace's legible handwriting, along with the majority of 
        those who wrote to Wallace, with the exception of Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, 
        and Lyell. All of the archivists were quite helpful, and some of them 
        very knowledgeable on both Wallace and nineteenth-century evolutionary 
        thought, particularly Gina Douglas at the Linnean Society, an excellent 
        research facility and a warm introduction to the Wallace archives. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Linnean Society is one of the gold mines 
        of archival materials, housing Wallace's letters, superb nature sketches, 
        and annotated books from his personal library (including a copy of Darwin's 
        <i>Descent of Man</i>). More significantly, the original notebooks in 
        Wallace's hand from the Malay Archipelago are available, as well as his 
        never-before-published American journal, containing fascinating descriptions 
        of the American landscape, cityscape, universities, and his spiritualism 
        experiences abroad. A small museum contains the skin of a giant python 
        Wallace killed in the jungles of the Malay Archipelago (described in his 
        book of the same name), as well as Darwin's satchel in which he kept his 
        scientific instruments on the Beagle voyage. While the room in which the 
        Darwin-Wallace papers were read into the record on July 1, 1858 is now 
        gone, another room is set up with most of the original furniture, such 
        that one can touch history by sitting in the Linnean Society President's 
        chair and, with imagination, hear the ground-breaking ideas presented 
        publicly (and generally ignored) for the first time. Likewise, the Museum 
        of Mankind contains artifacts Wallace brought back from Malaya, and the 
        British Museum of Natural History has many of Wallace's butterfly and 
        other entomological collections, as well as the magnificent color portrait 
        painted in 1923 by J. W. Beaufort that adorns the cover of this book. 
        The British Library contains a fascinating article written by Wallace 
        in 1900, simply entitled 'Evolution' <i><font color="990000">[[Editor's 
        note:</font> <a href="S589.htm">S589</a><font color="990000">]]</font></i>. 
        Although it is reported by the archives catalogue as never published, 
        it first appeared in the New York based <i>The Sun</i> under the title 
        'The Passing Century' on December 23, 1900, and was reprinted in <i>The 
        Progress of the Century</i> in 1901. It is a splendid summary of the state 
        of the science at the fin de si&egrave;cle, by one of its major scientific 
        players. 
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most valuable sources of Wallace letters, 
        books, and general memorabilia is his descendants. While there is no extant 
        Wallace home, his grandsons Alfred John Russel Wallace and Richard Russel 
        Wallace, from Bournemouth and Lymington respectively, have carefully saved 
        a number of important items of their grandfather. Among these is included 
        a binder of early correspondence that contains the famed letter to Bates, 
        apparently sent the same time as the 1858 letter to Darwin with the paper 
        on natural selection, that Darwin claims arrived on June 18. One can clearly 
        see on the Wallace-Bates letter the postmark of London, June 3. The grandsons 
        also have Wallace's sextant he used on the Amazon excursion, as well as 
        numerous family photographs, portraits, and even their grandfather's grandfather 
        clock. Both grandsons were extremely helpful and cordial, and John's hospitality 
        in extending a luncheon for us was above and beyond the call of historical 
        duty. John, now retired, was a science teacher and fully understands the 
        importance of his grandfather's work within the larger context of the 
        history of science. He incurred a not-inconsiderable expense in photocopying 
        a number of letters for this book, for which I am grateful. The warm reception 
        dispelled a rumor that a prior Wallace biographer had apparently started 
        about the unapproachability of the grandsons, done, it is speculated, 
        to discourage future historians from getting to these archives. If so, 
        the plan backfired, as John steered us to a set of letters henceforth 
        lost to the historical community. As we were leaving his home I inquired 
        whether there were any other archives that might contain Wallace documents 
        that were not on my list. He replied that he thought he remembered his 
        father, William, mentioning that he had turned over a couple of boxes 
        of his father's letters to Oxford University.
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of phone calls and a train trip later 
        my wife and I were at the Hope Entomological Collections in the University 
        Museum at Oxford University. There were two boxes of letters, about 200 
        items in all, of exchanges between Wallace and primarily E. B. Poulton 
        and Raphael Meldola (and a handful of others including a letter from Darwin 
        about the feeding habits of caterpillars and the coloration of insects, 
        not mentioned in any Darwin correspondence source). It was immediately 
        obvious that no one had looked at these before, or at least for a very 
        long time. (They are mentioned in no primary- or secondary-source bibliography.) 
        William Wallace had joined each letter together with its envelope and 
        a thin piece of tissue paper with a straight pin to protect the letter 
        from others piled on top. This produced two holes in each letter and envelope. 
        Not only were the pins rusty and a little difficult to pull out, but to 
        put them back together in such a way that the holes were all aligned was 
        very difficult. It was my impression that no one had done so before and 
        there was no indication at the museum that anyone had ever requested or 
        seen these letters. (The content of these letters, which is important, 
        is discussed in Chapter 7.)
      </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following appendix is the most complete archival 
        source bibliography to date on Wallace. It was compiled during the research 
        for the book as the previously published sources of primary documents 
        were incomplete and impractical for research purposes. As much information 
        as possible was recorded at each location so that historians will have 
        only to turn to a single sourcebook to begin archival research. Due to 
        space limitations not every letter is listed (though they were all recorded 
        at every archive except the British Library, whose over 2,400 letters 
        made this task impossible). General summaries and categories of correspondence

        Annie had three children: Herbert Spencer Wallace, William Randolf Wallace, 
        and Violet Wallace. Only William had children: Alfred John Russel Wallace 
        and Richard Russel Wallace. Richard has two children: Richard and William 
        Wallace. John has one daughter, Susan, whose daughter Rosamund is the 
        great, great, granddaughter of ARW. The grandsons live in Bournemouth 
        and Lymington respectively, and have carefully preserved much of their 
        grandfather's archival material, including a binder of fifty-eight letters, 
        dated July, 1835 - May, 1869. These include correspondences to and from 
        his father, mother, George Silk, his brothers John, H. E. and W. G. Wallace, 
        his sister Frances Sims, her husband and Wallace's friend, Thomas Sims, 
        R. Spruce, and Henry Walter and Frederick Bates, including the now famous 
        letter allegedly sent the same time as the letter and essay to Darwin, 
        and arriving in London on June 3. They also retained some of Wallace's 
        personal library (109 books), including foreign translations of <i>The 
        World of Life</i> (Spanish and Dutch), with some minor marginalia in mostly 
        the later editions. Many of Wallace's books were sold off after his death. 
        A hand catalogue of the library was produced by RRW. Also featured: a 
        pencil sketch of Wallace; a watercolor of Wallace's birthplace (the home 
        is still extant); a watercolor and painting of Wallace, his parents, and 
        some children (in one frame); a sextant used on the Amazon trip; a butterfly 
        collection; a grandfather clock; a three-dimensional likeness of the Westminister 
        Abbey monument; an article on the BBC docudrama on Wallace; original photographs, 
        many never before published. A handlist of the letters by AJRW, entitled 
        'Old letters to and from A. R. Wallace and other members of his family,'

        feeding habits and coloration of insects of Sydney, and from C. Lloyd 
        Morgan (1891). The Poulton and Meldola letters are particularly important 
        for understanding Wallace's hyper-selectionism, and his stance against 
        use-inheritance, Mendelian genetics, and mutationism. Also, a manuscript 
        by R. Meldola on Wallace and his theories; a copy of <i>The Scientific

        and assorted materials are in the Manuscript Room under 'Galton Papers.' 
        Correspondence of Wallace and F. Galton, and of particular interest Galton's 
        attempt to survey the eminent men and 'noteworthy families' of his time, 
        including Wallace, and Wallace's reticent (and modest) response declining 
        participation in the study. Letters discuss an 'Evolution Committee on 
        Breeding' and a request for Wallace's fingerprints. There is also a 'Scrapbook 
        of Darwinia,' including a letter from Darwin to Wallace.</font></p>

        in the 'Sclater Letters.' Thirty-three letters, dated 1850-1901, mostly 
        to P. L. Sclater on zoological matters, zoogeography, and the sales of 
        specimens in London, particularly birds, to finance research. Also, an 
        interesting 'Proposal as to a Joint Residential Estate,' by Wallace and 
        his partners in this proposal, for a planned community outside London 
        in which the natural beauty of the landscape would remain preserved.</font></p>

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="990000">[[p. 638]]</font> It is usually 
          said that the English are a practical people; that they prefer experience 
          to theory, and will seldom follow out admitted principles to their full 
          logical results. But this hardly represents them fairly, and many facts 
          in their history might lead an outside observer to give them credit 
          for exactly opposite qualities. He might even say that the English race 
          are more guided by principles than any other, because, though it takes 
          them a long time to become satisfied of the truth of any new principle, 
          when they have once adopted it they follow it out almost blindly, regardless 
          of the contempt of their neighbours, or of loss and injury to themselves. 
          As an example, he might point to the English race in America, who, having 
          at length seen that slavery was incompatible with the principles of 
          their own declaration of independence, not only made all the slaves 
          free, but at once raised the whole body of those slaves, degraded and 
          ignorant as they were, to perfect political equality with themselves, 
          allowing them not only to vote at parliamentary elections but to sit 
          as legislators, and to hold any office under Government. In England 
          itself he would point to our action in the matter of education and free 
          trade. Till quite recently, public feeling was overwhelmingly in favour 
          of leaving education to private and local enterprise; it was maintained 
          that to educate children was a personal not a public duty, and that 
          you should not attempt to make people learned and wise by Act of Parliament. 
          At length a change came. Public opinion and the legislature alike agreed 
          that to educate the people was a national duty; and so thoroughly is 
          this idea now being carried out, that food for the mind is looked upon 
          as of more importance than food or clothing for the body, and parents 
          who cannot earn sufficient to keep their children in health are fined, 
          or at all events made to lose time, which is to them often the cost 
          of a meal, because they do not send their children to school, and either 
          themselves pay the school fees or become paupers. An even more remarkable 
          instance of devotion to a principle might be adduced in our action with 
          regard to free trade. Till a generation ago we put heavy import duties 
          on food of all kinds, as well as on many other raw products and manufactured 
          articles. On this question of the <font color="990000">[[p. 639]]</font> 
          free import of food for the people, the battle of free trade was fought, 
          and, after a severe struggle, was won. The result was that the principle 
          of universal free trade gradually became a fixed idea, as something 
          supremely good and constantly to be sought after for its own sake. Its 
          benefits were, theoretically, so clear and indisputable to us, that 
          we thought we had only to set the example to other nations less wise 
          than ourselves, who would be sure to adopt it before long, and thus 
          bring about a kind of commercial millennium. We did set the example. 
          We threw open our ports, not only to food for our people, but to the 
          manufactured goods of all other nations, though those goods often competed 
          with our own productions, and sometimes produced immediate misery and 
          starvation among our manufacturing classes. But, firm to a great principle, 
          we continued our course, and notwithstanding that after nearly twenty 
          years' trial other nations have <i>not</i> followed our example, we 
          continue to admit their manufactures free, while they shut out ours 
          by protective duties. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These various instances do not support the view 

          that we are especially <i>practical</i> in our politics, but rather 

          that we are essentially <i>conservative</i>. We possess as a nation 

          an enormous <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i>. A tremendous motive force is required 

          to set us going in any new direction, but when once in motion an equally 

          great force is requisite in order to stop or even to turn us. After 

          spending so much mental effort and so much national agitation in deciding 

          to adopt a new principle, we hate to have to review our decision, to 

          think we have done wrong, or even that any limitations or conditions 

          are to be taken into account in the application of it. This rigid conservatism 

          is well shown in the treatment of the demand of many of our manufacturers 

          and some of our politicians for a fresh investigation of the subject 

          of free trade by the light of the experience of the last eighteen years. 

          They put forward 'reciprocity' as the principle on which we should act, 

          and they are simply treated with derision or contempt. They are spoken 

          of as weak, or foolish, or ignorant people, wanting in self-reliance, 

          and seeking to bolster up home productions by a return to protection; 

          and this is the tone adopted by the press generally, and by all the 

          chief politicians, both Liberal and Conservative. Little argument is 

          attempted; the facts, of increased imports and diminished exports, and 

          of widespread commercial distress, are explained away, as all facts 

          in such a complex question can be, and the names of Adam Smith and Cobden 

          are quoted as having settled the question once and for ever.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this mode of treating an important subject which 
          affects the well-being of the nation is not satisfactory. No one believes 
          more completely than myself in the benefits of free trade, or the impolicy 
          of restricting free intercourse between nation and nation any more than 
          between individual and individual; but, like most other principles, 
          it must be subject in its application to the <font color="990000">[[p. 
          640]]</font> conditions imposed upon us by the state of civilisation 
          and the mutual relations of the independent countries with whom we have 
          dealings. Nobody advocates free trade in poisons, or explosives, or 
          even in alcoholic drinks; and few believe that we are bound to allow 
          Zulus or Chinese to become armed with breech-loaders and rifled cannons 
          if we can prevent it; and the mere fact that restriction in these cases 
          is necessary should make us see that no commercial principle, however 
          good in itself, can be of universal application in an imperfect human 
          society. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence of free trade is its mutuality. Its 

          whole value depends upon the almost self-evident proposition, that, 

          <i>if each country freely produces that which it can produce best and 

          cheapest, and exchanges its surplus for the similarly produced products 

          of other countries, all will derive benefit</i>. As an argument against 

          the old policy of bounties and monopolies and prohibitory import duties, 

          and the idea that it was best for a country to produce everything for 

          itself and be independent of all its neighbours, this was irresistible, 

          and it did good work in its day. But people were so impressed with its 

          self-evident common-sense (which it yet took them so many years of hard 

          struggle to force upon a reluctant and conservative population) that 

          having once got it, they set it up on high and worshipped it, as if 

          it were a moral truth, instead of a mere maxim of expediency calculated 

          to produce certain economical effects if properly carried out. They 

          have thus been led to overlook two important aspects of the question, 

          which must be carefully studied and acted upon if we are to obtain the 

          full benefits to be derived from free trade. The one is, that, even 

          if universally adopted--that is, if no artificial restrictions were 

          imposed by any nation on the trade of any other nation with it--there 

          are yet many conceivable cases in which its full application would produce 

          injurious results, morally, physically, and intellectually, which might 

          so overbalance the mere commercial advantages it would bestow, as to 

          justify a people in voluntarily declining to act up to the principles 

          it enunciates. The other is, that even the commercial advantages depend 

          on the <i>whole programme</i> of free trade being carried out, and that 

          if the first half of it is neglected--that is, if each country does 

          not <i>freely produce</i> that which it can <i>naturally</i> produce 

          best and cheapest--then it may be demonstrated that one entire section 

          of the benefits derivable from free trade, and perhaps the most important 

          section for the real well-being of a nation, is destroyed. These two 

          points are of such importance, that they deserve to be carefully considered.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admitting that free trade will necessarily benefit 
          a country materially, it does not follow that it will be best for that 
          country to adopt it. Man has an intellectual, a moral, and an &aelig;sthetic 
          nature; and the exercise and gratification of these various faculties 
          is thought by some people to be of as much importance as cheap cotton, 
          cheap <font color="990000">[[p. 641]]</font> silk, or cheap claret. 
          We will suppose a small country to be but moderately fertile, yet very 
          beautiful, with abundance of green fields, pleasant woodlands, picturesque 
          hills, and sparkling streams. The inhabitants live by agriculture and 
          by a few small manufactures, and obtain some foreign necessaries and 
          luxuries by means of their surplus products. They have also abundance 
          of coal and of every kind of metallic ore, which pervade their whole 
          country but which they have hitherto worked only on a small scale for 
          the supply of their own wants. They are a happy and a healthy people; 
          their towns and cities are comparatively small; their whole population 
          enjoy pure air and beautiful scenery, and a large proportion of them 
          are engaged in healthy outdoor occupations. But now the doctrines of 
          free trade are spread among them. They are told that they are wasting 
          their opportunities: that other nations can supply them with various 
          articles of food and clothing far cheaper than they can supply themselves; 
          while they, on the other hand, can supply half the world with coal and 
          iron, lead and copper, if they will but do their duty as members of 
          the great comity of nations, and develope those resources which nature 
          has so bountifully given them. Visions of wealth and power float before 
          them; they listen to the voice of the charmer; they devote themselves 
          to the development of their natural resources; their hills and valleys 
          become full of furnaces and steam-engines; their green meadows are buried 
          beneath heaps of mine-refuse or destroyed by the fumes from copper-works; 
          their waving woods are cut down for timber to supply their mines and 
          collieries; their towns and cities increase in size, in dirt, and in 
          gloom; the fish are killed in their rivers by mineral solutions, and 
          entire hill-sides are devastated by noxious vapours; their population 
          is increased from ten millions to twenty millions, but most of them 
          live in 'black countries' or in huge smoky towns and, in default of 
          more innocent pleasures, take to drink: the country as a whole is more 
          wealthy, but, owing to the large proportion of the population depending 
          upon the fluctuating demands of foreign trade, there are periodically 
          recurring epochs of distress far beyond what was ever known in their 
          former condition. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this example of the natural effects of carrying 
          out the essential principles of free trade, another people in almost 
          exactly similar circumstances determine that they prefer less wealth 
          and less population, rather than destroy the natural beauty of their 
          country and give up the simple, healthful, and natural pleasures they 
          now enjoy. They accordingly, by the free choice of the people in Parliament 
          assembled, forbid by high duties the exportation of any minerals, and 
          even regulate the number of mines that shall be worked, in order that 
          their country shall not be changed into a huge congeries of manufactories. 
          A balance is thus kept up between different industries, all of which 
          are allowed absolutely free development so long as they do not interfere 
          with the public enjoyment, or cause any permanent <font color="990000">[[p. 
          642]]</font> deterioration to the water, the soil, or the vegetation 
          of the country. They are in fact protectionists, for the purpose of 
          preserving the beauty and enjoyability of their native land for themselves 
          and for their posterity. Free trade would destroy these, and give them 
          instead cheaper wine and silk, stale eggs instead of fresh, and butter 
          ingeniously manufactured from various refuse fats. They prefer nature 
          to luxury. They refer intellectual and &aelig;sthetic pleasures, with 
          fresh air and pure water, to an endless variety of cheap manufactures. 
          Are they morally or intellectually wrong in doing so? 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again: there may be, and probably are, countries 

          which produce nothing that some other country could not supply them 

          with cheaper. But as the populations must work to live, they have to 

          contravene the essential principle of free trade and produce the necessaries 

          of life dearly for themselves. Such people could hardly export anything. 

          They must necessarily be poor, and their surplus population must emigrate; 

          but these very conditions might be highly favourable to social and moral 

          advancement and a not inconsiderable share of happiness. Theoretically, 

          such a people ought not to exist, since they only produce what can be 

          produced with much less labour elsewhere; yet conditions approaching 

          to these have led to the development of one of the freest and most enviable 

          people of Europe--the Swiss.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is indeed fortunate that most countries are so 

          varied as they are, and that none are so peculiar as to be adapted for 

          the economical practice of one industry only. For if they were, the 

          principles of free trade would in time lead to the whole population 

          being similarly employed; they would become parts of a great machine 

          for the growth of one product or the manufacture of one article. It 

          surely will be admitted that such a state of things would not be desirable 

          for any country; and it thus seems as if nature herself had taught us 

          that the principle of each country limiting its energies to the one 

          or two kinds of industry it can practise best and cheapest, though commercially 

          sound, cannot always be carried out without injury, and must always 

          be subordinated to considerations of social, moral, and intellectual 

          advantage.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will now come to the other essential point--that 
          the whole programme of free trade must be carried out if its advantages 
          are not to be overbalanced by disadvantages. That programme is, that 
          each country shall <i>freely</i> produce that which it can <i>naturally</i> 
          produce best, and that all shall <i>freely</i> exchange their surplus 
          products. But after eighteen years' example on our part, no other country 
          approaches to this state of things. By means of protective duties they 
          all artificially foster certain industries, which could not long survive 
          under that open competition which is the essence of free trade. In all 
          the recent articles and discussions on this subject which I have seen, 
          the extreme free traders, without exception, maintain that this <font color="990000">[[p. 
          643]]</font> makes no difference, and that because the competition of 
          such artificially supported industries keeps down prices here, therefore 
          it benefits us and injures only the protectionist peoples. But this 
          argument entirely ignores the element of <i>stability</i> and <i>healthy 
          growth</i>, an essential to the prosperity of all industrial pursuits, 
          and of every manufacturing or trading community. When a country is developing 
          its natural resources without the artificial stimulus of bounties or 
          protective duties, its progress may not be very rapid, but it will be 
          sure, and for long periods permanent. It will depend upon the attraction 
          of capital to the industries in question, the training up of skilled 
          workmen, the making its way in foreign markets, and other similar causes; 
          and under a system of general free trade, these will not be subject 
          to extreme fluctuations, and the industry in question will be stable 
          as well as prosperous. No one can doubt that such stability in the various 
          industries of a country is the very essence of true prosperity, leading 
          to a steady rate of wages and an assured return both to labour and capital; 
          whereas the contrary condition of instability and fluctuation is the 
          most disastrous and disheartening. But such instability is the necessary 
          result of the trade of one country being subject to the ever-changing 
          influences of the protectionist legislation of other countries. When, 
          after acquiring a natural supremacy in any industry, we are suddenly 
          shut out of a market by prohibitive duties, and subjected to the competition 
          which those duties bring upon us, disturbance, loss, and suffering are 
          sure to be caused both to capitalist and workman. Here then we are deprived 
          of what is really the most important advantage of free trade, by the 
          action of other countries. Is there either reason or justice in passively 
          submitting to this deprivation? and is there any mode of action by which 
          we can gain for ourselves the benefits of that system of freedom which 
          we have so long magnanimously offered to all the world? I venture to 
          say that there is, and that by a consistent and clearly marked course 
          of action we can prevent other nations from injuring us by their various 
          phases of protectionist policy, while we retain whatever benefits free 
          trade can give us; and further, that while thus ourselves carrying out 
          the essential spirit of a free-trade policy, we shall be in possession 
          of the most powerful conceivable engine to convert others to its adoption. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before proceeding to explain my plan, let us see 
          what other schemes have been put forth by the advocates of reciprocity. 
          As far as I can make out, they are two only: the one to put a small 
          uniform <i>ad valorem</i> import duty on all foreign-manufactured articles; 
          the other to arrange, by treaties of commerce or otherwise, a scheme 
          of reciprocal import duties which shall be adjusted so as to benefit 
          both parties to the arrangement. The objection to the first is, that 
          it is giving up the whole principle of free trade, and neither public 
          opinion nor the legislature would sanction it; while the second is vague, 
          and <font color="990000">[[p. 644]]</font> involves innumerable questions 
          of detail, and equally gives up the principle of free trade with the 
          first. To these objections I add one of my own, that by neither plan 
          could we secure that stability and unchecked development of our resources 
          which is the most valuable of all the results of complete free trade. 
          We should not thereby prevent other nations from influencing our industries 
          prejudicially when with changes of government come changes of policy. 
          Bounties might still be given or increased, import duties might be raised 
          or lowered, and the capital invested in some of our industries to supply 
          both a home and foreign demand now, might be greatly depreciated or 
          even rendered worthless by the unexpected action of a foreign protectionist 
          minister a few years hence. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping to get some further light on this subject, 

          I turned to Professor Fawcett's volume on 'Free Trade and Protection,' 

          feeling sure that I should there find the question fairly stated and 

          the reasons against 'reciprocity' fully set forth. To my great astonishment, 

          however, I find that Mr. Fawcett's arguments are entirely directed, 

          not against 'reciprocity' of import duties, as I understand the term, 

          but against two totally distinct things--'retaliation' towards such 

          foreign countries as tax our products, and renewed 'protection' of our 

          domestic industries--both of which are clearly proved by him, and are 

          freely admitted by me, to be useless or injurious to ourselves. Thus 

          at p. 63 he says: 'If we desire to <i>retaliate </i>with effect upon 

          America for the injury which, by her tariff, she inflicts on our commerce;'--and 

          on the same page, 'If, therefore, we desire to make the American people 

          <i>suffer</i> some of the same loss and inconvenience which they inflict 

          on our commerce;'--and again, at p. 162, he speaks of the objection 

          'against imposing a duty on some article of French manufacture, with 

          the view of <i>punishing</i> the French for refusing to renew the Commercial 

          Treaty.' Surely such expressions as these which I have italicised, are 

          unworthy of an argumentative work on political economy and of Professor 

          Fawcett's high reputation. The desire of our manufacturers and workmen 

          to enjoy the legitimate benefits of free trade, and to be guarded against 

          the injury admitted to be done to them by the arbitrary and uncertain 

          departures from its principle by other nations, is a very different 

          thing from 'retaliation' or a revengeful wish to make others suffer.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Fawcett also argues, as it appears to 
          me very unsoundly, that because the import of goods which compete with 
          our manufactures is often <i>comparatively</i> small, therefore the 
          injury done or the distress caused is proportionately of small amount. 
          Surely he must know that there is often a very narrow margin between 
          profit and loss in manufactures, and that the importation of a <i>comparatively</i> 
          small quantity may determine the price at which a much larger quantity 
          must be sold. It is a well-known fact that the increased <font color="990000">[[p. 
          645]]</font> economy in working to the full power of a factory is such, 
          that the surplus so produced may be advantageously sold at less than 
          the actual cost, owing to the increased profit on the bulk of the goods 
          manufactured at a lower average cost. Foreign manufacturers, protected 
          by import duties against competition by us, enjoy practically a monopoly 
          in their own countries, and can secure such a profit on the bulk of 
          their goods sold at home that they can afford to undersell us with their 
          surplus stocks. These vary of course with variations of trade, and thus 
          our manufacturers are at any time liable to great fluctuations of prices 
          owing to such importations. It is a weak and miserable answer to say 
          that the people benefit by the low prices thus caused; for the great 
          mass of our people are producers as well as consumers, and almost every 
          article we either produce or manufacture is subject to the injurious 
          effects of the influx of surplus stocks from protected countries. There 
          is no comparison between the great loss and suffering thus caused, and 
          the small advantage to the consumer in an almost infinitesimal and often 
          temporary lowering of the retail price of goods the majority of which 
          are <i>not</i> prime necessaries of life. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is a very simple mode by which we <i>can</i> 

          obtain that stability which general free trade would give us, and which, 

          as I have endeavoured to show, is its greatest recommendation. It is, 

          to reply to protectionist countries by putting the <i>very same import 

          duty</i> on <i>the very same articles</i> that they do, changing our 

          duties as they change theirs.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will restore the balance, and, so far as we 

          are concerned, be equivalent to general free trade. It may, perhaps, 

          even be better for us, for we shall get some revenue from these duties; 

          but the great thing is, that we shall obtain stability. Our capitalists 

          and workmen will alike feel that foreign protectionist governments can 

          no longer play upon our industries as they please, for their own benefit. 

          They will know that they will be always free from unfair competition, 

          while neither asking nor receiving a shred of protection from that fair 

          competition of naturally developed industries which is alone compatible 

          with the principles of free trade. There will then be every incentive 

          to exertion in order to bring our manufactures up to the highest standard, 

          so that they may compete with the best productions of other nations, 

          without any fear that when they have achieved an honourable success 

          they may be deprived of their reward by an additional weight of protective 

          duties against them.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is urged against the advocates of reciprocity 
          that they are vague in their suggested remedies, and, when asked to 
          specify their proposals, 'escape in a cloud of generalities.' No one 
          can make this charge against my proposal. It is sufficiently clear and 
          sufficiently definite. Neither are Professor Fawcett's objections--that 
          'a policy of reciprocity is impracticable,' and that, once embarked 
          on it, trade <font color="990000">[[p. 646]]</font> after trade would 
          claim protection--at all more to the point. Every trade and industry 
          would be treated alike. All would have a free field and no favour. And 
          as regards foreign countries we should strictly do as we are done by, 
          and as we would be done by, and no more. We should make no attempt to 
          injure them or retaliate on them, but should simply and exactly neutralise 
          their interference with free trade as between us and them. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am here discussing an important question of 

          principle, to which, if it can be clearly established, our practice 

          should conform, I am spared the necessity of adducing that array of 

          statistics which is generally made use of in arguments on this subject. 

          It is well, however, to give one or two illustrative cases. Professor 

          Fawcett clearly proves, that the effect of the French sugar bounties 

          is, that sugar is sold in England under its cost price in France, and 

          that the only people who benefit by it are the proprietors on whose 

          land beet-root is grown, and the people of this country, who get sugar 

          practically cheaper. He admits, however, that 'considerable injury is, 

          no doubt, inflicted on English sugar refiners by the French being bribed 

          by their Government to sell sugar in the English market at a price which, 

          without a State subvention, would not prove remunerative;' but, he adds, 

          'if we embark on the policy of protecting a special trade against the 

          harm done to it by the unwise fiscal policy of other countries, we shall 

          become involved in a labyrinth of commercial restriction,' &amp;c. Surely 

          this is a very vague and unsatisfactory reason why our home and colonial 

          sugar manufacture should be left at the mercy of a foreign Power. For 

          if the French Government at any time and for any reason still further 

          increase the sugar bounties, they might completely ruin many of our 

          manufacturers; while some future ministry might abolish them altogether, 

          and then, when fresh capital had been drawn to the manufacture, it might 

          be again ruined. Are we to submit to this, on account of the shibboleth 

          of what is miscalled 'free trade,' when the imposition of an import 

          duty of the same amount as the bounty would prevent all such fluctuations? 

          By this course we should leave to France the full benefit of her <i>natural 

          sugar-producing capacity</i>, only taking away from her the power to 

          cause commercial distress in our country and our colonies by a course 

          of action which is liable to unforeseen changes at the whim of a minister 

          or a political party. Exactly the same arguments apply to our paper 

          manufacture, which is injured in the same way by foreign export duties 

          on the raw material and import duties on the manufactured article; and, 

          on the true principles of free trade, it is entitled to have those duties 

          <i>neutralised</i>, until the countries which impose them think fit 

          to abolish them altogether.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In almost every civilised country, including our 
          own colonies, the people naturally wish to develope their own resources 
          to the utmost; <font color="990000">[[p. 647]]</font> and we must all 
          sympathise with this desire. But as they have in the first instance 
          to struggle against old-established industries in other countries, the 
          difficulties and risk are too great to attract the necessary capital, 
          and they therefore endeavour to restore the balance in their favour 
          by means of protective duties, professedly as a temporary resource till 
          the new industry is well established. But Professor Fawcett assures 
          us that, in the United States, in no single instance has a protective 
          duty when once imposed been voluntarily relinquished, but, on the contrary, 
          each case is made a ground for seeking, and often obtaining, further 
          protection; and for about a century American protective duties have 
          been constantly increasing. The same thing applies more or less in the 
          case of other civilised nations with whom we have commercial intercourse, 
          and thus all security for the investment of capital in any manufacture 
          is taken away from our people. Whether in our mineral products or our 
          hardware, our cotton, paper, silk, or sugar, or any other of the thousand 
          industries on which the prosperity of our producers and workers depends, 
          all alike are subject to periodical floods of the surplus stocks of 
          other countries, from whose markets we are shut out by protective and 
          generally prohibitive duties. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage to foreign manufacturers, on the other 
          hand, of having an open market for their surplus goods, while they are 
          themselves protected from competition, is so obvious and so great, that, 
          instead of our example having any tendency to make them follow in our 
          steps, it really becomes a premium to them to continue their system 
          of exclusion. They obtain all the advantages of free trade, we all the 
          disadvantages of protection. Internal competition keeps down prices 
          in a protected country to a fair standard, and thus the consumers do 
          not materially suffer; while the free market we offer for surplus stocks 
          gives to the manufacturers the great advantage of utilising their plant 
          and machinery to its full extent, and thus working with a maximum of 
          economy. Our boasted freedom of trade, on the other hand, consists in 
          our being shut out of half the markets of the world, and in being further 
          handicapped by the irregular influx of surplus stocks which foreign 
          manufacturers are (in the words of Professor Fawcett) 'bribed to sell 
          us under cost price!' How differently do we act when there is a suspicion 
          of prison-manufactured goods competing with those of regular traders! 
          The representations of those traders are always listened to with respect 
          by our Government, and it is invariably admitted that they have a genuine 
          case of grievance. They are never told that the people benefit, and 
          therefore they must suffer: that prison mats and brooms can be sold 
          at least a penny in the shilling lower than the usual prices, and that 
          the public must not be deprived of this advantage, even though mat and 
          broom makers starve. Yet this is the very argument used (and almost 
          the only argument) in favour of our present system. The public (or a 
          <font color="990000">[[p. 648]]</font> section of it) get iron, and 
          silk, and paper, and cotton, and sugar fractionally cheaper, owing to 
          the influx of foreign-manufactured goods sold under cost price; therefore 
          the manufacturers of all these goods, and the large proportion of our 
          population who are engaged directly or indirectly in such manufactures, 
          must alike suffer. The weakness of this argument has already been exposed, 
          while its inconsistency, cruelty, and selfishness are no less obvious. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now, as I believe, pointed out a mode of 

          action which we may, as free traders, consistently adopt; which will 

          satisfy all the just claims of our manufacturers and workmen; which 

          will give stability to our industries, and inspire confidence in our 

          capitalists; and which, by neutralising the effects of the protectionist 

          policy of other countries, will place us as nearly as possible in the 

          position we should occupy were they all to become free traders. I have 

          shown, that as long as we continue our present course of action we really 

          offer them the strongest inducements to continue, or even to extend, 

          their present policy of protection; while it is evident that if we simply 

          neutralise every step they take in this direction, they will have no 

          motive, so far as regards us, for continuing such a system. Arguments 

          in favour of free trade will then have fair play, since they will not 

          be rendered nugatory by the bribe our policy now offers them to uphold 

          protection.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objections that I anticipate to my plan are: 

          first, that it is too complex, as it would compel us to adopt as against 

          each country its own tariff, however cumbersome; secondly, that it would 

          not satisfy those who now ask for another kind of reciprocity in the 

          shape of special protective duties; thirdly, that it would diminish 

          our commerce; and, fourthly, that it would be systematically evaded, 

          and is therefore impracticable.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to its complexity, I reply that it would really 

          be the most simple of all tariffs, since it would be determined by one 

          self-adjusting principle. The fact that the various lists of duties 

          imposed by foreign nations would be lengthy, is really of no importance 

          whatever. When alphabetically arranged, it is not more difficult to 

          find one item among a thousand than it is among five hundred. It may 

          also be said that we could not ascertain in many cases what the foreign 

          duties really are, owing to the complications introduced by bounties, 

          drawbacks, and various kinds of imposts distinct from the nominal import 

          duty. But if we could not precisely estimate the amount of protection 

          afforded in every case, we certainly could do so approximately; and 

          we might trust to our consuls and our custom-house officials to arrive 

          at a sufficiently accurate estimate.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If my proposal should not at first satisfy the present 
          demand of our manufacturers for reciprocity, I am sorry for it; but 
          that does not in the least affect the proposal itself, which has to 
          be judged by the rules of logic, common sense, and expediency. I put 
          it forward <font color="990000">[[p. 649]]</font> as being strictly 
          in accordance with the essential spirit of free trade; as a principle 
          of action which has nothing in common with protection in any form, since 
          its whole purport and effect is to neutralise all attempts at a protectionist 
          policy by other countries. Argument and example have alike failed to 
          influence them, but a check-mate of this kind may have a different result. 
        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the third objection I maintain, that commerce 

          exists, or ought to exist, for the good of the nation, not the nation 

          for the good of commerce. If I have shown that the system of strict 

          and detailed reciprocity here proposed would give us the most important 

          of the benefits and blessings of free trade, and would thus be for the 

          advantage of our entire industrial population, I need not concern myself 

          to show that a section of the community which may have gained by the 

          present false and one-sided policy will suffer no inconvenience should 

          that policy be changed; for such arguments have always been put aside 

          as irrelevant when free-trade principles have been at issue.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the fourth objection, that our reciprocal duties 

          would be evaded by passing goods through countries where they were allowed 

          free entry, I reply, that the duty might be levied on each article <i>as 

          being the product of a certain country</i>, from whatever port it was 

          shipped to us. In most cases our custom-house experts would at once 

          be able to say where the article was manufactured, and we might further 

          protect ourselves by requiring satisfactory proof (such as a certificate 

          from the manufacturer) that it was really the product of the country 

          from whose port it was shipped, in order to be admitted duty-free. Even 

          if we should be occasionally cheated, I cannot see that this is a valid 

          objection against adopting a sound and beneficial course of action.

        </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have carefully spared my readers figures and statistics, 

          but for those who wish to see how these apply to the questions here 

          raised, I may recommend Sir Edward Sullivan's volume on <i>Protection 

          to Native Industry,</i> and Captain Halford Thompson's pamphlet on <i>The 

          Effects of Free Trade without Reciprocity.</i></p>

          Canberra (pers. commun. 12/04):</font></i></strong>
        </p><p align="center"><i> <b>The Environmental Anti-Economics of Alfred Wallace,<br />
          and the Sacralisation of Nature</b></i> 
        </p><p align="left"><i> Alfred Wallace was an 'anti-economist.'</i>
</p><blockquote>
        <p align="left"><i><font size="-1">Everywhere, to-day, it [economics] 
          is being denounced by thinking men as a false science-as a delusion 
          and a snare-as an <u>ignis fatis</u> [i.e. delusive light], leading 
          men away from the paths of happiness and true well-being, and guiding 
          them towards the quagmires of unhealthy competition, poverty and discontent 
          . . . (S507, 1894, pp. 126-128).</font></i>
</p></blockquote>
        <p align="left"><i>Wallace was also, more specifically, one of the first 
          <u>environmentalist</u> anti-economists, who maintain that economic 
          reasoning results in the destruction of nature. He claimed, for example, 
          that, as result of free trade, Britons'</i>
</p><blockquote>
        <p align="left"><i><font size="-1">hills and valleys become full of furnaces 
          and steam-engines; their green meadows are buried beneath heaps of mine-refuse 
          or destroyed by the fumes from copper-works; their waving woods are 
          cut down for timber to supply their mines and collieries . . . the fish 
          are killed in their rivers by mineral solutions, and entire hill-sides 
          are devastated by noxious vapours . . . (S306, 1879, p. 641)</font></i>
</p></blockquote>
        <p align="left"><i> Wallace's environmentalist anti-economics must be 
          connected with the burgeoning of an environmentalist consciousness in 
          the late 19th century (manifested, for example, in the birth of the 
          National Park movement with the establishment of Yellowstone National 
          Park ). But I want to raise the possibility of a more specific connection 
          between his environmentalist anti-economics, and currents of thought 
          in the mid-Victorian period. I want to raise the possibility that Wallace 
          participated in the <u>sacralisation of nature</u> that took place in 
          the later 19th century.</i>
        </p><p align="left"><i>If we let 'the sacred' be that which is awe-inspiring, 
          extraordinary, beyond human control, and demanding self-abnegation and 
          reverence, then Enlightenment Christianity had compressed the sacred 
          into one location: God. The new life sciences of the mid-Victorian period 
          had, however, exploded this compression of the sacred in God. A spiritual 
          debris was dispersed across their mental universe, and there was a precipitation 
          of the sacred upon Nature. John Muir could now declare that &quot;perched 
          like a fly on the Yosemite dome I . . . humbly prostrate myself before 
          the vast display of God's power, and eager to offer self-denial and 
          renunciation with eternal toil to learn any lesson in the divine manuscript.&quot;</i>
        </p><p align="left"><i>Wallace's spiritualism was, plausibly, one manifestation 
          of this radiation of the sacred that followed the damage done to traditional 
          Christian belief by scientific progress (which included his own biological 
          theories). Was, perhaps, his attitude to nature also touched by this 
          radiation of the sacred?</i>

  <blockquote>  <!--sino date 1 January 2002-->

It is the vision of an ideal higher than that which the facts around him embody,
and the pursuit of it against all difficulty and
opposition, that marks the true
hero and leader among men from the self-seeking counterfeit who uses the
capacities and the blindness
and weaknesses of other men as the instruments of
his own aggrandizement and his
pleasures.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[4]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Clark was
not all words when it came to standards in public life. He resigned from his
position as Attorney-General in 1897 after
his colleagues granted a presumably
dubious lease of Crown land without seeking his legal advice. He did so to avoid
the office being
'stained or deterioriated' by any act which reduced its
dignity, status or power.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Clark rejected the notion of pandering to the views of the majority in order
to achieve political success. He quoted the words of
Washington on taking his
position as president of the Convention that framed the United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>: 'If to please the people, we offer what we ourselves disapprove,
how can we afterward defend our work. Let us raise a standard to
which the wise
and honest can repair'.<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[6]</a></sup> These are
words which many political leaders should take to heart. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Clark saw these words as an 'all sufficient and effectual
reply to the arguments used in support of the monarchical
and aristocratical
forms of the British <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'.<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[7]</a></sup>
He was a democrat and a republican.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading22"></a><b>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT
AND GOOD GOVERNMENT</b></h2>
<p>The relationship between the machinery of government and the ideal of good
government was one that Clark considered closely. He gave
general but qualified
supported to the aphorism that 'every country obtains a government as good as it
deserves'. He considered that
the Australian people deserved better government
than they had, if this were measured by reference to the capability of the
Australian
people to maintain and administer a better form of government.
However, if the question is asked by reference to the 'existence of
any
widespread desire for the possession of better political institutions or of any
earnest effort to obtain them, then it may be
that we get all we deserve because
we have not yet manifested any deep desire, or put forth any earnest effort to
improve the political
machinery around
us.'<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>That observation is just as valid today. It is not merely a reflection of the
apathy surrounding the republic debate. Criticism is
constantly heard of the
methods by which governments operate and the caliber of political
representatives, but it rarely, if ever,
moves beyond whinging to positive
efforts to change the machinery of government to effect a different outcome.
</p>
<p>Clark took the view that the people who govern us must be those who are the
most capable people in the community to perform such a
duty. If there are more
capable people in the community, who are not our legislators or Ministers, then
this must be a failure of
the machinery of government. It is a failure either
because the system does not provide for the best people to be chosen, or because
the best people refuse to govern. Even the latter case, according to Clark, was
the result of the failure of the machinery of
government.<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It would be difficult to assert today, that those who govern us in each of
the three tiers of government, are the most capable people
in the community to
do so. Many elected Members and councillors are unfit and unprepared for such a
role. It is clear that the voters
rarely have any idea about the capacities and
capability of the people they elect, and it is even doubtful whether the ability
to
govern is considered to be a criterion in choosing a candidate. Yet there is
no call to change the system, so perhaps we do get what
we deserve.</p>
<p>Clark did not confine his criticism to those who govern. He also had a swipe
at the press, noting that to the extent that its denunciation
of Ministers and
legislators is untrue and unfair, it lowers the standard of political life to
the level it declared already reached
by the persons it assails. This too, is a
pertinent comment today.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading30"></a><b>'REPRESENTATIVE  GOVERNMENT'  AND  'RESPONSIBLE 
GOVERNMENT'</b></h2>
<p>The meaning of 'representative government' is an issue that has recently
occupied the minds of the Justices of the High
Court.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[10]</a></sup> I wonder what their
Honours would make of the following definition offered by Clark:</p>
<blockquote>
The true principle and essence of representative government is the recognition
of the right of the most capable to govern, and the
correlative right of the
governed to determine the misrule of the incapable or dishonest who may at any
time be found exercising
the functions of
government.<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[11]</a></sup></blockquote><p>What
marvelous implications could be drawn from the right of the 'most capable' to
govern. Who would be left once the 'incapable'
and the 'dishonest' are removed?
Would we still recognize our form of 'representative government'?</p>
<p>Clark also rejected the system of responsible government as being
inappropriate in Australia. He preferred a separation between the
Parliament and
the Executive, based on United States or Swiss
models.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[12]</a></sup> He considered that
responsible government (or 'Cabinet government' as he described it) has the
tendency to make nominal leaders of
the most subservient followers of their
party, and creates an Opposition 'which is always ready to mutilate and deform
the most beneficial
measures of a Ministry simply as a display of strength, and
hence Ministerial proposals are often framed to present the fewest possible
number of points of attack than to grapple vigorously with the necessities of
the country.'<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[13]</a></sup> Again, this is the
voice of experience. It is an even greater problem today where governments no
longer have control of the upper
house and unpopular but necessary measures are
accordingly put off, abandoned or mutilated in political game-playing.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading39"></a><b>CONSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL REFORM</b></h2>
<p>Fear of change seems often to paralyse the prospect of reform today. Clark
and others in the late nineteenth century did not suffer
from such fears. They
were prepared to try and prepared to fail. Clark is most renowned for
introducing the Hare-Clark electoral
system in Tasmania, allowing greater
representation of minority views in the Parliament. This was his attempt to
improve the machinery
of government, so as to improve the quality of government
in Australia. Whether the system is beneficial or not, remains uncertain.
It
certainly exacerbates the problems of responsible government. However, one must
admire Clark's conviction and his efforts to devise
and implement this
reform.</p>
<p>Clark introduced constitutional reform to expand the franchise for both men
and women, and to deal with deadlocks between the two
Houses. The Bill was
defeated.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[14]</a></sup> He also failed to
achieve the passage of legislation to remove the plural, property-based, vote.
His concern with electoral law extended
to the corruption of the political
system though the large amounts of money spent on political campaigns. He
concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
Gross and direct bribery may have become comparatively rare, but so long as the
love of power urges men to spend money to obtain
it, and so long as the
expenditure of money for this purpose promotes the result to which it is
directed, the practice will continue.
It is therefore evident that the full
ideal of representative government will never be realised until the power and
influence of
money are eliminated from Parliamentary
elections.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[15]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Clark
also had strong social views. According to Petrow, Clark opposed increasing
customs duties because the poor suffered more than
the rich, and he would resign
rather than tax food.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Clark's many failures in the Tasmanian Parliament to effect constitutional
and social reform are reflected in the amendments he proposed
to the draft
Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> in 1897. In debate upon the draft Bill in the
Tasmanian Parliament, Clark proposed a provision to deal with deadlocks between
the
two Houses, the imposition of the Hare-Clark electoral system for the Senate
and the introduction of fundamental rights, such as
a 'due process' clause
modeled on the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment of the United States
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[17]</a></sup> Although he did
not always succeed with his proposals, he was always prepared to advocate and
encourage reform.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading49"></a><b>CLARK'S ROLE IN THE DRAFTING OF THE COMMONWEALTH
CONSTITUTION</b></h2>
<p>Apart from the Hare-Clark voting system, Clark is most remembered for his
role in the drafting of the Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. The first draft he
provided to selected delegates prior to the Constitutional Convention of 1891
was of importance because it set
an agenda, provided a structure, and set down
words, many of which made their way into the final draft of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
The influence of Clark's initial draft, as well as his role in the 1891
Convention, is assessed in detail by Alex
Castles.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>More interesting, perhaps, is Jim Thomson's assessment of Clark's lack of
understanding of the practical working of the Constitutions
of the United States
and Canada, and the consequences for the Australian States, particularly through
the way in which the federal
distribution of powers was implemented. Clark
seemed to be of the view that the American system, ultimately adopted, of
enumerating
the powers of the Commonwealth legislature and leaving the residue
to the States, would in fact protect the local autonomy of the
States.<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[19]</a></sup> In retrospect, a system
akin to the Canadian distribution of powers, where certain powers are reserved
to the States, would have
provided better protection to them. Thomson asks
whether Clark was partly responsible for the Commonwealth legislative dominance
that exists today? Perhaps kindly, he concludes that this error cannot be blamed
on Clark. Clark, after all, was advocating the removal
of responsible
government, with the greater checks and balances involved in a separate
executive and legislature.<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[20]</a></sup>
However, once it became clear that this system was not to be adopted, further
consideration should have been given to the effect
of the proposed distribution
of legislative power.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading55"></a><b>CLARK AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW</b></h2>
<p>Clark was never appointed to the High Court. He seemed destined to fulfil
this role, but was thwarted by fate. His bitterness towards
Deakin, who failed
to appoint him to the Court, is reflected in his poetry, where he described
Deakin as:</p>
<blockquote>
...clothed in bold yet unctuous disgrace<br>Of broken faith&#8212;so cunningly
devised<br>That none could safely say that he had
lied.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[21]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Nevertheless,
Clark's contribution to constitutional law exceeds his role in the drafting of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. His <i>Studies in Australian Constitutional Law </i>has
continuing use as a resource in constitutional analysis, as is seen by its
recent reprinting and references to it in High Court
judgments.<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[22]</a></sup> Clark's judgments, as
a Justice of the Tasmanian Supreme Court, in cases such as <i>Pedder v
D'Emden</i><sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[23]</a></sup><i> </i>were also
influential.</p>
<p>Justice Kirby, in his chapter on 'Clark and the High
Court'<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[24]</a></sup> refers to the importance
of Clark's approach to constitutional interpretation (which accords with his
own). Both reject the idea
of interpreting a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> according to the views
of those long since dead. The irony is noted that reliance is placed on a long
dead Clark to support this
view.<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Justice Kirby also discusses Clark's influence on the development of the
separation of powers. He refers to the judgment of Deane
J in <i>Polyukhovich v
The Commonwealth</i><sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[26]</a></sup> in which
reliance is placed upon Clark's writings to establish the proposition that ex
post facto criminal laws breach the separation
of powers. However, in my view
this is an example of stretching the words of a man long dead for modern
purposes. If the following
pages of Clark's work are read, it makes it clear
that he was referring to civil laws (the retrospective imposition of a tax after
a tax law is found by a court to be defective) and more specifically to the
effective use of the legislature as a court of appeal
to reverse court
decisions. It is testament to Clark's ongoing relevance, however, that he is
resorted to as authority for a proposition
even when the evidence of Clark's
support for it is less than clear.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading67"></a><b>THE FUTURE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</b></h2>
<p>During the centenary of federation, the impression was often given that this
was the birth of Australia as a nation&#8212;that Australia
had shaken off the
colonial shackles and obtained sovereignty. Of course, it is not true. All that
happened was that several colonies
joined together in a federation and became
one larger federal colony. Australia's colonial status was unchanged. Australia
did not
become a 'nation' in the sense that we understand that term as importing
independence and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Clark was concerned to remove this same misconception in his time. In his
essay 'The Future of the Australian Commonwealth: A Province
or a Nation?',
Clark noted that the 'establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia has been
repeatedly described as the advent of
a new nation' but that Australia cannot be
considered a nation while it is still an appendage of an empire, subject to the
paramount
legislative and executive and judicial authority of the sovereignty of
the British nation.<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[27]</a></sup> Clark
observed that:</p>
<blockquote>
The Commonwealth of Australia, like the Dominion of Canada, remains historically
and politically a portion of the comprehensive British
nation as much as each
separate colony which has become a State of the Commonwealth was a portion of
that nation before the Commonwealth
was
established.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[28]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Clark
considered that the growth in the locally born population would establish an
Australian nationalism, which would result in resistance
to the use of the power
of the Crown to disallow Commonwealth legislation. He even predicted the British
response, being a 'prudent
disuse of the royal veto' which would 'prolong the
connection of the Commonwealth with the Empire for a long period'. He considered
it inevitable, however, that Australian sentiment would eventually demand the
abolition of this power, resulting in the advent of
Australian
sovereignty.<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[29]</a></sup> Over one hundred
years later, the 'royal veto' remains in 'prudent disuse', but the power has yet
to be removed from the face of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 59.</a></p>
<p>Clark considered that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> contained within it the power to
transform the Australian Commonwealth into a republic. During the recent
republic debate in Australia,
questions were raised about the preamble and
covering clauses to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and whether they needed to be amended for
Australia to become a republic, or whether this could be achieved by referendum
alone.
Victoria even introduced a bill consenting and requesting to the repeal
of the preamble and covering clauses
2&#8211;8.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[30]</a></sup> One hundred years
earlier, however, in a debate on the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Bill in the Tasmanian House of
Assembly, Clark noted that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Bill vested the power of amendment
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> in the people, and that the people could amend it so as to
vest executive power in the Governor-General and appoint the Governor-General
in
any way they wished. He observed that this had been the deliberate intention of
Sir Samuel Griffith, Charles Kingston and himself
in drafting the 1891
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Bill.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[31]</a></sup> This shocked
some Members of the Tasmanian Parliament, with a former Premier exclaiming that
it was 'a march towards republicanism'.
If so, it was a very slow march
indeed.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading78"></a><b>CLARK'S CONTINUING LEGACY</b></h2>
<p>Henry Reynolds warns that the contemporary relevance of Clark's ideas bring
him closer to us than he really is. While we think of
him as an intellectual
contemporary, it is wrong to remove him from the time and place in which he
lived.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[32]</a></sup> He is right. The allure
of this book, for me, was the startling current relevance of many of the words
of a man who wrote one hundred
years ago. I was also captivated by the depth of
the knowledge, commitment, and passion of this politician, unmatched by most of
his contemporaries today. Most politicians today 'practise' politics, but few
today think so deeply about the machinery of government
and how the best form of
government can be achieved. Fewer still have shaped and moulded that system, as
did Clark through his electoral
reform and constitution-building.</p>

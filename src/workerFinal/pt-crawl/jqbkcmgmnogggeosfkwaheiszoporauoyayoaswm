<h2>Sensation -Malbrokskloof and Ld como h</h2>

<hr>

<p>In his 1969 monograph on <i>Sorocephalus</i>, John Rourke
noted that the Pinhead Powderpuff <i>So teretifolius</i> had been
collected by Drege at a locality known as Malbrokskloof. Two
records &#150; 7-February-1828 and 19-September-1833 were
collected from &quot;Between Uitkyk and Malbrokskloof.&quot; This
locality was important as this species had only been collected
twice since Drege collected it &#150; by Elsie Esterhuysen
&quot;between DuToitskloof Peak and Goudini Sneeukop&quot; and
Peter Jackson &quot;on Wemmershoek summit ridge. John surmized,
based on other records collected by Drege, that this kloof was
just north of the summit of DuToitskloof Pass.</p>

<p>But then in the 1980&#146;s a population of <a href="conebu3.htm#ldcomohf">Villiersdorp Ridgecone Conebush <i>Ld
comosum homaeophyllum</i></a> was discovered above Villiersdorp
by Mr Louis de Wet. This was sensational, as this subspecies was
known from only one locality: &quot;Malbrokskloof,
Dutoitskloof,&quot; collected on 20-February-1828 and
12-December-1828. This clinched the locality. Malbrokskloof could
not be the upper end of Dutoitskloof near to Paarl (as Ion
Williams surmized in 1972, based on the fact that Drege visited
the kloof so frequently) but the kloof south of Stettynskloof Dam
leading up to the saddle at &quot;High Noon.&quot; And sure
enough, the Pinhead Powderpuff has been found there as well
&#150; and atlassed too.</p>

<p>And then came the midweek team. While atlassing the road above
Du Toits Kloof Pass on the farm &quot;De poort van du Toits
kloof,&quot; while the farmer was bagging Ivan for trespassing,
we bagged <i>Leucadendron comosum homaeophyllum </i>within
50&nbsp;m of the road, just round the corner from the
farmer&#146;s house. Only a few plants, but with the needle-like
leaves and distinctive cone, this could only be the Villiersdorp
Ridgecone Conebush. </p>

<p>So, 170 years after having been discovered, <i>Ld comosum
homaeophyllum</i> has pinned down the locality of Malbrokskloof!
None other than the upper Dutoitskloof Pass, between the summit
overlooking Paarl and the old tunnel. The plants were in sight of
thousands of motorists every year! Much more alarming, for the
conservation ecologists, the farmer has been picking this species
for many years and it has been regularly on sale in Cape Town.
The picking is sustainable, so this is not the problem. The
problem is that no one who bought the flower bunches noticed this
once-thought extinct species. Do people really not bother about
the flowers they buy, as long as they look pretty? Even the
farmer was surprised by the news &#150; &quot;It has always been
there - I have been picking it for years&quot;.</p>

<p>So now all that remains is to find out if John Rourke was
really correct, with his detective work. To do that we need to
find the Pinhead Powderpuff nearby. Come on! Let&#146;s go!</p>

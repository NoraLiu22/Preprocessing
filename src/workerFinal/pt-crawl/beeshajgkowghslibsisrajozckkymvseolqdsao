OR LAYING THE GROUND FOR REFORM? </b></h1>
<p align="center"><b><i>Steven
White<sup><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[*]</a></sup></i></b></p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading6"></a><b>I 	INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
<p>Human treatment of other animals has been the subject of intense scholarly
and more general public deliberation for many years, especially
in the wake of
the 1975 publication of Australian philosopher Peter Singer's book <i>Animal
Liberation</i>.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[1]</a></sup> In the United
States, this debate has permeated the discipline of law to the extent that there
are now more than 90 animal law courses
conducted in universities around the
country,a significant and growing scholarly literature, multiple edition
textbooks<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[2]</a></sup> and dedicated law
journals.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[3]</a></sup> Despite the Australian
provenance of a major contributor to the contemporary philosophical debate, the
Australian legal academy has
shown relatively little interest in this important
area.<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[4]</a></sup> The aim of this article is to
contribute to the fledging Australian legal scholarship in animal law by
critically analysing the respective
roles of the Commonwealth, States and
Territories in the regulation of animal
welfare, focussing principally on the welfare of companion
and farmed animals. </p>
<p>The regulation of animal welfare has long been the responsibility of the
States and Territories. The <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> does not specifically
address animal welfare matters and, historically, the Commonwealth's role in
this area has not been a significant
one. However, institutional demands for
increased national and international cooperation on matters of animal welfare
are forcing
the Commonwealth to take a more active role. Despite a lack of
specific constitutional power, the Commonwealth has assumed an increasingly
influential position in the regulation of animal welfare, especially concerning
farmed animals.</p>
<p>By contrast with its far-reaching intervention in other areas of regulation
in which the States and Territories have formerly held
primary responsibility,
such as industrial relations,<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[6]</a></sup> the
Commonwealth has been much more respectful of 'States' rights' in the area of
animal welfare. It will be argued that this reticence
serves only to entrench
the flawed approach to regulation adopted by the States and Territories, centred
on a prohibition against
cruelty and a positive duty of care ('the standard
regulatory approach'). It will be argued that the standard regulatory approach
is deficient in a number of respects, particularly in the regulation of the
treatment of farmed animals. First, despite the adoption
of an anti-cruelty
standard and a positive duty of care, whole categories of animals, including
farmed animals, are exempted from
the protection of these standards. Second,
even where the standards remain applicable, they are not strictly enforced.
Third, more
fundamentally, regulatory standards fall well short of adequately
addressing the relevant risk (ie that animals, as sentient creatures,
will not
be provided with the necessary care for a decent life).</p>
<p>The standard regulatory approach is marked by an underlying irrationality
&#8212; the insistence on treating farmed and companion
animals differently,
even though both categories comprise sentient creatures capable of feeling
pain.<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[7]</a></sup> It will be argued that,
despite increasing Commonwealth influence in the area of animal welfare
regulation, there is little evidence
of a Commonwealth challenge to this
irrationality. This is perhaps not surprising given that in two areas where the
Commonwealth
has exercised direct regulatory responsibility for the treatment of
animals &#8212; the live export of farmed animals and trade in
wildlife &#8212;
irrational distinctions are made in the application of welfare standards.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of this article provides a brief overview of the history of animal
welfare regulation in Australia. The prevailing regulatory approach
of the
States and Territories to the treatment of companion and farmed animals is
described and critically assessed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III</a> considers some constitutional limitations on Commonwealth power to
regulate in this area. It then considers two areas in which the
Commonwealth has
been able to directly regulate animal welfare &#8212; live export of farmed
animals and trade in wildlife. The former,
in which the Commonwealth has largely
allowed industry self-regulation, has been marked by regulatory failure.
Different regulatory
welfare standards applicable to live export of farmed
animals on the one hand, and export of wildlife on the other, will be
highlighted.
 </p>
<p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part IV</a> contends that despite constitutional limitations the Commonwealth
exerts a growing influence on the regulation of animal welfare.
It is argued
that although the role of the Commonwealth has the potential to be quite
far-reaching, the Commonwealth's major contribution
to date, the development of
the <i>Australian Animal Welfare
Strategy</i>,<sup><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[8]</a></sup> merely endorses the
standard regulatory approach of the States and Territories, and is for that
reason flawed.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading25"></a><b>II	BACKGROUND TO ANIMAL WELFARE REGULATION IN
AUSTRALIA</b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading26"></a><b>A	 History and Development</b></h3>
<p>The first Australian anti-cruelty legislation was enacted in Van Dieman's
Land in 1837.<sup><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[9]</a></sup> New South Wales
enacted legislation of this type next, although not until
1850,<sup><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[10]</a></sup> and other colonies
followed in the 1860s.<sup><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[11]</a></sup> Jamieson
argues that this legislation, consistent with its English antecedents, was
premised at least partly on a desire to exert
some control over the 'lower
classes', an issue of some concern following revolutions in Europe in 1848 and
the emergence of universal
suffrage.<sup><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[12]</a></sup> Initially, such
legislation was not separately labelled as 'animal welfare' or 'anti-cruelty'
legislation. Instead, animal cruelty
offences were included in criminal
laws:</p>
<blockquote>
The growth of animal cruelty legislation in the colonies as a means of social
control is reinforced by the early inclusion of such
provisions almost
exclusively in colonial police offences laws, remaining so in Victoria as late
as 1966. The legislation of all
four colonies active in animal welfare in the
1860s is to be found in Police
Acts.<sup><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[13]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The early
legislation established a broadly expressed prohibition on cruelty to
animals.<sup><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[14]</a></sup> Following the reforms
of the 1860s, this broad prohibition was refined, becoming more particular and,
importantly, subject to a range
of exemptions. The fundamental structure of
anti-cruelty legislation, established in the 1850s and 1860s, and refined
through exemptions,
remains in place
today.<sup><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The key plank of such legislation is to criminalise cruel acts against
animals (eg '[a] person must not be cruel to an
animal'<sup><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[16]</a></sup>). This broadly expressed
standard is usually qualified such that it is not cruelty per se which is
illegal, but acts causing <i>unnecessary</i> suffering. For example, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/acapa2001229/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(2)</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/acapa2001229/" class="autolink_findacts">Animal Care and Protection Act 2001</a></i> (Qld) defines animal cruelty as
including 'pain that, in the circumstances, is unjustifiable, unnecessary or
unreasonable'. In Victoria,
the offence of cruelty is exclusively defined by
listed practices, including acts or omissions leading to 'unreasonable pain or
suffering'.<sup><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the States began including exemptions
for particular types of farming practices, such as the dehorning of cattle,
castration,
spaying, ear-splitting and
branding.<sup><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[18]</a></sup> In a further
significant expansion of this area of exemption in the 1970s and 1980s, the
States shifted to a model of blanket exemptions
for farming practices. Jamieson
gives the example of Victoria, which in 1980 amended anti-cruelty legislation to
provide that 'no
farming activity would infringe the Act when undertaken "in
accordance with accepted farming
practice".'<sup><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[19]</a></sup> The inclusion of
such exemptions is consistent with Australia's traditionally significant
reliance on rural industry. As Jamieson
suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
Australia being a country so heavily dependent even today on the activities of
its rural sector, one would expect in any utilitarian
humanist calculation
substantial concessions to that industry from the operation of the anti-cruelty
laws in recognition of its fundamental
importance to the Australian
economy.<sup><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[20]</a></sup> </blockquote><p>The
inclusion of significant exemptions remains in place today. Their operation can
be broadly summarised as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
All jurisdictions have an exemption from offences under the legislation where
there is compliance with relevant codes of [practice].
Codes are especially
important in the areas of farm animal production and transportation, and the use
of animals in scientific experiments.
In most jurisdictions, a person who
complies with an applicable code in their dealings with an animal will be
exempted from the offence
provisions. Codes [may] take the form of delegated
legislation, and compliance may or may not be compulsory. Other exemptions in
some of the statutes include Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander custom or
tradition, slaughter of an animal as part of religious
faith, self-defence
against an animal, normal animal husbandry, hunting, and acts controlling feral
animals and pests (although in
the latter case there is usually a requirement
that as little pain as reasonable be
caused).<sup><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[21]</a></sup></blockquote><p>A
notable development in anti-cruelty legislation since the 19<sup>th</sup>
century is the inclusion of a positive duty of care owed to animals. A
prohibition on cruelty is negative in character, establishing
what a person must
not do to animals. More recently, some of the States and Territories have
included the imposition of positive
duties on those responsible for animals. For
example, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/acapa2001229/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/acapa2001229/" class="autolink_findacts">Animal Care and Protection Act 2001</a></i> (Qld) requires a
person in charge of an animal to take reasonable steps to meet an animal's
needs, including the provision of food,
water and suitable accommodation or
living conditions; to enable the animal to display normal behaviour; and to
treat disease or
injury. Such provisions recognise that animal welfare can
require more than a mere prohibition against cruelty.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading49"></a><b>B	Standard regulatory approach</b></h3>
<h4>
<a name="Heading50"></a><b><i>(i)	 Companion animals</i></b></h4>
<p>Although there is some variation between the States and Territories, the
typical model of enforcement of animal welfare law limits
the authority to
enforce regulatory standards to agents of three authorities: the police, a
departmental authority and the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of
Animals ('RSPCA').</p>
<p>The role of the police is generally limited. In Australia, as in the United
Kingdom, 'for the police, animal law forms only a very
small part of their
general duty to enforce the criminal law and investigate the commission of
offences'.<sup><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, the RSPCA and the relevant department have formalised
their respective enforcement roles. For example, in Queensland,
RSPCA Qld and
the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries have entered into a
memorandum of understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
The MOU was jointly developed by the DPI&amp;F and the RSPCA, with all clauses
subject to mutual agreement. &#8230; The question
of who enforces the [Act] is
influenced by location and expertise. &#8230; Although not a mandated
requirement under the MOU, it
is mutually accepted [that] the DPI&amp;F will
generally have primary responsibility for dealing with livestock animal welfare
issues.
Conversely, the RSPCA largely has responsibility for companion animal
issues. This division of responsibilities is not an issue of
constraining
operations of agencies, but rather one of logistics and operational
practicality.<sup><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[23]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Such
an arrangement is purely a matter of political-administrative convenience, and
is not a legislative requirement. It should also
be noted that even in
jurisdictions where there is no formal memorandum of understanding between
enforcement agencies, the burden
of enforcing the law, at least in relation to
companion animals,<sup><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[24]</a></sup> is largely
assumed by the RSPCA.</p>
<p>What is the regulatory framework within which the RSPCA exercises its powers
of enforcement? The first point to be made here is that
the sphere within which
the RSPCA operates is 'civil', rather than economic:</p>
<blockquote>
In mapping out the variety of non-state actors it is useful to distinguish
between the state, the economy and civil society. The
economic sphere includes,
for example, markets and a broad range of profit motivated organizations and
activities embracing, for
example, finance and industry. The civil sphere
comprises non-governmental organizations (NGOs), charities, trusts, foundations,
advocacy groups and national and international non-state
associations.<sup><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[25]</a></sup></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><p>Increased understanding of the regulatory role of non-state
actors has grown alongside changes in public governance, including shifts
to
outsourcing and privatisation (the 'decentring' of
regulation).<sup><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[26]</a></sup> Interestingly, the
RSPCA is a very early example of a non-state actor being relied upon by the
state to pursue enforcement of legislation,
with the organisation engaged in
prosecutions almost from its inception in
1822.<sup><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second important point about the regulatory framework within which the
RSPCA operates is that the regulation of the treatment
of companion animals,
even in the absence of a direct state role, is a classic example of command and
control regulation, 'the exercise
of influence by imposing standards backed by
criminal sanctions.'<sup><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[28]</a></sup> A broad
prohibition standard ('no unnecessary cruelty') is applied, supplemented in more
recent years by a positive duty of care,
with a fine and/or a jail sentence
imposed for breach of the standard.</p>
<p>It would be reductionist, however, to characterise the regulation of the
treatment of companion animals as merely command and control.
The RSPCA utilises
enforcement techniques apart from investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>One important regulatory technique employed by the RSPCA is 'communication'.
Morgan and Yeung characterise this technique as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
Simple communication-based techniques include attempts to persuade and educate
members of the regulated community, or those affected
by the regulated activity,
to act in a manner that will facilitate the achievement of regulatory goals
&#8230; [t]he aim is therefore
to bring some kind of indirect social pressure to
bear on individual decision-making in the hope that it will lead to behavioural
change.<sup><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[29]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The RSPCA
engages in significant educational and public advocacy campaigns, reflecting two
key objectives for the organisation: 'To
take whatsoever steps are necessary to
educate the community with regard to the humane treatment of animals' and 'to
diffuse information
about the care, protection and treatment of animals by
publishing and circulating literature and conducting lectures, seminars and
competitions'.<sup><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another important regulatory technique available to the RSPCA in some
jurisdictions is the ability to issue enforceable directions,
providing guidance
and/or a warning to companion animal owners who are committing or may be about
to commit a breach of the legislation.
For example, in Queensland, inspectors
are authorised to issue 'animal welfare directions' to persons in charge of an
animal, requiring
certain steps to be taken relating to the welfare of the
animal.<sup><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[31]</a></sup> The directions are
generally in written form, and are required to set out quite detailed
information about what action is needed
and the time frame for doing so. Breach
of an animal welfare direction is an offence. Legislative provision for animal
welfare directions
provides a formal mechanism for the exercise of discretion in
enforcement. This form of regulatory technique can be characterised
as
compliance regulation, with the regulator engaging in a 'conversation' with the
regulated.<sup><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[32]</a></sup> It can be used both
as an educative tool and as a spur, under threat of prosecution, to
compliance.</p>
<p>In summary, therefore, the RSPCA employs both compliance and deterrent
approaches to the task of enforcement of animal welfare standards
for the
treatment of companion animals, consistent with the argument of Ayres and
Braithwaite that '[t]o reject punitive regulation
is naive; to be totally
committed to it is to lead a charge of the Light Brigade. The trick of
successful regulation is to establish
a synergy between punishment and
persuasion.'<sup><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Part of the explanation for the RSPCA's multi-faceted approach to enforcement
is the high cost of deterrence through prosecution.
This is consistent with the
observation that '[p]roponents of deterrence tend to argue that compliance
approaches are indicative
of &#8230; lack of enforcement
resources'.<sup><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[34]</a></sup> Lack of funding
significantly constrains the RSPCA's ability to provide adequate numbers of
inspectors. As RSPCA Australia suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
The Inspectorate plays a vital role within the RSPCA and maintaining their
presence is essential in providing continuity of animal
welfare services to the
community &#8230; The associated costs of funding just one RSPCA Inspector can
be as much as $100,000 each
year, which constitutes a large part of each
Society's annual budget. Whilst each state and territory RSPCA struggles to
raise enough
funds for its existing Inspectors, the sad reality is that, more
Inspectors are desperately
needed.<sup><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[35]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Figures
collated by RSPCA Australia show that in 2005&#8211;06, RSPCA inspectors
investigated a total of 38,913 cruelty complaints,
with 337 prosecutions and 254
convictions.<sup><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[36]</a></sup> The
prosecution/conviction to investigation ratio is low. Limited resources mean
that only those cases that are almost certain to
succeed are prosecuted since,
in the words of RSPCA Victoria, 'the RSPCA cannot afford to
lose.'<sup><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[37]</a></sup></p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading87"></a><b><i>(ii)	 Farmed animals</i></b></h4>
<p>Despite appearing to be governed by the same broad legislative scheme as that
for companion animals, the regulation of the treatment
of farmed
animals<sup><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[38]</a></sup> differs in significant
ways. This is because the treatment of farmed animals is exempted from the
overarching cruelty and duty of
care standards included in animal welfare
legislation.</p>
<p>A feature of animal welfare legislation in most of the States and Territories
is the incorporation of codes of practice addressing
welfare issues in a range
of settings in which animals are exploited by humans, principally in the areas
of farming, scientific research
and entertainment. In the key area of farming,
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ('CSIRO')
publishes
a number of Model Codes of Practice for the Welfare of Animals ('Model
Codes of Practice'), developed by the Primary Industries Ministerial
Council
('PIMC'). These codes of practice range across a number of categories of farmed
animals, including cattle, poultry, pigs,
sheep, buffalo and camels, and cover
titles dealing with land transportation and feral
animals.<sup><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p> The codes are regularly updated, although some date as far back as 1991. The
Model Codes of Practice set minimum standards for the
welfare of farmed animals.
Crucially, as illustrated below, these minimum standards may be lower than the
'no-cruelty' standard established
in offence provisions in the primary
legislation.</p>
<p>Most of the States and Territories either adopt the Model Codes of Practice
directly or prepare their own codes based on the Model
Codes. There is
considerable variation in the extent to which the codes are adopted and their
effect once they are adopted. The typical
approach is for primary legislation to
allow for the adoption of codes of practice by regulation or disallowable
instrument, with
the regulation or disallowable instrument then adopting some or
all of the Model Codes of Practice (or codes of practice based on
the Model
Codes). Significantly, most jurisdictions then provide that compliance with the
code is a defence to prosecution for cruelty.</p>
<p>For example, in Queensland, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/acapa2001229/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/acapa2001229/" class="autolink_findacts">Animal Care and Protection Act
2001</a></i> (Qld) provides that it is a defence to a charge of cruelty if there has
been compliance with a relevant code of practice. Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/acapa2001229/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2</a> and sch 1 of the
<i>Animal Care and Protection Regulation 2002 </i>(Qld), all of the Model Codes
of Practice have been adopted, although compliance with them is voluntary and
some of the Model Codes
of Practice listed are not the most recent published by
the CSIRO. The effect of this arrangement is that a farmer of cattle, for
instance, is not legally compelled to comply with the Model Code of Practice
dealing with cattle. However, if the farmer was charged
with a cruelty offence,
and wished to rely on the code as a defence, he or she would need to demonstrate
compliance with the code.</p>
<p>This general approach is also followed in
Victoria, South Australia, the
Northern Territory, the Australian Capital
Territory and
Western
Australia.<sup><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[44]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In Tasmania, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/awa1993128/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 50(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/awa1993128/" class="autolink_findacts">Animal Welfare Act 1993</a></i> (Tas) provides for
incorporation of codes of practice by regulation, but this has not occurred.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/awa1993128/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 44</a> allows the Minister to approve 'standards of animal welfare', and
these are 'to be followed in the care and management of animals'.
The Minister
has approved a number of codes of practice, including some of the Model Codes of
Practice, as animal welfare standards.
Their status, however, is uncertain. The
legislation does not provide that compliance with these animal welfare standards
amounts
to a defence to a prosecution for cruelty. The Act has recently been
reviewed, and some of these issues may be addressed in subsequent
amendments to
the Act.<sup><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>The status of codes of practice in New South Wales is much less certain. They
may be adopted under
regulations,<sup><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[46]</a></sup> and a number of the
Model Codes of Practice have been
prescribed.<sup><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[47]</a></sup> Although the codes
are not incorporated as a defence to the prohibition against cruelty, evidence
of compliance or non-compliance
is admissible in prosecution
proceedings.<sup><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[48]</a></sup> The New South Wales
primary legislation provides various directly stated exemptions from the
anti-cruelty prohibition for farmed
animals. This makes the differential
treatment of farmed animals and companion animals more readily transparent in
the primary legislation.</p>
<p>In summary, codes of practice for farmed animals detail wide-ranging
standards for care and transportation. Significantly, as illustrated
below, some
of those standards would not meet a general cruelty standard. This should not be
surprising given that compliance with
a code is generally a complete defence to
a prosecution for cruelty. Compliance with a code is generally voluntary &#8212;
the incentive
for choosing to comply with a code lies in the protection from a
prosecution for cruelty.</p>
<p>The regulation of farmed animals therefore approximates a form of command and
control regulation, since government (with significant
input from those
regulated) establishes minimum standards, with the possibility of prosecution
for non-compliance. It is approximate
because compliance with industry standards
generally operates by way of incentive rather than force.</p>
<p>In each State and Territory the relevant enforcement agency is usually the
government department responsible for administering animal
welfare legislation,
most commonly a primary industries or local government department. As has
already been discussed, there are
usually arrangements &#8212; informal or
formal (eg a memorandum of understanding) &#8212; in place between the RSPCA and
the departmental
agency demarcating enforcement roles, the RSPCA dealing with
companion animals and hobby farms, and the departmental agencies dealing
with
commercially farmed animals. By contrast with the RSPCA in each State and
Territory jurisdiction, little information on enforcement
activities is publicly
disclosed by the agencies responsible for enforcing the animal welfare standards
applicable to farmed animals.
This gap highlights a need for empirical research
into the work of these agencies. Even in the absence of such research, some
important
questions can justifiably be raised about regulatory activity in this
area, even if not yet capable of a definitive answer.</p>
<h4>
<a name="Heading113"></a><b><i>(iii)	 Critique of the standard regulatory
approach</i></b></h4>
<p>The standard regulatory approach to the treatment of companion and farmed
animals raises a number of concerns about the extent to
which the interests of
animals are protected.</p>
<p>The first concern is the type of standard used in animal welfare law. As
Bluff and Gunningham suggest: 'The choice of the type of
standard is crucial as
it influences the measures implemented to improve &#8230; performance,
compliance with &#8230; law, whether
regulatory objectives are achieved and
enforceability.'<sup><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>As has been shown, a longstanding standard adopted in animal welfare law is
the general overarching prohibition against cruelty. This
standard is broadly
expressed and heavily qualified. Cruelty is prohibited, so long as the pain
imposed on animals is not unjustifiable,
unnecessary or
unreasonable.<sup><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[50]</a></sup> Increasingly, as
has also been shown, animal welfare law also imposes a positive duty on those
responsible for the care of animals
to meet the welfare needs of those animals.
Radford argues that these two requirements &#8212; a duty to not be cruel and a
duty
to promote the welfare of an animal &#8212; are distinct, even if they do
overlap to some extent:</p>
<blockquote>
[Welfare] involves taking account of influences which may be either positive or
negative, while cruelty is concerned only with treatment
that is deleterious.
This distinction is reflected in the thrust of public policy. On the one hand,
the intention is to <i>prevent</i> cruel treatment by proscribing particular
forms of behaviour. On the other, the aim is to <i>promote</i> improved
standards of welfare by identifying those matters which are important to
animals, and translating these into rules, guidance,
and advice, to which those
responsible for their care are required to have due
regard.<sup><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[51]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Regardless
of whether these duties are regarded as being distinct, or, perhaps more
appropriately, as fitting along a continuum with
cruelty at one end, they are
broadly expressed, malleable concepts. The broad duties in animal welfare law
most closely resemble
what Bluff and Gunningham define as general duties or
'principle based' standards. Two notable aspects of general duty standards
are
'the broad nature of the duty to take all (reasonably) practicable measures' and
'the fact that they do not specify a clear performance
outcome.'<sup><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are some advantages in adopting a general duty:</p>
<p>First, such a duty is all-encompassing, requiring attention to be given to a
wide range of potential harms.<sup><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[53]</a></sup>
Most animal welfare law provides a non-exhaustive list of the types of matters
which may amount to cruelty, indicative of the range
of potential harms which
the general duty addresses.<sup><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, the broad nature of a general duty means that it does not date
quickly.<sup><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[55]</a></sup> This is clearly true of
the prevailing cruelty standard in animal welfare law &#8212; as has been shown,
this standard was established
in Australia more than 150 years ago.</p>
<p>However, as Bluff and Cunningham point out, the broad nature of general
duties is a two-edged sword:</p>
<blockquote>
the very breadth and flexibility of general duties entail considerable
uncertainty for duty holders as well as for &#8230; inspectors.
The lack of
guidance provided to duty holders about the outcomes required of them &#8230;
means that it is uncertain whether the
duty of care has been complied with until
and unless a matter is actually tested in
court.<sup><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[56]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
relation to the treatment of farmed animals, this uncertainty is resolved by
deferring to codes of practice, although where these
are not complied with a
court is still required to consider whether, in the absence of compliance, the
practice was nonetheless cruel
or inconsistent with a positive duty of care.
</p>
<p>The uncertainty around what is required to satisfy general duties is
amplified in an animal welfare setting because of the qualification
limiting the
prohibition on cruelty to that which is 'unnecessary, unreasonable or
unjustified'. This qualification has been celebrated
as making an important
contribution to the improved treatment of animals:</p>
<blockquote>
The concept of unnecessary suffering, which has been developed by the courts and
widely adopted by the legislature, has two very
considerable merits. First, it
may be applied to a multitude of different situations. Secondly, it can be
constantly reinterpreted
by the courts in the light of greater understanding
about animal suffering, and changing social attitudes regarding the proper
treatment
of
animals.<sup><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[57]</a></sup></blockquote><p>However,
there are good reasons to be cautious about the 'benefits' of the flexibility
inherent in this qualification, and the broader
standard of cruelty per
se.<sup><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>First, at least in Australia, there is very little higher court consideration
of these provisions &#8212; as a summary offence, almost
all prosecutions are
finally disposed of in magistrates' courts. This carries the risk of uneven
application of legislation both
within the States and Territories and across
jurisdictions. Second, the uncertainty of what is required to satisfy the 'no
unnecessary
suffering' standard creates the risk that in marginal cases the
interests of animals will always be
downplayed.<sup><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>A second concern with the standard regulatory approach is lack of adequate
enforcement. As has been shown, financial constraints may
severely limit the
ability of the RSPCA to prosecute breaches of regulatory standards for the
treatment of companion animals. By
necessity, it pursues prosecutions in a
highly selective way. Concerning the treatment of farmed animals, there is
little publicly
disclosed information on enforcement activities by relevant
enforcement agencies. It is likely that prosecution rates are low, although
the
reasons for this may be more complex than resource constraints.</p>
<p>One consequence of very low rates of prosecution is that in practice the
limits of standards in animal welfare law have not been subject
to sustained
judicial scrutiny. Arguably, enforcement of animal welfare law is distinguished
by the limitations identified by Baldwin
and Cave as particularly associated
with command and control regimes, where 'rules attending such regimes have to be
brought to bear
on the ground by bodies of officials or inspectors but
enforcement is expensive, the techniques used give rise to contention, and
the
effects of enforcement are said to be
uncertain.'<sup><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>A third concern with the standard regulatory approach to the treatment of
companion and farmed animals is the distinction between
standards applicable to
each category of animal. The way in which the codes are adopted in State and
Territory legislation is to
institutionalise the possibility of cruelty to
farmed animals in a way that would not be permissible for companion animals. By
providing
that compliance with codes is a defence to a charge of cruelty or
breach of duty, or at least evidence relevant to a prosecution,
as most of the
State and Territory legislation does, the way is clear for cruel practices to be
legally sanctioned.</p>
<p>For example, the Model Code of Practice for pigs endorses intensive farming
of pigs, including in special farrowing crates and stalls
where individual
animals are kept.<sup><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[61]</a></sup> Under the
code, the recommended minimum space for sows kept in stalls is 0.6m x 2m (newly
established stalls are required to be 0.6m
x
2.2m).<sup><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[62]</a></sup> Farrowing crates are
special stalls where pregnant sows are moved to give birth. The recommended
minimum space for these crates is
0.5m x
2m.<sup><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[63]</a></sup> Pigs can be confined in
these stalls for up to 16 weeks (to be reduced to six weeks in 10 years
time).<sup><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[64]</a></sup> Confinement in these
stalls causes physical harm and psychological stress to
pigs.<sup><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p> These aspects of intensive farming are manifestly
cruel,<sup><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[66]</a></sup> and for this reason have
been banned or are being phased out in countries of the European Union and New
Zealand.<sup><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[67]</a></sup> The cruel nature of sow
stalls and farrowing crates was, arguably, implicitly recognised by the code
itself, at least in its earlier
second edition. It suggested that '[p]racticable
alternatives to current conventional stalls (eg turnaround stalls or use of
group
housing) should be considered as they are developed' and that
'[p]racticable alternatives to the current farrowing crates should
be considered
as they are developed.'<sup><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[68]</a></sup> Despite
the obviously cruel nature of the intensive farming of pigs, and the certainty
that similar practices inflicted on a companion
animal such as a dog would be
illegal, compliance with animal welfare standards in the pig code will be a
defence to a prosecution
for cruelty.</p>
<p>On what basis can the application of differential standards applicable to the
two categories of animal be justified?</p>
<p>The answer to this question entails a consideration of the legal status of
the subjects of regulation, and of the reason for why the
treatment of companion
and farmed animals is regulated at all.</p>
<p>Regulation of the treatment of domesticated animals occurs in a context in
which those animals are the property of humans. As Halsbury's
Laws of Australia
puts it, 'domestic animals, like other personal and moveable chattels, are the
subject of absolute property.'<sup><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[69]</a></sup>
In essence, animal welfare legislation regulates the manner in which property
owners are entitled to exploit their property. Why
regulate the treatment of
domesticated animals, including companion and farmed animals, if they are
analogous to personal property
such as inanimate chattels? One persuasive answer
is that domesticated animals are sentient creatures, both capable of leading a
fulfilling life and of feeling pain. In moral terms, these facts demand that
constraints be placed on the ways in which humans may
treat
animals.<sup><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[70]</a></sup> If regulation of the
treatment of animals is conceptualised as minimising risk, the relevant risk
here is that in the absence of
state intervention, animals will be exposed to
harm by their owners and/or third parties. Sunstein articulates this
justification
for regulatory intervention as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
The idea here is that animals, species as such, and perhaps even natural objects
warrant respect for their own sake, and quite apart
from interactions with human
beings. Sometimes such arguments posit general rights held by living creatures
(and natural objects)
against human depredations. In especially powerful forms,
these arguments are utilitarian in character, stressing the often extreme
and
unnecessary suffering of animals who are hurt or killed. &#8230; [Animal welfare
legislation] reflects these
concerns.<sup><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[71]</a></sup></blockquote><p>However,
if regulatory intervention is justified by the sentiency of animals and the
potential for harm which they may suffer, on
what basis can differential
standards of care applicable to companion and farmed animals be explained? Given
their shared sentiency,
there is no rational basis for distinguishing between
the two. Rather, the key factor in understanding this dichotomy is the property
status (and hence economic value) of animals:</p>
<blockquote>
economic theory tells us that rational property owners will only harm their
animal property for good reason; ie, if it will produce
a societal benefit.
Therefore, anticruelty statutes need only protect against the irrational
property owner &#8212; one who causes
or allows harm to his property that is of
no benefit to society. Viewed in this manner, the focus of anticruelty statutes
on the
prevention of gratuitous suffering is effectively a regulation of the
irrational property owner, while the conduct of rational property
owners is
exempted.<sup><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[72]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In
other words, the differential approach to standard setting is justified on the
grounds that while cruelty to companion animals
yields no discernible social
benefit, the same cannot be said of cruelty to farmed animals. By permitting
some cruelty to farmed
animals, farmers can adopt production methods that are
more efficient than would be possible if higher standards of care were
applicable,
in turn allowing for the supply of slaughtered animals to consumers
at a lower price.<sup><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>Differential standards might also be justified on democratic grounds, on the
basis that they reflect 'societal preference'. Ibrahim
articulates this
justification as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
As representative bodies, legislatures are implementing a collective choice that
society has made to allow the exploitation of animals
so long as it produces a
human benefit. &#8230;. society's practical desire for the benefits of animal
exploitation outweighs its
theoretical desire that animals suffer only if
necessary, and, consequently, the exceptions to anticruelty statutes swallow the
rule.<sup><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[74]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
economic and democratic justifications made for differential standards setting
are pragmatic. They fail to fully acknowledge the
more fundamental reason for
regulation &#8212; that animals, both companion and farmed, are sentient
creatures capable of experiencing
pain and leading a fulfilling life. In other
words, so long as differential standards continue to apply to companion and
farmed animals,
the standard regulatory approach must be accepted as being
incoherent, at least in moral and scientific
terms.<sup><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[75]</a></sup> </p>
<p>This duality is possible because a key assumption underpinning both economic
and democratic justifications for the differential treatment
of companion and
farmed animals, an engaged and informed citizenry, is not satisfied. Many common
farming practices are unknown to
the general public. The result is that:</p>
<blockquote>
Every day of every year, people engage in practices that ensure extraordinary
suffering for animals. If those practices were highly
visible, they would change
because many people already believe they are morally unacceptable. This point
makes existing treatment
of animals extremely unusual. A great deal of progress
could be made, not by challenging existing moral judgments, but by ensuring
they
are actually
respected.<sup><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[76]</a></sup></blockquote><p>A
command and control regulatory model fails to adequately address this
informational deficit. Leslie and Sunstein suggest the need
for a different
regulatory approach:</p>
<blockquote>
Among the most dramatic developments of the last decades &#8230; has been the
shift from command-and-control regulation to disclosure
of information as a
regulatory tool. In countless areas, government has required agencies and
companies not to alter their practices,
but to disclose them. Sometimes the goal
is to make democratic processes work better by providing people with information
to inform
their political judgments &#8230; And sometimes the goal is to make
markets work better by giving people information that bears on
their
choices.<sup><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[77]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
disclosure of common farming practices which cause suffering to animals may lead
consumers to pay more for animals (and associated
animal products) which have
not been subject to such practices. However, even if this does not occur,
whether due to financial pragmatism
or collective action problems:</p>
<blockquote>
information about animal suffering may [still] have significant effects on the
political domain. It may energize public debate, activating
ordinary citizens
and representatives alike. To the extent that this effect is a product of
increased information, exposing practices
previously hidden from public view,
there is every reason to welcome
it.<sup><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[78]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In summary,
the standard regulatory approach in place today for the treatment of animals is
rooted in measures first introduced more
than a century ago. This approach
entails, first, the adoption of a general prohibition standard (no unnecessary
cruelty) and a general
duty standard (duty to take steps to meet the welfare
needs of an animal), second, the grant of an exemption from these standards
in
respect of significant categories of animals, including farmed animals, and,
third, the placement of enforcement responsibilities
into the hands of poorly
resourced public benevolent societies and/or opaque departmental authorities.
Apart from the introduction
of positive duties of care, reform at the State and
Territory level in recent times has been uneven and modest, centred on
increasing
the penalties for breach of anti-cruelty prohibitions.</p>
<p>Given the shortcomings I have identified with this regulatory structure, and
the cautious approach to change on the part of the States
and Territories, is
significant reform possible and likely? Having established the general
background to animal welfare regulation
in Australia, centred on the States and
Territories, Part III of this article considers the role of the Commonwealth. As
will be
argued below, the Commonwealth is playing an increasingly influential
role in this regulatory arena. However, whether the Commonwealth
will exert its
influence to address the shortcomings in the standard regulatory approach of the
States and Territories is uncertain
at best.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading182"></a><b>III	THE COMMONWEALTH'S ROLE IN ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATION: CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS</b></h2>
<h3>
<a name="Heading183"></a><b>A	No constitutional head of power</b></h3>
<p>Despite the colonies having legislated in the area of animal welfare since
1837, there was no discussion of this area of legislative
competence in the
constitutional conventions of the
1890s.<sup><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[79]</a></sup> Not surprisingly, then,
the <i>Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> does not specifically address the welfare of
animals at all.<sup><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia is not alone in excluding animal welfare from its constitution. Few
western countries have taken the step of explicit constitutional
recognition of
animal welfare, although some recent national and international developments
suggest momentum for constitutional change
may be building. In 1992 the <i>Swiss
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> was amended to recognise the importance of the protection of
animals.<sup><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[81]</a></sup> In 1997 a protocol on
animal welfare was annexed to the Treaty Establishing the European Community
('Treaty of Rome'), the foundation
document of the European
Community.<sup><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[82]</a></sup> The protocol
recognises that animals are sentient beings, deserving of 'improved protection
and respect',<sup><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[83]</a></sup> and requires that
'full regard' be given to the welfare of animals in areas such as agriculture
and research.<sup><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>Further, in a noteworthy development in 2002, the German Parliament amended
the <i>German <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i> (<i>Grundgesetz</i>) to afford protection to
animals, a step designed to affirm the role of the state in protecting life,
including the lives of animals.<sup><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[85]</a></sup>
Significant recent reform of animal law in Austria incorporates the following
statement into Austrian constitutional law: 'The state
protects the life and
wellbeing of animals due to the special responsibility of mankind with respect
to animals as their fellows.'<sup><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[86]</a></sup> It
is not yet clear what the practical implications of this form of constitutional
recognition might be, but at the very least it
reflects a level of
socio-political engagement with animal welfare issues at a national level so far
absent in Australia.</p>
<p>In Australia, despite a lack of express constitutional power to regulate
animal welfare per se, the Commonwealth nonetheless indirectly
regulates aspects
of animal welfare under the
trade,<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[87]</a></sup>
quarantine<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[88]</a></sup>,
fisheries<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[89]</a></sup> and external
affairs<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[90]</a></sup> heads of power:</p>
<blockquote>
Australian Government legislation covers the welfare of animals involved in the
live animal export trade and animals processed at
export registered slaughter
establishments. It also has overall responsibility for the welfare of kangaroos
killed for commercial
purposes &#8230;, for the conduct of introduced animal
management &#8230; and for animal welfare aspects of wild animal management
and
animal research on Australian Government
lands.<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[91]</a></sup></blockquote><p>I will
consider two particular areas where the Commonwealth, relying on the quarantine,
trade and external affairs heads of power,
has directly regulated animal
welfare: the export of live farmed animals and export of wildlife. The former
area is important because
it represents a significant and highly controversial
element of the broader regulation of the treatment of farmed animals. The latter
is considered briefly, despite not concerning farmed or companion animals,
because it serves to highlight distinctions drawn between
categories of animal
which cannot be justified by reference to the sentiency of the animals
concerned, a recurring theme in animal
welfare law generally.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading203"></a><b>B 	Commonwealth regulation of the export of live
farmed animals</b></h3>
<p>The live farmed animal export trade is a controversial one, involving ship
transport of animals over long distances to destinations
with limited animal
welfare regulation. In 1985, the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare
concluded that 'if a decision were
to be made on the future of the trade purely
on animal welfare grounds, there is enough evidence to stop the trade. The trade
is,
in many respects, inimical to good animal
welfare'.<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[92]</a></sup> Despite this, the
Committee acknowledged that the economic significance of the industry meant that
it was not likely to be brought
to an end in the short-term, recommending
improved animal welfare standards and a long-term strategy to phase out the
trade.<sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[93]</a></sup> This has not come to
pass. Live animal export remains big business for Australia. Australia exports
the largest number of live animals
in the
world,<sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[94]</a></sup> consisting principally of
cattle, sheep and goats. The trade generates in excess of A$1 billion per year
in export income.<sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>The regulatory regime underpinning live export is complex, undermining
effective administration. In 1985 the Senate Select Committee
on Animal Welfare
found that 'apart from the inadequate legislative base for the trade &#8230;
there is a lack of co-ordination of
the various Federal and State Government
authorities involved in the administration of the
trade.'<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[96]</a></sup> Not much has changed.
The 2003 Keniry Report echoed these concerns, finding that 'the current
legislative and administrative framework
for the operation of the livestock
export industry is inadequate in that it does not set sufficiently clear and
enforceable standards
for such a high-risk
trade'.<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>The legislation underpinning live animal export includes the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/amalia1997407/" class="autolink_findacts">Australian
Meat and Live-Stock Industry Act 1997</a></i> (Cth), the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/eca1982203/" class="autolink_findacts">Export Control Act
1982</a></i> (Cth) and the <i>Navigation Act 1912 </i>(Cth). These statutes, and
associated regulations, establish a largely self-regulatory industry, including
in standard setting, compliance
monitoring and enforcement.</p>
<p>In relation to standard setting, the legislation does not set out animal
welfare standards. Reliance is placed on codes of practice
adopted by the States
and Territories, and Australian Livestock Export Standards ('ALES'), developed
by the Australian Livestock
Exporters' Council ('ALEC'), addressing areas such
as selection and preparation of animals for export, land transportation
requirements,
inspection for fitness to travel and humane destruction of
animals.<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[98]</a></sup></p>
<p>Until 2003, so-called 'third party' veterinarians monitored standards
compliance. In reality, they had been engaged by the exporters
whose compliance
with standards they monitored. Failure to comply with standards could be a
reason for not accrediting an exporter
and issuing an export licence. The
accreditation body which issued licences, the Australian Livestock Export
Corporation Limited
('Livecorp'), was fully owned by Australian livestock
exporters through ALEC. The conflict of interest in such a structure is obvious,
and the Keniry Report was not shy in identifying the consequences:</p>
<blockquote>
the connection between ALES and LEAP [Livecorp's Livestock Export Accreditation
Program] and the two primary pieces of Commonwealth
legislation applying to the
industry, the <i>Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1987 </i>(the AMLI
Act) and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/eca1982203/" class="autolink_findacts">Export Control Act 1982</a></i> (ECA)<i>,</i> is tenuous: 'third
party' veterinarians, who &#8230;  play a critical role in preparing animals for
export and ensuring standards
are met, are not referenced in the legislation;
and breaches of the standards do not necessarily attract any sanction unless
Livecorp
withdraws accreditation from an exporter. The Review has heard that
this rarely occurs.<br>
In this environment AQIS, as the regulator, has had difficulty achieving
effective control and coordination; and audit arrangements
are inadequate and
not sufficiently
transparent.<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[99]</a></sup></blockquote><p>As
well, the Keniry Report concluded that reliance on codes of practice adopted by
the States and Territories was problematic: </p>
<blockquote>
there are &#8230; substantial problems in relying on the Codes to set standards
for the livestock industry. To be effective, the
Codes have to be located in
substantive legislation in each State and Territory. But there is considerable
variation among States
and Territories in their approach to implementation of
the Codes and in some States and Territories the Codes have not been
incorporated
in legislation. In these circumstances, prosecution for breaches of
a Code and application of a sanction is not
possible.<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[100]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
regulatory model associated with the live export of farmed animals has therefore
reflected the worst aspects of self-regulation.
A frequent failing of
self-regulation is that:</p>
<blockquote>
legitimate objectives or rules will tend to be subverted to private purposes
where their pursuit and application is given over to
a private body that is
accountable to its private members and is in effective control of relevant
information &#8230; self-regulatory
bodies have an especially poor record in
protecting the public interest through enforcing standards against errant
members.<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[101]</a></sup></blockquote><p>The
Keniry Report into the live export of animals laid bare a text book example of
regulatory failure. Efficiency, based on the applied
expertise of live animal
exporters in compliance monitoring and enforcement, came at the cost of a total
lack of accountability and
a failure to meet the underlying mandate of
protection of animal welfare. </p>
<p>In response to this failure, the Keniry Report recommended the development of
a national live export code referenced in relevant primary
legislation,
government responsibility for the grant of export licences and for the
monitoring of compliance with the code, and third
party veterinarians to be
directly contracted by and accountable to the Australian Quarantine and
Inspection Service ('AQIS').</p>
<p>The government response has been mixed. A national live animal export code
has been developed, the <i>Australian Standards for the Export of
Livestock</i>,<sup> <a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p> but important aspects of this code rely on State and Territory animal
welfare legislation and are otherwise very broadly expressed.
For example,
standard 2.1 states that '[t]he land transport of livestock for export must meet
any relevant animal health and welfare
and road transport requirements under
state and territory legislation and relevant requirements under national Model
Codes of Practice
for the Welfare of
Animals.'<sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[103]</a></sup> As already
discussed, the Keniry Report identified substantial problems in relying on
inconsistent State and Territory regulation
for the enforcement of animal
welfare standards. As well, in a point not remarked upon in the report, animal
welfare standards included
in codes of practice can entrench manifestly cruel
practices, as has been shown earlier in this article. AQIS is now responsible
for the grant of export licences and compliance monitoring. However, it acts on
the advice of third party veterinarians who, notwithstanding
the recommended
approach of the Keniry Report, are still engaged by exporters (even if subject
to approval by AQIS).</p>
<p>The narrow terms of inquiry leading to the Keniry Report ensured that the
report did not engage at all with the question of whether
live export of farmed
animals is prima facie cruel, and whether the practice should be continued or at
least phased out, as suggested
by the 1985 Senate Select Committee on Animal
Welfare report.<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[104]</a></sup> The reformed
regulatory regime, following implementation of some of the recommendations of
the Keniry Report, continues to entrench
cruelty to animals, through reliance on
State and Territory codes of practice as the underlying applicable welfare
standards.<sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[105]</a></sup></p>
<p> As the next section of this article shows, this approach to animal welfare
standard setting by the Commonwealth may be different
in less economically
significant spheres.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading235"></a><b>C	Commonwealth regulation of the import and export
of live native and endangered species</b></h3>
<p>Relying on the external affairs power, the Commonwealth Parliament has passed
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/" class="autolink_findacts">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a></i> (Cth)
which, among other things, regulates trade in endangered and/or native
species.<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[106]</a></sup> Part 13A of the Act
includes provisions dealing with the import and export of endangered and/or
native animals, and includes a very
broadly defined anti-cruelty standard. For
example, s 303GP(1) states that it is an offence to export or import a 'live
animal in
a manner that subjects the animal to cruel
treatment'.<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>While a detailed consideration of the regulation of wildlife falls outside
the ambit of this article, the cruelty standard adopted
by the Commonwealth in
this area is worth reflecting on since it is notably different to the standards
adopted in the live export
of farmed animals, and those applicable under State
and Territory legislation and codes of practice: no qualification is placed on
the nature of cruelty which is prohibited (such as 'no unnecessary suffering'),
and no specific defence to acting in a cruel manner
is provided. It means that
the Commonwealth, like the States and Territories, applies different standards
to different categories
of sentient animals. In this case, endangered animals
and native animals are regarded as more deserving of protection from cruelty
than farmed animals.</p>
<p>As argued in relation to the distinction between standards applicable to the
treatment of companion and farmed animals, if sentiency
is the basis on which
prohibition of cruelty is justified, there is no rational moral or scientific
explanation for why export farmed
animals should be subject to a lower standard
of protection than that afforded to imported or exported wildlife. Arguments
considered
earlier about the property status of animals, as well as democratic
politics, apply with equal force
here.<sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[108]</a></sup></p>
<p>The dualistic regulatory approach in these areas provides good reason to be
cautious about the likelihood of broader change as the
Commonwealth assumes an
increasingly influential role in the regulation of animal welfare. </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading243"></a><b>IV	TRANSCENDING CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS: THE
INCREASINGLY INFLUENTIAL ROLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH IN REGULATION OF ANIMAL
WELFARE</b></h2>
<p>As has been established, legislative intervention at a federal level in the
regulation of the treatment of companion and farmed animals
is subject to
putative constitutional limitation so that, notwithstanding Commonwealth
regulation of live animal export and trade
in native and endangered species, it
is the States and Territories which have been primarily responsible for
regulatory action in
the area of animal welfare.</p>
<p>Despite the formal division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States
and Territories, the substantive role played by the
Commonwealth is becoming
more significant. The Commonwealth plays a central role in coordinating the
development of the regulatory
standards for the treatment of farmed animals,
reflected in the Model Codes of Practice which are directly incorporated, or
adapted,
into State and Territory regulatory regimes. And the Commonwealth is
increasingly assuming policy leadership on animal welfare issues,
through bodies
such as the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare
('NCCAW'),<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[109]</a></sup></p> and the development of the
AAWS.<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[110]</a></sup></p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading249"></a><b>A 	Model Codes of Practice and farmed
animals</b></h3>
<p>The Model Codes of Practice, discussed in detail in Part II of this article,
are significant from a Commonwealth regulatory perspective
because the
Commonwealth plays a central role in leading the ministerial council, the PIMC,
which develops and approves the codes.<sup> </sup>The role of the PIMC is</p>
<blockquote>
to facilitate the implementation, nationally, of plans and proposals which would
not otherwise be possible because of the limitations
imposed by the division of
constitutional powers between Australian, State and Territory governments.<br>
The Primary Industries Ministerial Council (PIMC) consists of the
Australian/State/Territory and New Zealand government ministers
responsible for
agriculture, food, fibre, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture
industries/production and rural adjustment
policy.<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[111]</a></sup></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><p>While there has not been uniform adoption of the Model Codes of
Practice, and this undermines national consistency in animal welfare
regulation,
they have, as discussed earlier, been taken up in whole or part, or adapted, by
a number of State and Territory jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading256"></a><b>B	Australian animal welfare strategy</b></h3>
<p>The Commonwealth is now seeking to play a much more active role across the
regulation of the treatment of all animals, through the
AAWS. The AAWS,
developed by the Commonwealth with the assistance and advice of the NCCAW, was
approved by the PIMC in May 2004 and
launched in October 2005, amidst rhetorical
claims that Australia is a 'world leader in the field of animal
welfare'.<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[112]</a></sup> The purpose of the
AAWS is to provide 'direction for the development of future animal welfare
policies, based on a national consultative
approach and a firm commitment to
high standards of animal
welfare.'<sup><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[113]</a></sup></p>
<p>The AAWS is wide-ranging, aiming to bring national coordination to human
activities having an effect 'on all sentient species of animals
in
Australia'.<sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[114]</a></sup> The AAWS:</p>
<blockquote>
embraces a broad vision for the humane treatment of all sentient animals and
provides a framework for sustainable improvements in
animal welfare outcomes,
based on scientific evidence and social, economic and ethical considerations. It
reflects the high regard
Australians place on the value, care and the well-being
of
animals.<sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[115]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Attachment
1 to the AAWS provides perhaps the most succinct expression of the underlying
rationale of the AAWS:</p>
<blockquote>
Australia has a strong existing framework to establish and enforce acceptable
animal welfare outcomes and has contemporary and comprehensive
animal welfare
legislation and enforcement at national, state, territory and local levels
&#8230; The Strategy aims to promote and
refine the framework used to protect
the welfare of
animals.<sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[116]</a></sup></blockquote><p>It is
clear that the AAWS does not represent a thorough and critical re-examination of
the underlying regulatory framework for animal
welfare in Australia. Rather, the
much more modest mandate is to 'refine' and 'promote' the existing framework. As
part of this limited
mandate, however, a number of important initiatives are
proposed, their potential for providing the basis for more substantive change
shielded by ambiguous and blandly expressed bureaucratic language. These
initiatives include to:<sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[117]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#8226;	'[f]acilitate the maintenance of effective animal welfare units in
each jurisdiction';</p>
<p>&#8226;	'[f]acilitate the timely development and revision of codes of
practice, standards and guidelines and legislation';</p>
<p>&#8226;	'[p]romote the adoption of a harmonised approach to the development
and application of clear, contemporary, adequate and consistent
animal welfare
legislation and codes of practice across all state, territory and local
government jurisdictions';</p>
<p>&#8226;	'[u]ndertake a review of the existing animal welfare infrastructure,
policies and programs';</p>
<p>&#8226;	'[f]acilitate the development, collection and collation of national
statistics on animal welfare standards';</p>
<p>&#8226;	'[e]xpand Australia's efforts to inform international bodies of our
current standards for animal welfare through the development
of readily
available explanatory material outlining the animal welfare arrangements and
achievements, in Australia';</p>
<p>&#8226;	'[p]romote and facilitate the inclusion of animal welfare studies in
the curricula of educational institutions'; and</p>
<p>&#8226;	'[c]reate national internet sources for national, state/territory and
local animal welfare information'.</p>
<p>In order to claim a wide base of support, the development of the AAWS
necessarily required sensitivity to the significant and often
conflicting
concerns of those interest groups affected by the strategy &#8212; including the
State and Territory governments, animal
welfare organisations, farmed animal
representative groups, the scientific research community, and the veterinary
profession &#8212;
so that the measured aspirations of the strategy should not
be surprising.</p>
<p>Depending on how the AAWS is implemented, it may prove to be no more than a
bureaucratic/administrative exercise, providing some national
coordination to an
area of regulation which has historically been the domain of the States and
Territories, improving access to information
about animal welfare regulation and
allowing Australia to participate in international fora on animal welfare in a
more informed
way. Such an approach would mean that the critique of animal
welfare regulation considered earlier in this article would apply with
equal
force to the implementation of the AAWS. In particular, the AAWS suffers from an
underlying lack of coherence and rationality,
for the same reasons that the
standard regulatory approach to the treatment of animals lacks these. The AAWS
adopts a broad definition
of
'sentiency',<sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[118]</a></sup> and states that
'[a]ll animals have intrinsic
value'.<sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[119]</a></sup> However, by endorsing
the Model Codes of Practice as the source of minimum standards for the treatment
of farmed animals, it repudiates
the idea of a universal intrinsic value for
animals based on shared sentiency. Endorsement of the Model Codes of Practice
must mean,
as argued above, that the treatment of farmed animals is to be
regulated in a quite different way to that of other categories of
animal,
including companion
animals.<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[120]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, if the AAWS initiatives outlined above are to be given
full effect, particularly those requiring harmonisation,
it will require
leadership from the Commonwealth in setting the standards which are to apply in
achieving a nationally consistent
approach to regulation. This provides an
opportunity for coordinated regulatory reform, even if this will be a formidable
task, given
the significant inconsistencies which exist in the structure,
content, and enforcement of animal welfare regulation across the country.
Moreover, it prompts the question of why the Commonwealth has decided to assume
a new and potentially significant role in the regulation
of animal welfare at
all.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading283"></a><b>C	Why is the Commonwealth pursuing a more active
role in the regulation of animal welfare?</b></h3>
<p>The first of the Commonwealth government's specific responsibilities set out
in the AAWS is to 'represent Australia's position on
animal
welfare'.<sup><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[121]</a></sup> One important
reason for the recent and unprecedented interest of the Commonwealth in animal
welfare matters, reflected in its coordination
of the AAWS, is the increasing
level of international cooperation on animal welfare matters. For example, the
World Organisation
for Animal
Health,<sup><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[122]</a></sup> of which Australia is
a member, is currently considering the need for national and international
benchmarking of animal welfare
outcomes.<sup><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p> As well, Australia has been 'working with other international bodies such as
the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA)
on issues such as
development of a Universal Declaration on Animal
Welfare.'<sup><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[124]</a></sup> While particular
regions of the world have developed cross-jurisdictional agreements in this
area, such as the Protocol on Protection
and Welfare of Animals in the European
Union,<sup><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[125]</a></sup> there is as yet no
international agreement on animal welfare. Australia was one of 22 countries
represented at an intergovernmental
conference in Manilla in 2003 which agreed
to a proposal for a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare. The next step is 'a
ministerial
conference planned for the end of 2007 in New York. If consensus is
achieved at that ministerial conference it is hoped that the
Declaration will
then be put before the United Nations General Assembly for
adoption.'<sup><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[126]</a></sup></p>
<p></p>
<p>Developments in animal welfare in the international arena, in which Australia
has so far been an active participant, have the potential
to be a two-edged
sword for the Commonwealth. While having the positive effect of prompting the
federal government to assume a greater
role in coordinating animal welfare
regulation, they also have the potential to highlight significant shortcomings
in domestic animal
welfare
regulation.<sup><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[127]</a></sup> This may have
particular resonance for Australia in the area of the welfare of farmed animals.
For example, the World Organisation
for Animal Health recognises that:</p>
<blockquote>
the internationally recognised 'five freedoms' (freedom from hunger, thirst and
malnutrition; freedom from fear and distress; freedom
from physical and thermal
discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; and freedom to express normal
patterns of behaviour)
provide valuable guidance in animal
welfare.<sup><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[128]</a></sup></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><p>These freedoms, at least in the abstract, are uncontroversial
and have been widely
accepted.<sup><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[129]</a></sup> The five freedoms
are included in the proposed Universal Declaration on Animal
Welfare.<sup><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[130]</a></sup> The AAWS even
includes a commitment that, together with other guiding principles, 'Australia
will take these into account in developing
its vision, international policies
and input to relevant international goals for animal
welfare.'<sup><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[131]</a></sup> However, as is
clear from the earlier discussion of the Model Codes of Practice, Australian
regulation of the treatment of farmed
animals is not always consistent with
these freedoms. Indeed, on any view, intensive or factory farming may breach
four of these
five freedoms.</p>
<p>As well as highlighting inconsistencies and shortcomings in the animal
welfare standards which currently exist in Australia, the emergence
of a
Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare would be significant for another reason.
On the reasonable assumption that Australia
will be a signatory, the declaration
might provide the basis for direct regulation of companion and farmed animals by
the Commonwealth,
relying on the external affairs power of the <i>Australian
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i>.<sup><a name="fnB134" href="#fn134">[132]</a></sup> There is,
of course, no indication to date that the Commonwealth intends to take such a
step, or that this is a reason for its active
involvement in the development of
international law. One of the key goals of the AAWS is to bring a degree of
national consistency
to animal welfare regulation in Australia, but through
negotiated harmonisation rather than Commonwealth
fiat.<sup><a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[133]</a></sup>  </p>
<h2>
<a name="Heading305"></a><b>V	CONCLUSION</b></h2>
<p>This article has challenged the prevailing standard regulatory approach to
companion and farmed animal welfare in Australia. Deficiencies
in this approach
exist across standard setting, strategy and enforcement. The locus of regulatory
control has historically rested
with the States and Territories, principally for
constitutional reasons. There is, however, evidence that the Commonwealth is
emerging
as a significant regulatory player. By establishing a national strategy
for animal welfare, the Commonwealth is signalling an intention
to contribute in
a more meaningful way to animal welfare regulation. While some of the objectives
of its national strategy are potentially
transformative, the extent to which the
Commonwealth will challenge the standard regulatory approach established by the
States and
Territories remains unclear and, perhaps, slight. In two areas where
the Commonwealth has played a direct role in regulation of animal
welfare
&#8212; live farmed animal export and trade in wildlife &#8212; the regulatory
approach, especially in standard setting,
has echoed the irrationality and
incoherence found in State and Territory regulation of the welfare of companion
and farmed animals.</p>

se. That is, the protection of animals from cruelty was an important enough
principle
in its own right to be included in criminal legislation alongside a
range of other offences, perhaps implying a commitment to enforcement
of these
offences by the police in a manner consistent with other significant criminal
offences.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn16" href="#fnB16">[14]</a></sup> 	Interestingly, in two
colonies, South Australia and Victoria, a positive duty of care was included to
'supply an animal with food
and water', in addition to the general negative duty
of no cruelty: ibid 242. In more recent times, the States and Territories have
been reinvigorating the concept of a duty of care to animals. This is discussed
further below.</p>

<p><sup><a name="fn26" href="#fnB26">[24]</a></sup> 	With the exception of one
jurisdiction, there is no legislative category of 'companion animal'. The term
conceivably covers a potentially
wide spectrum, including the traditional family
pet (eg a cat, dog or bird), an assistance animal (eg a guide dog for the
blind),
and a 'guard' animal (eg a family pet nonetheless kept partially for
security reasons), as well as, perhaps, a 'working' dog on a
farm. In NSW, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1998174/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1998174/" class="autolink_findacts">Companion Animals Act 1998</a></i> (NSW) defines a companion animal as a
cat or a dog, but notes that '[t]he fact that an animal is not strictly a
"companion" does
not prevent it being a companion animal for the purposes of
this Act. All dogs are treated as companion animals, even working dogs
on rural
properties, guard dogs and police dogs.' </p>

<p><sup><a name="fn40" href="#fnB40">[38]</a></sup> 	As with 'companion animal',
there is no common legislative definition of 'farmed animal'. Jurisdictions take
a variety of approaches,
some not defining the term at all (eg the Australian
Capital Territory, Queensland and Tasmania). Other jurisdictions take a very
broad approach (eg in New South Wales, a 'stock animal' is defined as 'an animal
which belongs to the class of animals comprising
cattle, horses, sheep, goats,
deer, pigs, poultry and any other [prescribed] species': <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poctaa1979360/" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals Act 1979</a></i> (NSW) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poctaa1979360/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4).</a> Others define farm animals by
reference to their use in primary (ie commercial) production, and this is the
definition assumed by
this article (eg in Victoria, 'farm animal' refers to
cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, goats, and deer 'if kept for or used in connexion
with primary production': <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/poctaa1986360/" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986</a></i> (Vic)

at 19 November 2007. In the area of scientific research, the National
Health and Medical Research Council ('NHMRC') is responsible
for producing a
code of practice for the care and use of animals in scientific research: NHMRC,
<i>Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific
Purposes</i> (7<sup>th</sup> ed, 2004). There are no national codes dealing with
the use and care of animals in zoos or in entertainment, such as in
circuses.</p>

<i>Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1985</i> (SA) codes of practice may be
incorporated by regulation and, under s 43, compliance with a code will be a
complete defence to a
cruelty prosecution. Most of the Model Codes of Practice
have been adopted under s 10 and sch 2 of the <i>Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals Regulation 2000</i> (SA). Uniquely to South Australia, compliance with
all of the incorporated codes is mandatory, with a breach carrying a fine of
$1,250.</p>
<p><sup><a name="fn44" href="#fnB44">[42]</a></sup> 	The Minister may adopt a
code of practice under s 24 of the <i>Animal Welfare Act 1999</i> (NT) and,
under s 79(1) of the Act, it is a defence to prosecution for an offence if there
has been compliance with an adopted code
of practice. The Northern Territory has
considered a number of the Model Codes of Practice, but so far adopted a small
number: see

The emphasis on changing social attitudes regarding the proper treatment of
animals also points to legislation
as a means of transforming what is accepted
as 'necessary suffering'. For example, the <i>Agriculture (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1968</i> (UK) outlaws 'unnecessary pain' and 'unnecessary
distress' in relation to farm animals in the UK. Since the introduction of this
broad statutory offence, a range of more specific prohibitions have been
introduced through secondary legislation: see Simon Brooman
and Debbie Legge,
<i>Law Relating to Animals</i> (1997) 198&#8211;9.</p>

Scottish decisions concerning the cruel treatment of livestock, that the courts
have shown a willingness to place the interests of animals ahead of farmers,

<p><sup><a name="fn110" href="#fnB110">[108]</a></sup> 	Sociological
explanations may also be illuminating in this context. Franklin argues that the
way in which Australians understand
and relate to animals is inextricably bound
up with the process of colonisation and issues of national identity: Adrian
Franklin,
<i>Animal Nation: The True Story of Animals and Australia</i> (2006).
Initially, native Australian animals were viewed as undesirable, with colonial
professional shooters working 'their way through
country shooting out the
wildlife much as the forests were clear-felled'. However, Federation and the
development of an independent
Australian national culture meant that 'nativeness
was to be associated positively with the emergent nation and privileged over the
introduced species, who could be now be associated with their rejected colonial
status. &#8230; native animals seemed to demand policies
of protection': 15.</p>

area of animal use in scientific research, pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies are increasingly conducting research involving animals in countries
such as China and Singapore, where animal welfare standards
may not be strict
and where action by animal activists in drawing attention to the cruel nature of
this research is much less common:

the Pigs to Fly to Asia', <i>The Age</i> (Melbourne), 14 December 2005, 10.</p>

at 19 November 2007. The origin of the five freedoms can be traced back
to the 1960s Brambell Committee inquiry into the treatment
of farmed animals in
Great Britain: F W Rogers Brambell et al, <i>Report of the Technical Committee

example, implicit acceptance in State and Territory legislation (especially in
the requirements of the duty to
meet the welfare needs of an animal): see, eg,

<p><sup><a name="fn135" href="#fnB135">[133]</a></sup> 	Senator Andrew Bartlett,
an Australian Democrats representative, introduced the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/nawb2005216/" class="autolink_findacts">National Animal Welfare
Bill 2005</a> (Cth) into the Senate on 20 June 2005 with the aim of establishing a
uniform, national approach to animal welfare legislation. The
bill was referred
for inquiry to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee,
which reported on 22 June 2006. In
a report notable for a complete lack of
serious analytical consideration of the issues raised by the Bill and the 204
submissions
received by the inquiry, a majority of the committee recommended
that the bill not proceed: see Senate Rural and Regional Affairs
and Transport
Committee, Parliament of Australia, <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/nawb2005216/" class="autolink_findacts">National Animal Welfare Bill 2005</a></i>

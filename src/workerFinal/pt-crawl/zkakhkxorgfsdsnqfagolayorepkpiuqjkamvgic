<h2>Annex A-1<br>The Potsdam Declaration</h2>
</center>

<p align=right>
26 July 1945
<p>
<u>PROCLAMATION BY HEADS OF GOVERNMENTS, UNITED STATES, UNITED KINGDOM, AND CHINA</u>
<ol>
<li><a name=p1></a>
We, the President of the United States, the President
of the National Government of the Republic of China, and the Prime Minister of Great
Britain, representing the hundreds of millions of our countrymen, have conferred and
agree that Japan shall be given an opportunity to end the war.
<p><li><a name=p2></a>
The prodigious land, sea, and air forces of the United States, the British Empire, and
China, many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the West, are poised
to strike the final blows upon Japan. This military power is sustained and inspired by
the determination of all the allied nations to prosecute the war against Japan until she
ceases to resist.
<p><li><a name=p3></a>
The result of the futile and senseless German resistance to the might of the aroused free
peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of Japan.
The might that now converges on Japan is immeasurably greater
than that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis,
necessarily laid waste to the lands, the industry and
the method of life of the whole German people. The
full application of our military power, backed by our

resolve, <u>will</u> mean the inevitable and complete
destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just
as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland.
<li><a name=p4></a>
The time has come for Japan to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those
self-willed militaristic advisers whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Empire
of Japan to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will follow the path of reason.
<p><li><a name=p5></a>
The following are our terms. We shall not deviate from them. There are no alternatives.
We shall brook no delay.
<p><li><a name=p6></a>
There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have
deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest, for we insist
that a new order of peace, security, and justice will be impossible until irresponsible
militarism is driven from the world.
<p><li><a name=p7></a>
Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Japan's
war-making power is destroyed points in Japanese territory designated by the Allies
will be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objective we are here setting forth.
<p><li><a name=p8></a>
The terms of the <a href=../Dip/Cairo.html>Cairo Declaration</a> shall be carried out,
and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu,
Shikoku, and such minor islands as we determine.
<p><li><a name=p9></a>
The Japanese military forces after being completely disarmed shall be permitted to
return to

their homes, with the opportunity of leading peaceful and productive lives.
<p><li><a name=p10></a>
We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race nor destroyed as a nation,
but stern justice well be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited
cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the
revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people.
Freedom of speech, or religion, and of thought, as well as respect for fundamental human
rights, shall be established.
<p><li><a name=p11></a>
Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and
allow of the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those industries which would
enable her to rearm for war.
<p>
To this end access to, and distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted.
Eventual Japanese participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.
<p><li><a name=p12></a>
The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these
objectives have been accomplished, and there has been established, in accordance with
the freely expressed will of the Japanese people, a peacefully inclined and responsible
Government.
<p><li><a name=p13></a>
We call upon the Government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender
of all the Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of
their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is complete and utter destruction.

LEGATION DE SUISSE<br>
Washington, D.C.
<p align=right>
August 10, 1945
<p>
Sir:
<p>
I have the honor to inform you that the
Japanese Minister to Switzerland, upon instructions
received from his Government, has requested the
Swiss Political Department to advise the Government
of the United States of America of the following:
<p>
<blockquote>
In obedience to the gracious command of
his Majesty the Emperor who, ever anxious to
enhance the cause of world peace, desires
earnestly to bring about a speedy termination
of hostilities with a view to saving mankind
from the calamities to be imposed upon them by
further continuation of the war, the Japanese
Government several weeks ago asked the Soviet
Government, with which neutral relations then
prevailed, to render good offices in restoring
peace vis a vis the enemy power. Unfortunately,
these efforts in the interest of peace
having failed, the Japanese Government in conformity
with the august wish of His Majesty
to restore the general peace and desiring to
put an end to the untold sufferings entailed
by war as quickly as possible, have decided
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><center><i>--4--</i></center><hr><a name=page5></a><p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
upon the following:
<p>
The Japanese Government are ready to
accept the terms enumerated in the joint
declaration which was issued at Potsdam on
July 26, 1945, by the heads of the Governments
of the United States, Great Britain, and China,
and later subscribed by the Soviet Government
with the understanding that the said declaration
does not comprise any demand which prejudices
the prerogatives of His Majesty as a
Sovereign Ruler.
<p>
The Japanese Government sincerely hope
that this understanding is warranted and desire
keenly that an explicit indication to that
effect will be speedily forthcoming.
</blockquote>
In transmitting the above messages the Japanese
Minister added that his Government begs the Government
of the United States to forward its answer
through the intermediary of Switzerland. Similar
request are being transmitted to the Governments
of Great Britain and the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics through the intermediary of Sweden, as
well as to the Government of China through the intermediary
fo Switzerland. The Chinese Minister at
Berne has already been informed of the foregoing
through the channel of the Swiss Political Department.
<p>
Please be assured that I am at your disposal
at any time to accept for and forward to my Government
the reply of the Government of the United States.

Sir:
<p>
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your

the President of the United States has directed me

behalf of the Governments of the United States, the
United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, and China:
<p>

With regard to the Japanese Government's
message accepting the terms of the Potsdam proclamation
but containing the statement, 'with the
understanding that the said declaration does not
comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives
of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler,' our position is as follows:
<p>
From the moment of surrender the authority
of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule
the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander
of the Allied powers who will take such steps as he
deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms.

their control wherever located to cease active
operations and to surrender their arms, and to
issue such other orders as the Supreme Commander
may require to give effect to the surrender terms.
<p>
Immediately upon the surrender the Japanese
Government shall transport prisoners of war and
civilian internees to places of safety, as directed,
where they can quickly be placed aboard Allied transports.
<p>
The ultimate form of government of Japan
shall, in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration,
be established by the freely expressed will of the
Japanese people.
<p>
The armed forces of the Allied Powers will
remain in Japan until the purposes set forth in the
Potsdam declaration are achieved.

highest consideration.

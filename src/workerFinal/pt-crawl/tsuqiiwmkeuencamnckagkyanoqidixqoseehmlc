Hello, and welcome to Native Languages of the Americas! 
We are a small <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/help.htm">non-profit organization</a> dedicated to preserving and 
promoting American Indian languages, particularly through the use of Internet technology. 
Our website is not beautiful. Probably, it never will be. But this site has inner beauty, for it is, or will be, a compendium of 
online materials about more than 800 indigenous languages of the Western Hemisphere and the native people that speak them.

We currently have online language materials for more than 150 Indian peoples of North America, and are adding more information on
the native languages of Central and South America as well.
In addition to this language information, we have carefully collected and organized links to many 
different aspects of native life and culture, with an emphasis on American Indians as a living people with a
present tense. American Indian history is interesting and important, but Indians are still here today, too, and we
have tried to feature modern writers as well as traditional legends, contemporary art as well as museum pieces, 
and the issues and struggles of today as well as the tragedies of yesterday. Suggestions for new links are always
welcome.

These are diverse societies deserving of individual attention, and it can be very difficult to make accurate generalizations about them as a group. 
However, our site is also unfinished and may be of limited use to people seeking information on a tribe we have not yet covered. For this reason, 
we are providing some links to the main pages of sites with information about many different Native American peoples. Hopefully if you are looking

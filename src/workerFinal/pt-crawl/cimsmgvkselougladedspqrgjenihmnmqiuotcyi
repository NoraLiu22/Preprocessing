/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

        PREFACE.</b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small volume was commenced as a review 
        article on Professor Percival Lowell's book, <i>Mars and its Canals</i>, 
        with the object of showing that the large amount of new and interesting 
        facts contained in this work did not invalidate the conclusion I had reached 
        in 1902, and stated in my book on <i>Man's Place in the Universe</i>, 
        that Mars was not habitable.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more complete presentation of the opposite 
        view in the volume now under discussion required a more detailed examination 
        of the various physical problems involved, and as the subject is one of 
        great, popular, as well as scientific interest, I determined to undertake 
        the task.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was rendered the more necessary by the 
        fact that in July last Professor Lowell published in the <i>Philosophical 
        Magazine</i> an elaborate mathematical article claiming to demonstrate 
        that, notwithstanding its much greater distance from the sun and its excessively 
        thin atmosphere, Mars possessed a climate on the average equal to that 
        of the south <font color="#990000">[[p. vi]]</font> of England, and in 
        its polar and sub-polar regions even less severe than that of the earth. 
        Such a contention of course required to be dealt with, and led me to collect 
        information bearing upon temperature in all its aspects, and so enlarging 
        my criticism that I saw it would be necessary to issue it in book form.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of my mathematical friends have pointed 
        out the chief omission which vitiates Professor Lowell's mathematical 
        conclusions--that of a failure to recognise the very large conservative 
        and <i>cumulative</i> effect of a dense atmosphere. This very point however 
        I had already myself discussed in Chapter VI., and by means of some remarkable 
        researches on the heat of the moon and an investigation of the causes 
        of its very low temperature, I have, I think, demonstrated the incorrectness 
        of Mr. Lowell's results. In my last chapter, in which I briefly summarise 
        the whole argument, I have further strengthened the case for very severe 
        cold in Mars, by adducing the rapid lowering of temperature universally 
        caused by diminution of atmospheric pressure, as manifested in the well-known 
        phenomenon of temperate climates at moderate heights even close to the 
        equator, cold climates at greater heights even on extensive plateaux, 
        culminating in arctic climates and perpetual snow at heights where the 
        air is still far denser than it is on the surface of Mars. This <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        vii]]</font> argument itself is, in my opinion, conclusive; but it is 
        enforced by two others equally complete, neither of which is adequately 
        met by Mr. Lowell.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The careful examination which I have been led 
        to give to the whole of the phenomena which Mars presents, and especially 
        to the discoveries of Mr. Lowell, has led me to what I hope will be considered 
        a satisfactory physical explanation of them. This explanation, which occupies 
        the whole of my seventh chapter, is founded upon a special mode of origin 
        for Mars, derived from the Meteoritic Hypothesis, now very widely adopted 
        by astronomers and physicists. Then, by a comparison with certain well-known 
        and widely spread geological phenomena, I show how the great features 
        of Mars--the 'canals' and 'oases'--may have been caused. This chapter 
        will perhaps be the most interesting to the general reader, as furnishing 
        a quite natural explanation of features of the planet which have been 
        termed 'non-natural' by Mr. Lowell.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, also, I have been led to an explanation 
        of the highly volcanic nature of the moon's surface. This seems to me 
        absolutely to require some such origin as Sir George Darwin has given 
        it, and thus furnishes corroborative proof of the accuracy of the hypothesis 
        that our moon has had an unique origin among the known satellites, in 
        having been thrown off from the earth itself.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. viii]]</font> I am 
        indebted to Professor J. H. Poynting, of the University of Birmingham, 
        for valuable suggestions on some of the more difficult points of mathematical 
        physics here discussed, and also for the critical note (at the end of 
        Chapter V.) on Professor Lowell's estimate of the temperature of Mars.</p>

        Observers Of Mars.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few persons except astronomers fully realise 
        that of all the planets of the Solar system the only one whose solid surface 
        has been seen with certainty is Mars; and, very fortunately, that is also 
        the only one which is sufficiently near to us for the physical features 
        of the surface to be determined with any accuracy, even if we could see 
        it in the other planets. Of Venus we probably see only the upper surface 
        of its cloudy atmosphere.<sup><a href="#11">1</a></sup> As regards Jupiter 
        and Saturn this is still more certain, since their low density will only 
        permit of a comparatively small proportion of their huge bulk being solid. 
        Their <font color="#990000">[[p. 2]]</font> belts are but the cloud-strata 
        of their upper atmosphere, perhaps thousands of miles above their solid 
        surfaces, and a somewhat similar condition seems to prevail in the far 
        more remote planets Uranus and Neptune. It has thus happened, that, although 
        as telescopic objects of interest and beauty, the marvellous rings of 
        Saturn, the belts and ever-changing aspects of the satellites of Jupiter, 
        and the moon-like phases of Venus, together with its extreme brilliancy, 
        still remain unsurpassed, yet the greater amount of details of these features 
        when examined with the powerful instruments of the nineteenth century 
        have neither added much to our knowledge of the planets themselves or 
        led to any sensational theories calculated to attract the popular imagination.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of Mars the progress of discovery 
        has had a very different result. The most obvious peculiarity of this 
        planet--its polar snow-caps--were seen about 250 years ago, but they were 
        first proved to increase and decrease alternately, in the summer and winter 
        of each hemisphere, by Sir William Herschell in the latter part of the 
        eighteenth century. This fact gave the impulse to that idea of similarity 
        in the conditions of Mars and the earth, which the recognition of many 
        large dusky patches and streaks as water, and the more ruddy and brighter 
        portions as land, further increased. Added to this, a day only about half 
        an hour longer than <font color="#990000">[[p. 3]]</font> our own, and 
        a succession of seasons of the same character as ours but of nearly double 
        the length owing to its much longer year, seemed to leave little wanting 
        to render this planet a true earth on a smaller scale. It was therefore 
        very natural to suppose that it must be inhabited, and that we should 
        some day obtain evidence of the fact.</p>
      <p><i>The Canals discovered by Schiaparelli.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the great interest excited when Schiaparelli, 
        at the Milan Observatory, during the very favourable opposition of 1877 
        and 1879, observed that the whole of the tropical and temperate regions 
        from 60&deg; N. to 60&deg; S. Lat. were covered with a remarkable network 
        of broader curved and narrower straight lines of a dark colour. At each 
        successive favourable opposition, these strange objects called <i>canali</i> 
        (channels) by their discoverer, but rather misleadingly 'canals' in England 
        and America, were observed by means of all the great telescopes in the 
        world, and their reality and general features became well established. 
        In Schiaparelli's first map they were represented as being much broader 
        and less sharply defined than he himself and other observers found by 
        later and equally favourable observations that they really were.</p>
      <p><i>Discovery of the Double Canals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1881 another strange feature was discovered 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 4]]</font> by Schiaparelli, who found that 
        about twenty canals which had previously been seen single were now distinctly 
        double, that is, that they consisted of two parallel lines, equally distinct 
        and either very close together or a considerable distance apart. This 
        curious appearance was at first thought to be due to some instrumental 
        defect or optical illusion; but as it was soon confirmed by other observers 
        with the best instruments and in widely different localities it became 
        in time accepted as a real phenomenon of the planet's surface.</p>
      <p><i>Round Spots discovered in 1892.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the favourable opposition of 1892, Mr. W. 
        H. Pickering noticed that besides the 'seas' of various sizes there were 
        numerous very small black spots apparently quite circular and occurring 
        at every intersection or starting-point of the 'canals.' Many of these 
        had been seen by Schiaparelli as larger and ill-defined dark patches, 
        and were termed seas or lakes; but Mr. Pickering's observatory was at 
        Arequipa in Peru, about 8000 feet above the sea, and with such perfect 
        atmospheric conditions as were, in his opinion, equal to a doubling of 
        telescopic aperture. They were soon detected by other observers, especially 
        by Mr. Lowell in 1894, who thus wrote of them:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scattered over the orange-ochre groundwork 
        of the continental regions of the planet, are any <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        5]]</font> number of dark round spots. How many there may be it is not 
        possible to state, as the better the seeing, the more of them there seem 
        to be. In spite, however, of their great number, there is no instance 
        of one unconnected with a canal. What is more, there is apparently none 
        that does not lie at the junction of several canals. Reversely, all the 
        junctions appear to be provided with spots. Plotted upon a globe they 
        and their connecting canals make a most curious network over all the orange-ochre 
        equatorial parts of the planet, a mass of lines and knots, the one marking 
        being as omnipresent as the other.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p><i>Changes of Colour recognised.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the oppositions of 1892 and 1894 it was 
        fully recognised that a regular course of change occurred dependent upon 
        the succession of the seasons, as had been first suggested by Schiaparelli. 
        As the polar snows melt the adjacent seas appear to overflow and spread 
        out as far as the tropics, and are often seen to assume a distinctly green 
        colour. These remarkable changes and the extraordinary phenomena of perfect 
        straight lines crossing each other over a large portion of the planet's 
        surface, with the circular spots at their intersections, had such an appearance 
        of artificiality that the idea that they were really 'canals' made by 
        intelligent beings for purposes <font color="#990000">[[p. 6]]</font> 
        of irrigation, was first hinted at, and then adopted as the only intelligible 
        explanation, by Mr. Lowell and a few other persons. This at once seized 
        upon the public imagination and was spread by the newspapers and magazines 
        over the whole civilised world.</p>
      <p><i>Existence of Seas doubted.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time (1894) it began to be doubted whether 
        there were any seas at all on Mars. Professor Pickering thought they were 
        far more limited in size than had been supposed, and even might not exist 
        as true seas. Professor Barnard, with the Lick thirty-six inch telescope, 
        discerned an astonishing wealth of detail on the surface of Mars, so intricate, 
        minute, and abundant, that it baffled all attempts to delineate it; and 
        these peculiarities were seen upon the supposed seas as well as on the 
        land-surfaces. In fact, under the best conditions these 'seas' lost all 
        trace of uniformity, their appearance being that of a mountainous country, 
        broken by ridges, rifts, and ca&ntilde;ons, seen from a great elevation. 
        As we shall see later on these doubts soon became certainties, and it 
        is now almost universally admitted that Mars possesses no permanent bodies 
        of water.</p>
      <p><i>Notes, Chapter 1:</i></p>
      <p><sup><a name="11" id="11"></a>1</sup><font size="-1">Mercury also seems to have 
        a scanty atmosphere, but as its mass is only one-thirtieth that of the 
        earth it can retain only the heavier gases, and its atmosphere may be 
        dust-laden, as is that of Mars, according to Mr. Lowell. Its dusky markings, 
        as seen by Schiaparelli, seem to be permanent, and they are also for considerable 
        periods unchangeable in position, indicating that the planet keeps the 
        same face towards the sun as does Venus. This was confirmed by Mr. Lowell 
        in 1896. Its distance from us and unfavourable position for observation 
        must prevent us from obtaining any detailed knowledge of its actual surface, 
        though its low reflective power indicates that the surface may be really 
        visible. <font color="#990000">[[on p. 1]]</font></font></p>

        Percival Lowell's Discoveries and Theories.</b></p>
      <p><i>The Observatory in Arizona.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1894, after a careful search for the best 
        atmospheric conditions, Mr. Lowell established his observatory near the 
        town of Flagstaff in Arizona, in a very dry and uniform climate, and at 
        an elevation of 7300 feet above the sea. He then possessed a fine equatorial 
        telescope of 18 inches aperture and 26 feet focal length, besides two 
        smaller ones, all of the best quality. To these he added in 1896 a telescope 
        with 24 inch object glass, the last work of the celebrated firm of Alvan 
        Clark &amp; Sons, with which he has made his later discoveries. He thus 
        became perhaps more favourably situated than any astronomer in the northern 
        hemisphere, and during the last twelve years has made a specialty of the 
        study of Mars, besides doing much valuable astronomical work on other 
        planets.</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 8]]</font> <i>Mr. Lowell's recent Books upon 
        Mars</i>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1905 Mr. Lowell published an illustrated 
        volume giving a full account of his observations of Mars from 1894 to 
        1903, chiefly for the use of astronomers; and he has now given us a popular 
        volume summarising the whole of his work on the planet, and published 
        both in America and England by the Macmillan Company. This very interesting 
        volume is fully illustrated with twenty plates, four of them coloured, 
        and more than forty figures in the text, showing the great variety of 
        details from which the larger general maps have been constructed.</p>
      <p><i>Non-natural Features of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what renders this work especially interesting 
        to all intelligent readers is, that the author has here, for the first 
        time, fully set forth his views both as to the habitability of Mars and 
        as to its being actually inhabited by beings comparable with ourselves 
        in intellect. The larger part of the work is in fact devoted to a detailed 
        description of what he terms the 'Non-natural Features' of the planet's 
        surface, including especially a full account of the 'Canals,' single and 
        double; the 'Oases,' as he terms the dark spots at their intersections; 
        and the varying visibility of both, depending partly on the Martian seasons; 
        while the five concluding chapters deal with the possibility of animal 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 9]]</font> life and the evidence in favour 
        of it. He also upholds the theory of the canals having been constructed 
        for the purpose of 'husbanding' the scanty water-supply that exists; and 
        throughout the whole of this argument he clearly shows that he considers 
        the evidence to be satisfactory, and that the only intelligible explanation 
        of the whole of the phenomena he so clearly sets forth is, that the inhabitants 
        of Mars have carried out on their small and naturally inhospitable planet 
        a vast system of irrigation-works, far greater both in its extent, in 
        its utility, and its effect upon their world as a habitation for civilised 
        beings, than anything we have yet done upon our earth, where our destructive 
        agencies are perhaps more prominent than those of an improving and recuperative 
        character.</p>
      <p><i>A Challenge to the Thinking World.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This volume is therefore in the nature of a 
        challenge, not so much to astronomers as to the educated world at large, 
        to investigate the evidence for so portentous a conclusion. To do this 
        requires only a general acquaintance with modern science, more especially 
        with mechanics and physics, while the main contention (with which I shall 
        chiefly deal) that the features termed 'canals' are really works of art 
        and necessitate the presence of intelligent organic beings, requires only 
        care and judgment in drawing conclusions from admitted facts. As <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        10]]</font> I have already paid some attention to this problem and have 
        expressed the opinion that Mars is not habitable,<sup><a href="#21">1</a></sup> 
        judging from the evidence then available, and as few men of science have 
        the leisure required for a careful examination of so speculative a subject, 
        I propose here to point out what the facts, as stated by Mr. Lowell himself, 
        do <i>not</i> render even probable much less prove. Incidentally, I may 
        be able to adduce evidence of a more or less weighty character, which 
        seems to negative the possibility of any high form of animal life on Mars, 
        and, <i>a fortiori</i>, the development of such life as might culminate 
        in a being equal or superior to ourselves. As most popular works on Astronomy 
        for the last ten years at least, as well as many scientific periodicals 
        and popular magazines, have reproduced some of the maps of Mars by Schiaparelli, 
        Lowell, and others, the general appearance of its surface will be familiar 
        to most readers, who will thus be fully able to appreciate Mr. Lowell's 
        account of his own further discoveries which I may have to quote. One 
        of the <i>best</i> of these maps I am able to give as a frontispiece to 
        this volume, and to this I shall mainly refer.</p>
      <p><i>The Canals as described by Mr. Lowell.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clear atmosphere of Arizona, Mr. Lowell 
        has been able on various favourable occasions to detect a network of straight 
        lines, meeting or <font color="#990000">[[p. 11]]</font> crossing each 
        other at various angles, and often extending to a thousand or even over 
        two thousand miles in length. They are seen to cross both the light and 
        the dark regions of the planet's surface, often extending up to or starting 
        from the polar snow-caps. Most of these lines are so fine as only to be 
        visible on special occasions of atmospheric clearness and steadiness, 
        which hardly ever occur at lowland stations, even with the best instruments, 
        and almost all are seen to be as perfectly straight as if drawn with a 
        ruler.</p>
      <p><i>The Double Canals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under exceptionally favourable conditions, many 
        of the lines that have been already seen single appear double--a pair 
        of equally fine lines exactly parallel throughout their whole length, 
        and appearing, as Mr. Lowell says, &quot;clear cut upon the disc, its twin 
        lines like the rails of a railway track.&quot; Both Schiaparelli and Lowell 
        were at first so surprised at this phenomenon that they thought it must 
        be an optical illusion, and it was only after many observations in different 
        years, and by the application of every conceivable test, that they both 
        became convinced that they witnessed a real feature of the planet's surface. 
        Mr. Lowell says he has now seen them hundreds of times, and that his first 
        view of one was 'the most startlingly impressive' sight he has ever witnessed.</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 12]]</font> <i>Dimensions of the Canals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few dimensions of these strange objects must 
        be given in order that readers may appreciate their full strangeness and 
        inexplicability. Out of more than four hundred canals seen and recorded 
        by Mr. Lowell, fifty-one, or about one eighth, are either constantly or 
        occasionally seen to be double, the appearance of duplicity being more 
        or less periodical. Of 'canals' generally, Mr. Lowell states that they 
        vary in length from a few hundred to a few thousand miles long, one of 
        the largest being the Phison, which he terms 'a typical double canal,' 
        and which is said to be 2250 miles long, while the distance between its 
        two constituents is about 130 miles.<sup><a href="#22">2</a></sup> The 
        actual width of each canal is from a minimum of about a mile up to several 
        miles, in one case over twenty. A great feature of the doubles is, that 
        they are strictly parallel throughout their whole course, and that in 
        almost all cases they are so truly straight as to form parts of a great 
        circle of the planet's sphere. A few however follow a gradual but very 
        distinct curve, and such of these as are double present the same strict 
        parallelism as those which are straight.</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 13]]</font> <i>Canals extend across the Seas.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only after seventeen years of observation 
        of the canals that it was found that they extended also into and across 
        the dark spots and surfaces which by the earlier observers were termed 
        seas, and which then formed the only clearly distinguishable and permanent 
        marks on the planet's surface. At the present time, Professor Lowell states 
        that this &quot;curious triangulation has been traced over almost every portion 
        of the planet's surface, whether dark or light, whether greenish, ochre, 
        or brown in colour.&quot; In some parts they are much closer together than 
        in others, &quot;forming a perfect network of lines and spots, so that to identify 
        them all was a matter of extreme difficulty.&quot; Two such portions are figured 
        at pages 247 and 256 of Mr. Lowell's volume.</p>
      <p><i>The Oases.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious circular black spots which are seen 
        at the intersections of many of the canals, and which in some parts of 
        the surface are very numerous, are said to be more difficult of detection 
        than even the lines, being often blurred or rendered completely invisible 
        by slight irregularities in our own atmosphere, while the canals themselves 
        continue visible. About 180 of these have now been found, and the more 
        prominent of them are <font color="#990000">[[p. 14]]</font> estimated 
        to vary from 75 to 100 miles in diameter. There are however many much 
        smaller, down to minute and barely visible black points. Yet they all 
        seem a little larger than the canals which enter them. Where the canals 
        are double, the spots (or 'oases' as Mr. Lowell terms them) lie between 
        the two parallel canals.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can read this book without admiration 
        for the extreme perseverance in long continued and successful observation, 
        the results of which are here recorded; and I myself accept unreservedly 
        the substantial accuracy of the whole series. It must however always be 
        remembered that the growth of knowledge of the detailed markings has been 
        very gradual, and that much of it has only been seen under very rare and 
        exceptional conditions. It is therefore quite possible that, if at some 
        future time a further considerable advance in instrumental power should 
        be made, or a still more favourable locality be found, the new discoveries 
        might so modify present appearances as to render a satisfactory explanation 
        of them more easy than it is at present.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though I wish to do the fullest justice 
        to Mr. Lowell's technical skill and long years of persevering work, which 
        have brought to light the most complex and remarkable appearances that 
        any of the heavenly bodies present to us, I am obliged absolutely to part 
        company with him as regards <font color="#990000">[[p. 15]]</font> the 
        startling theory of artificial production which he thinks alone adequate 
        to explain them. So much is this the case, that the very phenomena, which 
        to him seem to demonstrate the intervention of intelligent beings working 
        for the improvement of their own environment, are those which seem to 
        me to bear the unmistakeable impress of being due to natural forces, while 
        they are wholly unintelligible as being useful works of art. I refer of 
        course to the great system of what are termed 'canals,' whether single 
        or double. Of these I shall give my own interpretation later on.</p>

        The Climate and Physiography of Mars.</b></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lowell admits, and indeed urges strongly, that 
      there are no permanent bodies of water on Mars; that the dark spaces and 
      spots, thought by the early observers to be seas, are certainly not so now, 
      though they may have been at an earlier period; that true clouds are rare, 
      even if they exist, the appearances that have been taken for them being 
      either dust-storms or a surface haze; that there is consequently no rain, 
      and that large portions (about two-thirds) of the planet's surface have 
      all the characteristics of desert regions. 
      <p><i>Snow-caps the only Source of Water.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state of things is supposed to be ameliorated 
        by the fact of the polar snows, which in the winter cover the arctic and 
        about half the temperate regions of each hemisphere alternately. The maximum 
        of the northern snow-caps is reached at a period of the Martian winter 
        corresponding to the end of February with us. About the end <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        17]]</font> of March the cap begins to shrink in size (in the Northern 
        Hemisphere), and this goes on so rapidly that early in the June of Mars 
        it is reduced to its minimum. About the same time changes of colour take 
        place in the adjacent darker portions of the surface, which become at 
        first bluish, and later a decided blue-green; but by far the larger portion, 
        including almost all the equatorial regions of the planet, remain always 
        of a reddish-ochre tint.<sup><a href="#31">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid and comparatively early disappearance 
        of the white covering is, very reasonably, supposed to prove that it is 
        of small thickness, corresponding perhaps to about a foot or two of snow 
        in north-temperate America and Europe, and that by the increasing amount 
        of sun-heat it is converted, partly into liquid and partly into vapour. 
        Coincident with this disappearance and as a presumed result of the water 
        (or other liquid) producing inundations, the bluish-green tinge which 
        appears on the previously dark portion of the surface is supposed to be 
        due to a rapid growth of vegetation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 18]]</font> But the 
        evidence on this point does not seem to be clear or harmonious, for in 
        the four coloured plates showing the planet's surface at successive Martian 
        dates from December 30th to February 21st, not only is a considerable 
        extent of the south temperate zone shown to change rapidly from bluish-green 
        to chocolate-brown and then again to bluish-green, but the portions furthest 
        from the supposed fertilising overflow are permanently green, as are also 
        considerable portions in the opposite or northern hemisphere, which one 
        would think would then be completely dried up.</p>
      <p><i>No Hills upon Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special point to which I here wish to call 
        attention is this. Mr. Lowell's main contention is, that the surface of 
        Mars is wonderfully smooth and level. Not only are there no mountains, 
        but there are no hills or valleys or plateaux. This assumption is absolutely 
        essential to support the other great assumption, that the wonderful network 
        of perfectly straight lines over nearly the whole surface of the planet 
        are irrigation canals. It is not alleged that irregularities or undulations 
        of a few hundreds or even one or two thousands of feet could possibly 
        be detected, while certainly all we know of planetary formation or structure 
        point strongly towards <i>some</i> inequalities of surface. Mr. Lowell 
        admits that the dark portions of the <font color="#990000">[[p. 19]]</font> 
        surface, when examined on the terminator (the margin of the illuminated 
        portion), do <i>look</i> like hollows and <i>may be</i> the beds of dried-up 
        seas; yet the supposed canals run across these old sea-beds in perfect 
        straight lines just as they do across the many thousand miles of what 
        are admitted to be deserts--which he describes in these forcible terms: 
        &quot;Pitiless as our deserts are, they are but faint forecasts of the state 
        of things existent on Mars at the present time.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears, then, that Mr. Lowell has to face 
        this dilemma--<i>Only if the whole surface of Mars is an almost perfect 
        level could the enormous network of straight canals, each from hundreds 
        to thousands of miles long, have been possibly constructed by intelligent 
        beings for purposes of irrigation; but, if a complete and universal level 
        surface exists no such system would be necessary</i>. For on a level surface--or 
        on a surface slightly inclined from the poles towards the equator, which 
        would be advantageous in either case--the melting water would of itself 
        spread over the ground and naturally irrigate as much of the surface as 
        it was possible for it to reach. If the surface were not level, but consisted 
        of slight elevations and depressions to the extent of a few scores or 
        a few hundreds of feet, then there would be no possible advantage in cutting 
        straight troughs through these elevations in various directions with water 
        flowing at the bottom of them. In <font color="#990000">[[p. 20]]</font> 
        neither case, and in hardly any conceivable case, could these perfectly 
        straight canals, cutting across each other in every direction and at very 
        varying angles, be of any use, or be the work of an intelligent race, 
        if any such race could possibly have been developed under the adverse 
        conditions which exist in Mars.</p>
      <p><i>The Scanty Water-supply.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But further, if there were any superfluity of 
        water derived from the melting snow beyond what was sufficient to moisten 
        the hollows indicated by the darker portions of the surface, which at 
        the time the water reaches them acquire a green tint (a superfluity under 
        the circumstances highly improbable), that superfluity could be best utilised 
        by widening, however little, the borders to which natural overflow had 
        carried it. Any attempt to make that scanty surplus, by means of overflowing 
        canals, travel across the equator into the opposite hemisphere, through 
        such a terrible desert region and exposed to such a cloudless sky as Mr. 
        Lowell describes, would be the work of a body of madmen rather than of 
        intelligent beings. It may be safely asserted that not one drop of water 
        would escape evaporation or insoak at even a hundred miles from its source.<sup><a href="#32">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>[<font color="#990000">[p. 21]]</font> <i>Miss Clerke on the Scanty Water-supply.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point I am supported by no less an authority 
        than the historian of modern astronomy, the late Miss Agnes Clerke. In 
        the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (of October 1896) there is an article entitled 
        'New Views about Mars,' exhibiting the writer's characteristic fulness 
        of knowledge and charm of style. Speaking of Mr. Lowell's idea of the 
        'canals' carrying the surplus water across the equator, far into the opposite 
        hemisphere, for purposes of irrigation there (which we see he again states 
        in the present volume), Miss Clerke writes: &quot;We can hardly imagine so 
        shrewd a people as the irrigators of Thule and Hellas<sup><a href="#33">3</a></sup> 
        wasting labour, and the life-giving fluid, after so unprofitable a fashion. 
        There is every reason to believe that the Martian snow-caps are quite 
        flimsy structures. Their material might be called snow <i>souffl&eacute;</i>, 
        since, owing to the small power of gravity on Mars, snow is almost three 
        times lighter there than here. Consequently, its own weight can have very 
        little effect in rendering it compact. Nor, indeed, is there time for 
        much settling down. The calotte does not form <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        22]]</font> until several months after the winter solstice, and it begins 
        to melt, as a rule, shortly after the vernal equinox. (The interval between 
        these two epochs in the southern hemisphere of Mars is 176 days.) The 
        snow lies on the ground, at the outside, a couple of months. At times 
        it melts while it is still fresh fallen. Thus, at the opposition of 1881-82 
        the spreading of the northern snows was delayed until seven weeks after 
        the equinox: and they had, accordingly, no sooner reached their maximum 
        than they began to decline. And Professor Pickering's photographs of April 
        9th and 10th, 1890, proved that the southern calotte may assume its definitive 
        proportions in a single night.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No attempt has yet been made to estimate the 
        quantity of water derivable from the melting of one of these formations; 
        yet the experiment is worth trying as a help towards defining ideas. Let 
        us grant that the average depth of snow in them, of the delicate Martian 
        kind, is twenty feet, equivalent at the most to one foot of water. The 
        maximum area covered, of 2,400,000 square miles, is nearly equal to that 
        of the United States, while the whole globe of Mars measures 55,500,000 
        square miles, of which one-third, on the present hypothesis, is under 
        cultivation, and in need of water. Nearly the whole of the dark areas, 
        as we know, are situated in the southern hemisphere, of which they extend 
        over, at the very least, 17,000,000 square miles; <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        23]]</font> that is to say, they cover an area, in round numbers, seven 
        times that of the snow-cap. Only one-seventh of a foot of water, accordingly, 
        could possibly be made available for their fertilisation, supposing them 
        to get the entire advantage of the spring freshet. Upon a stint of less 
        than two inches of water these fertile lands are expected to flourish 
        and bear abundant crops; and since they completely enclose the polar area 
        they are necessarily served first. The great emissaries for carrying off 
        the surplus of their aqueous riches, would then appear to be superfluous 
        constructions, nor is it likely that the share in those riches due to 
        the canals and oases, intricately dividing up the wide, dry, continental 
        plains, can ever be realised.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have assumed, in our little calculation, 
        that the entire contents of a polar hood turn to water; but in actual 
        fact a considerable proportion of them must pass directly into vapour, 
        omitting the intermediate stage. Even with us a large quantity of snow 
        is removed aerially; and in the rare atmosphere of Mars this cause of 
        waste must be especially effective. Thus the polar reservoirs are despoiled 
        in the act of being opened. Further objections might be taken to Mr. Lowell's 
        irrigation scheme, but enough has been said to show that it is hopelessly 
        unworkable.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that the writer of this article 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 24]]</font> accepted the existence of water 
        on Mars, on the testimony of Sir W. Huggins, which, in view of later observations, 
        he has himself acknowledged to be valueless. Dr. Johnstone Stoney's proof 
        of its absence, derived from the molecular theory of gases, had not then 
        been made public.</p>
      <p><i>Description of some of the Canals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of his volume Mr. Lowell gives a 
        large chart of Mars on Mercator's projection, showing the canals and other 
        features seen during the opposition of 1905. This contains many canals 
        not shown on the map here reproduced (see frontispiece), and some of the 
        differences between the two are very puzzling. Looking at our map, which 
        shows the north-polar snow below, so that the south pole is out of the 
        view at the top of the map, the central feature is the large spot Ascr&aelig;eus 
        Lucus, from which ten canals diverge centrally, and four from the sides, 
        forming wide double canals, fourteen in all. There is also a canal named 
        Ulysses, which here passes far to the right of the spot, but in the large 
        chart enters it centrally. Looking at our map we see, going downwards 
        a little to the left, the canal Udon, which runs through a dark area quite 
        to the outer margin. In the dark area, however, there is shown on the 
        chart a spot Aspledon Lucus, where five canals meet, and if this is taken 
        as a terminus the Udon canal is almost exactly <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        25]]</font> 2000 miles long, and another on its right, Lapadon, is the 
        same length, while Ich, running in a slightly curved line to a large spot 
        (Lucus Castorius on the chart) is still longer. The Ulysses canal, which 
        (on the chart) runs straight from the point of the Mare Sirenum to the 
        Astr&aelig;eus Lucus is about 2200 miles long. Others however are even 
        longer, and Mr. Lowell says: &quot;With them 2000 miles is common; while many 
        exceed 2500; and the Eumenides-Orcus is 3540 miles from the point where 
        it leaves Lucus Phoeniceus to where it enters the Trivium Charontis.&quot; 
        This last canal is barely visible on our map, its commencement being indicated 
        by the word Eumenides.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trivium Charontis is situated just beyond 
        the right-hand margin of our map. It is a triangular dark area, the sides 
        about 200 miles long, and it is shown on the chart as being the centre 
        from which radiate thirteen canals. Another centre is Aqu&aelig; Calid&aelig; 
        situated at the point of a dark area running obliquely from 55&deg; to 
        35&deg; N. latitude, and, as shown on a map of the opposite hemisphere 
        to our map, has nearly twenty canals radiating from it in almost every 
        direction. Here at all events there seems to be no special connection 
        with the polar snow-caps, and the radiating lines seem to have no intelligent 
        purpose whatever, but are such as might result from fractures in a glass 
        globe produced by firing at it with very small shots one at a time. <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        26]]</font> Taking the whole series of them, Mr. Lowell very justly compares 
        them to &quot;a network which triangulates the surface of the planet like a 
        geodetic survey, into polygons of all shapes and sizes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very lowest estimate the total length 
        of the canals observed and mapped by Mr. Lowell must be over a hundred 
        thousand miles, while he assures us that numbers of others have been seen 
        over the whole surface, but so faintly or on such rare occasions as to 
        elude all attempts to fix their position with certainty. But these, being 
        of the same character and evidently forming part of the same system, must 
        also be artificial, and thus we are led to a system of irrigation of almost 
        unimaginable magnitude on a planet which has no mountains, no rivers, 
        and no rain to support it; whose whole water-supply is derived from polar 
        snows, the amount of which is ludicrously inadequate to need any such 
        world-wide system; while the low atmospheric pressure would lead to rapid 
        evaporation, thus greatly diminishing the small amount of moisture that 
        is available. Everyone must, I think, agree with Miss Clerke, that, even 
        admitting the assumption that the polar snows consist of frozen water, 
        the excessively scanty amount of water thus obtained would render any 
        scheme of world-wide distribution of it hopelessly unworkable.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very remarkable phenomena of the duplication 
        of many of the lines, together with the dark <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        27]]</font> spots--the so-called oases--at their intersections, are doubtless 
        all connected in some unknown way with the constitution and past history 
        of the planet; but, on the theory of the whole being works of art, they 
        certainly do <i>not</i> help to remove any of the difficulties which have 
        been shown to attend the theory that the single lines represent artificial 
        canals of irrigation with a strip of verdure on each side of them produced 
        by their overflow.</p>
      <p><i>Lowell on the Purpose of the Canals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving this subject it will be well 
        to quote Mr. Lowell's own words as to the supposed perfectly level surface 
        of Mars, and his interpretation of the origin and purpose of the 'canals':</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A body of planetary size, if unrotating, becomes 
        a sphere, except for solar tidal deformation; if rotating, it takes on 
        a spheroidal form exactly expressive, so far as observation goes, of the 
        socalled centrifugal force at work. Mars presents such a figure, being 
        flattened out to correspond to its axial rotation. Its surface therefore 
        is in fluid equilibrium, or, in other words, a particle of liquid at any 
        point of its surface at the present time would stay where it was devoid 
        of inclination to move elsewhere. Now the water which quickens the verdure 
        of the canals moves from the pole down to the equator as the season advances. 
        This it does then irrespective of gravity. No natural force <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        28]]</font> propels it, and the inference is forthright and inevitable 
        that it is artificially helped to its end. There seems to be no escape 
        from this deduction. Water only flows downhill, and there is no such thing 
        as downhill on a surface already in fluid equilibrium. A few canals might 
        presumably be so situated that their flow could, by inequality of terrane, 
        lie equator-ward, but not all. . . . Now it is not in particular but by 
        general consent that the canal-system of Mars develops from pole to equator. 
        From the respective times at which the minima take place, it appears that 
        the canal-quickening occupies fifty-two days, as evidenced by the successive 
        vegetal darkenings, to descend from latitude 72&deg; north to latitude 
        0&deg;, a journey of 2650 miles. This gives for the water a speed of fifty-one 
        miles a day, or 2.1 miles an hour. The rate of progression is remarkably 
        uniform, and this abets the deduction as to assisted transference. But 
        the fact is more unnatural yet. The growth pays no regard to the equator, 
        but proceeds across it as if it did not exist into the planet's other 
        hemisphere. Here is something still more telling than travel to this point. 
        For even if we suppose, for the sake of argument, that natural forces 
        took the water down to the equator, their action must there be certainly 
        reversed, and the equator prove a dead-line, to pass which were impossible&quot; 
        (pp. 374-5).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my readers will agree with me that this 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 29]]</font> whole argument is one of the most 
        curious ever put forth seriously by an eminent man of science. Because 
        the polar compression of Mars is about what calculation shows it ought 
        to be in accordance with its rate of rotation, its surface is in a state 
        of 'fluid equilibrium,' and must therefore be absolutely level throughout. 
        But the polar compression of the earth equally agrees with calculation; 
        therefore its surface is also in 'fluid equilibrium'; therefore it also 
        ought to be as perfectly level on land as it is on the ocean surface! 
        But as we know this is very far from being the case, why must it be so 
        in Mars? Are we to suppose Mars to have been formed in some totally different 
        way from other planets, and that there neither is nor ever has been any 
        reaction between its interior and exterior forces? Again, the assumption 
        of perfect flatness is directly opposed to all observation and all analogy 
        with what we see on the earth and moon. It gives no account whatever of 
        the numerous and large dark patches, once termed seas, but now found to 
        be not so, and to be full of detailed markings and varied depths of shadow. 
        To suppose that these are all the same dead-level as the light-coloured 
        portions are assumed to be, implies that the darkness is one of material 
        and colour only, not of diversified contour, which again is contrary to 
        experience, since difference of material with us always leads to differences 
        in rate of <font color="#990000">[[p. 30]]</font> degradation, and hence 
        of diversified contour, as these dark spaces actually show themselves 
        under favourable conditions to independent observers.</p>
      <p><i>Lowell on the System of Canals as a whole.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now see what Mr. Lowell claims to be 
        the plain teaching of the 'canals' as a whole:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But last and all-embracing in its import is 
        the system which the canals form. Instead of running at hap-hazard, the 
        canals are interconnected in a most remarkable manner. They seek centres 
        instead of avoiding them. The centres are linked thus perfectly one with 
        another, an arrangement which could not result from centres, whether of 
        explosion or otherwise, which were themselves discrete. Furthermore, the 
        system covers the whole surface of the planet, dark areas and light ones 
        alike, a world-wide distribution which exceeds the bounds of natural possibility. 
        Any force which could act longitudinally on such a scale must be limited 
        latitudinally in its action, as witness the belts of Jupiter and the spots 
        upon the sun. Rotational, climatic, or other physical cause could not 
        fail of zonal expression. Yet these lines are grandly indifferent to such 
        competing influences. Finally, the system, after meshing the surface in 
        its entirety, runs straight into the polar caps.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is, then, a system whose end and aim is 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 31]]</font> the tapping of the snow-cap for 
        the water there semi-annually let loose; then to distribute it over the 
        planet's face&quot; (p. 373).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, again, we have curiously weak arguments 
        adduced to support the view that these numerous straight lines imply works 
        of art rather than of nature, especially in the comparison made with the 
        belts of Jupiter and the spots on the sun, both purely atmospheric phenomena, 
        whereas the lines on Mars are on the solid surface of the planet. Why 
        should there be any resemblance between them? Every fact stated in the 
        above quotation, always keeping in mind the physical conditions of the 
        planet--its very tenuous atmosphere and rainless desert-surface--seem 
        wholly in favour of a purely natural as opposed to an artificial origin; 
        and at the close of this discussion I shall suggest one which seems to 
        me to be at least possible, and to explain the whole series of the phenomena 
        set forth and largely discovered by Mr. Lowell, in a simpler and more 
        probable manner than does his tremendous assumption of their being works 
        of art. Readers who may not possess Mr. Lowell's volume will find three 
        of his most recent maps of the 'canals' reproduced in <i>Nature</i> of 
        October 11th, 1906.</p>
      <p><i>Notes, Chapter 3:</i></p>
      <p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="31" id="31"></a>1</sup>In 1890 at Mount Wilson, 
        California, Mr. W. H. Pickering's photographs of Mars on April 9th showed 
        the southern polar cap of moderate dimensions, but with a large dim adjacent 
        area. Twenty-four hours later a corresponding plate showed this same area 
        brilliantly white; the result apparently of a great Martian snowfall. 
        In 1882 the same observer witnessed the steady disappearance of 1,600,000 
        square miles of the southern snow-cap, an area nearly one-third of that 
        hemisphere of the planet. <font color="#990000">[[on p. 17]]</font><br />
        <sup><a name="32" id="32"></a>2</sup>What the evaporation is likely to be in Mars 
        may be estimated by the fact, stated by Professor J. W. Gregory in his 
        recent volume on 'Australia' in <i>Stanford's Compendium</i>, that in 
        North-West Victoria evaporation is at the rate of ten feet per annum, 
        while in Central Australia it is very much more. The greatly diminished 
        atmospheric pressure in Mars will probably more than balance the loss 
        of sun-heat in producing rapid evaporation. <font color="#990000">[[on

        Is Animal Life Possible On Mars?</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now shown, that, even admitting the accuracy 
        of all Mr. Lowell's observations, and provisionally accepting all his 
        chief conclusions as to the climate, the nature of the snow-caps, the 
        vegetation, and the animal life of Mars, yet his interpretation of the 
        lines on its surface as being veritably 'canals,' constructed by intelligent 
        beings for the special purpose of carrying water to the more arid regions, 
        is wholly erroneous and rationally inconceivable. I now proceed to discuss 
        his more fundamental position as to the actual habitability of Mars by 
        a highly organised and intellectual race of material organic beings.</p>
      <p><i>Water and Air essential to Life.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, fortunately, the issue is rendered very 
        simple, because Mr. Lowell fully recognises the identity of the constitution 
        of matter and of physical laws throughout the solar-system, and that for 
        any high form of organic life certain conditions which <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        33]]</font> are absolutely essential on our earth must also exist in Mars. 
        He admits, for example, that water is essential, that an atmosphere containing 
        oxygen, nitrogen, aqueous vapour, and carbonic acid gas is essential, 
        and that an abundant vegetation is essential; and these of course involve 
        a surface-temperature through a considerable portion of the year that 
        renders the existence of these--especially of water--possible and available 
        for the purposes of a high and abundant animal life.</p>
      <p><i>Blue Colour the only Evidence of Water.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In attempting to show that these essentials 
        actually exist on Mars he is not very successful. He adduces evidence 
        of an atmosphere, but of an exceedingly scanty one, since the greatest 
        amount he can give to it is--&quot;not more than about four inches of barometric 
        pressure as we reckon it&quot;;<sup><a href="#41">1</a></sup> and he assumes, 
        as he has a fair right to do till disproved, that it consists of oxygen 
        and nitrogen, with carbon-dioxide and water-vapour, in approximately the 
        same proportions as with us. With regard to the last item--the water-vapour--there 
        are however many serious difficulties. The water-vapour of our atmosphere 
        is derived from the enormous area of our seas, oceans, lakes, and rivers, 
        as well as from the evaporation from heated <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        34]]</font> lands and tropical forests of much of the moisture produced 
        by frequent and abundant rains. All these sources of supply are admittedly 
        absent from Mars, which has no permanent bodies of water, no rain, and 
        tropical regions which are almost entirely desert. Many writers have therefore 
        doubted the existence of water in any form upon this planet, supposing 
        that the snow-caps are not formed of frozen water but of carbon-dioxide, 
        or some other heavy gas, in a frozen state; and Mr. Lowell evidently feels 
        this to be a difficulty, since the only fact he is able to adduce in favour 
        of the melting snows of the polar caps producing water is, that at the 
        time they are melting a marginal blue band appears which accompanies them 
        in their retreat, and this blue colour is said to prove conclusively that 
        the liquid is not carbonic acid but water. This point he dwells upon repeatedly, 
        stating, of these blue borders: &quot;This excludes the possibility of their 
        being formed by carbon-dioxide, and shows that of all the substances we 
        know the material composing them must be water.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only proof of the existence of <i>water</i> 
        he adduces, and it is certainly a most extraordinary and futile one. For 
        it is perfectly well known that although water, in large masses and by 
        transmitted light, is of a blue colour, yet shallow water by reflected 
        light is not so; and in the case of the liquid produced by the snow-caps 
        of Mars, <font color="#990000">[[p. 35]]</font> which the whole conditions 
        of the planet show must be shallow, and also be more or less turbid, it 
        cannot possibly be the cause of the 'deep blue' tint said to result from 
        the melting of the snow.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a very weighty argument depending 
        on the molecular theory of gases against the polar caps of Mars being 
        composed of frozen water at all. The mass and elastic force of the several 
        gases is due to the greater or less rapidity of the vibratory motion of 
        their molecules under identical conditions. The speed of these molecular 
        motions has been ascertained for all the chief gases, and it is found 
        to be so great as in certain cases to enable them to overcome the force 
        of gravity and escape from a planet's surface into space. Dr. G. Johnstone 
        Stoney has specially investigated this subject, and he finds that the 
        force of gravity on the earth is sufficient to retain all the gases composing 
        its atmosphere, but not sufficient to retain hydrogen; and as a consequence, 
        although this gas is produced in small quantities by volcanoes and by 
        decomposing vegetation, yet no trace of it is found in our atmosphere. 
        The moon however, having only one-eightieth the mass of the earth, cannot 
        retain any gas, hence its airless and waterless condition.</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 36]]</font> <i>Water Vapour cannot exist on 
        Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Dr. Stoney finds that in order to retain 
        water vapour permanently a planet must have a mass at least a quarter 
        that of the earth. But the mass of Mars is only one-ninth that of the 
        earth; therefore, unless there are some special conditions that prevent 
        its loss, this gas cannot be present in the atmosphere. Mr. Lowell does 
        not refer to this argument against his view, neither does he claim the 
        evidence of spectroscopy in his favour. This was alleged more than thirty 
        years ago to show the existence of water-vapour in the atmosphere of Mars, 
        but of late years it has been doubted, and Mr. Lowell's complete silence 
        on the subject, while laying stress on such a very weak and inconclusive 
        argument as that from the tinge of colour that is observed a little distance 
        from the edge of the diminishing snow-caps, shows that he himself does 
        not think the fact to be thus proved. If he did he would hardly adduce 
        such an argument for its presence as the following: &quot;The melting of the 
        caps on the one hand and their re-forming on the other affirm the presence 
        of water-vapour in the Martian atmosphere, of whatever else that air consists&quot; 
        (p. 162). Yet absolutely the only proof he gives that the caps are frozen 
        water is the almost frivolous colour-argument above referred to!</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 37]]</font> <i>No Spectroscopic Evidence of 
        Water Vapour.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sir William Huggins is the chief authority 
        quoted for this fact, and is referred to as being almost conclusive in 
        the third edition of Miss Clerke's <i>History of Astronomy</i> in 1893, 
        I have ascertained that his opinion at the present time is that &quot;there 
        is no conclusive proof of the presence of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere 
        of Mars, and that observations at the Lick Observatory (in 1895), where 
        the conditions and instruments are of the highest order, were negative.&quot; 
        He also informs me that Marchand at the Pic du Midi Observatory was unable 
        to obtain lines of aqueous vapour in the spectrum of Mars; and that in 
        1905, Slipher, at Mr. Lowell's observatory, was unable to detect any indications 
        of aqueous vapour in the spectrum of Mars.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It thus appears that spectroscopic observations 
        are quite accordant with the calculations founded on the molecular theory 
        of gases as to the absence of aqueous vapour, and therefore presumably 
        of liquid water, from Mars. It is true that the spectroscopic argument 
        is purely negative, and this may be due to the extreme delicacy of the 
        observations required; but that dependent on the inability of the force 
        of gravity to retain it is positive scientific evidence against its presence, 
        and, till shown to be erroneous, must be held to be conclusive.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This absence of water is of itself conclusive 
        against <font color="#990000">[[p. 38]]</font> the existence of animal 
        life, unless we enter the regions of pure conjecture as to the possibility 
        of some other liquid being able to take its place, and that liquid being 
        as omnipresent there as water is here. Mr. Lowell however never takes 
        this ground, but bases his whole theory on the fundamental identity of 
        the substance of the bodies of living organisms wherever they may exist 
        in the solar system.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next two chapters I shall discuss an 
        equally essential condition, that of temperature, which affords a still 
        more conclusive and even crushing argument against the suitability of 
        Mars for the existence of organic life.</p>

        Temperature of Mars--Mr. Lowell's Estimate</b>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now to consider a still more important 
        and fundamental question, and one which Mr. Lowell does not grapple with 
        in this volume, the actual temperatures on Mars due to its distance from 
        the sun and the atmospheric conditions on which he himself lays so much 
        stress. If I am not greatly mistaken we shall arrive at conclusions on 
        this subject which are absolutely fatal to the conception of any high 
        form of organic life being possible on this planet.</p>
      <p><i>The Problem of Terrestrial Temperatures.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the problem may be understood 
        and its importance appreciated, it is necessary to explain the now generally 
        accepted principles as to the causes which determine the temperatures 
        on our earth, and, presumably, on all other planets whose conditions are 
        not wholly unlike ours. The fact of <font color="#990000">[[p. 40]]</font> 
        the internal heat of the earth which becomes very perceptible even at 
        the moderate depths reached in mines and deep borings, and in the deepest 
        mines becomes a positive inconvenience, leads many people to suppose that 
        the surface-temperatures of the earth are partly due to this cause. But 
        it is now generally admitted that this is not the case, the reason being 
        that all rocks and soils, in their natural compacted state, are exceedingly 
        bad conductors of heat.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A striking illustration of this is the fact, 
        that a stream of lava often continues to be red hot at a few feet depth 
        for years after the surface is consolidated, and is hardly any warmer 
        than that of the surrounding land. A still more remarkable case is that 
        of a glacier on the south-east side of the highest cone of Etna underneath 
        a lava stream with an intervening bed of volcanic sand only ten feet thick. 
        This was visited by Sir Charles Lyell in 1828, and a second time thirty 
        years later, when he made a very careful examination of the strata, and 
        was quite satisfied that the sand and the lava stream together had actually 
        preserved this mass of ice, which neither the heat of the lava above it 
        at its first outflow, nor the continued heat rising from the great volcano 
        below it, had been able to melt or perceptibly to diminish in thirty years. 
        Another fact that points in the same direction is the existence over the 
        whole floor of the deepest <font color="#990000">[[p. 41]]</font> oceans 
        of ice-cold water, which, originating in the polar seas, owing to its 
        greater density sinks and creeps slowly along the ocean bottom to the 
        depths of the Atlantic and Pacific, and is not perceptibly warmed by the 
        internal heat of the earth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the solid crust of the earth is estimated 
        as at least about twenty miles in average thickness; and, keeping in mind 
        the other facts just referred to, we can understand that the heat from 
        the interior passes through it with such extreme slowness as not to be 
        detected at the surface, the varying temperatures of which are due entirely 
        to solar heat. A large portion of this heat is stored up in the surface 
        soil, and especially in the surface layer of the oceans and seas, thus 
        partly equalising the temperatures of day and night, of winter and summer, 
        so as greatly to ameliorate the rapid changes of temperature that would 
        otherwise occur. Our dense atmosphere is also of immense advantage to 
        us as an equaliser of temperature, charged as it almost always is with 
        a large quantity of water-vapour. This latter gas, when not condensed 
        into cloud, allows the solar heat to pass freely to the earth; but it 
        has the singular and highly beneficial property of absorbing and retaining 
        the dark or lower-grade heat given off by the earth which would otherwise 
        radiate into space much more rapidly. We must therefore always remember 
        that, very nearly if not quite, the <i>whole</i> of <i>the </i><font color="#990000">[[p. 
        42]]</font><i> warmth we experience on the earth is derived from the sun</i>.<sup><a href="#51">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand the immense significance 
        of this conclusion we must know what is meant by the <i>whole</i> heat 
        or warmth; as unless we know this we cannot define what half or any other 
        proportion of sun-heat really means. Now I feel pretty sure that nine 
        out of ten of the average educated public would answer the following question 
        incorrectly: The mean temperature of the southern half of England is about 
        48&deg; F. Supposing the earth received only half the sun-heat it now receives, 
        what would then be the probable mean temperature of the South of England? 
        The majority would, I think, answer at once--About 24&deg; F. Nearly as many 
        would perhaps say--48&deg; F. is 16&deg; above the freezing point; therefore half 
        the heat received would bring us down to 8&deg; above the freezing point, 
        or 40&deg; F. Very few, I think, would realise that our share of half the 
        amount of sun-heat received by the earth would probably result in reducing 
        our mean temperature to about 100&deg; F. below the freezing point, and perhaps 
        even lower. This is about the very lowest temperature yet experienced 
        on the earth's surface. To understand <font color="#990000">[[p. 43]]</font> 
        how such results are obtained a few words must be said about the absolute 
        zero of temperature.</p>
      <p><i>The Zero of Temperature.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heat is now believed to be entirely due to ether-vibration, 
        which produces a correspondingly rapid vibration of the molecules of matter, 
        causing it to expand and producing all the phenomena we term 'heat.' We 
        can conceive this vibration to increase indefinitely, and thus there would 
        appear to be no necessary limit to the amount of heat possible, but we 
        cannot conceive it to decrease indefinitely at the same uniform rate, 
        as it must soon inevitably come to nothing. Now it has been found by experiment 
        that gases under uniform pressure expand 1/273 of their volume for each 
        degree Centigrade of increased temperature, so that in passing from 0&deg; 
        C. to 273&deg; C. they are doubled in volume. They also decrease in volume 
        at the same rate for each degree below 0&deg; C. (the freezing point of 
        water). Hence if this goes on to -273&deg; C. a gas will have no volume, 
        or it will undergo some change of nature. Hence this is called the zero 
        of temperature, or the temperature to which any matter falls which receives 
        no heat from any other matter. It is also sometimes called the temperature 
        of space, or of the ether in a state of rest, if that is possible. All 
        the gases have now been proved to become, first liquid and then (most 
        of them) <font color="#990000">[[p. 44]]</font> solid, at temperatures 
        considerably above this zero.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to compare the proportional temperatures 
        of bodies, whether on the earth or in space, is therefore by means of 
        a scale beginning at this natural zero, instead of those scales founded 
        on the artificial zero of the freezing point of water, or, as in Fahrenheit's, 
        32&deg; below it. Only by using the natural zero and measuring continuously 
        from it can we estimate temperatures in relative proportion to the amount 
        of heat received. This is termed the absolute zero, and so that we start 
        reckoning from that point it does not matter whether the scale adopted 
        is the Centigrade or that of Fahrenheit.</p>
      <p><i>The Complex Problem of Planetary Temperatures.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if, as is the case with Mars, a planet receives 
        only half the amount of solar heat that we receive, owing to its greater 
        distance from the sun, and if the mean temperature of our earth is 60&deg; 
        F., this is equal to 551&deg; F. on the absolute scale. It would therefore 
        appear very simple to halve this amount and obtain 275.5&deg; F. as the 
        mean temperature of that planet. But this result is erroneous, because 
        the actual amount of sun heat intercepted by a planet is only one condition 
        out of many that determine its resulting temperature. Radiation, that 
        is loss of heat, is going on concurrently with gain, and the rate of loss 
        varies with the temperature according to a law <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        45]]</font> recently discovered, the loss being much greater at high temperatures 
        in proportion to the 4th power of the absolute temperature. Then, again, 
        the whole heat intercepted by a planet does not reach its surface unless 
        it has no atmosphere. When it has one, much is reflected or absorbed according 
        to complex laws dependent on the density and composition of the atmosphere. 
        Then, again, the heat that reaches the actual surface is partly reflected 
        and partly absorbed, according to the nature of that surface--land or 
        water, desert or forest or snowclad--that part which is absorbed being 
        the chief agent in raising the temperature of the surface and of the air 
        in contact with it. Very important too is the loss of heat by radiation 
        from these various heated surfaces at different rates; while the atmosphere 
        itself sends back to the surface an ever varying portion of both this 
        radiant and reflected heat according to distinct laws. Further difficulties 
        arise from the fact that much of the sun's heat consists of dark or invisible 
        rays, and it cannot therefore be measured by the quantity of light only.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this rough statement it will be seen that 
        the problem is an exceedingly complex one, not to be decided off-hand, 
        or by any simple method. It has in fact been usually considered as (strictly 
        speaking) insoluble, and only to be estimated by a more or less rough 
        approximation, or by the method of general analogy from certain known 
        facts. It will be seen, <font color="#990000">[[p. 46]]</font> from what 
        has been said in previous chapters, that Mr. Lowell, in his book, has 
        used the latter method, and, by taking the presence of water and water-vapour 
        in Mars as proved by the behaviour of the snow-caps and the bluish colour 
        that results from their melting, has deduced a temperature above the freezing 
        point of water, as prevalent in the equatorial regions permanently, and 
        in the temperate and arctic zones during a portion of each year.</p>
      <p><i>Mr. Lowell's Mathematical Investigation of the Problem.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as this result has been held to be both 
        improbable in itself and founded on no valid evidence, he has now, in 
        the <i>London</i>, <i>Edinburgh</i>, and <i>Dublin Philosophical Magazine</i> 
        of July 1907, published an elaborate paper of 15 pages, entitled <i>A 
        General Method for Evaluating the Surface-Temperatures of the Planets; 
        with special reference to the Temperature of Mars</i>, by Professor Percival 
        Lowell; and in this paper, by what purports to be strict mathematical 
        reasoning based on the most recent discoveries as to the laws of heat, 
        as well as on measurements or estimates of the various elements and constants 
        used in the calculations, he arrives at a conclusion strikingly accordant 
        with that put forward in the recently published volume.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having myself neither mathematical nor physical 
        knowledge sufficient to enable me to criticise this <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        47]]</font> elaborate paper, except on a few points, I will here limit 
        myself to giving a short account of it, so as to explain its method of 
        procedure; after which I may add a few notes on what seem to me doubtful 
        points; while I also hope to be able to give the opinions of some more 
        competent critics than myself.</p>
      <p><i>Mr. Lowell's Mode of Estimating the Surface-temperature of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author first states, that Professor Young, 
        in his <i>General Astronomy</i> (1898), makes the mean temperature of 
        Mars 223.6&deg; absolute, by using Newton's law of heat being radiated 
        in proportion to temperature, and 363&deg; abs. (= -96&deg; F.) by Dulong 
        and Petit's law; but adds, that a closer determination has been made by 
        Professor Moulton, using Stefan's law, that radiation is as the <i>4th</i> 
        power of the temperature, whence results a mean temperature of -31&deg; 
        F. These estimates assume identity of atmospheric conditions of Mars and 
        the Earth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as none of these estimates take account 
        of the many complex factors which interfere with such direct and simple 
        calculations, Mr. Lowell then proceeds to enunciate them, and work out 
        mathematically the effects they produce:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The whole radiant energy of the sun on striking 
        a planet becomes divided as follows: Part is reflected back into space, 
        part absorbed by the atmosphere, part transmitted to the surface <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        48]]</font> of the planet. This surface again reflects a portion and only 
        the balance left goes to warm the planet.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To solve this complex problem we are helped 
        by the <i>albedoes</i> or intrinsic brilliancy of the planets, which depend 
        on the proportion of the visible rays which are reflected and which determines 
        the comparative brightness of their respective surfaces. We also have 
        to find the ratio of the invisible to the visible rays and the heating 
        power of each.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) He then refers to the actinometer and pyroheliometer, 
        instruments for measuring the actual heat derived from the sun, and also 
        to the Bolometer, an instrument invented by Professor Langley for measuring 
        the invisible heat rays, which he has proved to extend to more than three 
        times the length of the whole heat-spectrum as previously known, and has 
        also shown that the invisible rays contribute 68 per cent. of the sun's 
        total energy.<sup><a href="#52">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Then follows an elaborate estimate of the 
        loss of heat during the passage of the sun's rays through our atmosphere 
        from experiments made at different altitudes and from the estimated reflective 
        power of the various parts of the earth's surface--rocks and soil, ocean, 
        forest and snow--the final result being that three-fourths of the whole 
        sun-heat is reflected back into space, <font color="#990000">[[p. 49]]</font> 
        forming our <i>albedo</i>, while only one-fourth is absorbed by the soil 
        and goes to warm the air and determine our mean temperature.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) We now have another elaborate estimate of 
        the comparative amounts of heat actually received by Mars and the Earth, 
        dependent on their very different amounts of atmosphere, and this estimate 
        depends almost wholly on the comparative <i>albedoes</i>, that of Mars, 
        as observed by astronomers being 0.27, while ours has been estimated in 
        a totally different way as being 0.75, whence he concludes that nearly 
        three-fourths of the sun-heat that Mars receives reaches the surface and 
        determines its temperature, while we get only one-fourth of our total 
        amount. Then by applying Stefan's law, that the radiation is as the 4th 
        power of the surface temperature, he reaches the final result that the 
        actual heating power at the surface of Mars is considerably <i>more</i> 
        than on the Earth, and would produce a mean temperature of 72&deg; F., 
        if it were not for the greater conservative or blanketing power of our 
        denser and more water-laden atmosphere. The difference produced by this 
        latter fact he minimises by dwelling on the probability of a greater proportion 
        of carbonic-acid gas and water-vapour in the Martian atmosphere, and thus 
        brings down the mean temperature of Mars to 48&deg; F., which is almost 
        exactly the same as that of the southern half of <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        50]]</font> England. He has also, as the result of observations, reduced 
        the probable density of the atmosphere of Mars to 2 1/2 inches of mercury, 
        or only one-twelfth of that of the Earth.</p>
      <p><i>Critical Remarks on Mr. Lowell's Paper.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part of this paper, indicated under 
        pars. 4 and 5, is the most elaborate, occupying eight pages, and it contains 
        much that seems uncertain, if not erroneous. In particular, it seems very 
        unlikely that under a clear sky over the whole earth we should only receive 
        at the sea-level 0.23 of the solar rays which the earth intercepts (p. 
        167). These data largely depend on observations made in California and 
        other parts of the southern United States, where the lower atmosphere 
        is exceptionally dust-laden. Till we have similar observations made in 
        the tropical forest-regions, which cover so large an area, and where the 
        atmosphere is purified by frequent rains, and also on the prairies and 
        the great oceans, we cannot trust these very local observations for general 
        conclusions affecting the whole earth. Later, in the same article (p. 
        170), Mr. Lowell says: &quot;Clouds transmit approximately 20 per cent. of 
        the heat reaching them: a clear sky at sea-level 60 per cent. As the sky 
        is half the time cloudy the mean transmission is 35 per cent.&quot; These statements 
        seem incompatible with that quoted above.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 51]]</font> The figure 
        he uses in his calculations for the actual albedo of the earth, 0.75, 
        is also not only improbable, but almost self-contradictory, because the 
        albedo of cloud is 0.72, and that of the great cloud-covered planet, Jupiter, 
        is given by Lowell as 0.75, while Zollner made it only 0.62. Again, Lowell 
        gives Venus an albedo of 0.92, while Zollner made it only 0.50 and Mr. 
        Gore 0.65. This shows the extreme uncertainty of these estimates, while 
        the fact that both Venus and Jupiter are wholly cloud-covered, while we 
        are only half-covered, renders it almost certain that our albedo is far 
        less than Mr. Lowell makes it. It is evident that mathematical calculations 
        founded upon such uncertain data cannot yield trustworthy results. But 
        this is by no means the only case in which the data employed in this paper 
        are of uncertain value. Everywhere we meet with figures of somewhat doubtful 
        accuracy. Here we have somebody's 'estimate' quoted, there another person's 
        'observation,' and these are adopted without further remark and used in 
        the various calculations leading to the result above quoted. It requires 
        a practised mathematician, and one fully acquainted with the extensive 
        literature of this subject, to examine these various data, and track them 
        through the maze of formul&aelig; and figures so as to determine to what 
        extent they affect the final result.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is however one curious oversight which 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 52]]</font> I must refer to, as it is a point 
        to which I have given much attention. Not only does Mr. Lowell assume, 
        as in his book, that the 'snows' of Mars consist of frozen water, and 
        that therefore there <i>is</i> water on its surface and water-vapour in 
        its atmosphere, not only does he ignore altogether Dr. Johnstone Stoney's 
        calculations with regard to it, which I have already referred to (p. 35), 
        but he uses terms that imply that water-vapour is one of the heavier components 
        of our atmosphere. The passage is at p. 168 of the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>. 
        After stating that, owing to the very small barometric pressure in Mars, 
        water would boil at 110&deg; F., he adds: &quot;The sublimation at lower temperatures 
        would be correspondingly increased. Consequently the amount of water-vapour 
        in the Martian air must on that score be relatively greater than our own.&quot; 
        Then follows this remarkable passage: &quot;Carbon-dioxide, because of its 
        greater specific gravity, would also be in relatively greater amount so 
        far as this cause is considered. For the planet would part, <i>c&aelig;teris 
        paribus</i>, with its lighter gases the quickest. Whence as regards both 
        water-vapour and carbon-dioxide we have reason to think them in relatively 
        greater quantity than in our own air at corresponding barometric pressure.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand this passage except as implying 
        that 'water-vapour and carbon-dioxide' are among the heavier and not among 
        the lighter gases <font color="#990000">[[p. 53]]</font> of the atmosphere--those 
        which the planet 'parts with quickest.' But this is just what water-vapour 
        <i>is</i>, being a little less than two-thirds the weight of air (0.6225), 
        and one of those which the planet <i>would</i> part with the quickest, 
        and which, according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney, it loses altogether.</p>

      <p>Note on Professor Lowell's article in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>;

      <p>&nbsp;
      </p><blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;I think Professor Lowell's results are erroneous 
        through his neglect of the heat stored in the air by its absorption of 
        radiation both from the sun and from the surface. The air thus heated 
        radiates to the surface and keeps up the temperature. I have sent to the 
        <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> a paper in which I think it is shown that 
        when the radiation by the atmosphere is taken into account the results 
        are entirely changed. The temperature of Mars, with Professor Lowell's 
        data, still comes out far below the freezing-point--still further below 
        than the increased distance alone would make it. Indeed, the lower temperature 
        on elevated regions of the earth's surface would lead us to expect this.

        A New Estimate of the Temperature of Mars.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are presented with a complex problem 
        depending on a great number of imperfectly ascertained data, we may often 
        check the results thus obtained by the comparison of cases in which some 
        of the more important of these data are identical, while others are at 
        a maximum or a minimum. In the present case we can do this by a consideration 
        of the Moon as compared with the Earth and with Mars.</p>
      <p><i>Langley's Determination of the Moon's Temperature.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moon we see the conditions that prevail 
        in Mars both exaggerated and simplified. Mars has a very scanty atmosphere, 
        the moon none at all, or if there is one it is so excessively scanty that 
        the most refined observations have not detected it. All the complications 
        arising from the possible nature of the atmosphere, and its complex effects 
        upon reflection, absorption, and radiation are thus <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        56]]</font> eliminated. The mean distance of the moon from the sun being 
        identical with that of the earth, the total amount of heat intercepted 
        must also be identical; only in this case the whole of it reaches the 
        surface instead of one-fourth only, according to Mr. Lowell's estimate 
        for the earth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by the most refined observations with his 
        Bolometer, Mr. Langley was able to determine the temperature of the moon's 
        surface exposed to undimmed sunshine for fourteen days together; and he 
        found that, even in that portion of it on which the sun was shining almost 
        vertically, the temperature rarely rose above the freezing point of water. 
        However extraordinary this result may seem, it is really a striking confirmation 
        of the accuracy of the general laws determining temperature which I have 
        endeavoured to explain in the preceding chapter. For the same surface 
        which has had fourteen days of sunshine has also had a preceding fourteen 
        days of darkness, during which the heat which it had accumulated in its 
        surface layers would have been lost by free radiation into stellar space. 
        It thus acquires during its day a maximum temperature of only 491&deg; 
        F. absolute, while its minimum, after 14 days' continuous radiation, must 
        be very low, and is, with much reason, supposed to approach the absolute 
        zero.</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 57]]</font> <i>Rapid Loss of Heat by Radiation 
        on the Earth.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order better to comprehend what this minimum 
        may be under extreme conditions, it will be useful to take note of the 
        effects it actually produces on the earth in places where the conditions 
        are nearest to those existing on the moon or on Mars, though never quite 
        equalling, or even approaching very near them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in our great desert regions, and especially 
        on high plateaux, that extreme aridity prevails, and it is in such districts 
        that the differences between day and night temperatures reach their maximum. 
        It is stated by geographers that in parts of the Great Sahara the surface 
        temperature is sometimes 150&deg; F., while during the night it falls 
        nearly or quite to the freezing point--a difference of 118 degrees in 
        little more than 12 hours.<sup><a href="#61">1</a></sup> In the high desert 
        plains of Central Asia the extremes are said to be even greater.<sup><a href="#62">2</a></sup> 
        Again, in his <i>Universal Geography</i>, Reclus states that in the Armenian 
        Highlands the thermometer oscillates between 13&deg; F. and 112&deg; F. 
        We may therefore, without any fear of exaggeration, take it as proved 
        that a fall of 100&deg; F. in twelve or fifteen hours not infrequently 
        occurs where there is a very dry and clear atmosphere permitting continuous 
        insolation by day and rapid radiation by night.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 58]]</font> Now, 
        as it is admitted that our dense atmosphere, however dry and clear, absorbs 
        and reflects some considerable portion of the solar heat, we shall certainly 
        underestimate the radiation from the moon's surface during its long night 
        if we take as the basis of our calculation a lowering of temperature amounting 
        to 100&deg; F. during twelve hours, as not unfrequently occurs with us. 
        Using these data--with Stefan's law of decrease of radiation as the 4th 
        power of the temperature--a mathematical friend finds that the temperature 
        of the moon's surface would be reduced during the lunar night to nearly 
        200&deg; F. absolute (equal to -258&deg; F.).</p>
      <p><i>More Rapid Loss of Heat by the Moon.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although such a calculation as the above may 
        afford us a good approximation to the rate of loss of heat by Mars with 
        its very scanty atmosphere, we have now good evidence that in the case 
        of the moon the loss is much more rapid. Two independent workers have 
        investigated this subject with very accordant results--Dr. Boeddicker, 
        with Lord Rosse's 3-foot reflector and a Thermopile to measure the heat, 
        and Mr. Frank Very, with a glass reflector of 12 inches diameter and the 
        Bolometer invented by Mr. Langley. The very striking and unexpected fact 
        in which these observers agree is the sudden disappearance of much of 
        the stored-up heat during the comparatively short duration <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        59]]</font> of a total eclipse of the moon--less than two hours of complete 
        darkness, and about twice that period of partial obscuration.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Boeddicker was unable to detect any appreciable 
        heat at the period of greatest obscuration; but, owing to the extreme 
        sensitiveness of the Bolometer, Mr. Very ascertained that those parts 
        of the surface which had been longest in the shadow still emitted heat 
        &quot;to the amount of one per cent. of the heat to be expected from the full 
        moon.&quot; This however is the amount of radiation measured by the Bolometer, 
        and to get the temperature of the radiating surface we must apply Stefan's 
        law of the 4th power. Hence the temperature of the moon's dark surface 
        will be</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S730b.jpg" width="25%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p>of the highest temperature (which we may take at the freezing-point, 
        491&deg; F. abs.), or 154&deg; F. abs., just below the liquefaction point 
        of air. This is about 50&deg; lower than the amount found by calculation 
        from our most rapid radiation; and as this amount is produced in a few 
        hours, it is not too much to expect that, when continued for more than 
        two weeks (the lunar night), it might reach a temperature sufficient to 
        liquefy hydrogen (60&deg; F. abs.), or perhaps even below it.</p>
      <p><i>Theory of the Moon's Origin.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extremely rapid loss of heat by radiation, 
        at first sight so improbable as to be almost incredible, <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        60]]</font> may perhaps be to some extent explained by the physical constitution 
        of the moon's surface, which, from a theoretical point of view, does not 
        appear to have received the attention it deserves. It is clear that our 
        satellite has been long subjected to volcanic eruptions over its whole 
        visible face, and these have evidently been of an explosive nature, so 
        as to build up the very lofty cones and craters, as well as thousands 
        of smaller ones, which, owing to the absence of any degrading or denuding 
        agencies, have remained piled up as they were first formed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This highly volcanic structure can, I think, 
        be well explained by an origin such as that attributed to it by Sir George 
        Darwin, and which has been so well described by Sir Robert Ball in his 
        small volume, <i>Time and Tide</i>. These astronomers adduce strong evidence 
        that the earth once rotated so rapidly that the equatorial protuberance 
        was almost at the point of separation from the planet as a ring. Before 
        this occurred, however, the tension was so great that one large portion 
        of the protuberance where it was weakest broke away, and began to move 
        around the earth at some considerable distance from it. As about 1/50 
        of the bulk of the earth thus escaped, it must have consisted of a considerable 
        portion of the solid crust and a much larger quantity of the liquid or 
        semi-liquid interior, together with a proportionate amount of the gases 
        which we <font color="#990000">[[p. 61]]</font> know formed, and still 
        form, an important part of the earth's substance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the surface layers of the earth must have 
        been the lightest, they would necessarily, when broken up by this gigantic 
        convulsion, have come together to form the exterior of the new satellite, 
        and be soon adjusted by the forces of gravity and tidal disturbance into 
        a more or less irregular spheroidal form, all whose interstices and cavities 
        would be filled up and connected together by the liquid or semi-liquid 
        mass forced up between them. Thenceforward, as the moon increased its 
        distance and reduced its time of rotation, in the way explained by Sir 
        Robert Ball, there would necessarily commence a process of escape of the 
        imprisoned gases at every fissure and at all points and lines of weakness, 
        giving rise to numerous volcanic outlets, which, being subjected only 
        to the small force of lunar gravity (only one-sixth that of the earth), 
        would, in the course of ages, pile up those gigantic cones and ridges 
        which form its great characteristic.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this small gravitative power of the moon 
        would prevent its retaining on its surface any of the gases forming our 
        atmosphere, which would all escape from it and probably be recaptured 
        by the earth. By no process of external aggregation of solid matter to 
        such a relatively small amount as that forming the moon, even if the aggregation 
        was so violent as to produce heat enough to cause <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        62]]</font> liquefaction, could any such long-continued volcanic action 
        arise by gradual cooling, in the absence of internal gases. There might 
        be fissures, and even some outflows of molten rock; but without imprisoned 
        gases, and especially without water and water-vapour producing explosive 
        outbursts, could any such amount of scori&aelig; and ashes be produced 
        as were necessary for the building up of the vast volcanic cones, craters, 
        and craterlets we see upon the moon's surface.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware that either Sir Robert Ball or 
        Sir George Darwin have adduced this highly volcanic condition of the moon's 
        surface as a phenomenon which can <i>only</i> be explained by our satellite 
        having been thrown off a very much larger body, whose gravitative force 
        was sufficient to acquire and retain the enormous quantity of gases and 
        of water which we possess, and which are <i>absolutely essential</i> for 
        that <i>special form of cone-building volcanic action</i> which the moon 
        exhibits in so pre-eminent a degree. Yet it seems to me clear, that some 
        such hypothetical origin for our satellite would have had to be assumed 
        if Sir George Darwin had not deduced it by means of purely mathematical 
        argument based upon astronomical facts.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning now to the problem of the moon's temperature, 
        I think the phenomena this presents may be in part due to the mode of 
        formation here described. For, its entire surface being the result <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        63]]</font> of long-continued gaseous explosions, all the volcanic products--scori&aelig;, 
        pumice, and ashes--would necessarily be highly porous throughout; and, 
        never having been compacted by water-action, as on the earth, and there 
        having been no winds to carry the finer dust so as to fill up their pores 
        and fissures, the whole of the surface material to a very considerable 
        depth must be loose and porous to a high degree. This condition has been 
        further increased owing to the small power of gravity and the extreme 
        irregularity of the surface, consisting very largely of lofty cones and 
        ridges very loosely piled up to enormous heights.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this condition of the substance of the moon's 
        surface is such as would produce a high specific heat, so that it would 
        absorb a large amount of heat in proportion to the rise of temperature 
        produced, the heat being conducted downwards to a considerable depth. 
        Owing, however, to the total absence of atmosphere radiation would very 
        rapidly cool the surface, but afterwards more slowly, both on account 
        of the action of Stefan's law and because the heat stored up in the deeper 
        portions could be carried to the surface by conduction only, and with 
        extreme slowness.</p>
      <p><i>Very's Researches on the Moon's Heat.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the eclipse observations are 
        supported by the detailed examination of the surface- <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        64]]</font> temperature of the moon by Mr. Very in his <i>Prize Essay 
        on the Distribution of the Moon's Heat</i> (published by the Utrecht Society 
        of Arts and Sciences in 1891). He shows, by a diagram of the 'Phase-curve,' 
        that at the commencement of the Lunar day the surface just within the 
        illuminated limb has acquired about 1/7 of its maximum temperature, or 
        about 70&deg; F. abs. As the surface exposed to the Bolometer at each 
        observation is about 1/30 of the moon's surface, and in order to ensure 
        accuracy the instrument has to be directed to a spot lying wholly within 
        the edge of the moon, it is evident that the surface measured has already 
        been for several hours exposed to oblique sunshine. The curve of temperature 
        then rises gradually and afterwards more rapidly, till it attains its 
        maximum (of about +30 to 40&deg; F.) a few hours <i>before</i> noon. This, 
        Mr. Very thinks, is due to the fact that the half of the moon's face first 
        illuminated for us has, on the average, a darker surface than that of 
        the afternoon, or second quarter, during which the curve descends not 
        quite so rapidly, the temperature near sunset being only a little higher 
        than that near sunrise. This rapid fall while exposed to oblique sunshine 
        is quite in harmony with the rapid loss of heat during the few hours of 
        darkness during an eclipse, both showing the prepotency of radiation over 
        insolation on the moon.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other diagrams show the distribution of 
        heat at the time of full-moon, one half of the curve</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S730c.jpg" width="80%" height="auto" /></p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 65]]</font> showing the temperatures along 
        the equator from the edge of the disc to the centre, the other along a 
        meridian from this centre to the pole. This diagram (here reproduced) 
        exhibits the quick rise of temperature of the oblique rim of the moon 
        and the nearly uniform heat of the central half of its surface; the diminution 
        of heat towards the pole, however, is slower for the first half and more 
        rapid for the latter portion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting fact that the temperature 
        near the margin of the full-moon increases towards the centre more rapidly 
        than it does when the same parts are observed during the early phases 
        of the first quarter. Mr. Very explains this difference as being due to 
        the fact that the full-moon to its very edges is fully illuminated, all 
        the shadows of the ridges and mountains being thrown vertically or obliquely 
        <i>behind them</i>. We thus measure the heat reflected from the <i>whole</i> 
        visible surface. But at new moon, and somewhat beyond the first quarter, 
        the deep shadows thrown by the smallest cones and ridges, as well as by 
        the loftiest mountains, cover a considerable portion of the visible surface, 
        thus largely reducing the quantity of light and heat reflected or radiated 
        in our direction. It is only at the full, therefore, that the maximum 
        temperature of the whole lunar surface can be measured. It must be considered 
        a proof of the delicacy of the heat-measuring instruments that this difference 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 66]]</font> in the curves of temperature of 
        the different parts of the moon's surface and under different conditions 
        is so clearly shown.</p>
      <p><i>The Application of the Preceding Results to the Case of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This somewhat lengthy account of the actual 
        state of the moon's surface and temperature is of very great importance 
        in our present enquiry, because it shows us the extraordinary difference 
        in mean and extreme temperatures of two bodies situated at the same distance 
        from the sun, and therefore receiving exactly the same amount of solar 
        heat per unit of surface. We have learned also what are the main causes 
        of this almost incredible difference, namely: (1) a remarkably rugged 
        surface with porous and probably cavernous rock-texture, leading to extremely 
        rapid radiation of heat in the one; as compared with a comparatively even 
        and well-compacted surface largely clad with vegetation, leading to comparatively 
        slow and gradual loss by radiation in the other: and (2), these results 
        being greatly intensified by the total absence of a protecting atmosphere 
        in the former, while a dense and cloudy atmosphere with an ever-present 
        supply of water-vapour, accumulates and equalises the heat received by 
        the latter.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other essential difference in the two 
        bodies which may possibly aid in the production <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        67]]</font> of this marvellous result, is the fact of our day and night 
        having a mean length of 12 hours, while those of the moon are about 14 
        &#189; of our days. But the altogether unexpected fact, in which two independent 
        enquirers agree, that during the few hours'duration of a total eclipse 
        of the moon so large a proportion of the heat is lost by radiation renders 
        it almost certain that the resulting low temperature would be not very 
        much less if the moon had a day and night the same length as our own.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great lesson we learn by this extreme contrast 
        of conditions supplied to us by nature, as if to enable us to solve some 
        of her problems, is, the overwhelming importance, first, of a dense and 
        well-compacted surface, due to water-action and strong gravitative force; 
        secondly, of a more or less general coat of vegetation; and, thirdly, 
        of a dense vapour-laden atmosphere. These three favourable conditions 
        result in a mean temperature of about +60&deg; F. with a range seldom exceeding 
        40&deg; above or below it, while over more than half the land-surface of the 
        earth the temperature rarely falls below the freezing point. On the other 
        hand, we have a globe of the same materials and at the same distance from 
        the sun, with a maximum temperature of freezing water, and a minimum not 
        very far from the absolute zero, the monthly mean being probably much 
        below the freezing point of carbonic <font color="#990000">[[p. 68]]</font> 
        acid gas--a difference entirely due to the absence of these three favourable 
        conditions.</p>
      <p><i>The Special Features of Mars as influencing Temperature.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the special feature of Mars and 
        its probable temperature, we find that most writers have arrived at a 
        very different conclusion from that of Mr. Lowell, who himself quotes 
        Mr. Moulton as an authority who 'recently, by the application of Stefan's 
        law,' has found the mean temperature of this planet to be -35&deg; F. 
        Again, Professor J. H. Poynting, in his lecture on 'Radiation in the Solar 
        System,' delivered before the British Association at Cambridge in 1904, 
        gave an estimate of the mean temperature of the planets, arrived at from 
        measurements of the sun's emissive power and the application of Stefan's 
        law to the distances of the several planets, and he thus finds the earth 
        to have a mean temperature of 17&deg; C. (= 62 1/2&deg; F.) and Mars one 
        of -38&deg; C. (= -36 1/2&deg; F.), a wonderfully close approximation 
        to the mean temperature of the earth as determined by direct measurement, 
        and therefore, presumably, an equally near approximation to that of Mars 
        as dependent on distance from the sun, and '<i>on the supposition that 
        it is earth-like in all its conditions</i>.'</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we know that it is far from being earth-like 
        in the very conditions which we have found to be those which determine 
        the extremely different <font color="#990000">[[p. 69]]</font> temperatures 
        of the earth, and moon; and, as regards each of these, we shall find that, 
        so far as it differs from the earth, it approximates to the less favourable 
        conditions that prevail in the moon. The first of these conditions which 
        we have found to be essential in regulating the absorption and radiation 
        of heat, and thus raising the mean temperature of a planet, is a compact 
        surface well covered with vegetation, two conditions arising from, and 
        absolutely dependent on, an ample amount of water. But Mr. Lowell himself 
        assures us, as a fact of which he has no doubt, that there are no permanent 
        bodies of water, great or small, upon Mars; that rain, and consequently 
        rivers, are totally wanting; that its sky is almost constantly clear, 
        and that what appear to be clouds are not formed of water-vapour but of 
        dust. He dwells, emphatically, on the terrible desert conditions of the 
        greater part of the surface of the planet.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case now, we have no right to 
        assume that it has ever been otherwise; and, taking full account of the 
        fact, neither denied nor disputed by Mr. Lowell, that the force of gravity 
        on Mars is not sufficient to retain water-vapour in its atmosphere, we 
        must conclude that the surface of that planet, like that of the moon, 
        has been moulded by some form of volcanic action modified probably by 
        wind, but not by water. Adding to this, that the force of gravity on Mars 
        is nearer that of the <font color="#990000">[[p. 70]]</font> moon than 
        to that of the earth, and we may reasonably conclude that its surface 
        is formed of volcanic matter in a light and porous condition, and therefore 
        highly favourable for the rapid loss of surface heat by radiation. The 
        surface-conditions of Mars are therefore, presumably, much more like those 
        of the moon than like those of the earth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next condition favourable to the storing 
        up of heat--a covering of vegetation--is almost certainly absent from 
        Mars except, possibly, over limited areas and for short periods. In this 
        feature also the surface of Mars approximates much nearer to lunar than 
        to earth-conditions. The third condition--a dense, vapour-laden atmosphere--is 
        also wanting in Mars. For although it possesses an atmosphere it is estimated 
        by Mr. Lowell (in his latest article) to have a pressure equivalent to 
        only 2 &#189; inches of mercury with us, giving it a density of only one-twelfth 
        part that of ours; while aqueous vapour, the chief accumulator of heat, 
        cannot permanently exist in it, and, notwithstanding repeated spectroscopic 
        observations for the purpose of detecting it, has never been proved to 
        exist.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that I have now shown from the statements--and 
        largely as the result of the long-continued observations--of Mr. Lowell 
        himself, that, so far as the physical conditions of Mars are <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        71]]</font> known to differ from those of the earth, the differences are 
        all <i>unfavourable</i> to the conservation and <i>favourable</i> to the 
        dissipation of the scanty heat it receives from the sun--that they point 
        unmistakeably towards the temperature-conditions of the moon rather than 
        to those of the earth, and that the cumulative effect of these adverse 
        conditions, acting upon a heat-supply, reduced by solar distance to less 
        than one-half of ours, <i>must</i> result in a mean temperature (as well 
        as in the extremes) nearer to that of our satellite than to that of our 
        own earth.</p>
      <p><i>Further Criticism of Mr. Lowell's Article.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in a position to test some further 
        conclusions of Mr. Lowell's <i>Phil. Mag</i>. article by comparison with 
        actual phenomena. We have seen, in the outline I have given of this article, 
        that he endeavours to show how the small amount of solar heat received 
        by Mars is counterbalanced, largely by the greater transparency to light 
        and heat of its thin and cloudless atmosphere, and partially also by a 
        greater conservative or 'blanketing' power of its atmosphere due to the 
        presence in it of a large proportion of carbonic acid gas and aqueous 
        vapour. The first of these statements may be admitted as a fact which 
        he is entitled to dwell upon, but the second--the presence of large quantities 
        of carbon-dioxide and aqueous vapour--<font color="#990000">[[p. 72]]</font> 
        is a pure hypothesis unsupported by any item of scientific evidence, while 
        in the case of aqueous vapour it is directly opposed to admitted results 
        founded upon the molecular theory of gaseous elasticity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, although Mr. Lowell refers to the conservative 
        or 'blanketing' effect of the earth's atmosphere, he does not consider 
        or allow for its very great cumulative effect, as is strikingly shown 
        by the comparison with the actual temperature conditions of the moon. 
        This cumulative effect is due to the <i>continuous</i> reflection and 
        radiation of heat from the clouds as well as from the vapour-laden strata 
        of air in our lower atmosphere, which latter, though very transparent 
        to the luminous and accompanying heat rays of the sun, are opaque to the 
        dark heat-rays whether radiated or reflected from the earth's surface. 
        We are therefore in a position strictly comparable with that of the interior 
        of some huge glass house, which not only becomes intensely heated by the 
        direct rays of the sun, but also to a less degree by reflected rays from 
        the sky and those radiated from the clouds, so that even on a cloudy or 
        misty day its temperature rises many degrees above that of the outer air. 
        Such a building, if of large size, of suitable form, and well protected 
        at night by blinds or other covering, might be so arranged as to accumulate 
        heat in its soil and walls so as to maintain a tolerably uniform temperature 
        though exposed to a <font color="#990000">[[p. 73]]</font> considerable 
        range of external heat and cold. It is to such a power of accumulation 
        of heat in our soil and lower atmosphere that we must impute the overwhelming 
        contrast between our climate and that of the moon. With us, the solar 
        heat that penetrates our vapour-laden and cloudy atmosphere is shut in 
        by that same atmosphere, accumulates there for weeks and months together, 
        and can only slowly escape. It is this great cumulative power which Mr. 
        Lowell has not taken account of, while he certainly has not estimated 
        the enormous loss of heat by free radiation, which entirely neutralises 
        the effects of increase of sun-heat, however great, when these cumulative 
        agencies are not present.<sup><a href="#63">3</a></sup></p>
      <p><i>Temperature on Polar Regions of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a further consideration which 
        I think Mr. Lowell has altogether omitted to discuss. Whatever may be 
        the <i>mean</i> temperature of Mars, we must take account of the long 
        nights in its polar and high-temperate latitudes, lasting nearly twice 
        as long as ours, with the resulting lowering of temperature by radiation 
        into a constantly clear sky. Even <font color="#990000">[[p. 74]]</font> 
        in Siberia, in Lat. 67 1/2&deg; N. a cold of -88&deg; F. has been attained; 
        while over a large portion of N. Asia and America above 60&deg; Lat. the 
        <i>mean</i> January temperature is from -30&deg; F. to -60&deg; F., and 
        the whole subsoil is permanently frozen from a depth of 6 or 7 feet to 
        several hundreds. But the winter temperatures, <i>over the same latitudes</i> 
        in Mars, must be very much lower; and it must require a proportionally 
        larger amount of its feeble sun-heat to raise the surface even to the 
        freezing-point, and an additional very large amount to melt any considerable 
        depth of snow.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this identical area, from a little below 
        60&deg; to the pole, is that occupied by the snow-caps of Mars, and over 
        the whole of it the winter temperature must be far lower than the earth-minimum 
        of -88&deg; F. Then, as the Martian summer comes on, there is less than 
        half the sun-heat available to raise this low temperature after a winter 
        nearly double the length of ours. And when the summer does come with its 
        scanty sun-heat, that heat is not accumulated as it is by our dense and 
        moisture-laden atmosphere, the marvellous effects of which we have already 
        shown. Yet with all these adverse conditions, each assisting the other 
        to produce a climate approximating to that which the earth would have 
        if it had no atmosphere (but retaining our superiority over Mars in receiving 
        double the amount of sun-heat), we are asked to accept a mean temperature 
        for the more distant planet almost exactly the same as that of mild and 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 75]]</font> equable southern England, and a 
        disappearance of the vast snowfields of its polar regions as rapid and 
        complete as what occurs with us! If the moon, even at its equator, has 
        not its temperature raised above the freezing-point of water, how can 
        the more <i>distant</i> Mars, with its <i>oblique</i> noon-day sun falling 
        upon the snow-caps, receive heat enough, first to raise their temperature 
        to 32&deg; F., and then to melt with marked rapidity the vast frozen plains 
        of its polar regions?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lowell is however so regardless of the ordinary 
        teachings of meteorological science that he actually accounts for the 
        supposed mild climate of the polar regions of Mars by the absence of water 
        on its surface and in its atmosphere. He concludes his fifth chapter with 
        the following words: &quot;Could our earth but get rid of its oceans, we too 
        might have temperate regions stretching to the poles.&quot; Here he runs counter 
        to two of the best-established laws of terrestrial climatology--the wonderful 
        equalising effects of warm ocean-currents which are the chief agents in 
        diminishing polar cold; the equally striking effects of warm moist winds 
        derived from these oceans, and the great storehouse of heat we possess 
        in our vapour-laden atmosphere, its vapour being primarily derived from 
        these same oceans! But, in Mr. Lowell's opinion, all our meteorologists 
        are quite mistaken. Our oceans are our great drawbacks. Only get rid of 
        them and we should enjoy the exquisite climate of Mars--with its absence 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 76]]</font> of clouds and fog, of rain or rivers, 
        and its delightful expanses of perennial deserts, varied towards the poles 
        by a scanty snow-fall in winter, the melting of which might, with great 
        care, supply us with the necessary moisture to grow wheat and cabbages 
        for about one-tenth, or more likely one-hundredth, of our present population.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I may be excused for not treating such 
        an argument seriously.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various considerations now advanced, especially 
        those which show the enormous cumulative and conservative effect of our 
        dense and water-laden atmosphere, and the disastrous effect--judging by 
        the actual condition of the moon--which the loss of it would have upon 
        our temperature, seem to me quite sufficient to demonstrate important 
        errors in the data or fallacies in the complex mathematical argument by 
        which Mr. Lowell has attempted to uphold his views as to the temperature 
        and consequent climatic conditions of Mars.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding this portion of my discussion 
        of the problem of Mars, I wish to call attention to the fact that my argument, 
        founded upon a comparison of the physical conditions of the earth and 
        moon with those of Mars, is dependent upon a small number of generally 
        admitted scientific facts; while the conclusions drawn from those facts 
        are simple and direct, requiring no mathematical <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        77]]</font> knowledge to follow them, or to appreciate their weight and 
        cogency. I claim for them, therefore, that they are in no degree speculative, 
        but in their data and methods exclusively scientific.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next chapter I will put forward a suggestion 
        as to how the very curious markings upon the surface of Mars may possibly 
        be interpreted, so as to be in harmony with the planet's actual physical 
        condition and its not improbable origin and past history.</p>

        A Suggestion as to the 'Canals' of Mars.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special characteristics of the numerous 
        lines which intersect the whole of the equatorial and temperate regions 
        of Mars are, their straightness combined with their enormous length. It 
        is this which has led Mr. Lowell to term them 'non-natural features.' 
        Schiaparelli, in his earlier drawings, showed them curved and of comparatively 
        great width. Later, he found them to be straight fine lines when seen 
        under the best conditions, just as Mr. Lowell has always seen them in 
        the pure atmosphere of his observatory. Both of these observers were at 
        first doubtful of their reality, but persistent observation continued 
        at many successive oppositions compelled acceptance of them as actual 
        features of the planet's disc. So many other observers have now seen them 
        that the objection of unreality seems no longer valid.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lowell urges, however, that their perfect 
        straightness, their extreme tenuity, their uniformity throughout their 
        whole length, the dual character <font color="#990000">[[p. 79]]</font> 
        of many of them, their relation to the 'oases' and the form and position 
        of these round black spots, are all proofs of artificiality and are suggestive 
        of design. And considering that some of them are actually as long as from 
        Boston to San Francisco, and relatively to their globe as long as from 
        London to Bombay, his objection that &quot;no natural phenomena within our 
        knowledge show such regularity on such a scale&quot; seems, at first, a mighty 
        one.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly true that we can point to nothing 
        exactly like them either on the earth or on the moon, and these are the 
        only two planetary bodies we are in a position to compare with Mars. Yet 
        even these do, I think, afford us some hints towards an interpretation 
        of the mysterious lines. But as our knowledge of the internal structure 
        and past history even of our earth is still imperfect, that of the moon 
        only conjectural, and that of Mars a perfect blank, it is not perhaps 
        surprising that the surface-features of the latter do not correspond with 
        those of either of the others.</p>
      <p><i>Mr. Pickering's Suggestion.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best clue to a natural interpretation of 
        the strange features of the surface of Mars is that suggested by the American 
        astronomer Mr. W. H. Pickering in <i>Popular Astronomy</i> (1904). Briefly 
        it is, that both the 'canals' of Mars and the rifts <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        80]]</font> as well as the luminous streaks on the moon are cracks in 
        the volcanic crust, caused by internal stresses due to the action of the 
        heated interior. These cracks he considers to be symmetrically arranged 
        with regard to small 'craterlets' (Mr. Lowell's 'oases') because they 
        have originated from them, just as the white streaks on the moon radiate 
        from the larger craters as centres. He further supposes that water and 
        carbon-dioxide issue from the interior into these fissures, and, in conjunction 
        with sunlight, promote the growth of vegetation. Owing to the very rare 
        atmosphere, the vapours, he thinks, would not ascend but would roll down 
        the outsides of the craterlets and along the borders of the canals, thus 
        irrigating the immediate vicinity and serving to promote the growth of 
        some form of vegetation which renders the canals and oases visible.<sup><a href="#71">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opinion is especially important because, 
        next to Mr. Lowell, Mr. Pickering is perhaps the astronomer who has given 
        most attention to Mars during the last fifteen years. He was for some 
        time at Flagstaff with Mr. Lowell, and it was he who discovered the oases 
        or craterlets, and who originated the idea that we did not see the 'canals' 
        themselves but only the vegetable growth on their borders. He also observed 
        Mars in the Southern Hemisphere at Arequipa; and he has since made <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        81]]</font> an elaborate study of the moon by means of a specially constructed 
        telescope of 135 feet focal length, which produced a direct image on photographic 
        plates nearly 16 inches in diameter.<sup><a href="#72">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear therefore that Mr. Lowell's views 
        as to the artificial nature of the 'canals' of Mars are not accepted by 
        an astronomer of equal knowledge and still wider experience. Yet Professor 
        Pickering's alternative view is more a suggestion than an explanation, 
        because there is no attempt to account for the enormous length and perfect 
        straightness of the lines on Mars, so different from anything that is 
        found either on our earth or on the moon. There must evidently be some 
        great peculiarity of structure or of conditions on Mars to account for 
        these features, and I shall now attempt to point out what this peculiarity 
        is and how it may have arisen.</p>
      <p><i>The Meteoritic Hypothesis.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last quarter of a century a considerable 
        change has come over the opinions of astronomers as regards the probable 
        origin of the Solar System. The large amount of knowledge of the stellar 
        universe, and especially of nebul&aelig;, of comets and of meteor-streams 
        which we now possess, together with many other phenomena, such as the 
        constitution of Saturn's rings, the great number and extent of <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        82]]</font> the minor planets, and generally of the vast amount of matter 
        in the form of meteor-rings and meteoric dust in and around our system, 
        have all pointed to a different origin for the planets and their satellites 
        than that formulated by Laplace as the Nebular hypothesis.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now seen more clearly than at any earlier 
        period, that most of the planets possess special characteristics which 
        distinguish them from one another, and that such an origin as Laplace 
        suggested--the slow cooling and contraction of one vast sun-mist or nebula, 
        besides presenting inherent difficulties--many think them impossibilities--in 
        itself does not afford an adequate explanation of these peculiarities. 
        Hence has arisen what is termed the Meteoritic theory, which has been 
        ably advocated for many years by Sir Norman Lockyer, and with some unimportant 
        modifications is now becoming widely accepted. Briefly, this theory is, 
        that the planets have been formed by the slow aggregation of solid particles 
        around centres of greatest condensation; but as many of my readers may 
        be altogether unacquainted with it, I will here give a very clear statement 
        of what it is, from Professor J. W. Gregory's presidential address to 
        the Geological Section of the British Association of the present year. 
        He began by saying that these modern views were of far more practical 
        use to men of science than that of Laplace, and that they <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        83]]</font> give us a history of the world consistent with the actual 
        records of geology. He then continues:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;According to Sir Norman Lockyer's Meteoritic 
        Hypothesis, nebul&aelig;, comets, and many so-called stars consist of 
        swarms of meteorites which, though normally cold and dark, are heated 
        by repeated collisions, and so become luminous. They may even be volatilised 
        into glowing meteoric vapour; but in time this heat is dissipated, and 
        the force of gravity condenses a meteoritic swarm into a single globe. 
        'Some of the swarms are,' says Lockyer, 'truly members of the solar system,' 
        and some of these travel round the sun in nearly circular orbits, like 
        planets. They may be regarded as infinitesimal planets, and so Chamberlain 
        calls them 'planetismals.'</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The planetismal theory is a development of 
        the meteoritic theory, and presents it in an especially attractive guise. 
        It regards meteorites as very sparsely distributed through space, and 
        gravity as powerless to collect them into dense groups. So it assigns 
        the parentage of the solar system to a spiral nebula composed of planetismals, 
        and the planets as formed from knots in the nebula, where many planetismals 
        had been concentrated near the intersections of their orbits. These groups 
        of meteorites, already as dense as a swarm of bees, were then packed closer 
        by the influence of gravity, and the contracting mass was heated by the 
        pressure, even above the normal melting-point of the material, <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        84]]</font> which was kept rigid by the weight of the overlying layers.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, adopting this theory as the last word of 
        science upon the subject of the origin of planets, we see that it affords 
        immense scope for diversity in results depending on the total <i>amount</i> 
        of matter available within the range of attraction of an incipient planetary 
        mass, and the <i>rates</i> at which this matter becomes available. By 
        a special combination of these two quantities (which have almost certainly 
        been different for each planet) I think we may be able to throw some light 
        upon the structure and physical features of Mars.</p>
      <p><i>The Probable Mode of Origin of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This planet, lying between two of much greater 
        mass, has evidently had less material from which to be formed by aggregation; 
        and if we assume--as in the absence of evidence to the contrary we have 
        a right to do--that its beginnings were not much later (or earlier) than 
        those of the earth, then its smaller size shows that it has in all probability 
        aggregated very much more slowly. But the internal heat acquired by a 
        planet while forming in this manner will depend upon the rate at which 
        it aggregates and the velocity with which the 'planetismals' fall into 
        it, and this velocity will increase with its mass and consequent force 
        of gravity. In the early stages of a planet's growth it will probably 
        remain cold, the <font color="#990000">[[p. 85]]</font> small amount of 
        heat produced by each impact being lost by radiation before the next one 
        occurs; and with a small and slowly aggregating planet this condition 
        will prevail till it approaches its full size. Then only will its gravitative 
        force be sufficient to cause incoming matter to fall upon it with so powerful 
        an impact as to produce intense heat. Further, the compressive force of 
        a small planet will be a less effective heat-producing agency than in 
        the case of a larger one.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth we know has acquired a large amount 
        of internal heat, probably sufficient to liquefy its whole interior; but 
        Mars has only one-ninth part the mass of the earth, and it is quite possible, 
        and even probable, that its comparatively small attractive force would 
        never have liquefied or even permanently heated the more central portions 
        of its mass. This being admitted, I suggest the following course of events 
        as quite possible, and not even improbable, in the case of this planet.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the whole of its early growth, and till 
        it acquired nearly its present diameter, its rate of aggregation was so 
        slow that the planetismals falling upon it, though they might have been 
        heated and even partially liquefied by the impact, were never in such 
        quantity as to produce any considerable heating effect on the whole mass, 
        and each local rise of temperature was soon lost by radiation. The planet 
        thus grew as a solid and cold mass, compacted <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        86]]</font> together by the impact of the incoming matter as well as by 
        its slowly increasing gravitative force. But when it had attained to within 
        perhaps 100, perhaps 50 miles, or less, of its present diameter, a great 
        change occurred in the opportunity for further growth. Some large and 
        dense swarm of meteorites, perhaps containing a number of bodies of the 
        size of the asteroids, came within the range of the sun's attraction and 
        were drawn by it into an orbit which crossed that of Mars at such a small 
        angle that the planet was able at each revolution to capture a considerable 
        number of them. The result might then be that, as in the case of the earth, 
        the continuous inpour of the fresh matter first heated, and later on liquefied 
        the greater part of it as well perhaps as a thin layer of the planet's 
        original surface; so that when in due course the whole of the meteor-swarm 
        had been captured, Mars had acquired its present mass, but would consist 
        of an intensely heated, and either liquid or plastic thin outer shell 
        resting upon a cold and solid interior.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size and position of the two recently discovered 
        satellites of Mars, which are believed to be not more than ten miles in 
        diameter, the more remote revolving around its primary very little slower 
        than the planet rotates, while the nearer one, which is considerably less 
        distant from the planet's surface than its own antipodes and revolves 
        around it more than three times during the Martian day, <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        87]]</font> may perhaps be looked upon as the remnants of the great meteor-swarm 
        which completed the Martian development, and which are perhaps themselves 
        destined at some distant period to fall into the planet. Should future 
        astronomers witness the phenomenon the effect produced upon its surface 
        would be full of instruction.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the result of such an origin as that suggested, 
        Mars would possess a structure which, in the essential feature of heat-distribution, 
        would be the very opposite of that which is believed to characterise the 
        earth, yet it might have been produced by a very slight modification of 
        the same process. This peculiar heat-distribution, together with a much 
        smaller mass and gravitative force, would lead to a very different development 
        of the surface and an altogether diverse geological history from ours, 
        which has throughout been profoundly influenced by its heated interior, 
        its vast supply of water, and the continuous physical and chemical reactions 
        between the interior and the crust.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reactions have, in our case, been of substantially 
        the same nature, and very nearly of the same degree of intensity throughout 
        the whole vast eons of geological time, and they have resulted in a wonderfully 
        complex succession of rock-formations--volcanic, plutonic, and sedimentary--more 
        or less intermingled throughout the whole series, here remaining horizontal 
        as when first deposited, there <font color="#990000">[[p. 88]]</font> 
        upheaved or depressed, fractured or crushed, inclined or contorted; denuded 
        by rain and rivers with the assistance of heat and cold, of frost and 
        ice, in an unceasing series of changes, so that however varied the surface 
        may be, with hill and dale, plains and uplands, mountain ranges and deep 
        intervening valleys, these are as nothing to the diversities of interior 
        structure, as exhibited in the sides of every alpine valley or precipitous 
        escarpment, and made known to us by the work of the miner and the well-borer 
        in every part of the world.</p>
      <p><i>Structural Straight Lines on the Earth.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great characteristic of the earth, both 
        on its surface and in its interior, is thus seen to be extreme diversity 
        both of form and structure, and this is further intensified by the varied 
        texture, constitution, hardness, and density of the various rocks and 
        debris of which it is composed. It is therefore not surprising that, with 
        such a complex outer crust, we should nowhere find examples of those geometrical 
        forms and almost world-wide straight lines that give such a remarkable, 
        and as Mr. Lowell maintains, 'non-natural' character to the surface of 
        Mars, but which, as it seems to me, of themselves afford <i>prima facie</i> 
        evidence of a corresponding simplicity and uniformity in its internal 
        structure.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we are not ourselves by any means devoid 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 89]]</font> of 'straight lines' structurally 
        produced, in spite of every obstacle of diversity of form and texture, 
        of softness and hardness, of lamination or crystallisation, which are 
        adverse to such developments. Examples of these are the numerous 'faults' 
        which occur in the harder rocks, and which often extend for great distances 
        in almost perfect straight lines. In our own country we have the Tyneside 
        and Craven faults in the North of England, which are 30 miles long and 
        often 20 yards wide; but even more striking is the great Cleveland Dyke--a 
        wall of volcanic rock dipping slightly towards the south, but sometimes 
        being almost vertical, and stretching across the country, over hill and 
        dale, in an almost perfect straight line from a point on the coast ten 
        miles north of Scarborough, in a west-by-north direction, passing about 
        two miles south of Stockton and terminating about six miles north-by-east 
        of Barnard Castle, a distance of very nearly 60 miles. The great fault 
        between the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland extends across the country 
        from Stonehaven to near Helensburgh, a distance of 120 miles; and there 
        are very many more of less importance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more extensive are some of the great continental 
        dislocations, often forming valleys of considerable width and length. 
        The Upper Rhine flows in one of these great valleys of subsidence for 
        about 180 miles, from Mulhausen to Frankfort, in a generally straight 
        line, though modified by <font color="#990000">[[p. 90]]</font> denudation. 
        Vaster still is the valley of the Jordan through the Sea of Galilee to 
        the Dead Sea, continued by the Wady Arabah to the Gulf of Akaba, believed 
        to form one vast geological depression or fracture extending in a straight 
        line for 400 miles.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of such faults, dykes, or depressions 
        exist in every part of the world, all believed to be due to the gradual 
        shrinking of the heated interior to which the solid crust has to accommodate 
        itself, and they are especially interesting and instructive for our present 
        purpose as showing the tendency of such fractures of solid rock-material 
        to extend to great lengths in straight lines, notwithstanding the extreme 
        irregularity both in the surface contour as well as in the internal structures 
        of the varied deposits and formations through which they pass.</p>
      <p><i>Probable Origin of the Surface-features of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning now to Mars, let us consider the probable 
        course of events from the point at which we left it. The heat produced 
        by impact and condensation would be likely to release gases which had 
        been in combination with some of the solid matter, or perhaps been itself 
        in a solid state due to intense cold, and these, escaping outwards to 
        the surface, would produce on a small scale a certain amount of upheaval 
        and volcanic disturbance; and as an outer crust rapidly formed, a number 
        of vents might remain as craters or craterlets in a moderate state of 
        <font color="#990000">[[p. 91]]</font> activity. Owing to the comparatively 
        small force of gravity, the outer crust would become scoriaceous and more 
        or less permeated by the gases, which would continue to escape through 
        it, and this would facilitate the cooling of the whole of the heated outer 
        crust, and allow it to become rather densely compacted. When the greater 
        portion of the gases had thus escaped to the outer surface and assisted 
        to form a scanty atmosphere, such as now exists, there would be no more 
        internal disturbance and the cooling of the heated outer coating would 
        steadily progress, resulting at last in a slightly heated, and later in 
        a cold layer of moderate thickness and great general uniformity. Owing 
        to the absence of rain and rivers, denudation such as we experience would 
        be unknown, though the superficial scoriaceous crust might be partially 
        broken up by expansion and contraction, and suffer a certain amount of 
        atmospheric erosion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result of this mode of aggregation 
        would be, that the planet would consist of an outer layer of moderate 
        thickness as compared with the central mass, which outer layer would have 
        cooled from a highly heated state to a temperature considerably below 
        the freezing-point, and this would have been all the time<i> contracting 
        upon a previously cold, and therefore non-contracting nucleus</i>. The 
        result would be that very early in the process great superficial tensions 
        would be produced, which could only be <font color="#990000">[[p. 92]]</font> 
        relieved by cracks or fissures, which would initiate at points of weakness--probably 
        at the craterlets already referred to--from which they would radiate in 
        several directions. Each crack thus formed near the surface would, as 
        cooling progressed, develop in length and depth; and owing to the general 
        uniformity of the material, and possibly some amount of crystalline structure 
        due to slow and continuous cooling down to a very low temperature, the 
        cracks would tend to run on in straight lines and to extend vertically 
        downwards, which two circumstances would necessarily result in their forming 
        portions of 'great circles' on the planet's surface--the two great facts 
        which Mr. Lowell appeals to as being especially 'non-natural.'</p>
      <p><i>Symmetry of Basaltic Columns.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have however one quite natural fact on our 
        earth which serves to illustrate one of these two features, the direction 
        of the downward fissure. This is, the comparatively common phenomenon 
        of basaltic columns and 'Giant's Causeways.' The wonderful regularity 
        of these, and especially the not unfrequent upright pillars in serried 
        ranks, as in the palisades of the Hudson river, must have always impressed 
        observers with their appearance of artificiality. Yet they are undoubtedly 
        the result of the very slow cooling and contraction of melted rocks under 
        compression by strata <i>below and above them</i>, so that, <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        93]]</font> when once solidified, the mass was held in position and the 
        tension produced by contraction could only be relieved by numerous very 
        small cracks at short distances from each other in every direction, resulting 
        in five, six, or seven-sided polygons, with sides only a few inches long. 
        This contraction began of course at the coolest surface, generally the 
        upper one; and observation of these columns in various positions has established 
        the rule that their direction lengthways <i>is always at right angles 
        to the cooling surface</i>, and thus, whenever this surface was horizontal, 
        the columns became almost exactly vertical.</p>
      <p><i>How this applies to Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the features of the surface of Mars that 
        Mr. Lowell describes with much confidence is, that it is wonderfully uniform 
        and level, which of course it would be if it had once been in a liquid 
        or plastic state, and not much disturbed since by volcanic or other internal 
        movements. The result would be that cracks formed by contraction of the 
        hardened outer crust would be vertical; and, in a generally uniform material 
        at a very uniform temperature, these cracks would continue almost indefinitely 
        in straight lines. The hardened and contracting surface being free to 
        move laterally on account of there being a more heated and plastic layer 
        below it, the cracks once initiated above would continually widen at the 
        surface as they penetrated deeper and deeper <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        94]]</font> into the slightly heated substratum. Now, as basalt begins 
        to soften at about 1400&deg; F. and the surface of Mars has cooled to 
        at least the freezing-point--perhaps very much below it--the contraction 
        would be so great that if the fissures produced were 500 miles apart they 
        might be three miles wide at the surface, and, if only 100 miles apart, 
        then about two-thirds of a mile wide.<sup><a href="#73">3</a></sup> But 
        as the production of the fissures might have occupied perhaps millions 
        of years, a considerable amount of atmospheric denudation would result, 
        however slowly it acted. Expansion and contraction would wear away the 
        edges and sides of the fissures, fill up many of them with the debris, 
        and widen them at the surfaces to perhaps double their original size.<sup><a href="#74">4</a></sup></p>
      <p><i>Suggested Explanation of the 'Oases.'</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous round dots seen upon the 'canals,' 
        and especially at points from which several canals <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        95]]</font> radiate and where they intersect--termed 'oases' by Mr. Lowell 
        and 'craterlets' by Mr. Pickering--may be explained in two ways. Those 
        from which several canals radiate may be true craters from which the gases 
        imprisoned in the heated surface layers have gradually escaped. They would 
        be situated at points of weakness in the crust, and become centres from 
        which cracks would start during contraction. Those dots which occur at 
        the crossing of two straight canals or cracks may have originated from 
        the fact that at such intersections there would be four sharply-projecting 
        angles, which, being exposed to the influence of alternate heat and cold 
        (during day and night) on the two opposite surfaces, would inevitably 
        in time become fractured and crumbled away, resulting in the formation 
        of a roughly circular chasm which would become partly filled up by the 
        debris. Those formed by cracks radiating from craterlets would also be 
        subject to the same process of rounding off to an even greater extent; 
        and thus would be produced the 'oases' of various sizes up to 50 miles 
        or more in diameter recorded by Mr. Lowell and other observers.</p>
      <p><i>Probable Function of the Great Fissures.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Pickering, as we have seen, supposes that 
        these fissures give out the gases which, overflowing on each side, favour 
        the growth of the supposed <font color="#990000">[[p. 96]]</font> vegetation 
        which renders the course of the canals visible, and this no doubt may 
        have been the case during the remote periods when these cracks gave access 
        to the heated portions of the surface layer. But it seems more probable 
        that Mars has now cooled down to the almost uniform mean temperature it 
        derives from solar heat, and that the fissures--now for the most part 
        broad shallow valleys--serve merely as channels along which the liquids 
        and heavy gases derived from the melting of the polar snows naturally 
        flow, and, owing to their nearly level surfaces, overflow to a certain 
        distance on each side of them.</p>
      <p><i>Suggested Origin of the Blue Patches.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These heavy gases, mainly perhaps, as has been 
        often suggested, carbon-dioxide, would, when in large quantity and of 
        considerable depth, reflect a good deal of light, and, being almost inevitably 
        dust-laden, might produce that blue tinge adjacent to the melting snow-caps 
        which Mr. Lowell has erroneously assumed to be itself a proof of the presence 
        of liquid water. Just as the blue of our sky is undoubtedly due to reflection 
        from the ultra-minute dust particles in our higher atmosphere, similar 
        particles brought down by the 'snow' from the higher Martian atmosphere 
        might produce the blue tinge in the great volumes of heavy gas produced 
        by its evaporation or liquefaction.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#990000">[[p. 97]]</font> It may 
        be noted that Mr. Lowell objects to the carbon-dioxide theory of the formation 
        of the snow-caps, that this gas at low pressures does not liquefy, but 
        passes at once from the solid to the gaseous state, and that only water 
        remains liquid sufficiently long to produce the 'blue colour' which plays 
        so large a part in his argument for the mild climate essential for an 
        inhabited planet. But this argument, as I have already shown, is valueless. 
        For only very deep water can possibly show a blue colour by reflected 
        light, while a dust-laden atmosphere--especially with a layer of very 
        dense gas at the bottom of it, as would be the case with the newly evaporated 
        carbon-dioxide from the diminishing snow-cap--would provide the very conditions 
        likely to produce this blue tinge of colour.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be considered a support to this view 
        that carbonic-acid gas becomes liquid at -140&deg; F. and solid at -162&deg; 
        F., temperatures far higher than we should expect to prevail in the polar 
        and north temperate regions of Mars during a considerable part of the 
        year, but such as might be reached there during the summer solstice when 
        the 'snows' so rapidly disappear, to be re-formed a few months later.</p>
      <p><i>The Double Canals.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious phenomena of the 'double canals' 
        are undoubtedly the most difficult to explain <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        98]]</font> satisfactorily on any theory that has yet been suggested. 
        They vary in distance apart from about 100 to 400 miles. In many cases 
        they appear perfectly parallel, and Mr. Lowell gives us the impression 
        that they are almost always so. But his maps show, in some cases, decided 
        differences of width at the two extremities, indicating considerable want 
        of parallelism. A few of the curved canals are also double.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one drawing in Mr. Lowell's book (p. 
        219) of the mouths, or starting points, of the Euphrates and Phison, two 
        widely separated double canals diverging at an angle of about 40&deg; 
        from the same two oases, so that the two inner canals cross each other. 
        Now this suggests two wide bands of weakness in the planet's crust radiating 
        probably from within the dark tract called the 'Mare Icarium,' and that 
        some widespread volcanic outburst initiated diverging cracks on either 
        side of these bands. Something of this kind may have been the cause of 
        most of the double canals, or they may have been started from two or more 
        craterlets not far apart, the direction being at first decided by some 
        local peculiarity of structure; and where begun continuing in straight 
        lines owing to homogeneity or uniform density of material. This is very 
        vague, but the phenomena are so remarkable, and so very imperfectly known 
        at present, that nothing but suggestion can be attempted.</p>
      <p><font color="#990000">[[p. 99]]</font> <i>Concluding Remarks on the 'Canals.'</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this somewhat detailed exposition of a possible, 
        and, I hope, a probable explanation of the surface-features of Mars, I 
        have endeavoured to be guided by known facts or accepted theories both 
        astronomical and geological. I think I may claim to have shown that there 
        are some analogous features of terrestrial rock-structure to serve as 
        guides towards a natural and intelligible explanation of the strange geometric 
        markings discovered during the last thirty years, and which have raised 
        this planet from comparative obscurity into a position of the very first 
        rank both in astronomical and popular interest.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wide-spread interest is very largely due 
        to Mr. Lowell's devotion to its study, both in seeking out so admirable 
        a position as regards altitude and climate, and in establishing there 
        a first-class observatory; and also in bringing his discoveries before 
        the public in connection with a theory so startling as to compel attention. 
        I venture to think that his merit as one of our first astronomical observers 
        will in no way be diminished by the rejection of his theory, and the substitution 
        of one more in accordance with the actually observed facts.</p>

      <p><i>A Suggested Experiment to Illustrate the 'Canals' of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my explanation of the 'canals' should be 
        substantially correct--that is, if they were produced by the contraction 
        of a heated outward crust upon a cold, and therefore non-contracting interior, 
        the result of such a condition might be shown experimentally.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several baked clay balls might be formed to 
        serve as cores, say of 8 to 10 inches in diameter. These being fixed within 
        moulds of say half an inch to an inch greater diameter, the outer layer 
        would be formed by pouring in some suitable heated liquid material, and 
        releasing it from the mould as soon as consolidation occurs, so that it 
        may cool rapidly from the <i>outside</i>. Some kinds of impure glass, 
        or the brittle metals bismuth or antimony or alloys of these might be 
        used, in order to see what form the resulting fractures would take. It 
        would be well to have several duplicates of each ball, and, as soon as 
        tension through contraction manifests itself, to try the effect of firing 
        very small charges of small shot to ascertain whether such impacts would 
        start radiating fractures. When taken from the moulds, the balls should 
        be suspended in a slight current of air, and kept rotating, to <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        101]]</font> reproduce the planetary condition as nearly as possible.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact size and material of the cores, the 
        thickness of the heated outer crust, the material best suited to show 
        fracture by contraction, and the details of their treatment, might be 
        modified in various ways as suggested by the results first obtained. Such 
        a series of experiments would probably throw further light on the physical 
        conditions which have produced the gigantic system of fissures or channels 
        we see upon the surface of Mars, though it would not, of course, prove 
        that such conditions actually existed there. In such a speculative matter 
        we can only be guided by probabilities, based upon whatever evidence is 
        available.</p>

        Summary and Conclusion.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little volume has necessarily touched upon 
        a great variety of subjects, in order to deal in a tolerably complete 
        manner with the very extraordinary theories by which Mr. Lowell attempts 
        to explain the unique features of the surface of the planet, which, by 
        long-continued study, he has almost made his own. It may therefore be 
        well to sum up the main points of the arguments against his view, introducing 
        a few other facts and considerations which greatly strengthen my argument.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one great feature of Mars which led Mr. 
        Lowell to adopt the view of its being inhabited by a race of highly intelligent 
        beings, and, with ever-increasing discovery to uphold this theory to the 
        present time, is undoubtedly that of the so-called 'canals'--their straightness, 
        their enormous length, their great abundance, and their extension over 
        the planet's whole surface from one polar snow-cap to the other. The very 
        immensity of this system, and its constant growth and extension during 
        fifteen <font color="#990000">[[p. 103]]</font> years of persistent observation, 
        have so completely taken possession of his mind, that, after a very hasty 
        glance at analogous facts and possibilities, he has declared them to be 
        'non-natural'--therefore to be works of art--therefore to necessitate 
        the presence of highly intelligent beings who have designed and constructed 
        them. This idea has coloured or governed all his writings on the subject. 
        The innumerable difficulties which it raises have been either ignored, 
        or brushed aside on the flimsiest evidence. As examples, he never even 
        discusses the totally inadequate water-supply for such world-wide irrigation, 
        or the extreme irrationality of constructing so vast a canal-system the 
        waste from which, by evaporation, when exposed to such desert conditions 
        as he himself describes, would use up ten times the probable supply.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, he urges the 'purpose' displayed in these 
        'canals.' Their being <i>all</i> so straight, <i>all</i> describing great 
        circles of the 'sphere,' all being so evidently arranged (as he thinks) 
        either to carry water to some 'oasis' 2000 miles away, or to reach some 
        arid region far over the equator in the opposite hemisphere! But he never 
        considers the difficulties this implies. Everywhere these canals run for 
        thousands of miles across waterless deserts, forming a system and indicating 
        a purpose, the wonderful perfection of which he is never tired of dwelling 
        upon (but which I myself can nowhere perceive). <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        104]]</font> Yet he never even attempts to explain how the Martians could 
        have lived <i>before</i> this great system was planned and executed, or 
        why they did not <i>first</i> utilise and render fertile the belt of land 
        adjacent to the limits of the polar snows--why the method of irrigation 
        did not, as with all human arts, begin gradually, at home, with terraces 
        and channels to irrigate the land close to the source of the water. How, 
        with such a desert as he describes three-fourths of Mars to be, did the 
        inhabitants ever get to<i> know</i> anything of the equatorial regions 
        and its needs, so as to start right away to supply those needs? All this, 
        to my mind, is quite opposed to the idea of their being works of art, 
        and altogether in favour of their being natural features of a globe as 
        peculiar in origin and internal structure as it is in its surface-features. 
        The explanation I have given, though of course hypothetical, is founded 
        on known cosmical and terrestrial facts, and is, I suggest, far more scientific 
        as well as more satisfactory than Mr. Lowell's wholly unsupported speculation. 
        This view I have explained in some detail in the preceding chapter.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lowell never even refers to the important 
        question of loss by evaporation in these enormous open canals, or considers 
        the undoubted fact that the only intelligent and practical way to convey 
        a limited quantity of water such great distances would be by a system 
        of water-tight and air-tight <font color="#990000">[[p. 105]]</font> tubes 
        laid <i>under the ground</i>. The mere attempt to use open canals for 
        such a purpose shows complete ignorance and stupidity in these alleged 
        very superior beings; while it is certain that, long before half of them 
        were completed their failure to be of any use would have led any rational 
        beings to cease constructing them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also fails to consider the difficulty, that, 
        if these canals are necessary for existence in Mars, how did the inhabitants 
        ever reach a sufficiently large population with surplus food and leisure 
        enabling them to rise from the low condition of savages to one of civilisation, 
        and ultimately to scientific knowledge? Here again is a dilemma which 
        is hard to overcome. Only a <i>dense</i> population with <i>ample</i> 
        means of subsistence could possibly have constructed such gigantic works; 
        but, given these two conditions, no adequate motive existed for the conception 
        and execution of them--even if they were likely to be of any use, which 
        I have shown they could not be.</p>
      <p><i>Further Considerations on the Climate of Mars.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurring now to the question of climate, which 
        is all-important, Mr. Lowell never even discusses the essential point--the 
        temperature that must <i>necessarily</i> result from an atmospheric envelope 
        one-twelfth (or at most one-seventh) the density <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        106]]</font> of our own; in either case corresponding to an altitude far 
        greater than that of our highest mountains.<sup><a href="#81">1</a></sup> 
        Surely this phenomenon, everywhere manifested on the earth even under 
        the equator, of a regular decrease of temperature with altitude, the only 
        cause of which is a less dense atmosphere, should have been fairly grappled 
        with, and some attempt made to show why it should not apply to Mars, except 
        the weak remark that on a level surface it will not have the same effect 
        as on exposed mountain heights. But it <i>does </i>have the same effect, 
        or very nearly so, on our lofty plateaux often hundreds of miles in extent, 
        in proportion to their altitude. Quito, at 9350 ft. above the sea, has 
        a mean temperature of about 57&deg; F., giving a lowering of 23&deg; from 
        that of Manaos at the mouth of the Rio Negro. This is about a degree for 
        each 400 feet, while the general fall for isolated mountains is about 
        one degree in 340 feet according to Humboldt, who notes the above difference 
        between the rate of cooling for altitude of the plains--or more usually 
        sheltered valleys in which the towns are situated--and the exposed mountain 
        sides. It will be seen that this lower rate would bring the temperature 
        of Mars at the equator down to 20&deg; F. below the freezing point of 
        water from this cause alone. <font color="#990000">[[p. 107]]</font> But 
        all enquirers have admitted, that if conditions as to atmosphere were 
        the same as on the earth, its greater distance from the sun would reduce 
        the temperature to -31&deg; F., equal to 63&deg; below the freezing point. 
        It is therefore certain that the combined effect of both causes must bring 
        the temperature of Mars down to at least 70&deg; or 80&deg; below the 
        freezing point.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of this absolute dependence of terrestrial 
        temperatures upon density of the air-envelope is seldom discussed in text-books 
        either of geography or of physics, and there seems to be still some uncertainty 
        about it. Some impute it wholly to the thinner air being unable to absorb 
        and retain so much heat as that which is more dense; but if this were 
        the case the soil at great altitudes not having so much of its heat taken 
        up by the air should be warmer than below, since it undoubtedly <i>receives 
        </i>more heat owing to the greater transparency of the air above it; but 
        it certainly does not become warmer. The more correct view seems to be 
        that the loss of heat by radiation is increased so much through the rarity 
        of the air above it as to <i>more</i> than counterbalance the increased 
        insolation, so that though the surface of the earth at a given altitude 
        may receive 10 per cent. more direct sun-heat it loses by direct radiation, 
        combined with diminished air and cloud-radiation, perhaps 20 or 25 per 
        cent. more, <font color="#990000">[[p. 108]]</font> whence there is a 
        resultant cooling effect of 10 or 15 per cent. This acts by day as well 
        as by night, so that the greater heat received at high altitudes does 
        not warm the soil so much as a less amount of heat with a denser atmosphere. 
        This effect is further intensified by the fact that a less dense cannot 
        absorb and transmit so much heat as a more dense atmosphere.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here then we have an absolute law of nature 
        to be observed operating everywhere on the earth, and the mode of action 
        of which is fairly well understood. This law is, that reduced atmospheric 
        pressure increases radiation, or loss of heat, <i>more rapidly</i> than 
        it increases insolation or gain of heat, so that the result is <i>always</i> 
        a considerable <i>lowering</i> of temperature. What this lowering is can 
        be seen in the universal fact, that even within the tropics perpetual 
        snow covers the higher mountain summits, while on the high plains of the 
        Andes, at 15,000 or 16,000 feet altitude, where there is very little or 
        no snow, travellers are often frozen to death when delayed by storms; 
        yet at this elevation the atmosphere has much more than double the density 
        of that of Mars!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The error in Mr. Lowell's argument is, that 
        he claims for the scanty atmosphere of Mars that it allows more sun-heat 
        to reach the surface; but he omits to take account of the enormously increased 
        loss of heat by direct radiation, as well <font color="#990000">[[p. 109]]</font> 
        as by the diminution of air-radiation, which together necessarily produce 
        a great reduction of temperature.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this great principle of the prepotency 
        of radiation over absorption with a diminishing atmosphere that explains 
        the excessively low temperature of the moon's surface, a fact which also 
        serves to indicate a very low temperature for Mars, as I have shown in 
        Chapter VI. These two independent arguments--from alpine temperatures 
        and from those of the moon--support and enforce each other, and afford 
        a conclusive proof (as against anything advanced by Mr. Lowell) that the 
        temperature of Mars must be far too low to support animal life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third independent argument leading to the 
        same result is Dr. Johnstone Stoney's proof that aqueous vapour cannot 
        exist on Mars; and this fact Mr. Lowell does not attempt to controvert.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put the whole case in the fewest possible 
        words:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) All physicists are agreed that, owing to 
        the distance of Mars from the sun, it would have a mean temperature of 
        about -35&deg; F. (= 456&deg; F. abs.) even if it had an atmosphere as 
        dense as ours.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But the very low temperatures on the earth 
        under the equator, at a height where the barometer stands at about three 
        times as high as on Mars, proves, that from scantiness of atmosphere alone 
        Mars cannot possibly have a temperature as high <font color="#990000">[[p. 
        110]]</font> as the freezing point of water; and this proof is supported 
        by Langley's determination of the low <i>maximum</i> temperature of the 
        full moon.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of these two results must bring 
        down the temperature of Mars to a degree wholly incompatible with the 
        existence of animal life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The quite independent proof that water-vapour 
        cannot exist on Mars, and that therefore, the first essential of organic 
        life--water--is non-existent.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion from these three independent 
        proofs, which enforce each other in the multiple ratio of their respective 
        weights, is therefore irresistible--that animal life, especially in its 
        higher forms, cannot exist on the planet.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars, therefore, is not only uninhabited by 
        intelligent beings such as Mr. Lowell postulates, but is absolutely UNINHABITABLE.</p>

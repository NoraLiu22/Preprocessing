An old Arabic folktale tells how a man standing one night by a river
is bored and starts throwing pebbles in the water. Just as dawn breaks,
he picks up the last pebble and as he throws it: he briefly looks at it.
As it flies through the air, he realises that it was a jewel. 
A bag of jewels had been spilt on the river-bank, 
and through ignorance he had thrown them all away
<FONT SIZE=5><A HREF=larvae.html#helen>*</A></FONT>.
<P>
We have a similar problem with butterflies and modern society.
We are destroying their foodplants and their habitat.
If our grandchildren and future generations 
are to enjoy the wondrous nature of butterflies:
we need to allow Caterpillars to coexist with us in our society.
<P>
Caterpillars are the immature stages of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera).
At a recent count, Australia was home to 5 families of butterflies 
(containing about 400 named species), 
and about 100 families of moths 
(containing <A HREF=../checklist.html>10,783 named species</A>,
with probably as many moth species again yet to be described). 
Many of the Australian moths and butterflies are very beautiful, 
and many of their caterpillars are even prettier 
and more interesting than the their adult forms.
Caterpillars are also very tame and easy to catch, 
and so make delightful 
<A HREF=faqs/care.html>house pets</A>.
<P>
Only 7% Aussie moth species have known caterpillars. The other 93% of Australian caterpillar species are unidentifiable unless you rear them to an adult, The caterpillar death rate in the wild is over 99%, so for any caterpillar found in the wild: please be prepared to take into protective custody for <A HREF=faqs/care.html>rearing</A> to identify it, and help us dispel our communal ignorance.
<P>
Most <A HREF=http://www.earthlife.net/insects/classtax.html>
Australian Lepidoptera taxonomy</A> and identification has been performed on
dead adult moths sent back to the British Museum in London
from Australia by the early explorers.
Meanwhile: most professional entomologists in Australia are employed to
study the control of the few species that are pests.
So for instance: there is no information at all on the 
shapes, colours, and behaviour of the caterpillars of 93% of Australian moth species.
So even amateurs can help discover these things by
collecting, photographing and 
<A HREF=faqs/care.html>rearing in captivity</A>
any caterpillars that they find in Australia.
<P>
<A HREF=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004863832.0001.000/1:4.5?rgn=div2;view=fulltext>
Preserving caterpillars poses difficult problems</A>.
This makes the identification of caterpillars difficult.
So: of the limited number of Australian Lepidoptera that have
known caterpillars: only a small number have been photographed,
and still fewer of such photos are on the web.
In an attempt to improve this situation: we have created these webpages
with all the pictures and links we can find about 
caterpillars that occur in Australia.
The pictures come from ourselves and many colleagues, 
from a wide variety of sources, and are of very varied quality.
We are still adding more pictures,
so watch the counts at the head of this webpage.

<A HREF=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial">The fauna</A> and 
<A HREF="plants/index.html">the flora</A> 
of Australia are very different from those 
in the rest of the world, and this is just as true of the Caterpillars
as it is of the better known Marsupials. With the short history of
European influence in Australia and only a small human population,
only a limited amount of work has been done on naming and
identifying the various species.
<P>
Of course, the Australian Aborigines knew a great deal about
Australian Lepidoptera, and they used
several species as sources of food, for example:

The scientific name for a Caterpillar is <I>Larva</I> (plural
<I>Larvae</I>). This name was taken from the Latin word
<A HREF=https://www.etymonline.com/word/larva>
Larva</A> meaning amongst other things 'Mask',
because Caterpillars could be thought of as masking 
the butterflies and moths which they become.

Caterpillars have several thousand muscles and have no skeleton.
So by extending or contracting appropriate muscles: 
caterpillars can change their apparent length by plus or minus 25%.
The wingspan of the adult imago is approximately equal to 
the maximum length to which the caterpillar grows. 
Depending on the weather, availability of food, 
and genetic variability: caterpillar maximum sizes 
can also vary by plus or minus 25%.
Thus the measurements given in these webpages for various species
of moths and butterflies are also implicitly 
subject to this degree of variability.
<P>
The wingspans given in 19th century descriptions are
sometimes listed in 'lines' or its abbreviation " (double quote).
A line is 1/12th of an inch, approximately equal to 2 mms.
By the term 'wingspan' in these webpages is meant 
the distance between left and right forewing tips
of a specimen with the wings set so that the 
<A HREF="../faqs/glossary.html#hind">hind margins</A> 
of the forewings are at right angles to the axis of the body.
<P>
Note: that we have adopted three unconventional conventions
in an attempt to make these webpages more understandable to non-entomologists:<BR>
1. all scientific names are in italics,<BR>
2. all taxonomical levels above genus (such as family, order, class)
are in capitals, and<BR>
3. all our pictures have the head to the left,
although that has required a left-right reflection of some of the photos.
<P>
We have generally followed the nomenclature and taxonomic divisions 
as used in the erudite text :

We have 
<A HREF=faqs/ambiguous.html>a separate webpage for each species</A>,
and links to these are available from a webpage for each family
as a thumbnail picture and a highlighted name.
The families are also linked from one webpage for
<A HREF="moths.html">the moths</A> and one for
<A HREF="butter.html">the butterflies</A>.
We have included lots of pictures of the adult butterflies and
moths also, even if we had no caterpillar pictures for those species.
In these cases, our thumbnail pictures show only an adult.
For some species we have found no pictures at all, but only some
descriptive text. In these cases, we show only a bullet by the 
name, and the name is highlighted as the link.
Some species have been illustrated on
<A HREF="stamps/stamps-oz.html">
Australian postage stamps</A>,
and some more widespread species of
<A HREF="stamps/stamps-but.html">Australian butterflies</A> and

have appeared on overseas stamps.

Many caterpillars are very fussy eaters</A>, 
and eat only a very restricted range of plants or foodstuffs.
We have tried to include links for the known food sources of the 
various caterpillars.
However, we only list those that we have observed, 
those we have been told about by other observers, 
and those reported in the literature.
In principle, the caterpillars might feed on anything 
when nobody is looking.

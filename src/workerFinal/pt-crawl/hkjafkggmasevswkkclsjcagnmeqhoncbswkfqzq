<font size="8" face="Arial" color="#69B4FA">Interfab PONG IV Kit (1976)</font>

<p align=justify><font face="Arial" size="3"><br>
Interfab, an obscure company, released an interesting video game kit in 1976
called PONG IV. It played two games (Tennis and Handball), used
discrete components (mostly TTL chips) and had digital on-screen scoring,
a very rare feature for that type of system. As a matter of fact, digital on-screen 
scoring required several additional chips to generate the digits, unless a 
character generator chip was used. Interfab opted for the second 
solution.<br><br>
The kit could be purchased in three forms: fully assembled and ready for
use, partially assembled (RF oscillator tuned), or ready to assemble from
scratch. The third version is pictured here. As can be seen on the pictures, the components were already placed on the circuit board, which 
saved the time to place
them. They were maintained on the board by a vaccuum-wrapped plastic film. Both
controllers contained their knobs, potentiometers and push-button (see
picture).<br><br>
The kit pictured here did not come from an unsold dealer stock. It was
acquired from the original owner who purchased it in 1976, but never found
the time to assemble it (he purchased an Odyssey console for his kids).
Thus, the kit staid in a fantastic original condition.</font></p>

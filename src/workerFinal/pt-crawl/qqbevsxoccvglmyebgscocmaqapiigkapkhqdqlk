              <span class="bodytext">I attended the nine day Umha Aois (Irish 
              for Bronze Age and pronounced Oova Ish) Bronze Casting Symposium 
              in Doolin, County Clare, on the west coast of Ireland. It is a real 
              hands-on event and has been held annually for several years.</span><span class="new_red">*</span><span class="bodytext"> 
              The aim of the project is to understand more fully, how Bronze Age 
              metal working was carried out, by attempting to reproduce items 
              for which there is artefactual evidence, using, as far as possible, 
              methods for which there is archaeological evidence. There is also 
              a certain experimental aspect, looking at methods which could have 
              been used and which might not necessarily leave any evidence. <br>

              <p class="bodytext">Most of those attending were either sculptors, 
                metals specialists or archaeologists, although the project started 
                out originally as an artist/sculptor based event but has gradually 
                become more biased towards the archaeology. The focus of this 
                year&#8217;s event was on trying to reproduce some of the magnificent 
                blowing horns dating to the Bronze Age and found in various areas 
                of Ireland. Many examples of horns, either side-blowing or end-blowing, 
                are displayed in the National Museum in Dublin, together with 
                other ritual objects, including crotals, the ovoid, seamless, 
                hollow, bronze objects, known only from the Dowris hoard and thought 
                possibly to be associated with a bull cult.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">It is thought the horns were made using the 
                lost wax process, but the work involved in making such a wax model, 
                together with its sprue assembly was extremely complex. In its 
                simplest form, the sprue assembly comprises a pouring cup and 
                tubes for the molten bronze, together with risers to allow the 
                hot gasses to escape. Many people will perhaps have experience 
                of using the lost wax method of casting, so I won&#8217;t describe 
                the full process here. However, I will say that applying all the 
                runners and risers to a large, hollow, delicate wax object such 
                as a horn requires a lot of skill in assembling it securely, with 
                minimal handling of the whole relatively soft, but heavy wax object. 
                Hollow objects such as socketed items or horns are also more complex 
                because they must have a core, which needs to be held in place 
                by pins or chaplets, as once the wax has been melted out, the 
                core will be loose inside the mould. (Needless to say, as a beginner 
                I did not tackle a horn, but managed to produce a reasonably successful 
                socketed spearhead, a flanged axe and a couple of smaller items).</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The wax models were dipped in two layers of 
                clay slip, before being built up gradually with layers of clay 
                mixed with horse dung and some grog, until a good thick mould 
                was achieved. The wax was then melted out (and collected for re-use) 
                in two stages. Firstly, over a fire, it was melted from the pouring 
                cup, thus giving an escape route for the wax deeper inside, and 
                preventing sideways expansion which might cause the mould to explode. 
                Further heating of the moulds, placed upside down in a furnace, 
                melted out all the remaining wax. The clay moulds were then fired 
                hard in the furnace. The resultant hollow, fired clay and dung 
                moulds were light and crumbly on the outside and withstood the 
                heat shock of being filled with molten bronze, whilst the inner 
                layers of fine clay slip maintained the fine detail of the original 
                wax model.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The smelting and casting was done either in 
                simple pit furnaces inside a wood and canvas yurt or in the open 
                air, in small above-ground, hand-built furnaces which we made 
                from clay and horse dung. Using lumpwood charcoal, in either of 
                these furnace types, it took surprisingly little time, with the 
                aid of the wood and leather bellows, to achieve a pouring temperature 
                of 1050 &#8211; 1070&deg;, which was thought to be suitable for 
                the type of mould being used. During this project, most of the 
                bronze was smelted from 90% copper and 10% tin, although when 
                casting a Medieval style bronze hand bell, 20% tin was used, to 
                achieve a better ring tone and it did indeed give a beautiful 
                sound.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">About six attempts were made to cast a horn, 
                but only one was really successful and there is more work to be 
                done on refining the method. It seems that casting with the mould 
                supported in the ground in an almost upright position and with 
                a single pouring cup, thus giving better pressure to the flow 
                of molten bronze, might be better than placing the mould horizontally 
                and having multiple pouring cups. However, there are so many variables 
                that this cannot be stated with certainty. The successful casting 
                was of a side-blowing horn, which had the typical decoration of 
                small conical spikes around the open end, and a small loop close 
                to the closed end. It is thought that the original horns were 
                probably made specifically for individual persons, as the gap 
                at the narrow end was nearly always about a hand width, allowing 
                for comfortable holding when being blown. The successfully cast 
                horn made a very good sound and was relatively easy to blow, using 
                closed, vibrating lips. The bullocks in the next field were intensely 
                interested whenever the horn was blown!

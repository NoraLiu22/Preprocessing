      <p><b>China's welfare homes for children play a special role in the country's 
        efforts to care for children. The welfare homes and some social welfare 
        institutions that also accept orphans oer guardianship and rearing mainly 
        to children who have lost their parents during natural disasters or accidents, 
        and also to those abandoned by their parents because they are seriously 
        or almost irremediably disabled mentally or physically, or because they 
        have contracted a serious illness. Currently, there are about 20,000 such 
        children under the guardianship and rearing of welfare institutions, accounting 
        for five per one hundred thousand of the total number of juveniles in 
        China. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Rearing Under Guardianship </font></b></p>
      <p><b>In China, such rearing and emplacement of orphans or children abandoned 
        for physical disability are under the charge of civil administration departments. 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>These are the ways that orphans are reared under guardianship in China: 
        social welfare institutions set up by the government or collectives oer 
        guardianship and rearing to some of the orphans till their adult age and 
        give life support to idiotic and seriously disabled orphans under their 
        care; some orphans are brought up in citizens' homes under the guardianship 
        of welfare institutions; some orphans are adopted by domestic citizens 
        and a small number by foreign citizens according to relevant laws. </b></p>
      <p><b>By the end of 1995, there were a total of 73 welfare homes for children 
        set up by local governments, oering guardianship and rearing to 8,900 
        orphans and abandoned ill or disabled children. More than 1,200 social 
        welfare institutions in urban areas and some homes for the aged in rural 
        areas have also oered guardianship and rearing to orphans and abandoned 
        ill or disabled children. Some orphans and abandoned ill or disabled children 
        are under the care of or legally adopted by common people. Moreover, there 
        are a total of nearly ten thousand organizations serving orphans and disabled 
        persons in communities throughout China, such as schools for orphans, 
        rehabilitation centers, training classes for mentally retarded children, 
        rehabilitation stations for disabled children and community rehabilitation 
        stations, as well as about a hundred social welfare institutions established 
        by individuals or organizations. </b></p>
      <p><b>Apart from welfare institutions set up by the government and the society 
        to take care of orphans and abandoned children, China encourages citizens 
        to adopt these children so that they can enjoy a normal family life and 
        grow up sound of body and mind. In order to protect legal adoption and 
        the legal rights of the persons concerned, and to benefit the care and 
        growth of adopted juveniles, the NPC Standing Committee of China stipulated 
        the Adoption Law. According to this law, the Ministry of Justice and the 
        Ministry of Civil Affairs, with the approval of the State Council, published 
        for implementation the Procedures for the Adoption of Children by Foreigners 
        in the People's Republic of China. The adoption of orphans in China has 
        laws to go by and is in full accord with the principles put forward by 
        the United Nations in the Convention on the Rights of Children. </b></p>
      <p><b>All adoption procedures are done strictly according to law. Both Chinese 
        citizens and foreigners shall meet the conditions required by law and 
        go through all necessary procedures. While handling the adoption procedures 
        for the person concerned, the related departments of the Chinese Government 
        charge the fees strictly according to law. As required by law, the adoptor 
        shall pay to the welfare home the cost for upbringing of the adoptee, 
        which will then be used to improve living conditions for other children 
        in the institution. This cost is determined mainly through negotiations 
        between the two parties. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Funds </font></b></p>
      <p><b>Most of the funds for China's welfare homes for children come from 
        appropriations by state and local financial departments (the funds being 
        budgeted as full operating expenses for welfare homes in the financial 
        report of each year), supplemented by other means, such as collective 
        fund raising, welfare lotteries and donations. From 1990 to 1994, local 
        financial departments had appropriated a total of 515 million yuan directly 
        to urban welfare homes for children (of this total, 40 percent being used 
        directly for the livelihood of the children), at an annual increase rate 
        of 25.5 percent, thus guaranteeing the basic needs of the children. During 
        this period, the state appropriated 740 million yuan specially for the 
        improvement of welfare homes for children, including 240 million yuan 
        raised from welfare lotteries published by central and local governments, 
        150 million yuan from local financial departments and 350 million yuan 
        from donations. </b></p>
      <p><b>The funds received by each welfare home around the country are different 
        due to the various levels of economic development in each area. In economically 
        developed areas, the average expense per child per month is 400 to 500 
        yuan while in the less developed areas, the amount is 200 to 300 yuan. 
        Living expense of the children in the welfare homes is usually no lower 
        than that of local citizens, in view of the fact that prices are comparatively 
        low in China. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Administrative System </font></b></p>
      <p><b>China's welfare homes for children have adopted a fairly complete, 
        systematic administrative system. The system requires that the children 
        shall be under a two to three month observation period before they are 
        accepted. During the observation period the related departments search 
        for the child's parents or confirm his or her identification while at 
        the same time the child is given a comprehensive physical examination 
        and isolation is practiced on children suffering from infectious diseases. 
        The system also requires that there shall be a certain number of specialized 
        personnel in each welfare home -- the specialized personnel in first-level 
        state welfare homes shall account for above 70 percent, and in second-level, 
        above 65 percent, of the total welfare home staff. Each welfare home for 
        children has drawn up strict rules and regulations concerning every aspect 
        of internal management and of the children's lives -- upbringing, nursing, 
        medical care, rehabilitation, scientific research, community rehabilitation, 
        training, and supporting service. </b></p>
      <p><b>To supervise the implementation of these administrative procedures, 
        the civil affairs departments have carried out regular inspections. Units 
        that perform well are commended and those units or individuals who seriously 
        violate regulations are penalized. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>The Principle of Combining Upbringing,<br>
        Treatment and Education </font></b></p>
      <p><b>The welfare homes for children in China practice the principle of 
        combining upbringing, treatment and education. </b></p>
      <p><b>Due to the special care given to China's helpless orphans and abandoned 
        ill or disabled children, many of them have grown up and found jobs. With 
        help from the government and people from all circles, the more than 4,200 
        orphans left in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake -- from a few months to 16 
        years old, except for those adopted by their relatives -- were all settled 
        in the Xingtai Welfare Home for Children and at orphans' schools in Tangshan 
        and Shijiazhuang. Most of their living and study expenses were borne by 
        the state. In October 1995, Wang An, the last ``Tangshan earthquake orphan,'' 
        left the welfare home that had oered him guardianship and rearing to work 
        in a hospital. The Jilin Provincial Welfare Home for Children in Changchun 
        has brought up 2,478 orphans since its establishment 38 years ago. </b></p>
      <p><b>When they come to welfare homes, most children are suffering from 
        serious illness or inherent disabilities. Welfare homes have paid much 
        attention to treating these children to the most degree. Ill or disabled 
        children in serious condition are sent to local hospitals for better treatment. 
        In 1995, the number of the children nursed back to health exceeded 200. 
        Welfare homes for children boast doctors, rehabilitators, nutritionists, 
        as well as clinics, rehabilitation rooms, emergency treatment rooms, laboratories 
        and pharmacies, giving timely treatment to ailing children. With help 
        from the government and from people in all walks of life, many welfare 
        homes own fairly advanced medical equipment to meet the basic needs of 
        their children. At present, China has a professional staff who are devoted 
        to the well-being of orphans and disabled children; medical personnel 
        account for 32 percent of the total welfare home staff. </b></p>
      <p><b>Since 1995, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Pub"ilic 
        Health have jointly launched health projects for disabled orphans throughout 
        the country. Under the project, large hospitals give free hospitalization 
        to orphans who need to undergo operations, and charge half of the normal 
        surgical operation and treatment fees. Disabled children in welfare homes 
        take part in various rehabilitation training programs, and some of them 
        have recovered or basically recovered from disability. </b></p>
      <p><b>At welfare homes, children with normal intelligence, no matter if 
        they are physically handicapped or not, receive compulsory education like 
        other children. Blind, deaf and mentally retarded children are sent to 
        special education schools. In addition, the state has set up over 30 schools 
        especially for orphans. These schools educate children according to their 
        physical and mental abilities and characteristics; some schools even combine 
        compulsory education with vocational education to enhance the students' 
        career opportunities. For seriously disabled children, every welfare home 
        has set up a special education class that teaches self-sufficiency. In 
        1989, the government established a separate fund for special education. 
        In 1995, the fund totalled 23 million yuan, of which 1.1 million yuan 
        was appropriated to special education classes at welfare homes. </b></p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Mass Movements to Help Orphans </font></b></p>
      <p><b>The Chinese Government encourages activities to help orphans and has 
        called upon the whole society to show concern for orphans. In recent years, 
        mass movements to help orphans have blossomed. </b></p>
      <p><b>-- A mass campaign encouraging kindness to orphans is now wide"ispread 
        and volunteers are numerous. In Shanghai and Beijing, campaigns such as 
        ``Let kind-hearted people give orphans a big hug,'' ``Offer your affections 
        to orphans and disabled children and bring health to them,'' ``Help orphans 
        in every way'' and ``Link your hearts to orphans' hearts'' are enthusiastically 
        responded to by people from all walks of life. In these campaigns, many 
        urban families take children from children's welfare institutions and 
        let them stay in their homes during holidays or at ordinary times so that 
        these children can enjoy the warmth and affection of a family. </b></p>
      <p><b>-- The China Charity Federation was established to promote charities 
        and extensively collect donations. By the end of 1995, the China Charity 
        Federation had recruited 44 local organizations throughout China as group 
        members and it had collected donations of over 100 million yuan. A considerable 
        amount of the money was used to support orphans in vocational trainings 
        and perform corrective surgical operations on disabled children. </b></p>
      <p><b>-- People from all walks of life show much concern for children's 
        welfare institutions. They donate money and materials to help the institutions 
        improve their conditions. This allows the institutions to improve the 
        quality of their care and education. Welfare funds for orphans have been 
        established in Qingdao, Shandong Province, Cele County in Xinjiang Uygur 
        Autonomous Region and other places. In 1994 and 1995 the Shanghai Municipal 
        Welfare Home for Children received 4.4 million yuan in donations. At present, 
        8,000 orphans throughout China are financially supported in their school 
        education. </b></p>
      <p><b>-- Individuals are becoming ever more enthusiastic about running children's 
        welfare homes and non-governmental welfare homes are on the increase. 
        In Guangzhou the number of beds in social welfare institutions run by 
        individuals now account for 10 percent of all social welfare institution 
        beds. </b></p>
      <p><b>China has made great efforts to support the survival, protection and 
        development of children. The UNICEF, UNESCO, WHO and other international 
        organizations and public figures all made positive comments on China's 
        achievements in this connection. Of course, the Chinese Government is 
        sober about the fact that since China is a developing country with a large 
        population and since its economic foundation is still comparatively weak, 
        its per capita income is in a rather rear position in the world per capita 
        income listings and its development level is unbalanced between city and 
        countryside and between different areas, there is much difficulty in the 
        work for children and therefore much room for improvement. Take medical 
        care for children, for example. The incidence of disease among children 
        in the countryside is high and in some poor areas children's nutrition 
        is below the normal level. As for children's education, the teaching conditions 
        in some outlying and poor areas are not up to par and the phenonmenon 
        of primary and middle school children discontinuing their studies still 
        exists. As for the protection of disabled children, the state is not able 
        to amass in a short period enough money to fully satisfy the actual needs 
        in the protection of these children. Since the level of economic development 
        varies from area to area, some welfare homes are better run than others 
        with economic diculties. Therefore, as China develops economically and 
        socially, an important task facing the Chinese Government is to constantly 
        improve children's conditions and promote activities and programs to help 
        children. The Chinese Government will continue to work persistently toward 
        this end, as it has done in the past, and the cause of children will surely 
        develop further as a result. </b></p>

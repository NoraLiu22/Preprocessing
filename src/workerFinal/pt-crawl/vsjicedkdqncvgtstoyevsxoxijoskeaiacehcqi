      ruled in pyramidal fashion, with the Mwanamutapa

      empire was based on small-scale industries, for example
      iron smelting, textiles, gold and copper, along with

      the east to present-day central Zambia in the west and
      from central Zimbabwe in the south to the Zambezi River in
      the north. The regular inhabitants of the empire's trading
      towns were the Arab and Swahili merchants with whom trade
      was conducted. The empire was an&nbsp; important source of
      gold and ivory, the area attracted Swahili traders from
      the east coast of Africa (in modern Tanzania). When the
      Shirazis founded Sofala (in present-day Mozambique), the
      Karanga empire acquired an export market for its mining
      production. The &lsquo;Monomotapa&rsquo;, the Karanga leader,
      imposed a tributary relation on the neighboring Muslim
      nation as he had done with other minor cultures of the
      area. Thus, Karanga supremacy was established over a
      region including parts of present-day Malawi. The area
      around&nbsp; Great Zimbabwe became the trading capital of
      the wealthiest and most powerful society in south-eastern
      Africa of its era. The hilltop acropolis at Great Zimbabwe

      resident in Mwanamutapa began to redirect the kingdom's
      gold trade away from Portuguese-controlled Sofala and
      toward more northern ports. Thus, Portugal became
      interested in directly controlling the interior. In 1531,
      posts were established inland at Sena and Tete on the

      Swahili traders who lived there, fearing for their
      commercial position, persuaded Nogomo to have Silveira

      impact that affected some of its trade and there had been
      a series of wars which left the empire so weakened that it
      entered the 17th century in serious decline. By the

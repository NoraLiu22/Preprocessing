1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

  <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="990000">[[p. 300]]</font> The Journal 
        of the Linnean Society recently issued (No. 115, <i>Zoology</i>, July 
        23rd, 1886) is occupied by a very elaborate and lengthy paper by Dr. G. 
        J. Romanes, F.R.S., entitled <i>Physiological Selection: an Additional 
        Suggestion on the Origin of Species</i>, in which he seeks to show that 
        natural selection is not, strictly speaking, a theory of the origin of 
        species at all, because it does not account for what he maintains is the 
        primary and characteristic feature of <i>species</i>, namely, their invariable 
        infertility, more or less pronounced, when crossed with allied species. 
        Dr. Romanes is well known as an authority on some branches of animal physiology 
        and psychology, and is also an earnest student as well as a great admirer 
        of Mr. Darwin's works; while, as he informs us, he had for many years 
        &quot;the privilege of discussing the whole philosophy of evolution with Mr. 
        Darwin himself.&quot; His conclusions on this subject are therefore likely 
        to be widely adopted, more especially as the question is a very difficult 
        one, and the value of the arguments adduced can hardly be estimated by 
        persons who are not well acquainted with the copious literature of the 
        subject. There can be no doubt, however, that the theory of natural selection, 
        as Darwin left it, does present the weak points which are here attacked, 
        and it is therefore a question of great interest to ascertain whether 
        Dr. Romanes has really furnished us with a substantial addition to the 
        theory, and has successfully grappled with the admitted difficulties presented 
        by the phenomena of the sterility of crosses between distinct species. 
        After a careful study of his paper I have come to the conclusion that, 
        although it contains many valuable suggestions, it does not solve the 
        problem which he presents for solution. It also contains many statements 
        and assumptions which appear to be erroneous, and in correcting these 
        some facts will be adduced which must be taken account of in any attempt 
        to deal with this very difficult question. I propose, therefore, to give 
        a brief summary of Mr. Romanes' arguments, and to point out several important 
        facts and weighty considerations which he has omitted to take account 
        of, and which seem to me to render his theory altogether unworkable. I 
        shall conclude by submitting an alternative hypothesis which seems to 
        me to meet the chief difficulties of the case in a very simple manner.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Romanes urges that there are three cardinal 
        difficulties in the way of natural selection, considered as a theory of 
        the origin of species. These are (1) the fact that all our domestic animals 
        and <font color="990000">[[p. 301]]</font> cultivated plants are mutually 
        fertile when crossed, although they often differ in external characters 
        much more than do distinct species; yet natural species, though sometimes 
        differing very little from each other, are nearly always more or less 
        sterile when intercrossed; (2) the swamping effects of free intercrossing 
        upon any individual variation, preventing its ever becoming increased 
        and intensified by natural selection so as to constitute a distinct species; 
        and (3) the inutility of a large proportion of specific distinctions, 
        which consist of small and trivial differences of form and colour, or 
        of meaningless details of structure, which, being of no service to the 
        plants or animals presenting them, cannot have arisen through the agency 
        of natural selection. Mr. Romanes quotes many passages from Darwin's writings 
        admitting the force of these objections, and he shows, more or less successfully, 
        that the explanations Darwin offered are in no case sufficient.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Romanes proceeds to argue that, admitting 
        these objections, natural selection is not, properly speaking, a theory 
        of the origin of <i>species</i>, but that it is a theory of the origin--or 
        rather of the cumulative development--of <i>adaptations</i>. These, 
        he submits, are very different things, because each useful adaptation 
        usually characterises a whole group of species, often a whole genus or 
        a whole family, while the individual species are distinguished from each 
        other, not by adaptive, but usually by trivial, superficial, and altogether 
        useless characters. To account for these facts Darwin and his followers 
        have called in the aid of certain additional causes, such as use and disuse, 
        sexual selection, correlated variability, and, most important of all, 
        the prevention of intercrossing with parent forms. This last cause is 
        brought into action by the isolation of varieties in distinct areas, and 
        its effects are well seen in the distinct but closely allied species that 
        so often characterise oceanic islands. This is thought to prove that, 
        whenever intercrossing is prevented, independent variability is a sufficient 
        cause for the evolution of new species, which will always tend to arise 
        under such conditions, and will be usually distinguished by characters 
        which are not useful to them, and have therefore not been preserved by 
        the agency of natural selection.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it is argued, such species can never arise 
        without isolation, because intercrossing will continually extinguish all 
        such independent variations of an unuseful kind, and even all such as 
        are useful, unless they occur in considerable numbers together. Except 
        in the case of complete isolation in islands or by great geographical 
        changes in continents, species must have originated in the midst of a 
        parent form, and unless the mutual sterility we find to be a general characteristic 
        of species had appeared at the very beginning to prevent the extinction 
        of all incipient variations by intercrossing, it does not seem possible 
        for these variations ever to have been <font color="990000">[[p. 302]]</font> 
        preserved and accumulated so as to form distinct new species. Mr. Darwin's 
        suggested explanation of the whole difficulty is, that a number of similar 
        favourable variations occurring together will afford materials for natural 
        selection to act upon, and will then rapidly increase; while, as to the 
        cause of infertility between the new form and the parent stock, he suggests 
        that varieties occurring under nature will have been exposed during long 
        periods of time to more uniform conditions than have domesticated varieties, 
        and this may well make a wide difference in the result. This view is supported 
        by the opinion of many independent observers, that domestication tends 
        to enhance fertility; while it is a well known fact that in wild species 
        the reproductive system is so delicately balanced that they often become 
        sterile, even with their own kind, when in confinement.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Romanes, however, objects that this suggestion 
        is too vague and too little supported by known facts to explain such a 
        fundamental and almost universal difference as exists between varieties 
        and species in regard to their mutual fertility, and he therefore puts 
        forth his theory of physiological selection. Briefly stated, this theory 
        is, that individual variations in the degree of fertility with the parent 
        form often occur quite independently of any change in external characters. 
        This mode of variation may be either indirect or direct. In the former 
        kind the season of flowering or of pairing may be advanced or retarded, 
        and in either case the individuals so varying can only cross with each 
        other, not with the parent form. In the latter kind the new variety is 
        such that when crossed with the parent form it produces very few offspring, 
        and those offspring are usually sterile; while among themselves these 
        physiological varieties are perfectly fertile as are their offspring. 
        &quot;Once formed as such,&quot; he says, &quot;the new natural variety, even though 
        living upon the same area as its parent species, will begin an independent 
        course of history, and, as in the now analogous case of isolated varieties, 
        will tend to increase its morphological distance from the parent form, 
        until it eventually becomes a true species.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Romanes then goes on to argue that, as a 
        rule, these physiological variations are those which occur first, and 
        form the starting-point of new species. He admits that in some cases sterility 
        may be a secondary character, due perhaps to the constitutional change 
        indicated by the external variation; but even in that case physiological 
        selection plays an equally important part, because, if it does not arise, 
        either coincidentally with the ordinary external variation or as a consequence 
        of it, then that variation will not be preserved, but will rapidly be 
        extinguished by intercrossing with the parent type.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now set forth very briefly, but I believe 
        quite sufficiently and often in its author's own words, what the theory 
        of physiological <font color="990000">[[p. 303]]</font> selection is, 
        let us turn back and see how far the facts of variation on which it is 
        founded are adequately and correctly stated; and also endeavour to ascertain 
        with some precision what would happen to the physiological varieties arising 
        independently in the midst of a species, as Mr. Romanes supposes them 
        to do, and whether they could possibly form the usual starting-point of 
        new species. In discussing the &quot;three great obstructions in the road of 
        natural selection,&quot; which Mr. Romanes believes to be insuperable by natural 
        selection alone, it will be convenient to take them in the inverse order, 
        leaving the important question of sterility between species to be dealt 
        with after the road has been cleared of the two less important obstructions.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.) <i>Inutility of Specific Characters</i>.--This 
        forms an essential part of Mr. Romanes' argument as to the necessity for 
        physiological selection to account for the origin of species, but it is 
        only proved to exist by general statements quite unsupported by evidence. 
        He tells us, for example, that an &quot;enormous number&quot; of specific peculiarities 
        are of no use, giving as instances the callosities on the hind legs of 
        horses, or the habit of covering their excrement by some of the cat tribe. 
        In the latter case, however, it is surely not difficult to see a very 
        probable use, for as the excrements in question are exceptionally offensive, 
        their exposure on the surface of the ground might warn such creatures 
        as are preyed upon by them from approaching the haunts of these animals. 
        But this argument from our ignorance is a very bad one when we consider 
        how recently whole groups of specific differences, formerly looked upon 
        as useless, have been brought under the law of utility. The innumerable 
        fantastic diversities in the size, form, colour, and markings of flowers 
        would have been formerly thus classed; but these have now in so great 
        a number of cases been shown to be purposive modifications for aiding 
        in fertilisation, that few naturalists will doubt that all or almost all 
        similar distinctive characters have had a similar origin. So the various 
        kinds of spines and prickles, of hairs or down, of stinging organs or 
        of sticky exudations, once unintelligible, have now been proved serviceable 
        in keeping away &quot;unbidden guests&quot; from the flowers.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life histories of animals in a state of 
        nature have been so much less studied than those of plants that we are 
        quite unable to determine the use of many of the slighter specific characters 
        which distinguish them. But here, too, progress is being made, and many 
        peculiarities can now be shown to be useful which a few years ago would 
        have been classed as of no possible utility to the species. This especially 
        applies to the colours and markings of animals; and having paid much attention 
        to this question I will make a few remarks upon it. It is a very striking 
        fact, the full importance of which has not been appreciated, that almost 
        all animals, when domesticated, produce varieties of colour and markings, 
        often <font color="990000">[[p. 304]]</font> exhibiting a great diversity 
        in this respect, whereas the wild species from which they have been derived 
        have each a constant type of colour and marking, and although they not 
        unfrequently produce varieties, such as white or pied swallows, blackbirds, 
        &amp;c., these never increase in numbers as they do under domestication. 
        This implies that the variation is prejudicial to the species, and that 
        the general constancy of colouration we observe in each wild species is 
        a useful character. A long consideration of this subject has convinced 
        me that the usefulness of colour and marking to wild animals arises in 
        many different ways. The most general of all the uses of colour is to 
        serve as a protection to the species from its enemies or to aid in concealing 
        it from its prey; hence the very wide prevalence of protective colouration 
        as instanced, broadly, in the white arctic and sand-coloured desert animals, 
        in the numerous green birds of tropical forests, and, more especially, 
        in the countless insects resembling green or dead leaves, bark, bird's 
        dung, moss, stones, or other natural objects among which they live. The 
        protective character of many of these markings can rarely be understood 
        till the creature is seen in its natural attitude and among its natural 
        surroundings, so that hundreds of species preserved in our museums and 
        cabinets seem to have colours which are altogether unmeaning and useless, 
        owing to our ignorance of their habits and life history.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another kind of colouration was long quite unintelligible, 
        that of creatures which are very conspicuous and often so gaudily coloured 
        as to attract attention; but it is now found that many groups of species 
        thus coloured have a totally different kind of protection in being endowed 
        with such an offensive odour and taste as to be inedible. Whole families 
        of butterflies, moths, beetles, and other insects, are now known by actual 
        experiment to be so protected, and these in every case possess conspicuous 
        colours, or at all events are entirely wanting in those protective hues 
        which characterise most creatures which serve as food to others. Another 
        class of animals possess deadly weapons, like the stings of wasps and 
        the poison fangs of snakes, and these often exhibit conspicuous colours 
        or some other means of warning their enemies that they cannot be attacked 
        with impunity. As illustrations of these forms of useful characters I 
        may mention the glow-worm and fire-flies, which belong to inedible groups, 
        but being nocturnal and soft-bodied would be liable to be seized and injured, 
        if not devoured, without the warning light which tells all insect-eating 
        creatures (after one experience) that they are uneatable. This interpretation 
        of the use of the light was suggested by Mr. Belt and has been adopted 
        by Mr. Darwin. The case of the poisonous snakes is still more curious. 
        Most of these are rather protectively coloured in order that their prey 
        may approach them sufficiently near to be seized, but they are usually 
        characterised by a broad <font color="990000">[[p. 305]]</font> triangular 
        head and short tail which sufficiently marks out the tribe of viperine 
        poisonous snakes to reptilivorous birds and mammals. In a few cases, however, 
        they possess a more special warning. The rattle of the rattle-snake and 
        the dilated hood of the Indian and African cobras are of this character, 
        and it is interesting to note that the cobras do not belong to the viper 
        tribe, but have heads and tails of similar form to harmless snakes. In 
        South America there are poisonous snakes of the same family which get 
        protection not by a hood or rattle, but by a style of colouration in alternate 
        rings of black, red, and yellow, quite unlike that of any other snakes 
        in America or in the rest of the world. They are distinguished among other 
        snakes just as the brightly coloured inedible insects are distinguished 
        among their edible allies, and for the same purpose of warning enemies 
        not to attack them.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The several cases now referred to cover a great 
        deal of ground, but there remains one of the most important. It may be 
        said, you have shown the use of certain classes or styles of colouration, 
        but these would apply to a great number of species equally well. Why, 
        then, is each species usually different in colouration from all others? 
        The reply to this objection I believe to be, that easy recognition is 
        important to all animals, and especially to those which are gregarious 
        and whose safety largely depends upon their keeping together. My attention 
        was first called to this subject by a remark of Mr. Darwin's, that the 
        principle of protective colouring fails in the rabbit, &quot;for when running 
        to its burrow it is made conspicuous to the sportsman, and no doubt to 
        all beasts of prey, by its upturned white tail.&quot; Not believing that any 
        animal could have acquired a character actually hurtful to it without 
        some more than counterbalancing advantages, it occurred to me that, when 
        feeding in the dusk, rabbits run to their burrows on the least alarm, 
        and that it would be very important for those who were furthest off, and 
        especially for the young, to be able to follow the others without any 
        hesitation in a straight line. The upturned white tail thus serves as 
        a useful guide. On looking for other cases of analogous colouring, I was 
        struck by the remarkable fact that a large number of antelopes, which 
        are usually protectively coloured with sandy or earth-coloured tints, 
        are nevertheless rendered conspicuous by large white patches, usually 
        behind or on the flanks, and often accompanied by peculiar white marks 
        on the face, but always different in each species. Mr. Darwin imputes 
        all these markings to the effects of sexual selection, having been first 
        acquired by the males and then transmitted wholly or partially to the 
        other sex. It seems to me, however, much more probable that these markings 
        have been acquired for the purpose of enabling any strayed member of the 
        herd to recognise his fellows, and to be recognised by them. Most of these 
        animals depend for safety on keeping together, <font color="990000">[[p. 
        306]]</font> when they can defend themselves against most beasts of prey; 
        and as each kind will not usually allow animals of another species to 
        join them, it becomes doubly important that every species should have 
        a distinctive marking, especially with desert animals, which are obliged 
        to roam far in search of food and water, and still more when there are 
        many allied species of the same general form inhabiting the same country. 
        It seems not improbable that the many curious differences in the shape, 
        direction, and curvature of the horns of antelopes may have risen from 
        a similar cause, as when these alone were visible they would often serve 
        the purpose of recognition at a great distance. This same idea has occurred 
        to Mrs. Barber, an excellent observer of nature in Cape Colony. She says, 
        &quot;Land birds are for the most part coloured to match the country they inhabit. 
        Some of them, however, possess conspicuous markings, which are of great 
        service to them in their flight, enabling them, if disturbed (especially 
        during the night), to keep together. If, however, they are not in possession 
        of indicative colours (such as white beneath the wings, &amp;c.), they 
        will probably utter some peculiar note or frequent cry, which will answer 
        the same purpose, like that of the fern owl, for instance.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This need of easy recognition by each species 
        of its own kind and of the sexes by each other, will probably explain 
        at once those slight diversities of colour and marking, which, more commonly 
        than any other characters distinguish closely allied species from each 
        other, and also the constancy and bilateral symmetry of the colouration 
        of wild animals. For if the same species varied in colour beyond definite 
        limits, and especially if they became piebald or irregularly coloured, 
        great confusion would arise; and it is probable that such irregularities, 
        when they do occur, soon die out, because the normal-coloured individuals 
        refuse to pair with them.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have now shown that in a great number 
        of cases the trivial characters that distinguish species from species 
        are, in all probability, useful to them, and may therefore have been increased 
        and fixed by natural selection. This is the more probable if we remember 
        the extraordinarily rigid character of the selection that is always going 
        on among wild animals, from three to ten or a hundred times the minimum 
        population being weeded out every year, so that the very slightest characters, 
        if even at rare intervals affecting the safety of the individual, will 
        be almost sure to be preserved. We must also remember that many slight 
        characters may be the atrophied or rudimentary remains of more important 
        characters which were useful in some ancestral form, but which, being 
        now so very trivial, have not been completely lost by disuse; while sufficient 
        importance has not been given to the constant state of flux and reflux 
        of all organic forms, development and degeneration going on alternately 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 307]]</font> and having been many times repeated, 
        so that characters may be partially lost, and then under a change of conditions 
        utilised by a fresh development in a different direction, thus leading 
        to those singular complexities of form and structure, serving purposes 
        which might apparently have been reached in a much simpler and more direct 
        manner.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, therefore, that the alleged &quot;inutility 
        of specific characters,&quot; claimed by Mr. Romanes as one of the foundations 
        of his new theory, has no other foundation than our extreme ignorance, 
        in the great majority of cases, of the habits and life-histories of the 
        several allied species, the use of whose minute but often numerous differential 
        characters we are therefore unable to comprehend.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.) <i>Swamping Effects of Intercrossing</i>.--Mr. 
        Darwin's remarks on this subject are as follows:--&quot;Most animals and plants 
        keep to their proper homes, and do not needlessly wander about. We see 
        this with migratory birds, which almost always return to the same spot. 
        Consequently, each newly formed variety would generally be at first local, 
        as seems to be the common rule with varieties in a state of nature; so 
        that similarly modified individuals would soon exist in a small body together, 
        and would often breed together. If the new variety were successful in 
        its battle for life, it would slowly spread from a central district, competing 
        with and conquering the unchanged individuals on the margin of an ever-increasing 
        circle.&quot; After quoting this passage, Mr. Romanes objects that a very large 
        assumption is made when the newly formed variety is spoken of as represented 
        by similarly modified individuals--the assumption, namely, &quot;that the same 
        variation occurs simultaneously in a number of individuals inhabiting 
        the same area;&quot; and he adds, &quot;Of course, if this assumption were granted 
        there would be an end of the present difficulty;&quot; and then he goes on 
        to give &quot;reasons&quot; why such simultaneous variations are not likely to occur. 
        But that which Mr. Romanes regards as &quot;a very large assumption&quot; is, I 
        maintain, a very general fact, and, at the present time, one of the best-established 
        facts in natural history. A brief summary of these facts is given in my 
        <i>Island Life</i> (p. 57), and I possess in MSS. a considerable collection 
        of additional facts, showing that simultaneous variation is a general 
        phenomenon among the best-known species of animals and plants. Unfortunately, 
        very few naturalists pay attention to individual variations. They are 
        usually satisfied with describing typical or mean specimens, sometimes 
        noting the amount of variation of size they have met with, but hardly 
        ever taking the trouble to compare and measure scores or hundreds of specimens 
        of the same sex and age, and collected in the same locality, so as to 
        furnish us with direct evidence of the general amount and kind of variation 
        that occurs in nature. One American naturalist, however, has done this; 
        and to <font color="990000">[[p. 308]]</font> Mr. J. A. Allen we owe a 
        debt of gratitude for having furnished us, in his <i>Mammals and Winter 
        Birds of Florida</i>, with a complete demonstration of individual and 
        simultaneous variability by a series of minute comparisons and measurements 
        of a large number of common North American birds.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
        We have no longer any occasion to reason as to what kind or amount of 
        variation is probable, since we have accurate knowledge of what it is. 
        The following is a brief summary of Mr. Allen's facts.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After comparing and measuring from twenty to 
        sixty or more specimens of each of a great number of species, not only 
        as to their general size, but also as regards every external part and 
        organ capable of being measured, he says:--&quot;The facts of the case show 
        that a variation of from 15 to 20 per cent. in general size, and an equal 
        degree of variation in the relative size of different parts, may be ordinarily 
        expected among specimens of the same species and sex, taken at the same 
        locality.&quot; He then goes on to show that each part varies to a considerable 
        extent independently of the other parts. The wing and tail, for example, 
        besides varying in length, vary in the proportionate length of each feather, 
        which causes their outline to vary considerably in shape. The bill varies 
        in length, width, depth, and curvature. The tarsus varies in length, as 
        does each toe separately and independently; and all this not to a minute 
        degree, not &quot;infinitesimally,&quot; as usually stated, but to an amount that 
        can be easily seen without any measurement, as it averages one-sixth of 
        the whole mean length, and not unfrequently reaches one-fourth.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ascertain the amount of independent 
        variability of the different parts, I constructed a series of diagrams 
        from Mr. Allen's tables of measurements, so as to show, by the amount 
        and direction of the curvatures of lines, the variability of each part 
        in a number of specimens of the same species. The comparative lengths 
        of the wing, tail, bill, tarsus, and each of the toes were thus shown 
        for, say, twenty specimens of the same bird; and it was most interesting 
        to note how independent is the variation of each part, so that we may 
        choose either a long wing with a short tail, or the reverse, or both long 
        or both short; a long bill or a short bill with a long leg, or again the 
        reverse; and so with every external character there seems to be no fixed 
        correlation (though a tendency to it is in some cases shown), but each 
        part appears to vary independently of all the rest. As an illustration 
        of this independent variability which can be shown by figures, the following 
        table exhibits the relative lengths of the primary wing-feathers in the 
        myrtle warbler of the United States (<i>Dendr&#156;ca coronata</i>), occurring 
        among twenty-five specimens:--</p>
      <p align="center"><font color="990000">[[p. 309]]</font></p>
      
      <p align="center"><font size="-1">Relative Lengths of Primary Wing-Feathers 
        of &quot;Dendr&#156;ca Coronata.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../pics/S389.jpg" width="50%" height="auto" />
      </p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the figures 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. 
        indicate the wing-feathers numbered in order from the outer one, and we 
        see that either the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th feather is sometimes the second 
        in length, while the 1st or outer feather is sometimes one of the longest, 
        sometimes third, and sometimes only fourth in length. This is an extreme 
        case, but many other birds give almost similar results.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Allen also gives full details as to the 
        variation of colour and marking, showing that these are not less striking 
        than those of size and proportions; but the most important thing for us 
        in regard to the question we are discussing is the amount of simultaneous 
        variation of the same kind that is constantly occurring. To determine 
        this I formed diagrams, in which each individual was represented by a 
        spot placed on a horizontal line at a point determined by its actual dimensions. 
        It would have been antecedently expected that the great bulk of the spots 
        would be crowded together about a point representing the mean dimensions 
        of the species, but this was by no means the case. Often the central point 
        was not at all crowded with dots, but they were grouped with rough uniformity 
        for a considerable distance on each side of the centre, with a few isolated 
        at greater distances representing the extremes of variation. Hence a species 
        could usually be divided into two portions, with a considerable number 
        of specimens in each showing divergence from the mean condition--the very 
        &quot;simultaneous variation&quot; which Mr. Romanes regards as &quot;a very large assumption.&quot; 
        And this result appears more or less prominently whatever characters are 
        compared, so that whether we require modification of wing or tail, of 
        beak, leg, or toes, we <i>always</i> find a considerable number, say 
        from 10 to 20 per cent. of the whole, varying simultaneously, and to a 
        considerable amount, on either side of the mean value.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we must remember that these results have 
        been obtained from the comparison of from twenty to sixty specimens only, 
        usually <font color="990000">[[p. 310]]</font> collected at one time and 
        place, while nature deals with millions and hundreds of millions of each 
        species, reproduced afresh every few years, with probabilities of variation 
        far beyond those which occur in the very restricted range of one observer. 
        We must also remember that at least 90 to 95 per cent. of the offspring 
        produced each year are weeded out by natural selection (because birds 
        live <i>many</i> years and produce many young <i>each</i> year), so that, 
        during any change of conditions necessitating readjustment to the environment, 
        an ample supply of &quot;simultaneous favourable variations&quot; would occur calculated 
        to bring about that readjustment. And since we have every reason to believe 
        (as I have shown in the preceding section) that the slight specific differences 
        of which these variations are the initial steps are in most cases utilitarian 
        in character, we may feel sure that all useful variations, occurring so 
        frequently, would be preserved and rapidly increased without any danger 
        from the &quot;swamping effects of intercrossing.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now shown that two of the &quot;great obstructions 
        in the road of natural selection&quot; set forth by Mr. Romanes do not in fact 
        exist at all, we are in a position to consider the effect of the undoubtedly 
        real and important difficulty of the difference between species and varieties 
        in the matter of fertility when intercrossed.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3.) <i>Sterility between Species</i>.--In 
        discussing this question Mr. Romanes assumes that it is almost a universal 
        rule for natural species to be more or less infertile with each other, 
        while domesticated varieties, on the other hand, are almost always perfectly 
        fertile, and sometimes exceptionally so. Supposing this to be a fair statement 
        of the facts, he very naturally objects to Mr. Darwin's explanation of 
        them--that species have been subjected to uniform conditions for long 
        periods--as quite inadequate, urging the great &quot;antecedent improbability, 
        that in all these millions and millions of cases the reproductive system 
        should happen to have been affected in this peculiar way, by the mere 
        negative condition of uniformity;&quot; and further, &quot;that, at the time when 
        a variety is first forming, this condition of prolonged exposure to uniform 
        conditions must necessarily be absent as regards that variety: yet this 
        is just the time when we must suppose that the infertility with the parent 
        form arose.&quot;</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us see whether there is any reason for 
        believing that species which are very closely allied, that is, which have 
        recently been specialised the one from the other or both from a common 
        ancestor, as well as those natural varieties which may be classed as incipient 
        species, agree in being always infertile with each other or in producing 
        infertile offspring. It is important to remark that hybridisers usually 
        experiment with very distinct species, and often with distinct genera, 
        and even such crosses as these not unfrequently <font color="990000">[[p. 
        311]]</font> produce offspring; while in the cases of close allies being 
        quite fertile the conclusion is arrived at that they are really the same 
        species. Dean Herbert's experiments are most instructive in this respect, 
        since they show that in a considerable number of large genera hybrids 
        are perfectly fertile, and not unfrequently more fertile than the parents, 
        while in many cases they produce quite fertile offspring; and he concludes, 
        &quot;that the sterility or fertility of the offspring does not depend upon 
        original diversity of stock; and that, if two species are to be united 
        in a scientific arrangement on account of a fertile issue, the botanist 
        must give up his specific distinctions generally, and entrench himself 
        within genera.&quot; He showed that many very distinct species of crinum, hippeastrum, 
        gladiolus, pelargonium, calceolaria, and many other genera were quite 
        fertile when crossed, and often produced offspring which could be propagated 
        indefinitely and have thus formed valuable garden flowers; while other 
        species, more alike externally, either could not be crossed at all, or 
        produced offspring which were sterile; and he thence concludes, &quot;that 
        the fertility of the hybrid or mixed offspring depends more upon the constitutional 
        than the closer botanical affinities of the parents.&quot;<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popular ideas as to the sterility of hybrids 
        are derived from crosses between certain domestic animals by no means 
        closely allied, such as the horse and ass, the canary and goldfinch, or 
        the domestic fowl and the pheasant. To arrive at the common ancestor of 
        either of these pairs we should probably have to go back far into the 
        tertiary period, and trace their diverging progeny through many successive 
        distinct species, so that there is no fair comparison between such crosses 
        and those between domestic varieties, which, however different externally, 
        have all originated within a few thousand years. Really close species 
        which have probably originated by one remove from a common ancestor have 
        never yet been crossed in large numbers and for several generations, under 
        approximately natural conditions, so as to afford any reliable data. The 
        mere fact that not only animals of distinct genera, but even those classed 
        in distinct families--as the pheasant and the black grouse--sometimes 
        produce hybrid offspring in a state of nature, is itself an argument against 
        there being any constant infertility between the most closely allied species, 
        since if that were the case we should expect the infertility to increase 
        steadily with remoteness of descent till when we came to family distinctions 
        absolute sterility should be invariable.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite agree with Mr. Romanes that on this 
        point experiments are required, and some of those which he has suggested 
        at the conclusion of his paper are well fitted to test the question whether 
        infertility is a cause or a consequence of specific distinction or merely 
        <font color="990000">[[p. 312]]</font> a correlative phenomenon. The most 
        direct and easy experiments would be those with plants. We possess a considerable 
        number of native plants which by one school of botanists are classed as 
        species, while by another school they are considered to be only sub-species 
        in process of segregation from a parent form. It would be tolerably easy 
        to determine whether these pairs of allied forms present any definite 
        amount of infertility, which they should do in almost every case to support 
        Mr. Romanes' theory. We have, however, first to consider whether, even 
        if such general infertility exists, it can possibly have been brought 
        about in the way he suggests.</p>
      
      <p> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theory of Physiological Selection</i>.--While 
        fully admitting that variations in fertility are highly probable, and 
        also that there is evidence to show that individual varieties occur which, 
        while infertile with some members of the same species are fertile with 
        others, it yet seems to be quite impossible that such variations should 
        produce the results claimed for them by Mr. Romanes. He says, &quot;If the 
        variation be such that the reproductive system, while showing some degree 
        of sterility with the parent form, continues to be fertile within the 
        limits of the varietal form, in this case the variation would neither 
        be swamped by intercrossing, nor would it die out on account of sterility. 
        On the contrary, the variation would be perpetuated with more certainty 
        than could a variation of any other kind. For in virtue of increased sterility 
        with the parent form, the variation would not be exposed to extinction 
        by intercrossing; while in virtue of continued fertility within the varietal 
        form the variation would perpetuate itself by heredity, just as in the 
        case of variations generally when not reabsorbed by intercrossing.&quot; He 
        then goes on to show how, by these means, a species becomes divided into 
        two portions each free to develop independent histories without mutual 
        intercrossing.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement, with the results deduced from 
        it, sounds feasible when not closely examined; but it really slurs over 
        insuperable difficulties, and when viewed in the light of the known facts 
        of variation and natural selection it will be seen that the supposed results 
        could not follow. Mr. Romanes speaks of this physiological variation as 
        if it were a simple instead of a highly complex form of variation, and 
        as if it might occur sporadically within the limits of a species like 
        some change of colour or modification of form. In order to test this and 
        ascertain what would really happen, we must follow the variety step by 
        step under varied conditions. Let us then suppose that in a large species 
        some one individual is produced that is infertile with the bulk of the 
        species, but fertile with some few individuals of the opposite sex who 
        happen to be what may be termed the physiological complements of the first-named 
        individual. But it will evidently be in the highest degree improbable 
        that these <font color="990000">[[p. 313]]</font> complementary pairs 
        should accidentally meet, as, by the hypothesis, there is no external 
        common character distinguishing them from the rest of the species, and 
        if all are sterile with other than their &quot;complements&quot; then all are doomed 
        to almost certain extinction. Now let us suppose that, not one only, but 
        a dozen or a score or even a hundred of such physiological varieties occur 
        at the same time scattered throughout the area occupied by the species, 
        and that each one has some few complementary mates with whom alone it 
        will be fertile. In this case the chances against the right pairs meeting 
        will be almost as great as before, unless we make the assumption that 
        the individuals which vary in the direction of sterility with the bulk 
        of the species all agree in being fertile with any one of the same set 
        of individuals of the opposite sex. This, however, seems to me so highly 
        improbable an assumption that we cannot possibly accept it without direct 
        and cogent proof, since the fact that the different physiological varieties 
        arose in different parts of the area, from distinct parents, and under 
        slightly different conditions, renders it almost certain that each one 
        would require for its complement an individual which would not be the 
        complement of any other. This difficulty is so great that I cannot conceive 
        the possibility of such physiological variations arising sporadically 
        at several distinct points within the area of a species.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one other way--and it seems 
        to me the only possible way--in which such varieties could arise. The 
        entire offspring of a single pair might, conceivably, be so constituted 
        as to be fertile <i>inter se</i> while sterile with all the rest of the 
        species, and, if they kept together, might form the nucleus of a &quot;physiological 
        variety.&quot; But there would evidently be enormous odds against them. For 
        it must be remembered that the weeding-out by the struggle for existence 
        is so terribly severe that only in very rare cases can more than one or 
        two offspring of the same parents arrive at maturity and when this rare 
        event happens it will be essential that they comprise at least one pair 
        of opposite sexes. Then this pair, or pair and a half, after all the chances 
        and changes of early life, after enduring the fierce struggle for existence 
        for several months or for a year, and after each of them has escaped countless 
        perils, and has been driven hither and thither by the need of food, by 
        the inclemency of the seasons, or by the pursuit of enemies, must nevertheless, 
        just at the right time, come together--or become extinct. It must be remembered, 
        too, that there is nothing whatever but chance to bring them together; 
        for there is, by the assumption, no difference of form, or colour, or 
        habit, or instinct, nothing but the one fact--which they themselves cannot 
        possibly know--that unless they happen to meet and pair <i>their</i> particular 
        race will be doomed to extinction. Surely a phenomenon so widespread as 
        the existence of some degree of <font color="990000">[[p. 314]]</font> 
        sterility between species cannot possibly have originated in a mode of 
        variation, which, whenever it occurs, is almost certain to die out immediately.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now shown, by considering carefully the 
        results of the variations suggested by Mr. Romanes, that they could not 
        possibly produce the effects he attributes to them. Yet he has arrived 
        at a diametrically opposite conclusion; for he claims as the special feature 
        of these variations that &quot;they cannot escape the preserving agency of 
        physiological selection. Hence, even if it be granted that the variation 
        which affects the reproductive system in this particular way is a variation 
        of comparatively rare occurrence, still, as it must always be preserved 
        whenever it does occur, its influence in the manufacture of specific types 
        must be cumulative, and, therefore, in the course of geological time probably 
        immense.&quot; This most extraordinary statement, which I have just shown to 
        be the very opposite of what would really happen, seems to me to have 
        been reached by ignoring altogether the cardinal fact of the tremendous 
        struggle for existence, and the survival in each generation of only a 
        small percentage of &quot;the fittest.&quot; Mr. Romanes' argument almost everywhere 
        tacitly assumes that his &quot;physiological variations&quot; <i>are</i> the fittest, 
        and that <i>they</i> always survive! With such an assumption it would 
        not be difficult to prove <i>any</i> theory of the origin of species.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My readers may now reasonably ask whether, having 
        rejected Mr. Romanes' solution of the problem of the general sterility 
        of species as opposed to the equally general fertility of varieties, I 
        have myself any suggestion to make as to how the admitted difficulty may 
        be overcome. I have already stated that some of the more important data 
        for a complete solution are wanting, owing to the very imperfect character 
        of hybridisation experiments from this point of view; but the reconsideration 
        of the whole question to which I have been led by Mr. Romanes' paper (and 
        for which therefore I am much indebted to him) has cleared up some difficulties 
        in my own mind, and has resulted in a provisional explanation which seems 
        to me to be in harmony with most of the facts. This I will now endeavour 
        to explain.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Darwin, in his invaluable work on <i>Animals 
        and Plants under Domestication</i>, has collected a body of curious facts 
        proving a remarkable correlation between physiological peculiarities and 
        colour, both in plants and animals, the bearing of which on this question 
        he appears to have himself overlooked. Dealing first with general physiological 
        correlations, we have the following facts. In Holland <i>red</i>-coloured 
        hyacinths were injured by frost more than plants of any other colour; 
        <i>purple</i> plums are affected by a disease from which green or yellow-fruited 
        kinds are free; in Mauritius <i>white</i> sugar-canes suffer from disease 
        so severely that they have been largely given up <font color="990000">[[p. 
        315]]</font> for red canes, which do not suffer; in France a very fine 
        <i>white</i> onion was found to be especially liable to fungus; in Malaga 
        <i>green</i> grapes had the vine disease severely, while red and black 
        sorts did not suffer at all.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analogous facts in animals are that <i>white</i> 
        terriers suffer most from distemper; <i>white</i> or white-spotted horses 
        are poisoned by eating mildewed vetches, which did not injure brown or 
        black horses; in the Tarentino black sheep are kept because <i>white</i> 
        sheep are poisoned by eating the <i>Hypericum crispum</i> which abounds 
        there; in Virginia black pigs alone are kept, because they alone are not 
        injured by the poisonous paint-root; <i>white</i> chickens are found to 
        be most subject to the gapes; while in France the <i>yellow</i>-cocooned 
        silkworms have fungus disease much more than the white-cocooned varieties.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a very remarkable series of cases 
        showing that the whole constitution of animals and plants is often profoundly 
        modified in correlation with changes of colour, while no such constitutional 
        changes have been observed to accompany such modifications of form and 
        structure as are usually met with in varieties or allied species. We are 
        taught by these facts that colour is an important character, physiologically; 
        and as we know it to be so frequently modified for protective or other 
        utilitarian purposes, we can see what a powerful selective agency it may 
        become, especially as we may be sure that numbers of less obtrusive correlations 
        than those which seriously affect health and life must have remained unnoticed.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the same work Mr. Darwin furnishes us 
        with another set of correlations, in which infertility or complete sterility 
        is directly correlated with diversity of colour. The red and the yellow 
        varieties of maize were found by G&auml;rtner to be almost completely 
        sterile when crossed; the yellow and the white varieties of mullein will 
        not cross, although many distinct species, if both yellow or both white, 
        are perfectly fertile when crossed; the differently coloured varieties 
        of the hollyhock are raised by nurserymen in rows close together and never 
        hybridize, each sort keeping distinct, although they are visited by bees; 
        and, lastly, the blue and the red pimpernels, considered by most botanists 
        to be the same species since they present no differences of form or structure, 
        are yet completely sterile when crossed.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among animals no experiments have been made 
        to show how colour affects the sterility of crosses, but there is ample 
        evidence that the same result is brought about by the disinclination of 
        differently coloured races to pair together. In Paraguay and in Circassia 
        it has been noticed that feral horses of the same colour and size usually 
        breed together; in the Far&ouml;e Islands the black and <font color="990000">[[p. 
        316]]</font> the white sheep keep in separate flocks; in the Forest of 
        Dean and in the New Forest dark and pale herds of deer do not mingle together; 
        while pigeon-fanciers agree that if pigeons were allowed freedom of choice 
        they would pair with their own sort exclusively.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the facts here summarised rest upon 
        the testimony of more than one good observer, while in several cases they 
        were confirmed by Mr. Darwin's own observations; and they certainly demonstrate 
        the great importance of colour, both as a physiological selective agency 
        in certain localities, and as correlated with varied constitutional differences, 
        with disinclination to pair together in animals, and with actual mutual 
        sterility in plants. But it is a matter of common knowledge to naturalists 
        that differences of colour or markings form the very commonest of the 
        distinctive characters between closely allied species, while they also 
        frequently characterise the varieties of the same species. From a utilitarian 
        standpoint colour is, as I have shown, one of the most important of specific 
        characters, serving in infinitely varied ways the several purposes of 
        concealment, of warning, and of recognition; and, therefore, a difference 
        of colour is almost sure to arise whenever, by natural selection, a species 
        is becoming adapted to any change in its environment.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now taking into consideration the remarkable 
        facts above enumerated, it is surely a not improbable supposition that 
        change of colour is <i>usually</i> accompanied by some amount of sterility, 
        and of disinclination to pair in the case of animals; and that it thus 
        furnishes the required starting-point of that physiological distinction 
        which becomes more marked when, by successive variations and adaptations, 
        the original varieties of one parent form have become changed into distinct 
        and well-marked species. The extreme generality of colour as a specific 
        distinction, is in perfect accord with the generality of some amount of 
        sterility between distinct species; and we thus have a <i>vera causa</i> 
        co-extensive with the effect produced.</p>
      
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I do not deny that varieties 
        which exhibit no other distinctive character than sterility with the bulk 
        of the parent species may arise, but I claim to have shown that such varieties 
        are at an immense disadvantage, and could hardly by any possibility be 
        preserved and increased till they were required to form the nucleus of 
        a new species. On the other hand, I have shown that sterility or infertility 
        is actually, in many cases, correlated with colour-variations, while this 
        very character of colour-variation is the most frequent mark of closely-allied 
        species or sub-species. It is, therefore, by means of a study of this 
        class of facts that I believe the true solution of the problem of the 
        sterility of hybrids will be discovered.</p>

        commun. 2/04):</font></i></strong></p>
      <p align="left"><i> The subject of Wallace's attack, Romanes' 1886 article 
        in the <u>Journal of the Linnean Society</u>, is presented at: <a href="http://post.queensu.ca/%7Eforsdyke/romanes1.htm" target="_top">http://post.queensu.ca/~forsdyke/romanes1.htm</a>. 
        Although at that time Romanes' health was excellent, he had only eight 
        years to live. He died a few days after his forty-sixth birthday of what 
        seems to have been a brain tumour. In contrast, Wallace, then sixty-three, 
        was to live to 1913. The Linnean Society lecture was the first salvo in 
        an eight year public &quot;debate&quot; between Romanes and the evolution establishment, 
        which was no less colourful than its equivalent a century later between 
        Stephen Jay Gould and the modern evolution establishment. The issues were 
        basically the same, with Romanes (1886) and Gould (e.g., 'Is a New and 
        General Theory of Evolution Emerging?', <u>Paleobiology</u> 6: 119-130, 
        1980) both advocating a higher level of selection involving agencies other 
        than the natural selection of Darwin and Wallace. Remarkably, Gould himself 
        contracted cancer at about the same age as Romanes, but with modern therapies 
        survived another two decades to die in 2002 on 20 May (which happened 
        to be Romanes' birthday). Of necessity, Romanes and Gould could only describe 
        their agencies in abstract terms (see Gould, <u>The Structure of Evolutionary 
        Thought</u>, 2002) . Romanes, a physiologist by training, called his &quot;physiological

face="Verdana">The first instrumental track to claim the top spot
did so for just one week, and was taken from the film <i>Moulin
Rouge. </i>Annunzio Paolo Mantovani was born in Italy on 15
November 1905. He moved to England at the age of 16 with his
parents. In the 1930s he formed his own orchestra, which began to
be known for its 'cascading strings', and in the 1940s started
formally recording with the legendary Decca label. He soon became
as popular on record as he had been on radio. He recorded a
US-aimed album in 1951, and a song from that album, 'Charmaine'
reached the US Top 10 and sold a million copies. His first hit in
Britain was a version of White Christmas, which hit #6 over
Christmas of 1952 and spent three weeks on the chart. In 1953,
with still enduring popularity, his version of the theme from <i>Moulin
Rouge, </i>which starred José Ferrer as French painter Henri de
Toulouse Lautrec on his knees, eventually hit #1 in its twelfth
week. The song spent a lengthy 21 weeks on chart on its first
run. It re-entered at #10 in November for one week, and a month
later in December it spent a week at the bottom of the chart
(#12). Percy Faith had the biggest hit version in America, but
Mantovani once again hit the 10 and both versions sold a million.
The orchestra went on to have a few more hits, until 1957, when
the machine stopped. Mantovani, who backed David Whitfield on
most of his recordings, died on 31 March 1981.</font></p>

Man With The Golden Trumpet', Eddie Calvert was born 13 March
1922, Lancashire, UK and was the first British instrumentalist to
score two #1s and to earn a US gold disc. Trumpeter Eddie
Calvert's version of schmaltzy song Oh Mein Papa hit #1 in its
fourth week on chart and was a soaraway success. Eddie Fisher
recorded a fully vocal version, but for some this was far too
emotional for them. Calvert's purely instrumental version was the
perfect answer. Fisher had to make do with #9 here, while the
roles were reversed in the States; Fisher's version hit the top,
and Calvert's could only peak at #6. </font></p>

Why? The makers of new film <i>Underwater, </i>starring Jane
Russell,<i> </i>wanted it as their theme. He agreed, and the
single hit #1 in its fsixth week on the British charts. It was
even bigger in the States, where it resided for 10 weeks at
number one. Prado had a few more hits until the late 1950s. He
died on 14 September 1989 at the age of 72. In 1995, as a result
of a Guinness beer advertisement, Guaglione, never before
released in Britain, reached #2 and spent a formidable 24 weeks
on chart. </font></p>

Blossom White to become the only instrumental to be #1 in two

shortest gap between versions hitting the top. Indeed, there was
only one two week #1 in between these two. Funnily enough, this
perhaps proved movies don't always lead to success &#150; this
version spent longer at #1 and had more time on chart.&nbsp;</font></p>

that she was then the oldest female to top the chart, and is

in its sixth week, and became the first instrumental to reach #1
in more than two years, breaking the run of at least one
instrumental atop the charts each year from 1953-56. That record
was swiftly broken, starting with this, when at least one
instrumental topped the chart in each of six consecutive years,
from 1958-63. Harry Robinson had the luck of leading the band
Lord Rockingham's XI, which was the house band for Jack Good's
television show <i>Oh Boy!. </i>Their recording of Hoots Mon,
based on a traditional Scottish folk song called One Hundred
Pipers, was constantly plugged on the show, and became extremely
popular. It is known as an instrumental, although it and the
follow up <i>Wee Tom</i> contained a little spoken Scottish
(&quot;Hoots Mon! There's a moose loose about this hoose!&quot;).
Surprisingly, for the rockers' role in a single which sold over
half a million copies, they were paid just £6 each to record it
at Decca's studios in West Hampstead. The follow up spent a brief
time on the chart, only hitting #16. Hoots Mon returned to the
charts for one week in 1993 as a result of it being featured in a
Maynard's Wine Gums advertisement &#150; so it looks like Harry
and co are set to remain one-hit wonders.</font></p>

September 1927 and he joined the Merchant Navy at the ripe old
age of 15 in 1942. Two years later in 1944 he had joined the
Royal Navy. After having been involved in a somewhat vicious
combat with a bread slicer which cut off the top of the third
finger on his right hand Mr Stanford was awarded the
Distinguished Service Medal (though surely not for this escapade
with a bread slicer?), so he became Trevor Stanford DSM.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in
"><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Whilst in service,
Stanford had taught himself the piano, and soon began playing to
clubs. Dancer Irving Davies recommended him to producer Norman
Newell. The rest is history. Side Saddle hit number one in its
sixth week. It lingered a while, spending 30 weeks on the chart,
a run at that time second only to Frankie Laine's 36 weeks for I
Believe, and still the most weeks on chart for a number one
instrumental &#150; though well outdone by Mr Acker Bilk's #2 hit
Stranger On The Shore, which sold a million, spent an astonishing
55 weeks on chart and still remains one of the best selling
singles of all time in Britain.&nbsp;</font></p>

the only solo instrumentalist to have consecutive #1s. Just eight
weeks after Side Saddle had dropped from #1, and with just two
number one hits in between, this glided to the top in its sixth
week. It helped Russ to spend the most weeks on the British chart
in 1959 &#150; an astonishing 79, a massive feat considering the
chart was only a top 30 then, a run which pales today's acts who
spend 40 weeks or so on the Top 75 in a year into insignificance.
And of course, he was the biggest-selling artist of 1959. <br>
<br>
Hits for Russ petered out in the mid-sixties. He suffered a
nervous breakdown around that time, but was restored to full
health and continued performing until well into his sixties. <br>
<br>
Russ Conway died in December 2000, but many still fondly remember
his nine-and-a-half-fingered piano playing.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"

Shadows, Britain's biggest band pre-Beatles. Hitting #1 in its
sixth week, it got the Shadows off to a great start as they
rocketed to fame. Well, not really their start, was this. They
had actually previously featured on 11 weeks worth of #1 hits
with Cliff Richard, credited with him. They were for one #1 with
him, his first, known as the Drifters, but changed that name just
as the American group of the same name (known for hits such as
Saturday Night At The Movies) issued an injunction for name
duplication. They still have the most #1s for any instrumental
act in history and have the third most weeks on chart by any act,
with over 700. The group comprised of Hank B. Marvin on lead
guitar, Bruce Welch on rhythm guitar, Jet Harris on bass and Tony
Meehan on drums. </font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
face="Verdana">The song was first heard by the Shadows when they
were busy touring across Britain. A fellow artiste on the bill,
Jerry Lordan, played them the ditty on his ukelele. Bert Weedon
had already recorded it, but no one had any plans to release it.
The Shadows jumped in with their version, which promptly knocked
their own record, Please Don't Tease, on which they were credited
as Cliff Richard's backing band, off the top. He was also their
boss; the feat of knocking a manager/mentor off #1 is indeed rare
&#150; done also in 1999 when another male group, Westlife,
knocked their manager Ronan Keating's debut #1 off the top with
their second #1. The Shadows swept the annual awards polls in
1960; including being voted Britain's top Instrumental Group of
the Year and Apache being voted the Record of the Year by highly
regarded paper <i>New Musical Express. </i></font></p>

face="Verdana">Peter Gormley, the Shadows manager, was on the
lookout for songs for the Shadows to record when he heard this
one which came amongst the pile of tapes mounting on his desk. It
was written by the three members of vocal group the Avons, who
had a massive #3 hit in 1959 Seven Little Girls Sitting In The
Back Seat and not much else. Their fourth and final hit came in
early 1961 with Rubber Ball, a Bobby Vee cover, which could only
muster #30 while his version was a big Top 5 hit, entering a week
later. That same week a version also entered from Marty Wilde and
his group the Wildcats, which beat the Avons again to peak at #9.
Brian Bennett was then a Wildcat and later joined the Shadows, so
this was the only kind of connection for the Avons with a #1 hit,
which hit the top in its seventh week. The song was also later
denied the chance to have a place on the rather exclusive list of
songs to be Top 10 in an instrumental and vocal version, with
Kathy Kirby's version only managing #11. It thus failed to join
the likes of Oh Mein Papa (see earlier), Annie's Song, Amazing
Grace (see later) and Don't Cry For Me Argentina.</font></p>

instrumental song took over from another atop the charts. Terence
'Jet' Harris was born 6 July 1939 in Kingsbury, Middlesex and
David Joseph Anthony Meehan was born in Hampstead on 2 March
1943, and thus with them knocking the Shadows off the top came
another Shadows connection. Harris and Meehan played with groups
on several hits in 1958, until Mr Cliff Richard took them on to
play drums and bass for his backing band the Drifters who
obviously became the Shadows. This one peaked at the top in its
fourth week. After a further two big Top 5 hits that year, which
actually both spent the same amount of weeks on the chart as
their #1, the duo parted ways.</font></p>

in many ways. Firstly it was the final chart topper for the
Shads, although they did continue to score a further 21 hits
until 1981, including six Top Tenners. It was also a third
consecutive topper for producer Norrie Paramor, and a second
consecutive #1 for Bruce Welch as a co-writer, and as a performer
&#150; he of course featured on the previous Cliff Richard and
the Shadows #1, Summer Holiday. This again broke another record
&#150; it was a second consecutive #1 from the same film, and a
third in total from the feature presentation film Summer Holiday,
the first from the film to hit number one being The Next
Time/Bachelor Boy, another number from Cliff Richard and the
Shadows. Other films went on to score just as good chart success,
such as Grease and Saturday Night Fever in the late 70s, and most
recently notable is Bridget Jones's Diary having 4 hits from the
soundtrack on the UK Top 40 chart, but no film has come close to
this one's incredible run of chart success. The soundtrack also
hit #1 in the album charts for a massive 14 weeks. Finally, as
the Shadows stopped making #1s, there ceased to be an
instrumental #1 for some time&#133;&nbsp;</font></p>

became well-known for scores such as for the film Hurry Sundown
and the TV show The Man From U.N.C.L.E. He also acted as arranger
and conductor for major calypso artist and label mate Harry
Belafonte. This one was taken from a spaghetti western film,
starring Clint Eastwood, and it featured Tommy Morgan on electric
harmonica, Elliot Fisher on electric violin, Manny Klein on
piccolo trumpet and Arthur Smith on the ocarina, which provided
the unique introduction. A short while later Hugo narrowly
avoided being a permanent fix in the one-hit wonder list by being
one of just two artists to have their #1 follow up and last

instrumental (or single of any sort) to hit #1 twice, peaking at
#2 and giving the record a total of 35 weeks on chart. The hits
kept flowing for the Mac, and after the re-issue of Albatross the
British group expanded to include three Americans who helped them
to make the bestselling album Rumours, which took 49 weeks to hit
the top of the albums listings and was one of the biggest selling
albums of the 1970s in the UK.</font></p>

#1s, this time of three years, the first hit to feature the
Scottish bagpipes and the act with the longest artist name to hit
#1 hit the top in its third week. The traditional arrangement of
Amazing Grace was already well familiar to pop fans in Judy
Collins' vocal version, which spent a formidable 67 weeks on the
chart between 1970 and 73, yet peaking no higher than #5. This
version first appeared on the album Farewell To The Greys, a
tribute to the Royal Scots Greys (2<sup>nd</sup> Dragoon) that on
2 July 1971 had merged with the 35<sup>th</sup> Caribiniers
(Prince of Wales Dragoon Guards) to form a new regiment. At this
time they were stationed in West Germany, unaware that an album
track of theirs was gaining huge listener reaction after being
played on radio, starting with BBC Radio Two. The huge reaction
and public demand forced RCA to release it as a single. It spent
24 weeks on the chart initially, and after two more minor hits it
re-entered at Christmas to give it a total of 27 weeks on chart.
Combined with Judy Collins version, Amazing Grace has spent 94
weeks on chart to be the nation's second most popular ditty,
after Frank Sinatra's My Way.&nbsp;</font></p>

Eye Level was released but failed to make much of an impression,
only hitting #41 in November 1972. Momentum gathered as viewing
figures rapidly increased for the second series. It was quickly
re-released by popular demand (just like the aforementioned). It
thus hastily rose all the way in its third week of release and
spent four weeks at #1, selling a million copies. After a few
long breaks for instrumentals, the longest was now to come.</font></p>

harked back to an era even before the charts began. After a
massive 20 year gap, another ditty with absolutely no vocal in it
finally hit #1. Garnefski and Ridderhof, two producers from The
Hague in the Netherlands achieved this with a strange fusion of
1920s Charleston jazz that was spruced up with the techniques of
1990s house. Despite being widely believed to be an instrumental,
it must be noted that the title word is repeated relentlessly at
one point in the song by excited flapper girls. After entering at
#3 behind Mariah Carey's <em>Without You</em>, it jumped all the
way to #1. After three weeks there, and another two weeks in the
Top 5, it dropped quite rapidly. It became the 10<sup>th</sup>
bestselling single that year, and the Doop boys look forever
destined to end up on the ultimate one-hit wonder list after a
follow up, <em>Huckleberry Jam</em>, completely failed the Top
75.</font></p>

topper, the final one for the moment, is the only one to go
straight to the top. But perhaps not so surprising really given
the hype it received. Levi's, the jeans makers, were making yet
another advertisement, and again was to use music and for the
second time, after Stiltskin, decided to use a completely new
tune. Early in 1999, adverts started being shown with this music.
</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
face="Verdana">The adverts featured a furry little bear called
Flat Eric who became synonymous with the campaign and song. The
most famous of these adverts was one where a man was driving
along the road in his car, and next to him in the front of the
car was little Eric. The car was stopped by the police, who
demanded to look in the boot of the car. The man opened it up,
and would you believe it, the man had filled the boot with neat
piles of Levi's jeans. Of course, while all this was going on,
that wee ditty was playing. </font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
face="Verdana">The record-buying public soon got used to it, and
support built up. It was, to be honest, a tad on the repetitive
side, so when it had to be played on the radio, the edit was a
mere two minutes. It was of course a bit longer on recorded
vinyl, tape or CD. The only vocal or spoken part is at the start,
when a lady on the phone says: &quot;Oh yeah, I used to know
Quentin. He's a real jerk.&quot; But that can hardly exempt it
from instrumental status.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in
"><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;It crashed into the
top spot, selling over 200,000 copies in its first week alone and
678,000 in total to make it the 9<sup>th</sup> bestselling single
of 1999. </font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in
"><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;Behind all this had
to be a recording artiste of course. It was Quentin Dupieux, a
French underground techno artist. After all this he bowed out of
the mainstream voluntarily, saying he never intended to make
mainstream music and it was always intended for the underground. </font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in

color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;Oh, and on top of
that came the merchandising (bar those ever-so-radical engineered
jeans): key rings, badges&#133; and a puppet of the cute lil'
character as well.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in

color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;So how long until
the next instrumental #1? Well, dance music is always on the up,
and a fair amount of those massive dance choons have not vocals
whatsoever. So it can't be too far away&#133;<br>

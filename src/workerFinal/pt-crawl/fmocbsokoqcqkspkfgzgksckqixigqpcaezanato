            <h4>3. Cookies</h4>
            <p>
                Cookies are text files that we store on your computer. They
                enable us to monitor when and how you use our digital offers
                over a defined period of time. We use cookies for various
                purposes that are described below.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not want any cookies to be stored on your computer,
                you must disable this function according to the instructions
                provided in your web browser. As a consequence, however, you
                will no longer be able to use certain features of our website
                (e.g., auto-saving of facets or language settings).
            </p>
            <h5>3.1 Cookies storing settings and preferences</h5>
            <p>
                We use cookies to store your settings, e.g., your preferred
                language. We also use cookies to authenticate subscribed users.
                A pop-up message within our digital offer will notify you
                that we are using cookies. If you accept this, we will store
                the information in question in a cookie on your computer.
                Usually, the lifetime of such cookies ranges from some months
                to more than one year.
            </p>
            <h5>3.2 Cookies required for technical reasons in order to allow for sessions</h5>
            <p>
                We use cookies for technical reasons to be able to
                unambiguously allocate the large number of simultaneous visits
                to the respective users. They enable us to create “sessions”
                during which you can perform actions built upon one another.
                These cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session
                (by logout or by closing the tab or the browser used to access
                our digital offer).

            <h4>4. Sharing content through social networks</h4>
            <p>
                We do not use any mechanisms that automatically transmit data
                to providers of social networks when our digital offers are
                visited. Some of our digital offers allow for the sharing of
                pages through social networks.  To be able to share a page, you
                have to activate the button of the social network by mouse
                click first. Only upon your activating the button the provider
                of the social network will learn that you are using our digital
                offer. You have to carry out this activating process for each
                individual page of our digital offer you would like to share.

            <h4>3. Personal Metadata</h4>
            <p>
                In some of our digital offers we are processing metadata from
                scientific publications (including publications of data).
                Metadata describe a publication in order to identify it and to
                make it easily retrievable. These metadata also contain
                personal information that was either published by the
                respective persons themselves or that we have taken from
                publicly available sources:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Names of the authors or the persons who generated the data
                </li>
                <li>
                    Persistent, unambiguous person identifiers (e.g., ORCID,
                    VIAF, GND-ID, WikiData-ID)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Information about which institution the persons belong to
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hyperlinks to authors’ academic websites 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These personal metadata are usually processed together with
                other, non-personal descriptive metadata (e.g., the title of
                the publication, abstract, copyright holder). The purposes for
                which the data are processed and published include
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Supporting the scientific discourse,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Searching for and providing publications,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Acknowledging and correctly attributing scientific
                    achievements,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Archiving global research knowledge, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Persistently providing the descriptive metadata as a set of
                    research data. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All metadata are permanently stored within the scope of
                providing our services. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The legal basis for processing and publishing these data is
                GDPR Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f.
            </p>
            <p>
                The descriptive metadata are processed for research and storage
                purposes and are required in order to fulfil the specific
                purposes mentioned above. Therefore, the persons concerned may
                only object on grounds of their particular situation and if the
                interests, basic rights and fundamental freedoms of the persons
                concerned prevail over the legitimate interest mentioned above.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are always interested in correcting faulty metadata and
                completing incomplete sets of metadata, if necessary.
                Therefore, we are very grateful for any hint on missing data
                and errors to be corrected. Just contact us at one of the
                addresses listed in section V.6.

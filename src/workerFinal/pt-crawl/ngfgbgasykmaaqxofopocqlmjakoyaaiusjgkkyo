<h2>Further Comments from the Press</h2>

<p class="fancyfirst">Coverage of the impending repatriation of "El Negro" was limited in scope 
until the weekend before. The only prior announcements of the repatriation 
were in Gaborone's <cite>Mmegi/ The Reporter</cite>, which had been 
consistently following the issue over the previous six months 
(29 Sept.2000 p.2 "El Negro to be made national hero" by Leshwiti Tutwane), 
and in the government-owned Gaborone 
<cite><a href="http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi">Daily News/ Dikgang tsa Gompieno</a></cite>. 
But public consciousness was raised by a series of radio programmes, 
hosted by Monica Mpusu, over Radio Botswana during the extended holiday 
weekend that followed Independence Day on September 30th.</p>

<p>The actual arrival of the body in its box at Seretse Khama Airport in 
Gaborone on Wednesday October 4th was widely covered by the international, 
regional, national, and local press. The front page of the Johannesburg <cite>Star</cite> 
the next day featured a colour photo captioned "&nbsp;'El Negro' arrives back home 
to a proper burial'. The lead story beneath, however, confusingly referred 
to him as a 'Bushman'. (Oct.5 p.1 'Botswana welcomes return of Bushman's 
body used as colonial exhibit'). The same newspaper the day before had 
carried a SAPA-DPA story merely referring to him as a warrior 
(Oct 4 p.11: "Mummified warrior ro be given dignified burial on African 
soil: the body that was stuffed and put on show as a tourist curiosity"). 
<cite>The Star</cite> the next day reported the "Final rest for ancient 
African warrior" as a brief news flash from Sapa-AFP, while an editorial 
hailed the repatriation as "a positive step" that must lead to the 
return by the French government of the body of Sara Baartman who died in 
1814 (Oct 6, pp.2 &amp; 11). The Johannesburg <cite>City Press</cite> 
(Oct 8 p.2) carried a fuller Sapa-AFP story under the headline "Warrior 
home in Africa after 170 years".</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Gaborone Botswana Guardian of October 6 reported "Joy, 
sorrow greet El Negro's arrival", and told of people's shock and horror on 
seeing that the body on view had been reduced to just a clean skull. 
<cite>Mmegi/The Reporter</cite> (Oct. 6 p.1: "Controversy sees El Negro 
to his grave") carried a front-page photo of some of the thousands who 
flocked to see the body overnight on October 4th-5th lying in state in the 
Civic Centre, only to see a bare skull in a box. An editorial stressed that 
El Negro was being buried rather than permanently exhibited in Botswana 
out of African respect for the dead (p.14). The Francistown <cite>Voice</cite> 
(Oct.6 pp.1 &amp; 2: "Home at last" by Victoria Massimo), like editorials 
in other Botswana newspapers and <cite>The Star</cite>, put in a special word 
of thanks to Dr Alphonse Arcelin whose years of effort, at great personal 
sacrifice, resulted in the repatriation of"El Negro".</p>



<p>Comments from the public continued to appear in the newspapers for two 
weeks after the re-burial. Gaborone's <cite>Mmegi Monitor</cite> of October 10th (p.4) 
carried an interview with Dr. Arcelin, "ready to soldier on". An article 
below echoed the words of the presiding minister at the funeral: "Lord 
take from our hearts the anger we feel at what has been done to this body." 
A special feature in the Botswana Guardian (Oct.13, pp.10 &amp; 12), by Lekoko 
Kenosi, referred to "Our collective wrong". Spain had humiliated the human 
remains as a "nigger" on display but can Africans claim to be free of 
delusions of superiority and racial/ ethnic prejudice? <cite>Mmegi/The Reporter</cite> 
(Oct. 13, p.16) carried a comment by Busiswe Mosiieman claiming "A Cape 
Town museum displays stuffed humans" [referring to plaster-casts in the 
South African Museum]. A letter written to the Johannesburg <cite>Mail and Guardian</cite> 
(Oct.13, p.29), which assumed the body was that of a "Bushman",  condemned 
the hypocrisy of Botswana, because live rather than dead "Bushmen" are 
treated with contempt "on my friend's ranch in Botswana".</p>




<p><cite>Mmegi Monitor</cite> of October 17th was full of comments. Modirwa Kekwaletse 
(p.7) told how El Negro was the buzz-word at a wedding in Serowe. People 
were asking did not the child (ngwana) have any relatives to bury him. "El 
Negro" has also become, at least for the time being, a common nickname among 
young people. The columnist Sentinel Motlhokomedi in (p.14) wanted a 
stadium or a road named after El Negro. Sandy Grant on the next page objected 
to the body having been publicly displayed: was our curiosity somehow more 
justified that the Spanish we condemn as degrading? The Gaborone 
<cite>Botswana Gazette</cite> of October 25th carried two further comments. 
An e-mail from B.R. Lekabe demanded a full apology from Spain to Botswana. 
Gustin Bantu objected to the National Museum of Botswana displaying the 
sitting skeleton of a woman from the archaeological site at Toutswe a 
thousand years ago. The Gaborone <cite>Sunday Tribune</cite> of October 29th carried 
a photo of a strangely dressed man whom students had dubbed "El Negro" (p.1)</p>

<hr width="50%" align="left">
<p>The contents of the Spanish press are as yet unknown to us, but the most 
graphic reporting in English was by Rachel Swarms of the 
<cite><a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a></cite>, 
which was quoted at length in the <cite>Botswana Guardian</cite>. This is how she 
described  the overnight "lying in state" of El Negro.</p>
<div class="report">
<blockquote>
<p>...as the blazing afternoon faded into moonlit night, hundreds of people 
waited for hours to view the remains and to try, somehow, to right the wrongs 
of history by paying respect to a stolen ancestor and a wandering soul.</p>

<p>Construction workers stood in line with drills in their hands. Mothers 
carried groceries and babies. There were businessmen in suits, students 
in baseball caps and old women leaning on canes. Some sang the national 
anthem and waved flowers. But when it came time to see him, most people 
walked solemnly in single file and peered quietly through a tiny glass 
window in the polished coffin.</p>

<p>There lay his remains, though all that could be seen through the glass 
was a skull with empty eye sockets and broken teeth.</p>

<p>But Didimalang Keakopa Bukha, a nurse, did not flinch. Instead, she 
struggled to recognize the lines of his cheekbones and the breadth of his 
brow. "He has got a small forehead like me," said Mrs. Bukha, 44, her 
voice breaking. "This part of southern Africa where they say he is from, 
I have kin there. And when I saw him, I saw a person. Not a skull -- a 
human being.</p>

<p> "I felt like crying because of the belief that he might be related to me. 
 And it makes you wonder, how many people have been stolen like this?" </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Swarms quoted Tickey Pule, the director of the Botswana National Museum, 
saying she sees the return of El Negro as "a stepping-stone toward the 
repatriation"  of many other remains back to Africa: Pule added: "This 
is our past. These remains and artifacts are part of Africa. Our history 
is incomplete when it is [over] there."</p>

<p>Then there was the funeral itself:</p>
<div class="report">
<blockquote>
<p>Soldiers in white gloves carried the coffin and serenaded
it with their bugles. And the crowd sang mournful hymns, their
voices rising and falling in the morning still.</p>

<p>In a speech, the foreign minister, Lt. Gen. Mompati Merafhe,
summed up a continent's sentiments: "Today, 170 years later, we are
gathered here not only to re-enter the body in African soil where
it likely belongs, but also to cleanse that act of desecration,
restore the dignity of a common ancestor, to appease the spirits of
Africa and, above all, to correct a wrong which has no statute of
limitations."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The grave site in Tsholofelo Park, Gaborone, lies on the north side 
of the city. The grave is marked on the grass simply by four white 
posts linked by chains. People come at weekend to see the grave. Some 
throw a coin on it, to wish El Negro a peaceful rest at last. It has 
been suggested that the park should re-named after El Negro.</li>

<li>If you look back at the city centre from Tsholofelo Park, and indeed if 
you look towards Gaborone from the Airport and the north, you see the 
Kgale Hills in the background. For many years people have remarked on 
the odd shape of the hills in that profile, like a face staring upwards 
out of the Earth. A forehead on the right, a nose in the middle, and a 
chin on the left. Nobody has previously been able to give a name to 
this person. Perhaps we can do so now.</li>

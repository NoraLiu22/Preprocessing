It has been occupied almost continuously since. In the Middle Ages many of the caves were deepened and turned into strongholds during the wars of that time. In recent times the lower caverns were used as dwellings for farm owners and their staff, and the whole area has now been turned into displays for tourists to see how their ancestors lived."><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="window-target" content="_top" ><meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> </HEAD><BODY><br><br><center><h2><b><A HREF ="changes.html">Recent additions, changes and updates to Don's Maps</A></b></h2></center><center><br /><!-- CSS file for site and menu --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/layout.css" /><link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" href="https://www.donsmaps.com/favicon.ico"></center><center><script type="text/javascript"><!--//--></script></center><!-- Menu down Left Hand Side --><div class="left_menu">Navigation<ul ><li><a class="normal" href="abeltasmantrack.html">Abel Tasman Track in New Zealand</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="kimberleyart.html">Aboriginal Art of the Kimberleys</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginalrockart.html">Aboriginal art on the Northern Tablelands of NSW</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="aboriginals.html">Aborigines of Australia</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="pataudtools.html">Abri Pataud Tools</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="raymonden.html">Abri de Raymonden</a></li><li><a class="normal" href="mihisalisburyaccess.html">Access to Mihi Gorge and to Salisbury Waters below the junction with  Mihi Creek </a></li><li><a class="normal" href="loess.html">Achenheim -

It has been occupied almost continuously since. In the Middle Ages many of the caves were deepened and turned into strongholds during the wars of that time. In recent times the lower caverns were used as dwellings for farm owners and their staff, and the whole area has now been turned into displays for tourists to see how their ancestors lived. It is open every day during the summer season from 10.00 hours to 20.00 hours.

Prat, on a road to  a stone quarry, where a cartwheel which ran over it in the muddy rut where it lay unfortunately amputated the head and left hand which were not recovered. The material of the object is of amber calcite, slightly translucent,  measuring 92 mm in height. Aurignacian flint was found 150 metres from the statue, in a  quarry. It is estimated to be 25&nbsp;000 years old.<br /><br /> A female figure carved in a graceful profile, arms raised, held under the breasts. The head and torso are fractured. The legs are short but massive and bent in a kneeling position. A hole made between the lower legs could perhaps be used to insert a stick to hold the statue upright, or so that it might be used as a pendant. <br /><br />The abdomen and buttocks are protuberant, and the back is arched. There is, between the Tursac and Sireuil venuses an undeniable kinship of style, pose and material.<br /><br />Photos and text adapted and translated from: http://www.culture.gouv.fr/ <br /><br /></p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><img src="images23/rocdecazellemap.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="839" height="578" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />  Map of the Roc de Cazelle area, showing le Goulet, where the statuette of Sireuil was found, as well as the quarry mentioned,  about a kilometre upstream along the Petite Beune from Roc de Cazelle.  <br /><br />Photo: IGN</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p><!-- <a href="images3/vezerenoayla.gif" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images3/vezerenoaylasm.gif" alt = "Vezere Map" width="507" height="600" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a>      --> <a href="vezereclickarchaeology.html" title="Click to see larger image on a new page, clickable"><img src="images31/vezereill2014.10.04.gif" alt = "Vezere Map" width="800" height="973" align = "left" hspace = "10" vspace = "5"></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Map of   sites in the V&eacute;z&egrave;re Valley of France, including Roc de Cazelle. <br /><br />If you click on the map you will see a larger map with the ability to click on the sites marked with a red dot  and get further information. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock</p><br /><br clear = "left"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleaerial.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleaerialsm.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="447" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br /><br /><br />In this aerial shot we can see the top of the cliff of Roc de Cazelle on the left of the photo.

If a hide is suspended above the level that flames can reach, it will not burn, but will still get hot enough to boil water or a hunter's stew, though the hide does distort somewhat with repeated use.   <br /><br />Note also the bead work on the woman's head. Beads were very time consuming to make, and were a display of wealth. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0279.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0279.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Being able to knap flint as the man at the back is doing, for spear heads and other tools such as engravers (burins) and scrapers was a very necessary skill for all hunters, although some who had particular skill bartered their best pieces for other goods.<br /><br />In addition, as shown here, hides were a basic commodity that were used for a multitude of purposes, from curtains to clothes, just as today, and the preparation of both hides and flint tools was a part of normal daily routine, though perhaps by different members of any particular group. <br /><br />The spears resting against each other are of the thrown type, much thicker and heavier than the ones which were launched from a spear thrower or atlatl, a superior method of hunting game. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0283.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0283.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />This shows the method of using a spear thrower or atlatl. The spear is very light and whippy, which is important for it to be thrown accurately and for a long distance. <br /><br />Normally it would be fletched with feathers, not bare as shown in this example. Note also the cloak over the head, and the deer antlers attached to  the top of the cloak, used as camouflage so as not to scare the game unnecessarily. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0280.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0280.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />This young man, dressed for the hunt about 12&nbsp;000 years ago, also has a cloak with antlers, but is carrying an invention best adapted for forest hunting - the bow.  <br /><br />As the ice ages came to an end about 10&nbsp;000 to 12&nbsp;000 years ago, the forests which replaced much of the open grasslands typical of the ice ages grew ever larger in extent, and developed thicker understories, and the bow was better adapted for these tighter spaces. In addition, the bow is able to shoot further, faster, and more accurately, although as a hunter increases in strength he or she should swap to a bigger bow with a greater draw strength, which means making a new weapon. <br /><br />In contrast, the one atlatl or spearthrower can be used by anyone, or by the same hunter as he or she becomes stronger - or weaker! - and they are easier to make well. A bow is, in its ultimate form, a very complex hunting weapon. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0284.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0284.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />The results of the hunt had to be prepared carefully for storage, as there was no refrigeration, at least in summer, which could get quite warm, even in the ice ages. Methods included drying and smoking over a fire, or in winter by cutting into smaller portions and leaving outside, but protected from carnivorous animals, in shade and freezing conditions. Normally the fish would be cleaned of their guts and scales before preparing for storage. <br /><br />In colder climates such as the steppes of Siberia, smaller portions of large animals could be buried in holes dug in the permafrost, but this was not an option in this part of France. <br /><br />The man on the right appears to be gutting the pig, but this is normally done in the field as soon as the pig is killed, to make the carry home weight lighter, unless the entrails are going to be used for other purposes, in which case no time must be lost getting it home before spoilage occurs.  <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0285.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0285.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="300" height="400" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Here a flint knapper plies his craft in front of a tent made of poles and skins. Antler and bone were also important sources for tools and useful objects which could be shaped and decorated with the flint tools. <br /><br />When the hunters left the confines of the Vezere valley and the security of the abris or shelters of stone, they had to create their own semi-permanent dwellings from what was available. The abris would have been good to use, and were used by many people during the bi-annual migrations of reindeer through the valley to and from summer upland grazing areas, and the annual migration of salmon up the rivers, but the area could not support that sort of population year round. <br /><br />And in any case, the flatlands nearby well watered by the Dordogne and the Garonne  Rivers were a wonderful resource of grazing animals which prefer the open plains rather than river valleys and forests. <br /><br />Thus, they would have hunted horses, bison, aurochs and mammoths which did not often venture into the narrow valleys. <br /><br />That these animals were important to the inhabitants of the Vezere Valley and its tributaries is evidenced by the frequency with which they were depicted on the walls of their painted caves. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0286.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0286.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Hunters and gatherers often gained more of their calories from gathering than hunting. Hunters often return from a hunt with nothing for their efforts, whereas the fruits of the forest and the rivers are, though not as exciting to harvest, nor, when successful, do they provide such an abundance of food as, say, a mammoth, but are nevertheless more reliable. <br /><br />Here a woman gathers mushrooms in a leather basket. Baskets were made from whatever was available, and rushes and thin pliable creepers and thin branches of trees such as willow, sometimes split, were used, as well as birchbark when available. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0287.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0287.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Childbirth has always been a difficult and dangerous time for mothers. It is especially at times like this that a shaman or someone skilled in medicine and healing was invaluable for a group of hunter gatherers. Many women died in childbirth, and many children did not survive their first year. <br /><br /> Here a woman has come to term, and is being helped and comforted by a close relative. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0288.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0288.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Flint knapping is a somewhat solitary craft, the worker must concentrate and not be distracted by other things happening around the knapping area. For this reason, this flint knapper has set up a shelter devoted specifically to the task.  <br /><br /> It has the added advantage that the sharp waste flakes produced, or debitage, are well away from bare feet. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0290.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0290.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br /> The people of the abris or rock shelters of this area decorated their caves and abris (rock shelters) with paintings, carvings and engravings of the animals they saw and hunted in the area. In this recreation, a Cro-Magnon man from the area decorates a cliff face with an image of his hand, created in the negative by blowing a liquid mixture of pigment (often red ochre or black manganese dioxide) and water over the hand, which acted as a stencil. In order for this to stand out, the modern artist has outlined the hand in black, which was not usual. <br /><br />No doubt there were paintings such as this on exposed cliff faces, but twenty thousand years of the elements have erased all trace, except where engravings or carvings were made into the limestone. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0291.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0291.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br /> There were both the large cave bear and the (on average) smaller though still formidable brown bear in Europe in ice age times, though there is considerable variation in the sizes of these bears, depending on their habitat and available food.  <br /><br />Both would have  been dangerous and unpredictable animals to hunt with the weapons of the time, but would have provided a large amount of meat and fur for a successful group of hunters with the right weapons and techniques. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0292.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0292.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />A somewhat fanciful encounter between a bear and a Cro-Magnon man on a ledge reached by a well constructed ladder.   A spear might have been closer to hand and more effective against the bear, though not perhaps as dramatic!<br /><br /> The ladder is worth a closer look. The rails are made from one long straight tree, split down the middle, and it is both strong and light, and able to be raised to the level of the rock ledge when required, fairly easily constructed from available materials and  adequate for the task. <br /><br />The shelter on the ledge is constructed of hides attached to a light framework of poles, and no roof is necessary, since the ledge is overhung by the cliff above. It would have been quick and easy to make and to maintain when repairs were necessary, once the hides were put aside for the task. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0293.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0293.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Climbing the limestone walls must often have been necessary, either to examine ledges for suitability as living quarters, or when hunting for birds' eggs or robbing beehives. <br /><br />The sculptors of these figures have done a superb job, the figures are both anatomically correct, showing every muscle and tendon, coloured in a life-like manner and in very natural poses, with the impression that a moment in time has frozen, and we are able to look at events of ten or twenty thousand years ago as though they were happening before our eyes. <br /><br />Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0295.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0295.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Music and dancing were a normal part of the life of ice age people.

Bearing in mind how very ancient they are, with a date-range currently estimated, for most of them, at between ca. 20&nbsp;000 and 35&nbsp;000 years, these seemed remarkably advanced, and clearly justified careful reevaluation.</blockquote>    Photo and text above: http://www.flutopedia.com/dev_flutes_euroasia.htm<br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0296.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0296.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Some paintings and engravings, especially in caves, could only have been created after the construction of significant wooden platforms so that the artist could get high enough to reach the surface to be painted. <br /><br />In this case, as in many prehistoric examples in the area, the artist has first prepared the surface by removing the surface patina of grey lichen covering the exposed rock, to create a pure white surface for the painting. Many such images consist of a drawn outline later infilled with coloured pigments to complete the painting. <br /><br />Examples of the need for such constructions include many of the paintings of Lascaux, and the roof drawings of the Grand Ceiling of Rouffignac, both in the Dordogne&nbsp;/&nbsp;Vezere valley area, with the Grand Ceiling having a yawning pit beneath it, with slippery clay sides forming a funnel to another gallery far below. The artists had to first construct a wide circular platform, of which there was evidence in historical times, before attempting to complete the paintings. The resulting large platform, perhaps six metres across,  was then only one metre or so below the ceiling at that point, so the artist would have painted the frescoe on his back or on his knees. See below. <br /><br /> Photo: Don Hitchcock 2008</p><br clear ="all"><br /><br /><p> <a href="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0297.jpg" title="Click to see larger image"><img src="images23/rocdecazelleIMG_0297.jpg" alt = "Roc de Cazelle" width="400" height="300" hspace = "10" vspace = "5" align = "left"></a> <br />Life was usually short for men as well as for women.

For those people, here is a potted biography:<br /><br /></center>I live in New South Wales, Australia, and I am a retired high school mathematics/science teacher.<br /><br />The Donsmaps site is totally independent of any other influence. I work on it for my own pleasure, and finance it myself. I started before there was an internet, when I thought I could do a better job of the small map  on the end papers of Jean Auel's wonderful book, Valley of the Horses, by adding detail and contour lines,  and making a larger version. I have always loved maps since I was a young boy.<br /><br />I had just bought a black and white '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512K">fat Mac</A>' with a whopping 512 kB of memory (!), and no hard disk. With a program called '<A HREF ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint_(Macintosh)">Super Paint</A>' and a lot of double work (hand tracing first the maps of Europe from atlases, then scanning the images on the tracing paper, then merging the scanned images together, then tracing these digital scans on the computer screen), I made my own black and white map. <br /><br />Then the internet came along, the terms of my internet access gave me space for a small website, and Don's Maps started. I got much better computers and software over the years, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for example, and my maps became colourised and had more detail.  I did a lot of maps of the <A HREF ="indexmaps.html">travels of Ayla</A> from Jean Auel's books, and I gradually included other pages with more and more photos available from the web, and scanned from books or from scientific papers, since I was not happy with the quality generally available. I became very interested in the Venus figurines, and set out to make a <A HREF ="venusindex.html">complete record</A>  of the ice age ones. Along the way I got interested in archaeology for its own sake.<br /><br />In 2008 my wife and I went to Europe, and when we arrived in Frankfurt at sunrise after the 24 hour plane trip from Sydney, while my wife left on her own tour with her sister, they  visited relatives in Germany and Austria,  I went off by myself on the train to Paris.  Later  that afternoon I took a train to Brive-la-Gaillarde, found a hotel and caught up on lost sleep. The next morning I hired a car, and over the next four weeks visited and photographed many of the original archaeological sites in the south of France, as well as many archaeological museums. It was a wonderful experience.My wife and I met up again later in the Black Forest, and <A HREF ="radweg1.html">cycled down the Danube</A> from its source to Budapest, camping most of the way, a wonderful trip, collecting many photos, including a visit to <A HREF ="dolni.html">Dolni Vestonice</A> in the Czech Republic, as well as visiting the Vienna natural history museum. Jean Auel fans will realise the significance of that trip! <br /><br /> Luckily I speak French, the trips to France would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. No one outside large cities speaks English (or they refuse to). I was travelling independently, not as part of a tour group. I never knew where I was going to be the next night, and I camped nearly everywhere, except for large cities. I am a very experienced bushwalker (hiker) and have the required equipment - <A HREF ="bushwalkinggear.html">a one-man ultra lightweight tent, sleeping bag, stove, raincoat</A>, and so on, all of which I make myself for use here when I go bushwalking, especially down the beautiful gorges east of Armidale, though for Europe I use a commercial two person lightweight tent, since weight is not so much of a problem when cycling or using a car, and in any case my wife was with me when cycling, once along the Donau from its source to Budapest  in 2008, and again from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and then up the Rhine from K&#246;ln to the Black Forest in 2014, both of which were memorable and wonderful trips. <br /><br />In 2012 we went to Canada for a wedding and to visit old friends, and I took the opportunity to visit the wonderful Museum of Anthropology at the  University of British Columbia, where I took many photographs of the items on exhibit, particularly of the superb display of artefacts of the  <A HREF ="indexnorthwestcoast.html">First Nations of the Pacific Northwest</A>.<br /><br />In 2014 my wife and I did another European cycling tour, from <A HREF ="denmark01.html">Amsterdam to Copenhagen</A>, then from Cologne up the Rhine to the Black Forest, camping most of the way in each case, and  taking many useful photos in museums along the way, including the museums at Leiden, Netherlands, and <A HREF ="viking1.html">Roskilde</A>  in Denmark, and the National Museum in Copenhagen. Again, I later hired a car and did more photography and visited many more sites in France.<br /><br />In 2015 I made a lone visit to all the major museums in western Europe by public transport, mostly by train, and that went very well. I had learned a lot of German while travelling with my wife, who is a fluent speaker of the language, and of all the European countries, Germany is my favourite. I feel comfortable there. I love the people, the food, and the beer. Germans are gem&uuml;tlich, I have many friends there now.<br /><br /> I repeated the  visit to western Europe in 2018, to fill in some gaps of museums I had not visited the first time, because they were either closed for renovation the first time (such as the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris) or because I ran out of time, or because I wanted to fill in some gaps from major museums such as the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, M&uuml;nchen, the Louvre, the Petrie and Natural History Museums in London, the Vienna Natural History Museum, the important museum in Brno, and museums in northern Germany. It takes at least two visits, preferably three, to thoroughly explore the items on display in a major museum.  <br /><br />I spend a lot of time on the site, typically at least a few hours a day, often more. I do a lot of translation of original papers not available in English, a time consuming but I believe a valuable task. People and fate have been very generous to me, and it is good to give back a very small part of what I have been given. With the help of online translation apps and use of online dictionaries there are few languages I cannot translate, though I find Czech a challenge!<br /><br />I will never be able to put up all the photos I have taken, each photo needs a lot of research, typically, to put it in context on the site. I do not have enough time left, life is short and death is long, but I am going to give it a good shot!<br /><br />Life has been kind to me, I want for nothing, and  am in good health. Not many in the world are as lucky as I am, and I am grateful for my good fortune.<br /><br />My best wishes to all who read and enjoy the pages of my site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center>May the road rise up to meet you.<br />May the wind be always at your back.<br />May the sun shine warm upon your face;<br /><!--The rains fall soft upon your fields;<br />-->And may rain on a tin roof lull you to sleep at night.<br /><br /><!-- <A HREF ="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</A> --></center><!--<center><A HREF ="http://www.donsmaps.com/sitemap.html">  Site Map </A></center>--><br /><center>Webmaster: Don Hitchcock</center><br /><center>Email: <A HREF="mailto:don@donsmaps.com">don@donsmaps.com</A><!--   or  <A HREF="mailto:hitchcock.don@gmail.com">hitchcock.don@gmail.com</A></center> --><br /><br /><br /><br />  <center>     Website last updated Monday 29 April 2024    </center></div><script type="text/javascript"> </script><script type="text/javascript"> </script> </BODY></HTML> contentType 9 text/html url 46 https://www.donsmaps.com:443/rocdecazelle.html responseCode 3 200

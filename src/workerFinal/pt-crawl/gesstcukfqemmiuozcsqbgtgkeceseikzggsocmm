Economic growth has long been associated with increased demand for resources, and the world economy is expected to continue to grow. There are different ways of addressing this <strong><a href="/en/topics/in-depth/sustainability-challenges">sustainability challenge</a></strong>. </p><p>Production and consumption systems vary significantly across Europe.<strong> <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/agriculture-and-food">Food</a>, <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/energy">energy</a> and <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/transport-and-mobility">mobility</a> systems</strong> account for much of Europe’s <strong>pressures </strong>on the environment and health but are also a <strong>foundation for our well-being</strong>. The way we produce food or energy requires <strong>key resources</strong> like <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/water">water </a>and<a href="/en/topics/in-depth/land-use"> land</a> and often generates <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/pollution">pollution</a>, and greenhouse gases, affecting <a href="/en/topics/in-depth/environmental-health-impacts">human health</a> as well as <a href="/en/topics/at-a-glance/nature">nature</a>. </p><p><strong>Consumers </strong>can play a role in shifting consumption patterns, whereby reducing pressures linked to consumption. But sustainable consumption can only be achieved when sustainable products are produced and presented as viable options to consumers, and ultimately disposed of. These require systemic changes. </p><p>Overall, global and European trends point to <strong>continuing sustainability challenges</strong> but also to <strong>opportunities for positive change</strong>. For example, while <strong>new technology</strong> might save resources and alleviate environmental pressures, it can also increase energy, and natural resource demands. In this context, European policies like the <strong>European Green Deal</strong> and its circular economy packages aim to make production more efficient, save resources and facilitate more sustainable consumption. </p></div></div></div><div class="ui bottom attached segment tab"><div id="Key facts" class="tab-name"><div tabindex="0" role="tabpanel" id="tab-pane-fa515f0c-9ab0-493c-b4cd-58a32dfaae0a"><p>Our assessments and indicators show the latest trends related to Europe&#x27;s production and consumption. </p><ul role="list" class="ui bulleted list"><li role="listitem" class="">Europe’s consumption patterns are unsustainable.

across the continent. Production also includes agriculture, which is significant in terms of both its scale and the associated pollution risks. </p><p>The processes involved in providing the goods that we use range from simple assembly operations to complex industrial activities involving toxic and persistent chemicals. All of these activities result in some kind of emissions. Therefore, production can be a significant source of pressure on the environment — with the potential to cause serious pollution if not carefully managed.</p><div class="styled-callToActionBlock primary right has--align--right has--theme--primary align styled"><div class="block call-to-action align right"><a class="ui button primary" title="">Read more in zero pollution report</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="styled-dividerBlock"><div class="ui hidden section divider"></div></div><div class="columns-view"><div class="ui twelve column grid column-grid"><div class="six wide computer twelve wide mobile six wide tablet column column-blocks-wrapper"><h2 id="what-about-europes-consumption" data-block="37097051-df78-4d62-84cd-e7f81d4f2085"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="/en/topics/in-depth/production-and-consumption#what-about-europes-consumption"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="2em" viewBox="0 0 36 36"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M27.1318,7.333 C24.4028,4.604 19.9618,4.604 17.2328,7.333 L12.9898,11.576 C11.8428,12.723 11.1288,14.248 10.9778,15.871 C10.8228,17.541 11.2708,19.211 12.2378,20.576 C12.4818,20.919 12.7278,21.213 12.9888,21.475 C13.7848,22.271 14.7778,22.868 15.8608,23.202 C16.5498,23.415 17.2548,23.519 17.9518,23.518 C19.7808,23.518 21.5598,22.804 22.8888,21.475 L23.9498,20.414 L22.5358,19 L21.4748,20.061 C20.1648,21.371 18.2388,21.842 16.4498,21.291 C15.6668,21.049 14.9778,20.635 14.4038,20.061 C14.2218,19.879 14.0478,19.668 13.8698,19.418 C13.1778,18.443 12.8588,17.249 12.9688,16.056 C13.0768,14.896 13.5868,13.808 14.4038,12.99 L18.6468,8.747 C20.5958,6.798 23.7688,6.798 25.7178,8.747 C26.6568,9.687 27.1748,10.942 27.1748,12.283 C27.1748,13.623 26.6568,14.878 25.7178,15.818 L27.1318,17.232 C28.4488,15.915 29.1748,14.157 29.1748,12.283 C29.1748,10.408 28.4488,8.65 27.1318,7.333"/><path d="M25.0107,16.5254 C24.2147,15.7294 23.2217,15.1324 22.1387,14.7984 C19.6417,14.0284 16.9477,14.6894 15.1107,16.5254 L14.0507,17.5864 L15.4647,19.0004 L16.5247,17.9394 C17.8357,16.6294 19.7587,16.1554 21.5497,16.7094 C22.3337,16.9514 23.0217,17.3644 23.5957,17.9394 C23.7777,18.1214 23.9527,18.3314 24.1307,18.5824 C24.8217,19.5564 25.1417,20.7514 25.0317,21.9444 C24.9237,23.1034 24.4137,24.1924 23.5957,25.0104 L19.3537,29.2534 C17.4047,31.2024 14.2317,31.2024 12.2817,29.2534 C11.3427,28.3134 10.8247,27.0574 10.8247,25.7174 C10.8247,24.3774 11.3427,23.1214 12.2817,22.1824 L10.8677,20.7684 C9.5507,22.0854 8.8247,23.8424 8.8247,25.7174 C8.8247,27.5924 9.5507,29.3504 10.8677,30.6674 C12.2327,32.0314 14.0257,32.7134 15.8177,32.7134 C17.6107,32.7134 19.4027,32.0314 20.7677,30.6674 L25.0107,26.4244 C26.1567,25.2774 26.8717,23.7524 27.0227,22.1294 C27.1777,20.4594 26.7297,18.7894 25.7617,17.4244 C25.5177,17.0814 25.2717,16.7874 25.0107,16.5254"/></g></svg></a>What about Europe&#x27;s consumption?</h2><p>The EU&#x27;s <strong>Eighth Environment Action Programme</strong> calls for the EU to significantly reduce by 2030 its consumption footprint — the environmental and climate impacts that result from EU citizens’ consumption. </p><p>This footprint <strong>decreased only slightly</strong>, by around 4%, between 2010 and 2020.

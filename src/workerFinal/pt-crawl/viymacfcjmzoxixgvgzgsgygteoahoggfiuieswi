<p align="left">
Implementers of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf">PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata</a> now have a set of tools to support their PREMIS implementations in the <a href="http://pim.fcla.edu/">PREMIS in METS Toolbox</a>.  The Toolbox works with standalone PREMIS documents and with PREMIS elements embedded within METS documents.
</p>

<p align="left">
The Validate tool will validate a PREMIS document against the PREMIS schema and return a conformation message or list of errors.  It will validate a METS document against the METS schema and also against set of rules for PREMIS in METS best practice encoded in <a href="http://www.schematron.com/">Schematron</a> (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2006).  Best practice follows the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/guidelines-premismets.pdf">Guidelines for Using PREMIS With METS for Exchange</a> (September, 2008).
</p>

<p align="left">
The Convert tool will take a PREMIS or METS document as input.  Given a PREMIS document, it will generate an output METS document containing the PREMIS elements according to best practice.  The user can specify whether to put all PREMIS elements in a single METS digiProvMD section, or distribute the elements into digiProvMD, rightsMD, and techMD sections. Given a METS document containing PREMIS elements, Convert will generate a stand-alone PREMIS document.
</p>

<p align="left">
The Describe tool takes any digital file as input and generates its description in a PREMIS document.  Describe invokes the DAITSS 2 Description Service which in turn uses DROID for format identification and JHOVE for characterization.  General file metadata including format, file size, checksum, creator, create date, and inhibitors is supplied, as well as format-specific metadata for JPEG, JP2 and TIFF images (MIX), WAVE and AIFF (AES-X098B), ASCII, UTF8 and XML (TextMD), and PDF (DocMD).  The PREMIS document generated by Describe can then be submitted to the Convert tool to create a METS document if desired.
</p>

<p align="left">
The PREMIS in METS Toolbox joins a growing repertoire of tools available from the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS Maintenance Activity website</a>.  It was coded by Francesco Lazzarino and Marly Wilson at the Florida Center for Library Automation under contract to the Library of Congress (LC).  LC is the maintenance agency for both PREMIS and METS.

</p>
<img src="images/euscreen%20logo.png" alt="EUscreen Logo" width="220" height="66" />
<p align="left">
<a href="http://www.euscreen.eu/">EUscreen</a> is a Best Practice Network, co-funded by the eContentplus programme of the European Commission. The major objective of EUscreen is to stimulate the use of content from television archives and advance active engagement with the cultural memory of Europe. The three-year project started in October 2009. By 2012, the EUscreen portal will provide free, multilingual online access to over 30,000 digital objects related to the history of television of Europe, enriched with contextual information. The content will also become accessible though the <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/">Europeana</a> portal, the online collection of millions of digitized items from European museums, libraries and archives. The project consortium consists of 27 partners (archives, universities and technology providers) from 19 European countries. The co-ordination is in the hands of Utrecht University, Institute of  Media and Culture Studies. EUscreen builds on the results of its predecessor, the <a href="http://www.videoactive.eu/">Video Active</a> project, that managed to offer online access to 10,000 content items. 
</p>


<p align="left"><b>Main Issues to be Addressed</b><br />
Although many archives are digitising their analogue collections and more and more material becomes available online, access to audiovisual archives remains fractured and scattered. This is due to the lack of interoperability (both at the level of metadata and semantics), the non-existence of proven scenarios for the use of audiovisual material, the complexity of rights issues and the lack of contextualisation. EUscreen addresses these issues by building a network of key stakeholders and technology providers to provide  multilingual and multicultural access to television heritage. EUscreen develops long-term solutions to rights issues and supports user-led demand and interest for services and content, including the development of use case scenarios for different contexts, notably research, learning, leisure and creative reuse.
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Aggregators for Europeana</b><br />
EUscreen is one of the main audiovisual content aggregators for Europeana. Europeana provides cross-domain access to cultural heritage content coming from museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual collections across Europe. Aggregating content from thematic portals (such as EUscreen) is key to the success of Europeana. There are thousands of cultural heritage institutions in Europe and the central Europeana Office in The Hague will never be able to ingest content from all these individual institutions. Other European audiovisual content providers include EFG (European Film Gateway) and DISMARC. EUscreen is closely collaborating with EFG in particular. EFG brings together 21 partners from 15 European countries and aims to provide access to 790,000 digital objects, including films, photos, posters, drawings, audio and text documents. 
</p>

<p align="left">
<b>User Requirements and Software Development</b><br />
In the first months of the project, ample time and effort was invested to define the user requirements and draft the functional specifications of the portal. The Technical University of Athens coordinates the technical development of the portal. This work is executed in close collaboration with Noterik, the European Broadcasting Union, the University of Arts and Design Helsinki and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. Key components of the portal include:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Content and Metadata Ingestion web service, providing tools to establish and exploit the semantic alignment of metadata schemata that content providers use to annotate their items, to a common machine understandable schema. </li>
	<li class="spacetop">The Metadata Export service that supports exporting of the aggregated metadata to several established standards for metadata mediation. Primary showcase is the transformation of the aggregated content to the Europeana Semantic Elements schema and the deployment of an OAI-PMH repository to facilitate harvesting by Europeana. </li>
	<li class="spacetop">A EUscreen developed and implemented 'server-less' front-end APIs approach where a javascript/flash proxy system handles the communication with the back-end services. The result will be a front-end system that can be 'installed' on any plain html web server without any need for server-side technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">
The EUscreen platform will be launched in January 2011. Please visit <a href="http://www.euscreen.eu">www.euscreen.eu</a> to keep informed on current developments.

</p>

<p align="left">
The Content Lifecycle Integration Framework (<a href="http://www.hull.ac.uk/clif/">CLIF</a>)  project was set up to look at a real-world problem.
</p>

<p align="left">
At the heart of meeting institutional needs for managing digital content is the need to understand the different activities that the content goes through, from planning and creation to disposal or preservation.  Digital content is created using a variety of authoring tools.  Once created the content is often stored somewhere different, made accessible in possibly more than one way, altered as required, and then moved for deletion or preservation at an appropriate point.  A number of different systems can be involved at different stages: one of these may be a repository.  To embed repositories in the content lifecycle, and prevent them becoming yet another content silo within the institution, they thus need to be integrated with other systems that support other parts of this lifecycle.  In this way the content can be moved between systems as required, minimising the constraints of any one of them.
</p>

<p align="left">
CLIF is examining the management of the lifecycle of digital content from creation through to disposal or preservation across system boundaries. It is carrying out this examination through the integration of the Fedora digital repository system with two other systems used within the HE sector in the UK and abroad, Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server (MOSS) and Sakai, to enable the movement of content between them as required.  All three systems are used to manage digital content, and each addresses different overlapping parts of the content lifecycle.
</p>

<p align="left">
The project started with a use case study and a literature review and has now defined an initial architecture for the work.  The CLIF developers are currently working on the transfer of content to and fro between Fedora and Sakai on the one hand, and Fedora and MOSS on the other.  Once this basic work is complete, more complex interactions involving richer workflows, more complex metadata and more complex content will be considered.
</p>

<p align="left">
The CLIF project, which runs until March 2011, is a collaboration between <a href="http://www.hull.ac.uk/acs/">Academic Services at the University of Hull</a>  and the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iss/cerch/">Centre for e-Research at King's College, London</a>;  it is funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a>).

</p>

<p align="left">
The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) Library at the University of London houses the world's greatest concentration of scholarly works on Asia, Africa and the Middle East. It contains an estimated 1.8 million items, many of them rare, written in hundreds of languages. Library treasures include a 9th century Tibetan prayer book, priceless Japanese scrolls, original maps of Africa drawn by the 19th century explorer David Livingstone and the first known writings in the Aboriginal language.
</p>

<p align="left">
But with more than 25,000 new books being added each year, the Library is running out of room. As SOAS approaches its first centenary, it is embarking on an ambitious plan to transform the Library into a modern, truly global resource. This &pound;12m project will see the Library transformed into a modern learning environment.  A shift towards electronic resources will make it easier to source information and transform the learning experience of all users.

<p align="left">
The Centre for Digital Africa, Asia and the Middle East (CeDAAME) has been up and running at SOAS since September 2009. It is an 18-month project funded by JISC with the goal of developing a school-wide strategy for digitisation in support of learning, teaching and research at SOAS. 
</p>

<p align="left">
This has involved carrying out an audit of a sample of SOAS materials in order to build up a picture of the extent and scope of SOAS' collections. A consultation exercise with staff, students and external users has been carried out, the results of which will form the basis for drawing up a strategy.  
</p>

<p align="left">
This strategy will be central to safeguarding the future status of SOAS as a leading research institution in the UK and abroad. The strategy will allow SOAS to take its place as a world player among other hybrid libraries in the newly emerging digital landscape. This will be carried out by centralising the currently ad-hoc nature of digitisation across the School and establishing policies for managing ever increasing amounts of born-digital material.
</p>

<p align="left">
A co-ordinated programme of digitisation will offer numerous benefits. Access to material will be increased and will be more flexible: users of SOAS Library will be able to access digitised collections from home at times that suit them, and as a result SOAS collections will be promoted to a wider audience. The digitisation of core teaching materials will also improve provision for distance learning. Selecting fragile items for digitisation (in conjunction with carrying out necessary conservation work) will preserve material for the future and ensure access to otherwise restricted material. By providing digital surrogates it is anticipated that hard-copy volumes may be stored more efficiently to maximise space. A key aim of the centre is also to establish networks with other institutions. This will allow SOAS to build awareness of existing digitisation initiatives targeting material that is complementary and adds value to SOAS collections. 
</p>

<p align="left">
As a centre of expertise, CeDAAME is also responsible for supporting the ongoing digitisation of material from SOAS collections and, as well as managing existing projects, is also actively engaged in sourcing funding for new projects. Around 20,000 photographs have been digitised to date and around 10,000 of those are already available to view online at: <a href="http://digital.info.soas.ac.uk/">digital.info.soas.ac.uk</a>. More information about CeDAAME and current and proposed digitisation projects is available on the CeDAAMe website: <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk/cedaame/">http://www.soas.ac.uk/cedaame/</a>.

&lt;terrier&#064;dcs.gla.ac.uk&gt;</i>

</p>

<p align="left">
The University of Glasgow has announced the version 3.0 release of the open source <a href="http://terrier.org">Terrier</a> information retrieval (IR) platform. Terrier includes full-text indexing and search functionalities, and represents an effective and efficient platform for performing extensive IR research and developing large-scale search applications. Terrier is distributed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL).
</p>

<p align="left">
Particular features of Terrier 3.0 include several state-of-the-art effective retrieval and query expansion approaches (e.g., parameter free Divergence from Randomness weighting models), in addition to field-based weighting models (e.g., BM25F, PL2F), and proximity weighting models (e.g., MRF, pBiL2).
</p>

<p align="left">
For IR research and experimentation, Terrier is an excellent choice, with support for all standard Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) research test collections up to the current ClueWeb09 corpus of Web documents. For such multi-terabyte scale corpora, the built-in MapReduce indexer based on Apache Hadoop technology allows easy horizontal scaling of the indexing process.
</p>

<p align="left">
Terrier has been used by research groups worldwide, for both mono-lingual and multi-lingual IR research. Moreover, Terrier has exhibited top retrieval performances on TREC (English), CLEF (European), and FIRE (Indian) test collections. As an example, the University of Glasgow have developed models for Web search, relevance feedback, enterprise expert search, blog search and entity search built on the retrieval approaches of the Terrier platform. In addition, the platform can easily be integrated into applications needing search technologies, such as digital library solutions.
</p>

<p align="left">
Terrier is written in Java, and follows a component-based architecture, whereby developers and researchers can integrate new retrieval approaches by "plugging in" at various stages in the retrieval process. Moreover, to support the growing community using Terrier, there is a popular forum on the Terrier website, as well as an issue tracker.
</p>

<p align="left">
We believe that Terrier 3.0 represents a major improvement to the platform, and a promising framework for developing research or application search services.

Project Compass, launched by <a href="http://www.imls.gov/news/2009/091009.shtm">OCLC WebJunction and the State Library of North Carolina</a>, features four regional summits where state library officers are sharing best practices on meeting the workforce needs of their communities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;South Carolina State Library representatives highlighted an <a href="http://www.worksc.org/">IMLS-supported Web site</a> for workforce recovery. It provides library staff across the state with a well-organized and consistent set of resources for patrons, providing them with a number of pathways toward employment. The 'Next Steps' section, for example, provides resources for starting a small business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Along with a <a href="http://tntel.tnsos.org/jobs.htm">job and career resource Web site</a>, the Tennessee Public Libraries featured an impressive array of partnerships that it has leveraged for staff training, workforce development tools, and promotion of library services. Partners include the Tennessee Department of Labor &amp; Workforce, the University of Tennessee, Adult Education Centers, and State Technology Centers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After the showcase, the Atlanta group identified three key needs:</p>

   <ol type="1" start="1">
	<li>Training for library staff to meet the needs of job seekers.</li>
	<li>Strategies for funding, including information about how to maximize support, gain visibility, and minimize budget cuts.</li>
	<li>A Web site with centralized resources on workforce recovery provided by the state library. For examples of state Web sites that have been established, please go to: <a href="http://wiki.webjunctionworks.org/index.php/Workforce_Resources">http://wiki.webjunctionworks.org/index.php/Workforce_Resources</a>.&quot;</li>

<p class="orange">In age of Social Media U.S. libraries encourage users to choose privacy</p>

<p><b><i>National public awareness campaign helps library patrons understand privacy rights in the digital age</i></b></p>

<p>April 27, 2010 &#151; &quot;In the past, privacy could be protected by closing a curtain, sealing a record, or simply choosing not to share one's information. But in today's digital environment, more and more of our personal information exists online, available and vulnerable to anyone with prying eyes and access to a computer. This makes individual control over one's personal information a vital and compelling concern for Americans today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The American Library Association's (ALA) Office for Intellectual Freedom has established Choose Privacy Week, May 2-8, to help libraries work with their communities around these complicated but vital issues. Privacy has long been a cornerstone of library services in America and a freedom that librarians defend every day....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Librarians have a long history of protecting the rights of people to read, learn, and be curious, because the freedom to read and receive ideas anonymously is at the heart of individual liberty in a democracy. This makes libraries ideal places for people to think and talk about privacy today.&quot;</p>

<p>March 29, 2010 &#151; &quot;The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library now offers a beta mobile Web site at <a href="http://m.library.illinois.edu">http://m.library.illinois.edu</a>.  The site provides access to a core set of basic library services customized for successful use on mobile devices, including the ability to search the Library's catalog, find Library locations and hours, access additional databases with mobile interfaces, and text librarians.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The University Library established a working group that was charged with planning, developing, and maintaining an information access environment for Library users who have mobile devices, including iPhone and BlackBerry phones.  If the beta mobile site is well-received by the public, it can serve as the platform for delivering a growing array of mobile services in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The mobile Web site includes access to the Text a Librarian service, also a new pilot initiative of the Library.  University Library users may text a librarian with questions through the mobile site or SMS text 217-686-4361 from any mobile phone that supports text messaging.  Standard charges apply, based on the user's mobile phone plan with the account provider, for both messages sent and received.

<p class="orange">First-ever National Study: Millions of People Rely on Library Computers
for Employment, Health, and Education</p>


<p>March 25, 2010 &#151; &quot;Nearly one-third of Americans age 14 or older &#150; roughly 77 million people &#150; used a public library computer or wireless network to access the Internet in the past year, according to a national report released today. In 2009, as the nation struggled through a recession, people relied on library technology to find work, apply for college, secure government benefits, learn about critical medical treatments, and connect with their communities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The report, <i>Opportunity for All: How the American Public Benefits from Internet Access at U.S. Libraries</i>, is based on the first, large-scale study of who uses public computers and Internet access in public libraries, the ways library patrons use this free technology service, why they use it, and how it affects their lives. It was conducted by the University of Washington Information School and funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Institute of Museum and Library Services....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The library's role as a technology resource has exploded since 1996, when only 28 percent of libraries offered Internet access. Today, almost all public libraries offer visitors free access to computers and the Internet....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The report's findings are based on nearly 50,000 surveys &#150; including 3,176 from a national telephone survey and 44,881 web survey responses &#150; from patrons of more than 400 public libraries across the country.

<p class="orange">Despite Flat Budgets, State Library Agencies Invest in Technology Services</p>


<p>March 18 2010 &#151; &quot;Despite the lack of real growth in their budgets in
recent years, state library agencies are working strategically to assist
library professionals and local libraries to meet patrons' needs,
according to State Library Agency Service Trends: 1999-2008, a new
research brief by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)
<a href="http://www.imls.gov/pdf/Brief2010_02.pdf">http://www.imls.gov/pdf/Brief2010_02.pdf</a>. Limited resources are being
shifted as libraries services are being redefined. Over the past 10
years, for example, real dollar expenditures on statewide database
licensing more than doubled, reaching a total of &#36;65.8 million in 2008.
These databases provide all library users access to a wide range of
online resources, such as reference sources for homework, job search and
training tools, and specialized magazines and newspapers. This finding
indicates one way that state library agencies are making the most of
limited resources...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Twenty-first century patrons expect more technology resources in
schools, public libraries, colleges, and universities. While current and
future information technologies provide exciting new opportunities to
extend library services to patrons across the U.S., they require
significant investment and coordination, the study found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;IMLS will continue to document the trends highlighted in this report to
better understand how changes at the state level affect the quality of
library services to the public.&quot;</p>

<p class="orange">Expert meeting in Paris revised the concept of knowledge societies</p>

<p>March 15, 2010 &#151;  &quot;UNESCO organized an expert meeting on 'Knowledge Societies: The way forward' on 1 and 2 March 2010, in its Paris Headquarters. The purpose of the meeting was to refine UNESCO's strategy directed towards building inclusive knowledge societies. A group of global experts from academic, civil society, and governmental sectors participated in discussions on the concept of knowledge societies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In light of recent technological and social developments, there was a need to revise the concept of knowledge societies. In doing so, the expert meeting targeted three main objectives:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>to operationalize the concept of knowledge societies: identify mechanisms for putting the theory into practice, towards UNESCO's goal of building inclusive knowledge societies;</li>
	<li>to develop tools to qualify and quantify the concept of knowledge societies: provide analysis for anticipating trends and emerging challenges to support Member States in developing adequate strategies and policies, particularly in the area of communication, education, sciences and culture; and</li>
	<li>to identify concrete activities for UNESCO to propose at the national level: learn from ongoing and recent efforts to translate the knowledge societies concept into reality on country levels.&quot;</li>
</ul>


<p>&quot;Participants of the meeting suggested a number of key actions, including:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>enhancing strategic partnerships with multiple actors, ensuri</li>
	<li>, at the same time, a complementary "delivering as one" UN approach;</li>
	<li>producing more in depth studies about ongoing, holistic national efforts to develop knowledge societies, in order to learn more about key elements of successful processes and failures;</li>
	<li>raising the awareness of decision makers and Member States and assisting them in the implementation of the knowledge societies concept, including through the tools developed by UNESCO.&quot;</li>
</ul>

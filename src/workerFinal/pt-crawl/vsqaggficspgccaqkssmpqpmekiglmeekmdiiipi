  </div><br />&nbsp;<p align="justify">Roderick MacKinnon as a child liked the outdoors, hiking, fishing etc., he felt an affinity with the natural world but said he was excited by both physical and natural sciences.&nbsp; As a kid in Junior High School (11-12 years old) he was sent on a science enrichment course for a month where he was given a small microscope and loved it.&nbsp; He says he enjoys taking things apart to see how they work rather putting things together.</p><p align="justify">In this interview MacKinnon goes&nbsp;on to discuss Max Perutz and then his own research.&nbsp; He says his course into science was quite sequacious and he really didn`t start science until he was about 30 as he had a strong interest in athletics first.&nbsp; Initially, he went into Medicine but did not think it was science, as although it is important he found it more about pattern orientation than anything else.&nbsp; MacKinnon qualified in Medicine but realised at the age of 29 that he couldn`t do it.&nbsp; One thing that helped him get through medical school was studying mathematics which he still does (applied maths in general but not always).&nbsp; He left Medicine and went into science&nbsp;as he had a interest in Channels (electro-physiology protein ion channels) which he found fascinating.&nbsp; At Brandeis University in Chris Miller`s Laboratory he was asked to study potassium channels.&nbsp; The channel field at that time was separate from all the rest of bio-chemistry as people tended to be electrical engineering types and when MacKinnon was&nbsp;doing his&nbsp;post-doctoral studies he says we did not think about proteins but talked about resistence.&nbsp; Ion protein channel conductivity was very well known by the electrical signature but they were not known&nbsp;by their molecules in fact nobody had seen or crystallized one&nbsp;as it was very difficult.&nbsp; Even now the total number of membrane protein structures solved is less than 100.&nbsp;&nbsp;About a&nbsp;quarter of the genome is encoding membrane proteins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is technically difficult as they are unstable and the membrane has to be removed in detergent&nbsp;and kept.&nbsp; He thinks that it is amazing the they have been crystallized at all but now entire viruses have been crystallized.&nbsp; </p><p align="justify">In 1995 he decided to leave a professorship at Harvard to dedicate his time to new structures of potassium channels.&nbsp; He&nbsp;moved to Rockefeller University where he started working with his wife Alice who is a chemist.&nbsp; As he knew that he had a lot to learn he decided that he needed to work alone and thought that the change of environment would focus his attention.&nbsp; He needed money to do the work and the Rockerfeller offered a start-up package under the director of Torsten Wiesel who invited him to visit.</p><p align="justify">MacKinnon`s message to students is don`t get caught up - just follow your interests and work hard and you`ll become an expert.&nbsp; He agreed that working off the main stream is where some of the most important work exists.</p><p align="justify">On world issues and social responsibility he says `yes` he does feel it but at present is delaying it as he feels too young and wants to solve another good problem.&nbsp; He wants to concentrate for a few more years on his science.&nbsp; He says that humanity is faced with huge difficulties with population growth and the management of our planet.&nbsp; We have done such a bad job he says and thinks that when he can contribute more (or perhaps help young scientists) he will make the transition.&nbsp; At present he would not do a good job he thinks as he is not a good&nbsp;multi-tasker.&nbsp; Management of our planet requires some great leadership he says.&nbsp; </p><p align="justify">There has been such a growth in information on science and scientists he thinks have done a poor job conveying this to the public.&nbsp; Many people are afraid of science and scientists have a bad image.&nbsp; People he thinks need to realise that&nbsp; science is beautiful - it is like looking a sunset or feeling the breeze.&nbsp; Science is a way of appreciating the world around us.&nbsp; Some people believe that science takes away and the destroys the&nbsp;mystery in life.&nbsp; MacKinnon says that the mystery grows as we get to know more science.</p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><span class="bold_title">Links To Other Information:</span><p /><strong><a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2003/mackinnon-lecture.html">Nobel Lecture</a></strong><br />Link to MacKinnon`s Nobel Lecture</div>

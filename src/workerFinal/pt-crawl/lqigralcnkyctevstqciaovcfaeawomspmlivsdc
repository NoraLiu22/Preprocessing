  <blockquote>  <!--sino date 1 January 2008-->

There is an element of incongruity in describing as a requirement or condition,
compliance with which is required in the terms and
conditions of employment
<i>as a casual teacher</i>, a requirement that in order to access higher levels
of salary, <i>one must cease to be a casual teacher</i> and obtain permanent
appointment.<sup><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[88]</a></sup><i>
</i></blockquote><p>In contrast to this restrictive approach, which regarded the
two classifications as discrete, the minority felt that it was necessary
to go
beyond the value of the work to consider their rights and obligations. It is
impossible not to agree with Kirby J (dissenting)
that the interpretation
adopted by the majority is 'narrow and antagonistic' to the beneficial and
purposive approach mandated by
the
legislation.<sup><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[89]</a></sup> The majority's
deference to the employer's historic and gendered categorisation of casual and
permanent staff, despite repeal of
the statutory exception, had the effect of
defining the discrimination complaint 'out of
existence.'<sup><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ironically, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ, in the very course of articulating
a restricted meaning for the phrase 'requirement or condition',
noted that the
legislation is to be given a broad rather than a technical
meaning.<sup><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[91]</a></sup> They state that it was
wrong to ask 'what was the requirement or condition' rather than 'whether the
perpetrator engaged in a proscribed
form of
discrimination&#8230;'<sup><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[92]</a></sup> It seems
to me that the requirement or condition must be established before ascertaining
whether it exerted a discriminatory effect
or not. In this case, the permanency
requirement disproportionately impacted on the complainants <i>because</i> they
were women. </p>
<p>The restrictive interpretation adopted by the majority avoids consideration
of the gendered nature of casual employment and why women
'choose' to do it, or
feel duty bound to accept it. The majority position is striking in light of the
fact that all but two of the
complainants had formerly occupied permanent
positions in the teaching service. In most cases, the explanation for the
transfer to
the casual category was simple. They had resigned to care for their
families, a sacrifice not expected of their male
partners.<sup><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[93]</a></sup> When the women
subsequently sought to return to the teaching service, permanency entailed them
accepting a posting anywhere in the
State, but they were not free to relocate
because of family commitments. The social norm prevailed that they follow their
partner's
place of work and accommodate the needs of their families.
Accordingly, they accepted casual positions that were accessible to their
homes.
</p>
<p>The powerful norms that govern gender and familial relations, to which I have
adverted, have long shaped the employment conditions
of women. A positivistic
reading of the text of the ADA effectively sloughs off the historic
discrimination inhering within the differential
pay scales. The narrow stance
adopted by the majority contrasts markedly with the earlier judgment of
<i>Banovic</i>, in which Justices Deane, Dawson and Gaudron determined that past
discrimination could not be used to justify conduct that continues
to
discriminate unfairly against
women<i>.</i><sup><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[94]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While <i>Amery</i><sup><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[95]</a></sup><i>
</i>adopts a technocratic approach in the interpretation of a requirement or
condition that appears to be neutral and depoliticised, its
meaning is shaped by
the juridical hermeneutic world which, in turn, is shaped by the shifts and
turns within the broader socio-political
<i>nomos</i>. This includes the
neoliberal swing in favour of flexible work that is casual and precarious but
which suits employers because it
cuts costs. Such work is overwhelmingly
feminised.<sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[96]</a></sup> Precarious work
suggests a greater deference to employer prerogative, as we see in <i>Amery</i>;
workers' rights, including the non-discrimination principle, are no longer in
the ascendancy.<sup><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[97]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Focusing on the value to the employer of contingent or precarious work at the
expense of employees also reifies the conventional public-private
dichotomy of
liberalism, as it cloaks the reasons why women predominate in this type of work
and how it contributes to systemic discrimination
in the workplace. While the
normative universe comprises an unstable mixture of imperial and paideic
elements, and various shades
in between, neoliberalism, in conjunction with the
prevailing neoconservatism, has legitimated the contemporary imperial turn in
adjudication on issues of sex discrimination. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading160"></a><b>V	Courts of Appeal and Unreasonableness </b></h3>
<p>The concept of reasonableness, invariably the most vexed element of the
indirect discrimination test, also deserves comment as it
represents a classic
instance of the abdication of responsibility by the legislature, which I have
identified as a marked characteristic
of anti-discrimination legislation. This
familiar standard is left entirely to judges to interpret and invest with
meaning within
a particular context, or it is otherwise devoid of meaning. For
this reason, Julius Stone described reasonableness as a concept that
is
'slippery and even treacherous'.<sup><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[98]</a></sup>
Its open-ended character allows judges to determine whether to look to the
future or the past and, in so doing, whether to favour
the perspective of the
complainant or the respondent. Some legislation now includes criteria to which
the courts should pay particular
heed when addressing the reasonableness
test,<sup><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[99]</a></sup> which gives the
appearance of objectivity and certainty. While such mechanisms serve to obscure
the subjectivity of the judge, the
leeways of choice are inescapable. This is
the case whether the onus of proving reasonableness is on the complainant or
whether it
has shifted to the
respondent.<sup><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>The test of reasonableness is frequently the sticking point in indirect
discrimination complaints, and there is a growing body of
case law around the
term,<sup><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[101]</a></sup> although this is not
necessarily illuminating. The longevity of a practice can endow it with a veneer
of reasonableness, which may
well have been a factor in <i>Amery</i>,<i>
</i>although reasonableness was discussed only by Gleeson CJ (Callinan and
Heydon JJ agreeing). Gleeson CJ was of the view that while
the nature and
quality of a permanent officer and casual teacher may be identical, the issue of
deployability in a large geographical
area could not be
ignored.<sup><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[102]</a></sup> He determined that
it had not been shown to be unreasonable to pay the two categories
differently.<sup><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[103]</a></sup> Thus, even if
this case had not foundered on the identification of the requirement or
condition with which the complainants were
expected to comply, the application
of the reasonableness standard may well have proven fatal.</p>
<p>I propose to consider two appellate decisions that turned on the issue of
reasonableness in the domain of sex discrimination to illustrate
the extent and
power of the hermeneutic role at the authoritative level: <i>Commonwealth Bank
of Australia v Human Rights &amp; Equal Opportunity Commission
</i>('<i>Commonwealth
Bank</i>')<i>,</i><sup><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[104]</a></sup><i> </i>a
decision of the Full Bench of the Federal Court, and
<i>Schou</i>,<sup><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[105]</a></sup> a decision of
the Victorian Court of Appeal. These decisions may be fruitfully considered
alongside <i>Amery</i> because they involve indirect discrimination arising from
maternity and caring responsibilities that disproportionately impact on
women.
In both cases, the complainants failed because of the favouring of a managerial
perspective over the interests of the complainants,
which had the effect of
upholding the status quo. </p>
<p>It might be noted that both cases would probably have gone to the High Court
had the complainants been able to afford it. On the basis
of <i>Amery</i> and
other recent discrimination
cases<i>,</i><sup><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[106]</a></sup><i> </i>however,
it would not necessarily have been advantageous for them. In these cases, the
leaning towards retention of an imperial world
would not only have implicitly
privileged corporate power and Benchmark Men, the unencumbered subjects of
liberal legalism,<sup><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[107]</a></sup> but
managerial prerogative would also have been privileged over workers' rights.
Recourse to the convenient catch-all concept of
'reasonableness' authorises the
legitimation of this ordering by judges.</p>
<p>While reasonableness is normally an issue for an initial hearing, I have
chosen to focus on appellate decisions, where the jurisgenerative
role is
respected and well established. Reasonableness confounds the fact/law
distinction, since a matter of fact cannot be determined
in the abstract,
although, as a matter of law, reasonableness is characterised as requiring an
objective test &#8213; a weighing
up of the evidence. Although reasonableness
may be a question of fact, it is appellate judges who are charged with its
review. They
say it is to be determined by 'weighing all the <i>relevant
</i>factors' (emphasis
added).<sup><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[108]</a></sup> Relevance is a
category of illusory reference, no less than reasonableness, which further
underscores the undeniable play of judicial
subjectivity, despite asseverations
to the contrary. </p>
<p>'Reasonableness' is a trope that allows discrimination against women to be
justified and legitimated by the powerful today, no less
than in the past,
albeit less overtly. As a bona fide instrument within the hermeneutic tool kit
of discrimination law, reasonableness
selectively instantiates an imperial
approach to issues of gender in the workplace that sustains the separation of
the public and
private spheres of liberal legalism. The message is that caring
for young children belongs in the private sphere, a responsibility
that should
be clearly disconnected from the world of work. This approach is immune to the
contemporary rhetoric of flexible work
and work/life balance. The imperial view
is that the workplace is a domain where employer prerogative reigns supreme,
free from the
'unreasonable' demands of maternity leave and sick children.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading178"></a><b>(i)	</b><b><i>Commonwealth
Bank</i></b><sup><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[109]</a></sup></h3>
<p>This complaint was instituted by the Finance Sector Union on behalf of more
than 100 female employees of the Commonwealth Bank. The
bank engaged in a major
restructure, which entailed the loss of about 7 500 staff, as a result of which
employees had the option
of either taking a redundancy package or applying for a
new position. It was argued that the restructure disproportionately impacted
on
women because those on extended family leave, including maternity leave, did not
have access to redundancy packages. So far as
the new positions were concerned,
employees had to be available to take them up within four weeks of appointment.
For women on maternity
leave, including those who have either recently had a
baby or are about to give birth, this is unlikely to be practicable. The
inability
to apply for a superior position instantiates the idea of women as
primary carers but secondary workers in accordance with the prevailing
neo-conservative ethos.</p>
<p>While HREOC found in favour of the union in the first
instance,<sup><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[110]</a></sup> the Federal Court
held on appeal that the condition was not unreasonable and reversed in favour of
the bank.<sup><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[111]</a></sup> The reasoning of
the court was that HREOC had failed to take sufficient account of the fact that
women on maternity leave were entitled
to a comparable position when they
returned from maternity
leave.<sup><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[112]</a></sup> HREOC had acknowledged
the commercial imperative, but rejected the necessity of the four-week
requirement. The effect was that the
complainants missed out on the possibility
of superior positions, which they might have been prepared to take up after the
elapse
of more then four weeks. In this case, we see judicial deference to
corporate power and convenience. </p>
<p>Tarrant is critical of the approach of the Federal Court for what she terms
its adoption of the 'package deal
approach'.<sup><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[113]</a></sup> That is, rather
than focus solely on the effect of the detriment arising from the requirement or
condition; the court takes into
account any other benefit allegedly conferred
which, in this case, was the availability of comparable positions: 'the primary
mischief
in the package deal approach is that it puts it in the power of the
respondent unilaterally to assess and determine the needs of
a
complainant.'<sup><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[114]</a></sup></p>
<p>As Tarrant points out, there is no authority in <i>Waters v Public Transport
Corporation</i><sup><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[115]</a></sup><i> </i>for
the 'package deal' approach, despite the Federal Court's purported reliance on
its interpretation of reasonableness in <i>Commonwealth
Bank</i>.<sup><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[116]</a></sup> However, I would
take issue with Tarrant regarding the power of the bank as the primary mischief
here, for this power would have
been of little avail without the crucial
legitimating role of the judges of the Federal Court. As with
<i>Amery</i>,<sup><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[117]</a></sup> the judges were
able to relegate the principle of equality for women at work and the values
underpinning sex discrimination legislation
to the background under the rubric
of reasonableness. </p>
<p>The Finance Sector Union ran the case on behalf of the complainants but it
was not prepared, or could not afford, to pursue an appeal
to the High Court.
Because of the high cost of representation and the risk of losing the case,
which could entail paying the bank's
costs as well as its own, the male members
of the union were reputed to be opposed to an appeal. This chance element in
litigation
points to the way that the victors, invariably corporate entities
with power and resources, are able to write sex discrimination
jurisprudence in
their own image. The homologous relationship between these corporate players and
the judiciary induces judges to
privilege the arguments of respondents over
those of complainants. It also means that any successful utilisation of
anti-discrimination
legislation in the wake of a restructure would be virtually
impossible.<sup><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[118]</a></sup> </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading194"></a><b>(ii)	</b><b><i>Schou</i></b><sup><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[119]</a></sup></h3>
<p><i>Schou </i>is the second case I consider in respect of reasonableness. It
represents yet another variation on the theme of the woman worker as
carer, and
highlights the difficulty of combining work and family in light of the competing
values within the normative universe,
despite the prevalence of the rhetoric.
Indeed, as a manifestation of the changing discourse from the rights of
individual workers
to what is best for families, the alleged discrimination is
based, not on sex, but the relatively recent ground of status as a parent
or
carer.<sup><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[120]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The complainant was a Hansard reporter who had worked for the Victorian
Parliament for seventeen years. Because she had a chronically
ill child, she
sought to do her transcription work at home for two days per week when
Parliament was sitting (sometimes until 2:00
am), which was possible with a
computer and a modem to which the employer had initially agreed. The requirement
or condition with
which the complainant was unable to comply was that she
attended work full-time at Parliament House on sitting days. Neither the
conceptualisation of the requirement nor the issue of proportionality were
contentious, as it was accepted that a higher proportion
of people without
parental or caring status could comply with the requirement. As with
<i>Commonwealth Bank</i>,<sup><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[121]</a></sup> the
focus was on the reasonableness of the attendance requirement. The Victorian
Civil and Administrative Tribunal found
(twice)<sup><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[122]</a></sup> that the requirement
was not reasonable as there was a practical alternative to working in situ,
which was working online at home,
and awarded the complainant damages of more
than $160 000.</p>
<p>Once again, we find a restrictive approach being adopted by appellate courts
before, first, a single judge<sup><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[123]</a></sup>
and, secondly, a majority of the Full Bench of the Victorian Supreme
Court.<sup><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[124]</a></sup> While Gaze presents a
trenchant critique of the judgment of Harper J in the first appeal to the
Supreme Court for his less than adequate
grasp of the elements of indirect
discrimination,<sup><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[125]</a></sup> a similar
charge could be levelled against the majority judges in the subsequent appeal to
the Full Bench.<sup><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[126]</a></sup> Both Harper
J, sitting as a single judge, and Phillips JA (Buchanan JA agreeing) of the Full
Bench held respectively that the focus
of the reasonableness provision should
have been directed to the attendance requirement without regard to the modem
proposal. In
the disaggregation of issues, we see the same<i> </i>narrow
technocratic interpretation as in
<i>Amery</i><sup><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[127]</a></sup> although, in
this case, particularly so far as Phillips JA (Buchanan JA agreeing) was
concerned, there was little attempt to disguise
the preference for managerial
prerogative. Phillips JA found it 'almost inconceivable' that the attendance
requirement could be regarded
as not reasonable as a matter of law, since it was
authorised by the employment
contract.<sup><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[128]</a></sup>  Common law,
however, was not the end of the matter as the complainant had entered into an
individual workplace agreement that guaranteed
to promote 'flexible and
progressive work practices and reasonable changes in the way work is
organised'.<sup><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[129]</a></sup> This agreement
was ignored by the Supreme Court judges, which would seem to discount the
legislative requirement that 'all the relevant
circumstances of the case be
taken into consideration' in weighing up the meaning of
reasonableness,<sup><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[130]</a></sup> a position
supported by the High Court judges in
<i>Waters.</i><sup><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[131]</a></sup> Callaway JA,
in a brief dissent, rejected the narrow view, holding that the question of
reasonableness was a matter of fact for the
Tribunal. </p>
<p>The semiotics of 'choice' and 'flexibility' has changed our understanding of
work. This language has been deployed by neoliberals
to place responsibility on
individual employees for the course of their lives and to deflect attention away
from prevailing social
structures and the profit-making
imperative.<sup><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[132]</a></sup> Choice was
invoked in <i>Amery</i> to explain that the unwillingness of the complainants to
accept teaching positions outside nominated geographical areas. While the
Anti-Discrimination Tribunal recognised the socially constructed nature of this
choice in that it was not merely a 'personal' or
'lifestyle' choice, the
propensity of conservative judges to individualise it deflects attention away
from the structural factors
that require women to place their families first in
determining work location. Hence, Buchanan JA in <i>Schou</i>, suggested that
the modification of a general requirement to accommodate one person's special
needs is not what the indirect provisions
of the Act are
about.<sup><a name="fnB134" href="#fn134">[133]</a></sup> Equality as sameness
was also stressed by Harper J: 'the Act forbids discrimination. It does not
compel the bestowing of special
advantage'.<sup><a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[134]</a></sup> This stance
virtually guarantees the failure of any complainant's case that entails any
accommodation of
difference.<sup><a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[135]</a></sup></p>
<p>Charlesworth has observed that there is a propensity to treat 'working mums'
as transient workers with little commitment to the
workplace.<sup><a name="fnB137" href="#fn137">[136]</a></sup> The secondary
worker status for women with children is a prominent strand of the <i>nomos
</i>and through <i>Schou, </i>together with <i>Commonwealth Bank </i>and
<i>Amery, </i>we can see the power of judges in keeping alive this imperial
construction. When a choice has to be made, there is an unwillingness
to find
that the interests of women workers with childcare responsibilities could
possibly take precedence over powerful institutional
and corporate interests. In
this way, the hermeneutic role of judges may be invoked to authorise the
evisceration of the promise
of sex discrimination legislation so as to retard
women's struggle for equality. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Heading218"></a><b>VI	 Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>The trajectory of sex discrimination cases shows a symbiotic relationship
between the socio-political climate and the adjudicative
norms of the day. There
is never going to be a precise congruence because of the ad hoc nature of
adjudication, such as which complainants
possess the fortitude to appeal and who
has the resources to do so. Despite the small numbers of heroic complainants,
the movement
away from an expansive and paideic view of the legislation to a
more restrictive and positivistic approach over two decades is discernible
in
appellate decisions. This has crystallised into what Justice Kirby refers to as
a 'hostile litigious environment in which claims
of the present kind are
typically litigated'.<sup><a name="fnB138" href="#fn138">[137]</a></sup> To some
extent, the change mirrors the shift from social liberalism to neoliberalism,
which has spawned an environment that is antipathetic
to social justice. A
similar observation could be made about the American Supreme Court. It was seen
as the champion of civil rights
under Chief Justice Warren
(1953-1969),<sup><a name="fnB139" href="#fn139">[138]</a></sup> but the
subsequent swing to the right saw the appointment of conservative judges under
Presidents Reagan, Bush Senior and Bush Junior,
together with the gradual
unpicking of the great civil liberties victories in terms of race and sex
discrimination.<sup><a name="fnB140" href="#fn140">[139]</a></sup></p>
<p>Today, legal aid for sex discrimination complaints and for civil litigation
generally (other than for some family law matters) has
contracted. The demise of
legal aid is another casualty of neoliberalism, with its assumption of a
user-pays philosophy.<sup><a name="fnB141" href="#fn141">[140]</a></sup> A law
firm could agree to act pro
bono,<sup><a name="fnB142" href="#fn142">[141]</a></sup> but it might hesitate
in view of the identity of a powerful corporate respondent with deep pockets.
The New South Wales Women's Advisory
Council, which advocated on behalf of the
34 women of non-English speaking background in <i>Banovic</i>, has been
abolished and there is no replacement body with access to ministers, as existed
in the 1980s. In <i>Amery</i>, while the State of New South Wales supported the
government department respondent's appeal to the High Court, it also agreed to
pay the complainants' costs. In the <i>Schou </i>case, a law firm ran the case
pro bono on behalf of the complainant to the Supreme Court. This firm was also
prepared to run an appeal
to the High Court provided that the State of Victoria
undertook not to sue for costs, but the Attorney-General declined to give this
undertaking.<sup><a name="fnB143" href="#fn143">[142]</a></sup> In <i>Amery
</i>and <i>Schou</i>, we see respondent Labor Governments in both New South
Wales<sup><a name="fnB144" href="#fn144">[143]</a></sup> and
Victoria<sup><a name="fnB145" href="#fn145">[144]</a></sup> undermining their
own anti-discrimination legislation as the political pendulum swings further to
the right.<sup><a name="fnB146" href="#fn146">[145]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Of course, access to the courts is by no means the end of the matter.
Inevitably, the power and resources of corporate respondents
determine the
course of the litigation and shape the jurisprudence that emerges, although the
extent of support that corporate respondents
currently receive from both
governments and courts encourages them to appeal. Such a climate does not bode
well for the advancement
of the non-discrimination
principle.<sup><a name="fnB147" href="#fn147">[146]</a></sup> Three sex
discrimination cases before the High Court in thirty years is not very many.
</p>
<p>In reflecting on why more race than sex cases have gone to the High
Court,<sup><a name="fnB148" href="#fn148">[147]</a></sup> Jocelynne Scutt
speculates that it is because race cases, such as
<i>Koowarta</i><sup><a name="fnB149" href="#fn149">[148]</a></sup> and
<i>Mabo</i><sup><a name="fnB150" href="#fn150">[149]</a></sup> were framed in
terms of property rights rather than human rights or
discrimination.<sup><a name="fnB151" href="#fn151">[150]</a></sup> While the
discourse of human rights has become more prominent in recent years, the
normalisation of sex discrimination has militated
against it being perceived as
a human rights violation. However, there has been a resiling from the
recognition of rights of all
kinds in favour of 'the good of the economy'. The
recent diminution of workers' rights is salutary, for there has been a
correlative
enhancement of employer prerogative which has augmented the burden
of proof confronting all complainants in discrimination
cases.<sup><a name="fnB152" href="#fn152">[151]</a></sup> In
<i>Amery</i>,<sup><a name="fnB153" href="#fn153">[152]</a></sup><i> </i>we see
deference towards the idea of respondents defining a requirement or condition in
their own interests that earlier courts warned
against.<sup><a name="fnB154" href="#fn154">[153]</a></sup> One of the express
aims of the SDA is to 'promote recognition and acceptance within the community
of the principle of the equality
of men and
women'.<sup><a name="fnB155" href="#fn155">[154]</a></sup> A narrow positivistic
reading of the indirect provisions effectively nullifies this principle of
equality underpinning the legislation.
Even in the case of direct
discrimination, the tendency is to recognise only those instances that lie close
to the surface.<sup><a name="fnB156" href="#fn156">[155]</a></sup> The judicial
propensity to slough off history and context effectively legitimates systemic
discrimination. </p>
<p>Judges always encounter leeways of choice between the imperial and the
paideic, but a neoliberal milieu with its promotion of market
values and moral
conservatism signals a turn to the right that is less likely to champion the
rights of women workers and the ideals
of gender equality. Judges, however, are
invariably more comfortable with the world maintaining norms of the past,
despite their
jurisgenerative role. The inclusion of open-ended standards like
'reasonableness', together with substantial lacunae within the legislative
texts, endorses the predilection in favour of the imperial turn. The
interpretive community is most comfortable with a positivistic
paradigm in which
justice is incidental.</p>
<p>One could go a step further and distinguish the earlier cases dealing with
the 'letting in' of women to non-traditional areas of work,
such as
<i>Wardley</i><sup><a name="fnB157" href="#fn157">[156]</a></sup><i> </i>and
<i>Banovic</i>,<sup><a name="fnB158" href="#fn158">[157]</a></sup><i> </i>from
the more recent cases, such as
<i>Amery</i>,<sup><a name="fnB159" href="#fn159">[158]</a></sup> <i>Commonwealth
Bank</i><sup><a name="fnB160" href="#fn160">[159]</a></sup> and
<i>Schou</i>.<sup><a name="fnB161" href="#fn161">[160]</a></sup> It might be
averred that 'letting in' a few women to non-traditional workplaces, when their
exclusion was egregious, is significantly
less destabilising than radically
challenging established work practices emanating from the old
master&#8211;servant relationship,
such as the employer's right to determine the
structure of the workplace, the site of work, and the terms and conditions of
employment.
Despite the legislative prescripts of anti-discrimination
legislation, the conservative view is that according gender equality to
women
with caring responsibilities in the public sphere is corrosive of the core
values at the heart of the normative universe. The
malleable hermeneutics of
adjudication allow judges to sustain benchmark masculinity by adopting an
imperial approach that is legitimated
by the rule of law. </p>
<p>The imperial approach represents an unstable position, however. Faith in the
rule of law demands the adoption of a paideic approach
towards
anti-discrimination legislation &#8213; at least some of the time. A changed
political climate may provide just the spur
that is needed.</p>

general principle of the anti-discrimination jurisdiction that each party bear
its own costs at the
tribunal level now being undermined in sexual harassment
complaints, if the complainant is unable to prove her case to the requisite
standard. For example, in <i>Prolisko v Knight (Anti Discrimination) </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2006/2046.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006]

the alleged conduct, not only had her complaint dismissed, despite
some
corroborating evidence, but was ordered to pay $10 000 towards the respondents'
costs. In another unsuccessful sexual harassment
complaint before the Victorian
Civil and Administrative Tribunal, the complainant was ordered to pay 50 per
cent of the costs and
disbursements of both respondents. See <i>Gonsalves v MAS

a decision of the Industrial Commission of

difference in the
tasks or responsibilities of teachers, whether permanent or
supply casual; see <i>Amery v New South Wales </i>(2001) EOC  93&#8211;130

a defence to a complaint of discrimination to argue

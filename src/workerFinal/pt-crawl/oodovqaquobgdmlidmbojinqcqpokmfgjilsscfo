<font size="+2">C</font>hadian handicrafts include carpets, woven mats, 
fabric, jewellery, wool rugs, beads, leather products and wood carvings.
Calabashes (a type of gourd) are shaped and engraved to serve many 
household purposes and to make musical instruments. The village of Gaoui,
a short distance from N'Djamena, is known for its fine pottery. Generally,
each village has its own distinctive shapes for water jars and pottery. <p>
<font size="+2">C</font>hadians enjoy listening to music. In the Sahel 
region, groups such as African Melody and International Challal have 
popularized music that combines traditional and electric instruments. 
Tibesti, another well-known group, plays <i>sai</i>, a type of music 
that draws on folkloric rhythms from the south of the country. Ahmed 
Pecos plays Sudanese-inspired guitar music. Cl&eacute;ment Masdongar 
is a leading Chadian musician and singer who performs in France.</td>

<font size="+2">T</font>raditional Chadian instruments include trumpets 
made from goat horns, the <i>kinde</i> (a variety of bow harp), the 
<i>kakaki</i> (a tin horn that can be up to three metres long) and the
<i>hu hu</i> (a stringed instrument that uses calabashes as loudspeakers). 
The Sara people of the south use whistles, balaphones (an instrument 
similar to a xylophone), a harp-like instrument and large <i>kodjo</i> 
drums. Kanembu music combines the sounds of a flute-like instrument and 
drums, while Baguirmian music features zithers and drums. Baguirmians 
also have a distinctive dance in which dancers wield large grain-pounding 
pestles and pretend to use them on another dancer.<p>
<font size="+2">C</font>had has produced several important writers. The
tales of Joseph Brahim Seid, including <i>Au Tchad sous les &eacute;toiles</i>
(1962) and the autobiographical <i>Un enfant du Tchad</i> (1967) are 
Chadian classics. Baba Moustapha, who died in 1982 at the age of 30, 
left several notable works, one of which, <i>Le Commandant Chaka</i> 
(published posthumously in 1983), denounces military dictatorships. 
Poetry is a popular form of expression in the north.</td>

<font size="+2">L</font>ive theatre in Chad is often satirical and performers 
poke fun at people in the news. The Cheikh Anta Diop theatre group is popular
and performer Haikal Zakaria, who plays the character "Commandant Al Kanto," 
is often featured on television.<br><br><br>

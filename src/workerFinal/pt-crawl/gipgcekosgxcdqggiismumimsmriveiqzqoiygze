The female narrator reads letters sent by fictional Sandor Krasna, writing from ‘another world’. The spoken word, synthesized sound and haunting visuals investigate relationships between developed and developing societies. Virtuoso editing and special effects conjure the disorientation of a world traveller, journeying through cultures, secret rituals and confusions of time.</p>

<p>“The consummate cine-essay, framed as reportage from a roving cineaste, built mainly from Marker’s observations of the ‘empire of signs’ that is modern Japan and the poverty endemic in Guinea Bissau. Entertainingly provocative speculations on the ‘post-political’ world, haunted by the piano music of Mussorgsky.” <strong>Tony Rayns</strong></p>

<p>“A treatise on travel, on history, on art and on life, Marker’s film unfolds like an epistolary novel in dialogue with itself. His virtuosity with the camera is matched by the brilliance of the montage.” <strong>Bruce Jenkins</strong></p>

<p>“The essay film par excellence. Sometimes philosophical, sometimes playful, always intriguing, always surprising.” <strong>Rainer Rother</strong></p>

This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors. This electorate spans experimental, arthouse, mainstream and genre filmmakers from around the world.

The female narrator reads letters sent by fictional Sandor Krasna, writing from ‘another world’. The spoken word, synthesized sound and haunting visuals investigate relationships between developed and developing societies. Virtuoso editing and special effects conjure the disorientation of a world traveller, journeying through cultures, secret rituals and confusions of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The consummate cine-essay, framed as reportage from a roving cineaste, built mainly from Marker’s observations of the ‘empire of signs’ that is modern Japan and the poverty endemic in Guinea Bissau. Entertainingly provocative speculations on the ‘post-political’ world, haunted by the piano music of Mussorgsky.” <strong>Tony Rayns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A&nbsp;treatise on travel, on history, on art and on life, Marker’s film unfolds like an epistolary novel in dialogue with itself. His virtuosity with the camera is matched by the brilliance of the montage.” <strong>Bruce Jenkins</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The essay film par excellence. Sometimes philosophical, sometimes playful, always intriguing, always surprising.” <strong>Rainer Rother</strong></p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Chris Marker","producer":"Anatole Dauman","writer":"","featuring":"Florence Delay, Alexandra Stewart"},"year":"1982","nameAndYear":"Sans Soleil (1982)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"tags":["Shop"],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":0,"sightAndSound":{"results":[{"position":59,"tied":false,"category":"critics"},{"position":72,"tied":true,"category":"directors"}],"voters":{"critics":[{"firstname":"Magdalena","surname":"Arau","slug":"magdalena-arau","name":"Magdalena Arau","sortName":"Arau, Magdalena","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Programmer","country":"Argentina","remarks":null,"url":"/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time/all-voters/magdalena-arau"},{"firstname":"Erika","surname":"Balsom","slug":"erika-balsom","name":"Erika Balsom","sortName":"Balsom, Erika","type":"critic","jobTitle":"Reader in Film Studies, King's College London","country":"UK","remarks":[{"type":"p","key":"All the usual disclaimers apply!

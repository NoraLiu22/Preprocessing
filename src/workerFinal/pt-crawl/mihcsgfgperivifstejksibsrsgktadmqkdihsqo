This is an expansion of our popular <a href="http://www.native-languages.org/names.htm">Native American Pet Names</a> 
fundraiser. A lot of people write to us asking for an American Indian translation from English for a tattoo, 
jewelry inscription, piece of artwork, story they're writing, grandfather's birthday cake, and so forth. In most cases you can 
make a translation to Indian languages yourself for free if you are willing to spend the time--check out our 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/linguistics.htm">Amerindian</a> index for a large number of 
language-related Internet resources including online American Indian-English dictionaries and lists of 
vocabulary words in Native American languages.

If you don't care to do this, though--it can take a long time to do Native American translation if you're not 
familiar with these languages and you don't already know which language you're looking for-- you can ask us and 
we'll do the translating for you, in exchange for a $10 donation to our 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/help.htm">nonprofit organization</a> 
(which will then be used to preserve and promote endangered Indian languages). The list of languages we can currently 
provide native translations for include Abenaki, Algonquin, Apache, Athabaskan, Bella Coola, Blackfoot, Caddo, Cherokee, 
Cheyenne, Chipewyan, Chippewa, Choctaw, Comanche, Cree, Creek, Crow, Dakota Sioux, Dene, Delaware, Haida, Hopi, 
Inuktitut, Lakota, Lenape, Maliseet-Passamaquoddy, Mesquakie, Mohawk, Mojave, Munsee, Muskogee, Navajo, Nez Perce, 
Nuxalk, Ojibway, Oneida, Osage, Pima, Potawatomi, Salish, Sauk, Seneca, Shawnee, Shoshone, Tohono O'odham, Tlingit, 
and Yaqui. We may also be able to translate an American Indian word from another language--
<A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">contact us</A> first if you have a different language in mind.
<BR><BR>
Please note that this is <U>only</U> a fun way to raise money for a good cause. <B>We will not give you or anyone 
else a "spirit name," nor will we bless you, the words, or whatever you are writing them on.</b> These requests are 
offensive to many Native Americans<b>;</b> please respect our beliefs and do not misrepresent our role in 
suggesting these translations. They are no different, spiritually speaking, than words you looked up in an English-Indian 
language dictionary. If you are looking for an American Indian name with spiritual significance, <U>please</u> talk 
to an elder in your community. No stranger can do this for you over the Internet, any more than you could get baptised 
over the Internet. Also, if you are planning on getting a tattoo, please be aware that using words as tribal tattoos is a 
modern practice, not a traditional one in any Indian tribe that we know of. If it is important to you to have a 
traditional style tattoo, please see Orrin's article on 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/tattoo.htm">Native American Tattoos</a> to learn more about that difficult quest. 
<BR><BR>
On the other hand, if you are looking for the translation of a word from English into Native American languages for a 
modern style tattoo or another creative but non-religious endeavor, then please fill out the form below. After you send 
it you will be prompted to make a $10 donation. If you prefer, you can also write down this information and send it 
along with cash or a check (made out to Native Languages of the Americas) to our postal address:
<BR><BR>
Native Languages of the Americas<br>
PO Box 385291<br>
Minneapolis, MN 55438
<BR><BR>
We will email you three possible Native American words or phrases that match your criteria, along with each word's 
meaning, language, and pronunciation, and you can pick the translation that appeals to you the most. Please note that 
some American Indian languages use modified European alphabets, so they may have diacritics (accent marks, or 
other notations above or below some of the letters). You're welcome to ignore these or even use a simplified spelling 
that looks better to you if you like. Except for <A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/cherokee.htm">Cherokee</a>, 
Native North American writing systems originally came from outside the community anyway.

<b>1. What are you planning to do with this word?</b> (Tattoo yourself, inscribe it in a ring, use it in a short story,<BR> 
spraypaint it on the walls of Alcatraz? :-D You don't have to answer this if you're providing the word yourself,<BR>
but it's hard for us to suggest good native translations to you if we don't know what they're for.)

<P>

<b>2. What word are you looking for, or would you prefer we just suggest a few Native American words with 
positive meanings?</b><BR>
(Note that verbs and abstract nouns are long and complex in many native languages--kinship terms or the<BR>
word for a kind of animal that inspires you are usually good bets for a short word for tattoos or artwork.)

<b>4. How concerned are you with the word's length?</b><BR>

<b>5. How concerned are you with being able to pronounce the word easily?</b><BR> 
(Some American Indian words have very different sounds than English and it will limit your options if the word<BR>
must be easy to pronounce in English.)
</font><br>
<input type="radio" name="Pronunciation" value="Any">Doesn't matter, this word will only be written not spoken<br>
<input type="radio" name="Pronunciation" value="So-so">Somewhat important, please give me a word I can learn to pronounce without much trouble<br>
<input type="radio" name="Pronunciation" value="Easy">Extremely important, I want readers to be able to figure out how to say this word without my help<br>

<input type="radio" name="Hurry" value="Yes">No, I need the words right away--please ignore my language and meaning preferences if it will get me the translation faster<br>

The system waswithout witness or controller, so God created a small-minded controller. God carefully avoided clueing in the small-mindedcontroller on the finer details of the theory of feedback controlsystems.<p>****** Even God was amused, and so ended the first day.<p>And God said, "Let the small-minded controller draw up a goalstatement." And behold, the small-minded controller identified thedesirable goals states for the system. And God thought it soundedpretty good.<p>******* And evening and morning were the second day.<p>And God said, "Let the small-minded controller determine correctionsand adjustments and engage in determining rules of guidance andcontrol." Unfortunately, a debate about the sanctions and punishmentsto be inflicted in the event of a rule violation pre-empted almost allof the third day.<p>******* And evening and morning were the third day.<p>And God said, "Let there be a university in which the small-mindedcontroller can envision system concepts and engage in discovering thedeeply hidden laws of feedback control theory." The small-mindedcontroller considered adjustment of rules and sanctions and moreintelligent alternatives to rules, and God saw that this was good.And God thought that it was even worth all of the adrenalin,serotonin, and endorphins he had to supply.<p>******* And so ended the fourth day.<p>And God said, "Let the small-minded controller's policies beimplemented with long-range vision and insightful strategies." Thesmall-minded controller considered insights and feedback loops andstate-space measurements and sampling theorems, and comparativeanalysis and simulation models. And God saw that this was very
ingenious and fruitful.<p>And so would have ended the fifth day, except for the unintentional
renewal of the debate about the choices amongst rules and sanctions.<p>******* On the sixth day the small-minded controller devised criteria
for classifying and assesing trajectories converging to the goal
states and the associated rates of convergence. This wasn't the thesis
topic that God had planned. God wasn't able to read the thesis,
however, because he had to take the afternoon off to create day and
night and heaven and earth and seas and plants and stars and trees and
seasons and years and sun and moon and birds and fish and animals and
human beings and the invisible emotional economy.<p>******** On the seventh day God rested and the small-minded controller
submitted his model and analysis. It turned out that the recommended
system model was nearly identical to the way that God had created the
world, so the small-minded controller gave thanks to God for his
implementation according to the integrated system model. There was,
however, some opinion expressed that humans should have been created
in the mimnetically reflected image of the small-minded controller's
recursive system model.<p>And God caused a deep agnosimnesia to fall upon the mode ...<p><p>

<br />
Article by Sean Reilly and Robert Tupelo-Schneck, <i>Corporation for National Research Initiatives</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-reilly</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> The Digital Object Architecture defines three primary components: an identifier system, metadata registries, and digital object repositories. The identifier system is the widely used Handle System and the CNRI metadata registries are now in use in several projects. This paper introduces the Digital Object Repository Server (DORS), the most recent instantiation of CNRI's repository work. DORS includes an open, flexible, secure and scalable protocol and software suite that provides a common interface for interacting directly with all types of Digital Objects. It has been implemented and tested as server software and provides a trustworthy network interface for invoking operations on objects. </p>

<br />
Article by Kristin R. Eschenfelder, <i>University of Wisconsin-Madison</i> and Grace Agnew, <i>Rutgers University</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-eschenfelder</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> This article describes the results of a survey investigating the use of technological protection measure (TPM) tools to control patron access to or use of digital cultural materials made accessible by U.S. archives, libraries and museums.  Libraries reported using a broader range of systems than archives or museums including repository software, streaming media servers, digital library software and courseware.  In terms of controlling access to collections, most respondents reported using IP range restrictions and network-ID based authorization systems. In terms of controlling use of collection items, respondents reported reliance on resolution limits, clips and thumbnails, and visible watermarking.</p>

<br />
Article by Dimitrios A. Koutsomitropoulos, Andreas D. Alexopoulos, Georgia D. Solomou, and Theodore S. Papatheodorou, <i>University of Patras</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-koutsomitropoulos</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> The wide availability of educational resources is a common objective for universities, libraries, archives and other knowledge-intensive institutions. Although generic metadata specifications (such as Dublin Core) seem to fulfill the need for documenting web-distributed objects, educational resources demand a more specialized treatment and characterization. In this article we focus on the use of learning-object specific metadata in digital repositories, as they are primarily incarnated in the LOM (learning object metadata) standard. We review relevant standards and practices, especially noting the importance of application profiling paradigms. A widespread institutional repository platform is offered by DSpace. We discuss our implementation of LOM metadata in this system as well as our interoperability extensions. To this end, we propose a potential LOM to DC mapping that we have put into use in DSpace. Finally, we introduce our implementation of an LOM ontology, as a basis for delivering Semantic Web services over educational resources.</p>

<br />
Article by Diane Hillmann, <i>Information Institute of Syracuse, Metadata Management Associates</i>; Karen Coyle, <i>kcoyle.net</i>; Jon Phipps, <i>JES &amp; Co., Metadata Management Associates</i>; Gordon Dunsire, <i>University of Strathclyde</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-hillmann</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> The Resource Description and Access (RDA) standard, due to be released this coming summer, has included since May 2007 a parallel effort to build Semantic Web enabled vocabularies.  This article describes that effort and the decisions made to express the vocabularies for use within the library community and in addition as a bridge to the future of library data outside the current MARC-based systems.  The authors also touch on the registration activities that have made the vocabularies usable independently of the RDA textual guidance. Designed for both human and machine users, the registered vocabularies describe the relationships between FRBR, the RDA classes and properties and the extensive value vocabularies developed for use within RDA.</p>

Article by Rose Holley, <i>Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program (ANDP), National Library of Australia</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-holley</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> In August 2008, tagging was implemented on articles that were full text searchable within the National Library of Australia's historic Australian Newspapers service. During the first year, 500 users created over 100,000 tags, 38,000 of which were distinct. The tagging was very successful and the National Library will be extending the tagging functionality to all of its other collections before the end of 2009. In this article, the tagging activity, behaviors and outcomes are analyzed and compared with other research on image tagging.</p>

Article by Marisa Ramirez, <i>California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo</i> and Gail McMillan, <i>Virginia Tech</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-ramirez</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> Information privacy is an important consideration when transitioning university collections from paper to electronic access. Yet the protection of &#151; and limits to &#151; student privacy regulations have rarely been addressed in the literature for online electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and its relevance to student work should be a consideration when widely distributing scholarship like e-portfolios, ETDs, and senior capstone projects. In this article, we share several campus approaches to FERPA and electronic student work.

Article by Richard H. Cyburt, Sam M. Austin, Timothy C. Beers, Alfredo Estrade, Ryan M. Ferguson, Alexander Sakharuk, Hendrik Schatz, Karl Smith, and Scott Warren, <i>Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA)</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-cyburt</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> The research area of nuclear astrophysics is characterized by a need for information published in tens of journals in several fields and an extremely dilute distribution of researchers. For these reasons it is difficultfor researchers, especially students, to be adequately informed of the relevant published research. In an attempt to address this problem, we have developed a virtual journal (VJ), a process for collecting and distributing a weekly compendium of articles of interest to researchers in nuclear astrophysics.  Subscribers are notified of each VJ issue using an email-list server or an RSS feed.  The VJ data base is searchable by topics assigned by the editors, or by keywords. There are two related VJs: the Virtual Journal of Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA VJ), and the SEGUE Virtual Journal (SEGUE VJ).</p>

Conference Report by Richard Lewis, <i>Goldsmiths College, University of London</i><br />
doi:10.1045/january2010-lewis</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> Funded under the AHRC/EPSRC/JISC e-Science in the Arts and Humanities Initiative, the e-Science for Musicology workshop held in Edinburgh in July 2009 brought together expert speakers in using computer technology in music scholarship and musicologist participants with little or no experience in such methods. During the course of the workshop, several techniques for dealing with music in computers were demonstrated and the participants were given the opportunity to comment on those techniques and discuss their wider implications for the discipline.</p>

doi:10.1045/january2010-morris</p>

<p class="contents"><i>Abstract:</i> Soon after the first major snowstorm of the season, 3,800 delegates to EDUCAUSE 2009 were greeted in Denver by warm temperatures and blue skies over the distant front range from November 3-6, 2009. With a national climate of shrinking IT budgets and increasing needs at institutions of higher education, many sessions and conversations centered around taking advantage of economies represented by new technologies such as cloud computing and distributed communication tools. Higher education IT professionals gathered at the Colorado Convention Center and simultaneously online to uncover "the best thinking in higher education."</p>

<p class="fcFont"><a href="http://swingle.miami.edu" class="fc">The Swingle Plant Anatomy Reference Collection</a> is a historical collection of plant anatomical microscope slides that were made early in the 20th century by Walter Tennyson Swingle (1871 - 1952), one of the twentieth century's foremost authorities on citrus plants.  After 50 years of service to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),  Swingle retired from the government and came to work for the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida.  It was during this stage of his life that Swingle began creating the Plant Anatomy Reference Collection from both cultivated plants as well as specimens collected during his travels.</p>

<p class="fcFont">Dr. Barbara Whitlock, University of Miami Department of Biology and the University Libraries collaborated to digitize and provide online access to selected images from Swingle's extensive slide collection.  The new online service features over 1,700 images from more than 250 species of plants collected from all over the world. The images are digitized photomicrographs of plants that were sectioned, stained, and permanently mounted to a glass slide. Although the earliest specimen was collected in 1769 (Limonia acidissima L., accession number SV221) and obtained by Swingle, the majority were collected in the early 20th century. Animations were also created by transforming images of consecutive microtome sections into individual "frames" using JavaScript, so that time represents movement up the axis of the plant structure. The result provides a new perspective on how plants are constructed in three dimensions. The site also contains images and full-text of selected photographs, articles, diaries, and letters all related to the life and work of Walter Tennyson Swingle.</p>

  This is a german version of a very common european system. It was released by numerous
  manufacturers such as Sportron, Asaflex, Univox, Interstate and others, and exists
  in two versions: 4 and 6 games. The case can be black or white and the controllers
  can change. This system was released in 1977 and uses the AY-3-8500 chip grom General
  Instruments.</p>

  This german system is very uncommon as it uses two game chips: the AY-3-8610 (10 PONG
  games) and the AY-3-8760 (4 motor-cycle games). The schematic is quite big. Several
  other manufacturers used the same apparatus (same chips): Ingersoll, Creatronic, and
  even Atari).</p>

  <p align=justify>Just a simple advertisement for the AY-3-8500 game chip from
  General Instruments (Electronics Today International magasine, november 1976).<br>
  Rather than selling a complete kit, XENON proposed only the chip at very low price
  (the stock was a pull-out from electronic boards), and gave the complete schematic
  to make a working system (which uses a minimum of components).</p>

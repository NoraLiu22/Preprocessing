Totem poles are an ancient tradition of the Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest Coast--Washington state in the USA, British Columbia 
in Canada--and some of the Athabaskan tribes of southern Alaska.

<BR><BR>
Contrary to popular belief, the Southwest Indians, Plains Indians, 
and Inuit never built totem poles (there are no trees that size in the Sonoran desert or the Arctic tundra!) Now and then, though, 
you will hear an anthropologist claim that Native American tribes did not make totem poles at <B>all</b> before Europeans came 
to the New World. Since Native American totems are made out of wood, which decays over time, there is no way to prove to 
anthropologists that this assertion is false, but the oral histories of Northwest Indians and their neighbors are unanimous 
about the totem pole existing in those cultures long before European arrival, and the form and design of Northwest totem poles are so 
stylized and distinctive it would be hard to believe they 
sprang up recently. Totem poles have definitely grown in size since the acquisition of European woodcarving tools, though. 
The totem poles in Haida, Tlingit, Kwakiutl, and other Northwest Coast folklore were carried by men or stood inside a room. 
Neither was possible for the majestic totem poles created during the 1800's, which were made of single pieces of cedar wood 
up to forty feet high. 
<BR><BR>
Today, both short and tall totem poles are still enthusiastically made by Northwestern and Alaskan Indian 
artists, and it is possible to purchase one-- for a price. This is probably the single most expensive native art form there is, no surprise 
given the cost of a full-grown cedar tree and the amount of hand-carving and painting required to make a totem pole. 
I hate to put things in purely financial terms, but frankly, if you find a large totem pole being sold for less than $500 a foot, 
it is probably not hand-carved, not made by a native artist, and/or not carved from a single tree trunk. Even imitation totems 
are pricy, and spending $2000 on a cheaply made fake is in many ways less affordable than spending $8000 on a 
genuine artwork. If you're looking for something less expensive, why not visit our 
<a href="http://www.native-languages.org/sculpture.htm">Native American sculptures</a> page instead, where there are 
some nice collections of beautiful Indian woodcarving (including Northwest Coast staffs, bentwood boxes, and wall plaques with 
similar designs to those on totem poles). 
<BR><BR>
On the other hand, if you are looking to buy a totem pole that was actually made by Native Americans, here is our list of 
Northwestern and Alaskan Indian artists whose totems are available online. If 
you have a website of Indian totem carvings to add to this list, <A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">let us know</A>. 
We gladly advertise any individual native artist or native-owned art store here free of charge, provided that all totems were made by tribally
recognized American Indian/First Nations artists.
</p>
Thank you for your interest in Native American art!

<B>About us:</b> This website belongs to Native Languages of the Americas, a <A href="http://www.native-languages.org/help.htm">non-profit 
organization</a> dedicated to preserving and promoting endangered Native American languages. We are not artists ourselves, so 
if you are interested in buying totem poles featured on this page, please contact the artists directly. 
Though we have featured only Native North American totem poles identified with the name and tribal affiliation of each artist, we haven't 
called the tribal offices to check up on any of them, and we only know a few of them personally. We also don't guarantee any of their products. 
This is not an exhaustive list of Native American totem poles--if you would like us to add your totem pole site to this page, please 
<A HREF="http://www.native-languages.org/faq.htm">contact us</A> with your URL and tribal affiliation. We advertise any individual native artist or 
native-owned art business here free of charge. We do <U>not</u> link to totem poles which are not made by tribally recognized 
American Indian, Inuit, or First Nations artists, so please do not ask us to. And finally, websites do occasionally expire and change hands, so use 
your common sense and this general rule of thumb<B>:</b> if the creator of each individual artwork is not identified by name and specific tribe, 
you are probably not looking at a picture of a genuine Native American totem pole.

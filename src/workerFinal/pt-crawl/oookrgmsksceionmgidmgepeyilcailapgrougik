<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>PART I</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+2>The History of Sound in Indian
Cinema</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>"The positive fallout of
technological change will be a greater sensitivity among Indian audiences
to sound in films; perhaps we may develop Indian&shy;ness in sound in the
way we use sound in Indian films, like our relationship with music."</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Introduction </B>:</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Amrit Gangar, Film Historian</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Like everywhere in world
cinema, sound in Indian cinema, has been marginalised to a fault. It is
taken for granted as a part of the entire audio&shy;visual ambience that
cinema produces and reflects. Instead of being defined as having an independent,
distinctive identity of its own, sound <I>per se, </I>has remained on the
back&shy;burner, and everything associated with sound in Indian cinema
has almost always, historically and in the present, been equated with music
and song. Though music and song form an integral part of Indian cinema,
there is no reason to ignore the contribution of sound <I>per se, </I>which
of course, includes silence along with speech, voice&shy;over, interior
monologue, noise. In fact, the marginalisation of sound within the design
of a film is obvious from the credit designation that is given to the sound
engineer as 'director of audiography or, 'sound engineer' etc. though,
in point of fact, the sound design of a film is as responsible for the
quality of the final product as is the production design, the cinematography,
the histrionics, the script and the direction. One never gets to see the
phrase 'sound designer' in the credits of any film. In this scenario therefore,
it becomes important to highlight the important role sound plays not only
in contributing to the quality of a film, but also, and very significantly,
the its role in cinema as a cultural signifier of a people. Critically
speaking, very few film critics and reviewers pay attention to the use
of sound and silence in their film critiques and reviews. Mainstream Indian
cinema too, takes the sound design of an average film for granted, since
songs and music form a major part of the narrative and cinematic space,
and are almost automatic ingredients of Indian cinema.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The History of Sound:</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The statistical story of
the Indian sound film in its earliest years may briefly be summarised.
It was, in large part, a story of new units, in which individuals from
older companies were brought together by new capital. The Bombay producer
who made the first talking feature, Alam Ara &shy; in the Hindi language
&shy; was Ardeshir M Irani. Born in 1885, he started out in his family's
musical instruments business, grown restless, gone into distribution of
foreign films and finally, joined with tent showman Abdulally Esoofally
in buying the Alexandra Cinema in 1914 and building the Majestic Cinema
four years later.' Exhibition profits edged the partners into production.
After involvement in several other companies, they launched the Imperial
Film Company In 19262 and built a studio for it. In 1931 this company</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>won the sound race among
Bombay producers. The equipment Irani obtained for the US was virtually
'junk' but somehow, via its single&shy;system process, he completed <I>Alam
Ara. </I>In this system, later used mainly for newsreels, sound goes directly
onto the picture negative. In the more versatile double system, picture
and sound are kept separate for flexibility in editing, to be combined
in the laboratory as one of the final steps of the production process.
Irani is said to have been strongly inspired by Universal's <I>Showboat
</I>which he saw in New York. <I>Alam Ara </I>has never been described
as an artistic triumph and no one seems to have preserved even a fragment
of it. But its impact was astonishing. The Majestic theatre was besieged.
Tickets disappeared into the black market. "Police aid had to be summoned
to control the crowds </FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>.... </FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>Four&shy;anna
tickets were quoted ar Rs.4 and Rs.5."' Later, units went on tour with
the film, taking sound projection equipment with them, and everywhere drew
surging crowds.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>That same year, 22 other
Hindi films appeared, and all seem to have made money. Also, in 193 1,
three films in Bengali, one in Tamil, one in Telugu, appeared in their
respective language areas. 1932 saw eight films in Marathi, two in Gujarati.
In 1933, 75 Hindi features [</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>2]</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>were made; production in
other languages was also growing. Film after film appears to have had tumultous
reception. Virtually all the films appear to have earned back their cost.
In the 1930s, as one producer recalled wistfully, "almost all films made
rnoney: </FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[3]</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>By 1933, trepidation over
the coming of sound had given way to unbounded optimism. That year, the
compiler of <I>Who's Who in Indian Filmland, </I>in a jubilant preface
gave expression to the mood:</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>What with scanty resources,
stepmotherly Government aid, with keen competition from priviliged foreign
films, with few technically qualified men, with no interested capitalists,
with less interested fans, with actors and actresses scarcely able to spell
their names (for it was thought a disgrace by society people to be associated
with the screen), with no market excepting India, with censuring censors,
with discouragement to the right, cheap sneers to the left, despair in
front, and criticism from behind, the Indian Film Industry, thank God,
has marched on and on to the field of victory, battling against a thousand
other misfortunes. Has she not made a giant stride?</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The reasons however, were
not far to seek. Firstly , in a land where foreign languages dominated
the councils and pleasures of the mighty for a thousand years, film in
a vernacular tongue which the local man could understand, vested Indian
cinema with a status it did not earlier enjoy. Secondly, sound granted
the Indian producer 'natural protection.' He now had markets which foreign
competitors would find difficult to penetrate. , the protection that the
Government failed to give him through a quota system had now been conferred
with the coming of the spoken word. But more than all this, there was another
very strong potent at work. Songs.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><I>Alam Ara </I>included
about a dozen songs. Another early Hindi film, <I>Indrasabha, </I>is said
</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>4 </FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>to have had about around 59
songs. <I>Shirin Farhad </I>had 42 songs. An early Tamil film </FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>IS
</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>said to have had over 60 songs.' All the sound films
produced in India in these early years had a profusion of songs. Most also
had dances. Advertisements described some of these films as "all talking,
all singing, all dancing" features. The Indian sound film, unlike the sound
film of any other land, had from its first moment, seized <I>exclusively
</I>on music&shy;drama forms. In so doing, the film had tapped a powerful
current, one that had given it an extraordinary new impetus. It was a current
that went back some 2000 years. In ancient India, in the Golden Age of
Sanskrit theatre, the idea of drama was inseparably linked with song, dance
and music. This has been the Indian tradition for many, many years, till
1000 A.D. when Sanskrit drama went into decline with the death of Kalidasa
(ca.400 A.D.) It underwent a rebirth in the 19th century under&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>British rule. It flourished
first in the form of private family theatres maintained in the large joint&shy;family
homes of educated Indian families, specially in Calcutta.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Thus the sound film of 1931
was not only the heir of the silent film; it also inherited something more
powerful and broadbased. Into the new medium came a river of music that
had flown through unbroken millennia of dramatic tradition. While this
strengthened the film, it also had other effects. It struck a mortal blow
to rural and folk theatre performances in villages and smalltowns The sound
film almost wiped out the reborn theatre with one brush of its hand. While
cinema appropriated folk song and dance to its purposes, it changed these
along the way. In their new environment, they began, quite naturally, to
respond to new influences. The songs were ~formed through new instrumentation
and new &shy; sometimes Western &shy; rhythms. Musicologists, just beginning
to discover the same folk music, howled in anger at this sudden hybridisation
and plagiarisation of traditional Indian tunes. Today this very 'hybridisation'
defines the unique persona of Hindi film music and songs.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1931 and 1932, at what
seemed a dark moment in Indian film history, song and dance &shy; in part
derived from a tradition of folk music&shy;drama &shy; played an important
role in winning for the sound film, an instant and widening acceptance.
"With the coming of the talkies, the Indian motion picture came into its
own as a definite and distinctive piece of creation. This was achieved
by musical This same music was expected to temporarily block the Indian
film from Western markets, and this proved to be a perceptive prophecy.
It was also noted by observers that the obsession with music was a hazard
to script values. The indiscriminate use of songs robbed the early talkies
of narrative cohesion and dramatic force. Stories were loosely strung together
to make room for songs and more songs.7 A film periodical commented: "Cases
of singing before drawing a sword for a fight are not uncommon."' In the
Indian film world, writers would have problems.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The First Sound Films:</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In India, the earliest demonstration
of what was known as 'Phonofilm' a process invented by Dr.Lee DeForest,
in which sound was synchronised with the picture, was given at the Royal
Opera House in Mumbai, in May 1927. The programme comprised of scenes from
<I>Julius Caesar </I>with Basil Gill, the famous London actor, in the cast.
Lillian Hall Davies and Miles Mander appeared in a comedy skit entitled
<I>As We Lie.9</I></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The earliest attempts at
synchronised sound film production in India were made by Madan Theatres.
Early in 1929, Madan Theatres exhibited the first talking picture in India,
Universal's <I>Melody of Love </I>at the Elphinstone Picture Palace in
Calcutta. This was the first theatre in the East to be equipped with permanent
sound apparatus. Soon after, on February 2 1, the same film was presented
at the Excelsior Theatre in Mumbai By the end of 1930, more than 30 out
of a total of 370 theatres in the country were technical ready for sound
projections of film. 10 J.J.Madan had seen <I>The Jazz Singer </I>in New
York. The tremendous public response to the film had convinced him about
the unavoidable impact of sound in cinema.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><I>Alam Ara </I>is India's
first full&shy;length sound film. It was released on l4th March, 1931 at
Majestic Theatre, Mumbai (then, Bombay.) It narrowly beat <I>Shirin Farhad
</I>(1931) to make cinema history. It established the use of music, song
and dance as the mainstay of Indian cinema The film was a period fantasy
based on Joseph David's popular Parsee theatre play and narrated a fairy
tale. <I>Alam Ara </I>was made on the Tanar single&shy; system camera,
recording image and sound simultaneously, which was difficult especially
for the songs which were the film's highlights. Wazir Mobanurted Khan's
rendering of a wandering minstrel's song number <I>de de khuda ke namme
par pyaare &shy; was </I>particularly popular. It pioneered the use of
a commentating chorus, a device adopted in several later films. In an interview
with the Indian documentarist B.D.Garga, Irani said, "since there were
no sound&shy;proof stages, we preferred to shoot indoors at night. Since
our studio is located near a railway track... most of our shooting was
done between hours that the trains ceased operation. We worked with a single
system Tanar recording equipment...There were also no booms. Microphones
had to be hidden in incredible places to keep out of camera range."" Along
with his assistant Rustom Bharucha, he learnt the elementaries of sound
recording from Wilford Denning, an American engineer, who had come to India
to assemble the equipment for them. <I>"Alam Ara </I>shows the range and
variety of sound reproduction involved in the production of a complete
story ... it has shown that with due restraint and thouthfull direction,
players like Vithal and Prithviraj and Miss Zubeida could by their significant
acting and speech, evolve dramatic values to which the silent screw cannot
possibly aspire. </FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>,12</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Within three weeks of <I>Alani
Ara, </I>Madan Theatres released its first Bengali takie, <I>Jamai Shashthi.
</I>This was followed with the release of <I>Shinn Farhad </I>in Hindi,
also from the Madan's production house. This film beat <I>Alam Ara's </I>record
at the box office. Three reasons given for its thumping success are : (a)
the dialogue by Aga Hashar Kashmiri, (b) the songs sung by Kajan and Nissar
and (c) the crystal clear recording done on the RCA Photophone. The recording
for this film. was done on Double System Sound by foreign technicians.
Madan Theatres turned out eight sound films in 1931 and 16 in 1932. Almost
simultaneously with Hindi, films in different languages began to be made
in the country. Among the first regional language films were <I>Jamai Sashti
</I>in Bengali (193 <I>1), Kalidas </I>in Tamil (1931), <I>Bhakta Prahlad
</I>in Telugu (1931), <I>Ayodhyecha Raja </I>in Marathi (1932), <I>Narsimha
Mehta </I>in Gujarati (1932) and <I>Dhruva Kumar </I>in Kannada (1934.)
But in terms of form and content, they were copies of the Hindi formula,
full of songs, dances and music. The scenario has remained more or less
the same today.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Technique of Sound:</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Technically speaking, during
the earliest days of sound in Indian cinema, the Audio Carnex was the most
popular among the sound recording machines used for filming sound. Around
1935, about 25 such machines were in use. Second in priority ranking was
the Fildelytone, with 20 machines in operation. B.A.F. was in use in four
studios. Other recording machines in use were &shy; Rico, Vinten, Visatone,
R.C.A., Balsley and Phillips, Blue Seal, Adair Jenkins and Fearless." The
Tanar Sound System was no longer in use by 1935 and two machines were lying
idle in two studios. The introduction of sound changed the entire style
of production and projection of motion pictures. It also led to the growth
and adaptation of new equipment, and the creation of a hitherto unknown
creative and technical vocation &shy; sound engineering. The first response
to sound in cinema was to clarity of speech and song. If 80 per cent of
the dialogue was clear and distinct, then producers were happy. </FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>14
</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>Earlier, when the cameras were noisy, their sound
was controlled by using cotton blimps or cover. Silent cameras are a relative
rarity in India. But a silent revolution has taken place in the technology
of sound. Mani Kaul's Indian representation of Erotic <I>Tales </I>entitled
<I>The Cloud Door </I>used Dolby SR for the transfer from negative to Beta
video format to Avid (digitised computer system in which pictures and sounds
are stored on hard disc) which is a non&shy;linear editing system, allowing
for simultaneous editing of sound and picture. Avid offers the scope for
non&shy;destructive editing where original sound is not destroyed while
cuttmg. The film was edited by Lalitha Krishna, exwife of Mani Katil, at
Media Artists Studio in Chennai, considered to be the best in India. Sound
processing in labs is now going through the process of being standardised.
Sound labs are becoming conscious about the <I>quality </I>of sound rather
than emphasise only clarity.</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sound technology in the country
has shifted from optical to magnetic quite some time ago. Today, optical
</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>IS </FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>used only in the final stage
of film&shy;making. Magnetic technology offers greater range in sound than
the mono&shy;optical system. The earlier loop system of recording has made
ay for the rock&shy;n&shy;roll system. New technology has made the hierarchy
of sounds more complex, more exciting. Innovative sound designers like
Vikram Joglekar and D. Wood have done a lot of experimenting with sound
such as processing sound effects, bringing them close to music without
necessarily musicalising it, sampling sound effects, taking real&shy;life
sound and arranging them in a certain way. Raja Dholakia who is a sound
designer and music director, learnt to go beyond music to know, understand
and apply the musicality of sound while working on the sound design of
Mani Kaul's film <I>Siddheshwari, </I>an aesthetic impressionistic documentary
on the famous thumri singer Siddheshwari Devi. "I tried to evoke the environmental
influences in Siddheshwari's music through sounds" says Dholakia.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+2>Masters of Sound among
Indian filmmakers:</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Some Indian filmmakers have
paid close attention to the sound design of their films to combine aesthetics
with realism in order to work out a smooth harmony between sound and other
elements of film. Sadly, they are all from off&shy;mainstream cinema. Because,
mainstream filmmakers have conveniently taken refuge under music, songs
and long&shy;winded dialogue, ignoring the significant of sound almost
completely. The few mainstream filmmakers who need to be mentioned are
Ramesh Sippy (Sholay), Dayal Nihalani <I>(Andha Yudh), </I>Mahesh Bhatt
<I>(Saransh), </I>Partho Ghosh (Agni <I>Sakshi) </I>etc. B.R.Chopra, Subliash
Ghai, Yash Chopra and Suraj Kumar BazJatya, who have broken several records
at the box office with their stupendously successful films have worked
out a strange blend of music and song to organise the entire sound design
of their films. Their films spill over with songs and dances and with a
lot of music on the sound&shy;track, sound effects <I>per se, </I>are cleverly
sidetracked without hampering the aesthetics of the film. The characteristic
sound effects associated with each entry of the dreaded dacoit Gabbar Singh
in Ramesh Sippy's <I>Sholay </I>offers a model lesson on how sound can
be used to signify the terror a character evokes. <I>Sholay is </I>also
exemplary in its use of sound&shy;matching to jump&shy; cut to a different
scene and time, without breaking the continuity of the narrative, yet,
intensifying the drama. Among off&shy;mainstream filmmakers Shyam Benegal
picks up natural sounds despite the long footage of location shoots his
films demand. He almost never uses the services of a dubbing theatre. GuIzar
uses sound lyrically, since he is a poet himself and has a wonderful ear
for music. Basu. Bhattacharya used sound as 'design by inference' which
in common parlance, is known as the sound&shy;picture counterpoint. In
his film <I>Avishkar, </I>he uses the sound of a running train on the soundtrack
to hint at the drifting apart of the couple who are in bed, like two passengers
travelling towards the same destination, apparently together, but emotionally
distanced. Kuar Shahani used a similar sound&shy;picture counterpoint in
<I>Tarang </I>whereas Govind Nihalani used it very strongly in the climactic
scenes of <I>Party </I>and throughout the film in <I>Hazaar Chaurasi ki
Maa.</I></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hritwik Ghatak was a master
of asynchronous and non&shy;diegetic sound to produce irony and ambiguity
in his films. In his essay, <I>Sound in Film" </I>he offers interesting
examples of his own use of sound. In his <I>Meghe Dhaka Tara </I>(the Cloud&shy;capped

pain, anguish, and helplessness. The impact is much more stronger and lasting

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Meaning of Culture</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In its most general sense,
culture is the whole way of life of a people that is transmitted from one
generation to the next. The concept "culture" is often used interchangeably
with "society." But society refers to interacting people who <I>share </I>a
culture, while culture is the <I>product </I>of that interaction. Thus,
this limited meaning of culture is an abstraction. In everyday speech,
culture is often interpreted as refinement or sophistication in the arts.
Sociologists and anthropologists commonly define culture as the social
product of a human group or society which includes values, language, knowledge
and material objects. The people of any group or society share "non&shy;
material" meanings of what is right and wrong, good and bad, some medium
of communication; and knowledge about the environment and about ways of
doing things. They also share a body of "material" or physical objects,
such as tools, money, clothing, and works of art that reflect non&shy;material
cultural meanings. Not only is culture <I>shared </I>but it must also be
<I>learned </I>by each new generation through the process of social interaction.
In India, mainstream cinema is the most immediate and popular process through
which social interaction can and does take place.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hindi mainstream film
and culture:</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Perhaps, the most important
social function of the Hindi film is its ability to act as an interface
between the traditions of Indian society and the <I>disturbing </I>modem
or Western intrusions into it. At this plane, the Hindi film is a means
of (a) giving cultural meaning to Western structures superimposed on society,
(b) demystifying some of the culturally" unacceptable modem structures
which are increasingly in vogue in India and (c) ritually neutralizing
those elements of the modem world which have to be accepted for reasons
of survival.'9 But are Western intrusions into the Hindi mainstream film.
ethos really <I>disturbing? </I>One would not believe so because the emphasis
is not on the inner struggle between modernity and tradition. Nor is it
on any deep ambivalence towards the West. The function of the Hindi film,
according to Shyam. Benegal, a noted Indian film&shy; maker, is to externalize
an inner psychological conflict and handle the inner passion generated
by social and political processes as problems created by events and persons
outside. These events and persons are both ideal types and representatives
of different aspects of a fragmented self These fragments are separately
controlled and the Hindi mainstream seeks to sustain this control by sharpening
the focuses of these differences &shy; the hero and the anti&shy;hero,
the heroine and the anti&shy;heroine, the large&shy;hearted father&shy;in&shy;law
and the middle&shy;aged don. The Hindi mainstream does this because integration
of these separate fragments into a unified whole would highlight the gray
elements of characterization which it does not wish to adhere to.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Indian&shy;ness of
Mainstream Cinema </B>:&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>But the question is not about
<I>what </I>culture mainstream Indian films produce. We know the culture
it produces is defined and redefined by the time, the place and the socio&shy;
political context in which it functions. Not to leave out the basic question
of economic viability without which the industry's very existence stands
to be threatened. The question is about its own cultural <I>identity. </I>Does
Indian mainstream cinema have a cultural identity that is predominantly
and obviously <I>Indian? </I>Or, has it become rather hybrid with influences
of Hollywood pervading the screen with sexual innuendoes and graphic violence?
Is the <I>Indian&shy;ness </I>of Indian cinema under threat of succumbing
to the commercially motivated pressures of external values and norms? Or
is it being redefined by the stimulus it receives from the Western, specifically
Hollywood brand of cinema? All answers to these questions are undercut
by the fact that culture itself is in a constant state of flux because
it is being influenced and determined by the changes that are taking place
in our social, economic and political domains. Culture is not a rigid,
static word that defies It does not exist in a vacuum. Nor is it bound
anymore within the framework of geographical parameters which are themselves
constantly threatened by modern warfare and communicational globalisation
via the electronic media. Culture therefore, is itself "hybrid" in its
sense of defiance of all <I>Western </I>notions of what constitutes "Indian
Culture" It is also hybrid in the way it resists all <I>Indian </I>academic
attempts to entrap it within predetermined concepts and preconceived notions
of scholastic terminology.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Culture has initially meant,
in our context, the monuments of antiquity, the temple sculpture of a glorious
past, the texts of ancient scriptures, all "the wonder that was." So when
we turn to look at present&shy;day cultural practices, weighed down as
we are, by the golden past and therefore, by a certain notion of culture,
we react with incomprehension, dismissal, embarassment or shame. Is it,
perhaps, the very modernity of our culture that prompts this realisation?20</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Language Divide:</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In terms of language, though
Hindi was, and still is, the principal <I>lingua franca </I>for Indian
films, the talking picture drew upon target audiences marked by the linguistic
divide. Indian films are today made in 17 different languages. The earliest
talkies used Hindusthani which was a strange blend of pure Hindi and pure
Urdu. Today, we have Hindi films using regionally accented Hindi in the
dialogue such as the Bambaiya Hindi which uses a vulgarised version of
Hindi spoken in Mumbai. Or, the Telugu&shy;stressed Hindi spoken by characters
set against a Telugu backdrop. Such as in Shyam Benegal's film <I>Ankur.
</I>There are dialectical versions of Hindi too, as spoken by illiterate
tribals, such as in Govind Nihalani's <I>Aakrosh. </I>The tone, the pitch,
timbre, rhythm and even sing&shy;song notes of dialogue delivery vary from
region to region, and from different pockets within the same region. Besides,
Indian films have the unique quality of different characters speaking different
varieties of Hindi according to their social status, their caste, communal
identity, education, profession, financial status, etc. Thus, within the
same film, you have the educated hero speaking very good Hindi peppered
with impeccable English when needs be. The heroine, if she is semi&shy;literate
and comes from a rural setting, speaks in some dialectical, hybridised
form of Hindi to suit the costume she is wearing, which reflects the region
she seems to come from. The villain's goons, speak in a special vulgarised,
Bambaiya (from Bombay) Hindi concocted specifically to typify such screen
characters in Hindi cinema. If there is an Indian Christian character,
specially a female, she speaks her lines in a typical Goan&shy;accented
Hindi stressing the long vowels with her grammar all wrong. This, even
if she is not really from Goa today, writes :</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In Prakash Jha's <I>Damul
</I>(Death by Hanging) the dialogue is a rustic Bihari dialect. It is easy
to understand and is also symbolic often simplicity of the village folk.
At the same time, the powerful people in the village intersperse their
lines with heavily accented English words like <I>kundidate, dangerous
problem </I>and uppojishun. This shows the political awareness of vested
interests. These days, a lot of English crops into the dialogue and songs
of Hindi mainstream films, since in the larger metros, English is as popular
and as common as Hindi among the upper&shy;class, urban and educated class.
English phrases like "I Love You" and sentences like "C&shy;A&shy;T <I>CAT,
Cat Maane Billi, </I>R&shy;A&shy;T Rat, <I>Rat Maane Chooha" (CAT </I>means
'cat' and RAT means 'rat') often form the lyrics of film songs.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Chidananda Dasgupta, the
seniormost and most scholastic film critic in the country</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><I>"The 'Hindi' film is a
misnomer. "The language in most of the productions grouped under this rubric
is Hindustani, with a bias towards Urdu. The official 'national' language,
with its predilection for </I>shuddh <I>(pure) Hindi, is far removed from
what passes muster with the populace. The businessman out to make money
has succeeded in determining the practical possibilities of an all&shy;India
language of a culturally underdeveloped (low literacy, violence against
women and low castes and religious orthodoxy) area, naturally susceptible
to totalist promptings, on relatively superior cultures. The film industry's
interest lies in the widest possible accetpability for the eclectic, open
language its products use in selling themselves to all corners of the country.
Thus, the Hindi film is accepted in the northeastern states where English
enjoys predominance, in the south where local languages hold sway, in the
east, in Orissa which has a rich and old history, and in Bengal, where
Bengali literature has reached very high levels of contemporary consciousness.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Musical Metaphor:</FONT></FONT></I></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Music in Indian cinema is
unique in its cultural implications because it spells out the Indian&shy;ness
of cinema even when the songs or the background score are influenced, inspired
and now, even plagiarised from Western, African and Arabic hits. Music
in Indian mainstream cinema defines a new synthesis of traditional and
international genres of music. Each level involves such a synthesis that
any one particular level cannot simply be reduced to another. A cinema
song cannot be reduced to its classical or folk roots. The fact that a
particular film song is based on a classical <I>raaga </I>or on a folk
tune does not deny it its distinct genre&shy;identity. As film music grew,
it became clear that good composers of film music would of neccessity,
have to be trained within the musical ambience of Hindi cinema itself.
Though earlier grounding in classical and folk forms offer sound support
to music directors, a truly loyal and committed music composer for mainstream
films must seek inspiration from the kinetic visuals of cinema. Today's
music director often does just this.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Classical and folk Indian
music are intimately tied to our feudal, historical past. The essential
function of folk music is to glue individuals into a group to perform ritualised
functions. Folk music tends to be collectivist, tied as it is, to rural
life where functions are collective and songs are sung mainly in groups.
Classical music on the other hand, invokes and celebrates the grandeur
of power and aristocracy. Its main aim is to distance the mind from worldly
cares and material pleasures in favour of abandoning oneself to the love
of spiritualism and of dedication. It is therefore, estranged from the
world of reality and consequently, from the masses. Indian film music is
said to be the ideal adaptive response of Indian culture to the technology&shy;inspired,
jetlike pace of the 20th Century. Unwittingly, Hindi film songs have created
and underscored democratic values of equality and freedom, of patriotism
and secularity, of love and brotherhood and solidarity.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Songs and dances in popular
Indian cinema are used as natural expressions of everyday emotions and
situations. While seeking to intensify the element of fantasy through music
and spectacle, popular cinema also reinforces the impression that songs
and dances are the natural and logical expression of emotion in a given
situation within the filmic; narrative. This coincides, to a large extent,
to the Indian social reality where music forms an integral part of life
itself, whether it be in celebration of a happy event like a birth in the
family, or a wedding, or, when the occasion is one of grief such as a death
within the home. Music contributes a vital ingredient in the cultural reconstruct
of emotion. Popular cinema however, has learnt to adapt it to suit to the
changing demands of an increasingly global audience through exaggeration,
plagiarisation, adaptation of Western fads like rap, and has placed it
against spectacle.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>No modem musical form from
any part of the globe, including jazz, can boast of such diversity, richness,
subtlety and reach as the Hindi film song can. </FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>22
</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>The Hindi film song has cut through all language barriers
in India to engage in lively communication with a nation where more than
20 languages are spoken. Whether the film is a family melodrama, a historical
adventure, a mythological tale, a comedy, a love story or a thriller, songs
arc bound to be part of each finished film. Exceptions to the golden rule
were sometimes made with drastic results at the box office. To mention
a couple, B.R.Chopra's courtroom drama <I>Kanoon </I>and his murder mystery
<I>Ittefaq </I>were both without songs in them. <I>Kanoon </I>did break
even but that was mainly because of its star&shy; value and imaginative
cinematography than because it was songless. <I>Ittefaq </I>flopped and
the same goes for K.A.Abbas' film <I>Munna. </I>But all these films had
rich background scores to express theme, mood and ambience. Prakash Jha's
off&shy;mainstream film <I>Damul is </I>also songless. The background score
is amply infused with atmosphere and mood. For atmosphere, you hear the
humming of crickets in the night. For mood, there are sounds of pathetic
of the <I>basti </I>women, which sounds like moaning the dead. The sound
of drums heightens the tension of a tense scene. Since the director claims
that the entire film was shot in natural light, in the semi&shy;darkness
of the evening and night shots, the sounds acquire loudness and clarity,
underscoring the 'reality' of the tragic circumstances of the oppressed
people.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

with colourful visuals and harmoniously choreographed dances, these songs

audiovisual effect the film leaves behind.</FONT></FONT></UL>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>dialogue</B> &shy; if this
is a voice&shy;over, or an interior monologue, it is usually sombre, soft
spoken, articulate, with clear enunciation. If this is a dialogue, it is
generally long&shy;winded and wordy, loud and high&shy;pitched, alternating
between the ornamental and the crude, with shades in between. The accents
of different kinds of Hindi create varied sound effects. Because of the
multiple&shy;language culture, no cinema in the world offers the variety
in dialogue, speech, monologue, etc, that Indian cinema offers. Voice&shy;overs
by female characters are a rarity in Indian films. Two out of a handful
of specific exceptions however, are Satyajit Ray's <I>Ghare Baire </I>(Me
Home and the World) and Rituparno Ghosh's <I>Dahan. </I>One brilliant example
of ways of speech, enunciation and designing of silence, along with special
sound effects to generate and ambience of fear, is the mainstream offering
<I>Sholay </I>(Flames) directed by Ramesh Sippy. Sippy took special pains
to draw out different speech patterns to suit the different characters
in this film each character's personality being defined by his/her distinct
manner of dialogue&shy;delivery, tone, voice and pitch. The director offered
sound counterpoints through the two major female characters, one extremely
talkative and the other totally silent, offering another sound design which
invests the film with an unusual richness. The silent girl is shown to
have been very talkative through flashbacks, as a young and filmloving
maiden. The present time&shy;frame projects her as having withdrawn into
a self&shy;imposed shell of silence, postwidowhood. The sound of speech
of dialogue in Indian cinema, is a highly subjective exercise.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>noise &shy; In his essay, <I>Notes
for an Aesthetic of Cinema Sound, </I>Kumar Shahani says that incidental
and atmospheric sounds in cinema lie between organised sound (music) drifting
into entropy and contextual sounds (speech), while the rest is silence.
Sound defined thus, needs to be classified differently.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) enviromriental noise
in rural and urban settings is not necessarily culture&shy; specific to
the Indian situation; this is more universal in character and quality consisting
of bird&shy;cries, chirps and twitters, the sound of a moving bullock cart,
a mobile herd of cows or sheep with bells jangling around their throats,
traffic noise, a running train, a screeching car, noise within interior
shots such as slamming of doors, swishing of curtains, noise associated
with violent scenes like fights and rape scenes, gunshots, sound of steam
rollers, etc. Men there are the natural sounds like rain, thunder, lightning,
storm, blowing winds, etc. The only exceptional is a Kannada film. This
offers a brilliant example where environmental sound has been turned into
an integral <I>character </I>of the Story is Girish Kasaravalli's Kannada
film <I>Mane </I>(House.) The film makes imaginative use of every conceivable
sound to show how sound can make it very difficult for a newly married
couple </FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>to </FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>settle down in life.
Sound not only initially plays the metaphorical villain in the film but
later, also shows how important its existence is, in everyday life. The
juxtaposition, blending and overlapping of different kinds of sounds in
the film offers an insight into the hybridisation and mechanisation of
life in an Indian small town. It also infuses the mise&shy;en&shy;scene
with ambiguity. But this is not really culture&shy;specific in character
or quality because it is used globally by filmmakers.</FONT></FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) environmental noise
evolves a purely cultural characteristic in Indian cinema when it emanates
from the bodylperson of a female character in a film.This applies especially
to the sounds of ornaments and <U>jewellery </U>worn by women within films.
The rustling sound of a long skirt while a girl is rushing across a meadow
may not be culturally unique to Indian cinema. But jingling glass bangles
around a girl's wrist is definitely culture&shy; specific. The jingling
of bangles suggests laughter, cheer, fun, happiness, love, anticipation.
The sound of glass bangles breaking, with or without visual support, signifies
something entirely different &shy; widowhood, grief, tragedy, or, the premonition
of a sad event. Glass bangles are mainly used because of the musical sounds
they reproduce. Because, in reality, the organic making of the bangle is
reflective of social class &shy; gold suggesting affluence and aristocracy,
pearls and diamonds hinting at royalty and fiefdom, bone demonstrating
low&shy; caste untouchables, etc. But glass bangles cut across the caste&shy;class
divide in India so far is films go because they represent the same things
both within the script as well as for the spectator in an Indian film.
There is just a single example of a film directed by Sai Paranjpye, which
had Choopiyan (Bangles) as its title. This was a short fiction film aimed
at the de&shy;addiction of men in an Indian village which is reduced to
sheer penury by virtue of its men being incurable addicts of country liquor.
The women in the village gather together to teach them a lesson. They force
bangles on the wrists of the men who refuse to give up drinking. This hints
at the emasculation of the men. Both sound and picture underscored the
moral lesson contained in the film, though in sum the film was not an aesthetic
masterpiece.</FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) Dangling ear&shy;rings are
not used for their sound&shy;effects, but more for lyrics of songs supported
by strong, expressive visuals. Ear&shy;rings used in songs generally suggest
erotica (Gunga Jumna) or just pure entertainment Wera Saaya.)</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>(iiI Dancing bells worn on
the feet are generally classified into two kinds &shy; silver anklets which
are purely ornamental and do not have a sound design typical of Indian
culture; and dancing bells worn mainly by dancers but mostly associated
with dancing prostitutes. The jingling sound of silver anklets have the
cinematic effect of youth, maidenhood, marriage; alternately, it is sometimes
used to intensify and highlight suspense, terror, panic in the mind of
the spectator in scenes of suspense and eerie ghostliness. Even with the
screen remaining dimly lit or almost totally dark, just the sound of anklet&shy;worn
feet rushing through a forest or field is enough to heighten suspense.
This is often used in mainstream ghost and suspense films with good effect
despite the monotonous repetition.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) The collective striking
of brass plates by a whole group of women is a Hindu ritual practised in
a manner of announcing the birth of a boy in some regional pockets of India
such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, U.P., etc. One filmmaker has neatly reversed
the significance of this same collective sound by investing it with a totally
different meaning &shy; collective female rebellion against feudal patriarchy
and dictatorship. Ketan Mehta demonstrated this very expressively in a
scene in <I>Mirch </I>Masala (Spices.) No one talks, and all the women
of the village gather together under the leadership of the village head's
wife, to express their protest against the forceful victimisation of one
of the girls who works in the village spice factory there. This is an unique
gender&shy;specific use of&shy;sound&shy;in Indian cinema which underscores
the culture&shy;specific use of sound.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) In Prakash Jha's <I>Mrityudand
(</I>Death Sentence) makes sit similar use of collective clapping by village
women, beginning softly to steadily grow into a rising crescendo, as a
strong statement against the raping and kidnapping of village women by
the villainous promoter and land&shy;grabber. Collective clapping by a
group of eunuchs in India, in film. and in real life, is both an identity
card as well as a professional strategy adopted in order to draw attention
to themselves. The sound of the clap and the manner in which it is executed,
is distinct and very different from the way ordinary people would clap.
They clap when they beg for alms, they clap to make their presence felt,
and they clap to herald the entry of a newborn.. The family is expected
to shower them with gifts and money. They then form a circle around the
newborn and begin to dance and sing, clapping all along. These, and all
other sounds and speech patterns of Indian eunuchs came across tellingly
in Kalpana LaJmi's film <I>Darmiyaan </I>which literally translates as
'in between.'</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Sound as an expression of
emotion.</B> This refers to laughter, which is generally speaking, quite
universal in cinema. But weeping, crying, yelling out in grief and pain,
are culture&shy;specific and generally differ from one culture to another.
Unlike m Occidental cultures, where any public expression of grief and
pain is considered indecent, because grief and pain are taken to be extremely
private and intimate, in Oriental cultures, to withhold such public expression
of grief through loud crying or weeping is considered to be unhealthy and
almost abnormal. Though with the rapid pace of urbanisation and Westernisation,
this open show of grief is on the decline, Indian cinema has held on to
convention and tradition. So, crying and weeping in Indian cinema takes
different forms and shapes depending mainly on the director's handling
of the scene to intensify the pain just so that it communicates itself
to the spectator and lends conducively to audience&shy;identification.
But an absolutely culture and gender&shy;specific practice unique to India
is the concept of professional mourning women, called Rudaali Though with
the collapse of feudal landlordism and fiefdom, this profession is dying
out, its pathos was movingly brought out by Kalpana LaJmi in the film <I>Rudaali.
</I>It narrates the story of a woman who is forced into the profession
because of the sudden death of the professional mourner. But her problem
is that she cannot cry. Nor can she shed tears. The horrific tragedies
that life had in store for her, sucked her tears dry. When the time comes
for her to beat her chest and wave her thick mane and cry loudly, she finds
she has just to draw on her storehouse of pain and personal grief to earn
her livelihood when the dying landlord of the village, finally dies. Sound,
colour, songs, music, and a vast visual landscape of Rajasthan make for
an aesthetic and very socially relevant design for the film though the
overdose of glamourin the form tends to overshadow and dilute the essence
of the content.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Musical Instruments used as Visuals:</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Indian cinema, mainly of
the mainstream kind, is flush with visuals of musical instruments used
within the <I>mise&shy;en&shy;scene </I>of the film. The two most commonly
used instruments to make their presence strongly felt are, the grand piano
and the flute or the <I>bansuri </I>(flute carved out of bamboo.) Very
interestingly, the visual use of these musical instruments can be interpreted
as cultural signifiers of two distinct groups. The piano defines itself
as a permanent fixture in the spacious drawing room of an affluent family.
It is sometimes used by one of the leading characters to belt out a song
with double&shy;entendre lyrics at a crowded birthday bash. But even if
it is not really in use, it forms part of the decor of the house. Within
the Indian ambience of cinema, the piano suggests affluence, Westernisation,
urbanisation, sophistication and aristocracy, natural or acquired. The
flute, on the other hand, is a direct descendant of Lord Krishna, whose
famous flute is both the sign and the signifier of his visual or aural
presence. As such, even when an urbanised hero plays the flute, (Jackie
Shroff 'm Subliash Ghai's <I>Hero) </I>the flute is suggestive of total
ethnicity, simplicity and poverty. Satyajit Ray's Apu played the flute
in <I>Apur Sansar </I>when he lived alone in the city. Here, it underscored
his loneliness. The use of the flute also goes back to the Radha&shy;Krishna
love story from Hindu mythology, and often finds favour even with the sophisticated
spectator. Ironically however, neither the piano nor the flute is common
in India's everyday cultural ethos. The piano has become a non&shy;entity
because of dwindling spaces in urban apartments. The flute is neatly sidetracked
because it is not considered 'hep.' Yet, Indian cinema thrives on its visual
and aural use. This representation, tied to tangible musical instruments,
is not really in keeping with contemporary Indian reality.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Granted, that the question
of culture&shy;specificity of cinema in any nation is today fraught with
the fear of the great Hollywood invasion. The crisis of culture in an era
of economic globalisation has itself evolved into a significant issue of
discussion and debate. India is no exception. Yet, India is an exception.
Because, in its cinema, simply by virtue of the massive size of numbers
of films released every year, the threat of the Hollywood influx is dissipated.
It is not possible for the cinematic influences of a foreign culture to
uproot the cultural roots of a nation dotted with a largely illiterate
mass population nurtured on a steady and generous diet of mythology, folklore,
theatre, folk arts, music, all of which have success fully found themselves
reflected, represented, interpreted, distorted and even questioned in and
by its cinema, both of the mainstream and of the arthouse variety.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Politics of Silence
as a Metaphor of the Oppressed :</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Only in a sound film, can
a director use silence for dramatic effecf' wrote VY Perkins. Music director
Bliaskar Chandavarkar says "if you cannot express things through music,
you can use silence which is likely to reveal more than what music or dialogue
could have revealed. Silence does not exist in an absolute sense. Bresson
once said, "on the obvious level, silence in music relates to space indirectly.
In the cinema, on the other hand, it relates to space in movement." Though
mainstream cinema m India does not accept 'silence' as a part of the sound
design of the film, Along with its sophisticated cousin, off&shy; mainstrearn
or arthouse cinema), it has, almost unwittingly, defined the role of silence
with reference to particular characters in some films. This silence, or
'muteness' in the characters is voluntary and not physiological or genetic.
It therefore, is also culture&shy; specific to Indian films, never mind
the generic label. It would be right to define it as a political statement
on the oppressed, the marginalised, the poor and the outcasts, which includes
women. Silence in this sense, is an explosive expression of resistance,
revolt, suppressed anger, rebellion, which finds eloquence because of its
juxtaposition against all the sounds that characterise the normal sound
film also because it is self&shy;imposed, Therefore, its dramatic impact
is more coincidental to the director's total design for the entire film
than intentionally imposed from without. The culture&shy;specificity lies
in the significant revelation that almost without exception, it the marginalised
who recede into this shell of self&shy;imposed silence, either for the
entire film, or for part of the narrative footage of the film.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hrishikesh Mukherjee's mainstream
film <I>Abhimaan, is </I>a case in point. It unspools the story of a famous
singer who, on impulse, marries a village girl and brings her to the city.
She turns out to be more gifted than him, and becomes more famous in the
field of film music. This comes as a jolt to the husband's ego. He finds
this difficult to digest. In a fit of anger, he throws her out of the house,
not knowing that she is pregnant. Back with her musician father, the girl
loses the child, and takes refuge in near&shy;total silence. She simply
goes into an emotional limbo, failing to react to anything at all. This
self&shy;imposed silence of the wife acts as a pointer to patriarchal values
where, within a conventional married relationship, the wife ought to have
no right to supersede her husband in the field of work and in public. In
reality, the problem is a global issue. But its cinematic expression through
self&shy;imposed silence is culture&shy;specific.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Govind Nihalani's noted film
<I>Aakrosh is </I>one of the most brilliant cinematic examples of voluntary
silence used as a strong political statement against wrongful indictment
of a lowcaste, poor and illiterate man by vested interests in the semi&shy;rural
place he lives and works in. Lahanya Bhiku, a poor, illiterate tribal,
is accused of having murdered his wife Nagi. In actual fact, the woman
was gang&shy;raped and murdered by the bigwigs of the village. But Lahanya
refuses to speak, even to his lawyer, who has more than empathy for Lahanya
because he himself has risen from his low&shy;caste birth. Lahanya's self&shy;imposed
silence is his 'voice' against an Establishment where, he knows and understands,
speaking out will be in vain. He is sentenced to death. In the climactic
scene, he is brought to perform the last rites of his dead father, his
hands and feet shackled. As he ritually circles the burning pyre, he lets
out a final cry of anguish <I>(Aakrosh) </I>and slays his young sister,
lest she befall the same fate his wife did. This total silence of Lahanya
stands on its own throughout the film's cinematic and narrative space.
But the final cry, loud, long, expanded and echoing in the vastness of
open space, intensifies the drama, the pain, and the futility of being
born poor and low&shy; caste in a country that breeds and promotes inequality.
That sudden cry coming out of Lahanya takes the spectator by both surprise
and shock, making the silence that precedes it all that more potent and
powerful. Nihalam skillfully links the exercise of social power with sexuality,
masochism and the final denouement in the climax.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout Prakash Jha's
Damul, the audience is almost continuously subjected to a series of audio&shy;visual
shocks. The onslaughts on the oppressed are like a whiplash unleashed on
thern. There is cold&shy;blooded murder, there are mass killings of defenceless
people, sexual blackmail of a helpless young widow from an upper&shy;caste
family, holding the entire low&shy;caste <I>basti </I>to ransom, <I>geraoing
</I>the <I>basti </I>to stop them from casting their votes, and finally,
the death by hanging of an innocent Harijan Sanjeevana, because he has
turned wise to the landlord's wicked ways. Two characters in <I>Damul </I>are
reduced to silence in the second half of the film. One is the Harijan (low&shy;caste)
leader Golcul, who is touted as an electoral candidate for the <I>basti
</I>people but loses because the election is a total farce. He turns mute
out of the shock at the carnage in the <I>basti </I>caused by a fire engineered
by the landlord and his henchman. He seems to have lost his voice completely.
The other is Sanjeevana himself, who becomes totally silent in the courtroom.
Illiterate that he is, his silence is motivated by the fact that this will
perhaps, appease the judge to free him of the crime someone else has committed.
The silence is wasted. It is also the director's personal comment on the
injustice which the oppressed fail to rise against because they are poor
and therefore, illiterate. This is perhaps, much closer to reality than
one would like to believe.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In Ramesh Sippy's blockbuster
<I>Sholay, </I>there are two female characters. One draws a tonga and the
other is the daughter&shy;in&shy;law of the local landlord, a widow. The
tonga&shy; driver, Basanti is a beautiful extrovert, extremely talkative
who just cannot keep her mouth shut. The widow is quiet, sombre, solemn,
clothed is stark white widow's weeds, never smiles and never talks unless
extremely necessary. But in a brief flashback into her past, we find the
same woman as a young maiden, playing with colour, jumping about, laughing
away, and talking to the dozen. The sudden widowhood immediately after
marriage, the visible carnage of her entire family, shocks her into silence.
Her present silence juxtaposed against the talkative past underscores the
burden life as a widow has imposed on her. Her voice has been sucked dry
because, as the sole survivor in the carnage, she perhaps bears and additonal
burden of guilt inside her. It is as if, her self&shy;imposed silence is
a sort of life&shy;sentence she has inflicted on herself.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In <I>Namkeen </I>(Salty),Gulzar's
lyrical and rather unusual love story set in the picturesque, hilly terrains
of the North, is the story of a stem and no&shy;nonsense mother and her
three daughters, who take in guests and grind spices to eke out a sparse
livelihood. Of the three, the middle sister (Shabana Azmi) cannot speak.
Yet, she is not physiologically dumb. She is a hearing person. the older
daughter is a serious person who does not talk much and the youngest is
very talkative As the story proceeds, one gets to learn that the middle
sister's silence is the direct result of her being kidnapped by hoodlums
as a kid. By <I>the </I>time she was released she had lost her voice. Therefore,
no one (within the film) really knows what happened to her in captivity.
She finally loses her sanity, jumps off the cliff to her death. Her silence
stands testimony to another 'marginal' person being forced into a world
of silence and tragedy.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Buddhadeb Dasgupta's film
<I>Andhi Galli </I>(Blind Alley). Hemanta and his wife Jaya arrive in Bombay.
Jaya is naive and innocent, totally ignorant about the compromises demanded
in trying to eke out a living in a metro city. Hemanta is trying to make
it in the jazzy world of advertising where, he feels he can make a quick
buck and move into the spacious apartment of his dreams. He is taken by
surprise when the agency he does business with, suddenly find in Jaya the
ethnic model they are desperately looking out for. Jaya is surprised and
confused when asked to model. But after a few compromises at baring and
daring, she puts her foot down when she is asked to strip for a certain
campaign. Hemanta, who was away, returns to find that his wife has turned
down a promising money&shy;making deal. He flares up and yells at her.
Jaya's shock deepens when she discovers that her husband is prepared to
put his wife up for physical display against her express wishes, in exchange
for the money needed to buy the 'social status' he is so anxious about.
She withdraws into a shell. Her body language changes as she shrinks and
coils into foetus&shy;like postures, her face filled with silent anguish,
fear, confusion, and her willingness to speak disappears almost completely.
The silent, shrivelled up Jaya offers a dramatic contrast to the earlier
Jaya, innocent, charming, naive and ever&shy;smiling. The spanky and spacious
apartment seems to throttle her because she faces a Hemanta starkly different
from the Hemanta she was married to. Then, one day, without warning, she
jumps off the balcony of the skyscraper they have moved into. Her suicide
is symbolic of her silent but explosive 'voice' of protest against the
erosion of values in contemporary urban society of which Hemanta is but
a microcosmic example. Her silence is as aggressive as her suicide turns
out to be. A very different kind of silence of the female lead in a film
that ends in suicide is shown by Mani Kaul in <I>Nazar </I>(Sight), loosely
derived from Fyodor Dostevsky's short story, A <I>Gentle Creature. </I>The
girt, whose relationship with her elderly husband is captured only through
glances &shy; frozen, fluid, sometimes painfully slow, glances that are
more confused than meaningful, glances that are self&shy;questioning even
while they are not directed at a muTor, finally walks out of the relationship.
She steps out of the balcony as if she is stepping out for a walk. Most
of the story is narrated by the husband, either through monologue or voice&shy;over,
or sometimes imaginary and sometimes real dialogue with his wife. The wife
hardly has anything to say. So, the glances. <I>Andhi Galli </I>and <I>Nazar
</I>offer diametrically opposed cinematic definitions, of silence for the
female lead. Whilst in <I>Andhi Galli, </I>the silence may appear to be
an extension of Jaya's submissiveness in the first half of the film, in
reality, it is just the opposite. In <I>Nazar </I>however, the silence
of the girl is a pure character&shy;trait she is perhaps, born with. It
just is. It does not mean anything other than what it really is.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In sum, the following facts
emerged from this writer's enquiry:</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Silence in Indian cinema
is invested with the questionable 'quality' of ambivalence</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>2.Silence is associated with
<I>characters </I>in a film, not with the narrative or the cinematic</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Silence is rarely used
to intensify the quality of sound in a film.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>4.Character&shy;centric silence
is not associated with the spatial element of the film though the time&shy;element
is often confirmed through flashbacks and interior monologue.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>5.The <I>characters </I>such
silence is linked to are always found to belong to 'social outgroups' such
as tribals <I>(Aakrosh), </I>low&shy;caste untouchables <I>(Damul) women
(Sholay, Andhi Galli), </I>minority communities, working class people <I>(Main
Zinda Hoon).</I></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>6. Character&shy;centric
silence is both ambivalent and ambiguous. It could mean rebellion in one
character, it could mean submission in another. It could be read as 'protest'
in yet another. Or an expression of appeasement in a fourth one.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Conclusion:</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Many Indian films are often
focussed on describing the dominant paradigms of caste as a manifestation
of the essentially heirarchical nature of Indian society through films
like <I>Achhyut Kanya, Sujata, Jaag Utha Insaan. </I>It has also produced
particular interpretations of the caste question through films like <I>Damul,
Aakrosh, Ankur </I>and <I>The Bandit Queen </I>(none of which strictly
conform to the ideology upheld and propagated by the mainstream) which,
by virtue of their commercial success, (except for perhaps, <I>Damul, </I>could
be brought within the periphery of the mainstream. It would be in the fitness
of things to say that mainstream Indian cinema unwittingly adheres to the
beliefs of people like Benjamin, Williams, Hall, Bourdieu and Foucault
who have brought in newer ways of theorising culture Mainstream cinema,
like Stuart Hall," reflects culture as "a site of convergent interests
rather than a logically or conceptually clarified idea." The field of culture
is seen as "a constant battlefield" where "strategic positions" are "to
be won or lost." Mainstream cinema departs from Hall's belief that there
are no victories to be gained because here, the box office must be appeased
at all costs so far as commercial Indian cinema goes. Like all politics
however, the politics of silence in Indian cinema, mainstream or off&shy;mainstream,
is the art of the possible.24</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

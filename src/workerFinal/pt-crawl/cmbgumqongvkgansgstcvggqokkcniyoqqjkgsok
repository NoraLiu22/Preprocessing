  <h3><q>&quot;Ancient Future offers evocative world music imbued with graceful simplicity.&quot;</q> â€“ <cite>Bob Tarte, <span class="medianame">The Beat</span></cite>   </h3>
  <p>BILLBOARD calls the group <q>&quot;trendsetters&quot;</q> for contributing to the emerging movement known as <dfn>world fusion music</dfn>, a term Ancient Future leader Matthew Montfort coined at the band&#146;s inception for music that blends musical ideas from many different cultures.<sup>1</sup> Formed in 1978, Ancient Future is the world's first and longest running ensemble dedicated exclusively to the mission of the creation of world fusion music. </p>
  <p> Their original music is an exhilarating fusion of exciting rhythms and sounds from around the globe that combines contemporary jazz and rock with the irresistible rhythms of African, Balinese, Indian, Middle Eastern and South American percussion, the rich harmonies of Europe, and the beautiful melodies of Asia. </p>
  <p> The original American members of Ancient Future looked beyond their roots for inspiration by studying with the master musicians of many world music traditions, from Balinese gamelan director Mad&eacute;&nbsp;Gerindem to North Indian sarod master Ali Akbar Khan. They use their knowledge of world music to create something new and uniquely their own that is respected by pundits from the cultures whose traditions are a part of the mix. According to <span class="medianame">India Currents</span>, Ancient Future <q>&quot;plays with technical brilliance and gypsy-like fire,&quot;</q> and their music <q>&quot;demonstrates the continuing beneficial influence of Indian music upon world culture.&quot;</q> </p>
  <p> Over the years, Ancient Future has expanded its musical vision through collaborations with noted masters of various world music traditions who are now an integral part of what is today more than just a band. Ancient Future has grown to become a large chamber ensemble of more than thirty performers from around the world with over a dozen smaller ensembles within it, enabling Ancient Future to realize its core mission of creating world fusion music. </p>
  <p> Through cross cultural exchange and collaboration, Ancient Future has created a rich musical world of tradition and innovation. In addition to their original music based on world traditions, the many ensemble variations also perform traditional music from the cultures of the individual master musicians who perform with the band. This provides an educational experience for the audience that excites people about world traditions and then shows how those traditions can make contemporary culture richer. </p>

  <h2>Recordings</h2>

  <p>Ancient Future has released seven full length studio CDs selling over 150,000 units: <span class="CDbooktitle"><a href="visions.html">Visions of a Peaceful</a> <a href="visions.html">Planet</a></span>, <a href="natural.html" class="CDbooktitle">Natural Rhythms</a>, <a href="quiet.html" class="CDbooktitle">Quiet Fire</a>, <a href="dream.html" class="CDbooktitle">Dreamchaser</a>, <a href="world.html" class="CDbooktitle">World Without Walls</a>, <a href="asian.html" class="CDbooktitle">Asian Fusion</a>, and <a href="planetpassion.html" class="CDbooktitle">Planet Passion</a>. Over one million legal mp3 files from three of these releases on <a href="label.html">Ancient-Future.Com Records</a> have been distributed commercially. This of course does not count files distributed illegally (Ancient Future's leader, Matthew Montfort, was selected as the proposed Class Representative for Independent Musicians Against Napster due to the large number of Ancient Future files being traded illegally). Ancient Future is featured on samplers selling millions of units on labels such as <a href="putumayo.html">Putumayo</a> and <a href="collect.html">Narada</a>. Ancient Future is currently working on its eighth full length recording, the crowd funded <a href="afar.html" class="CDbooktitle">Archive of Future Ancient Recordings</a>, which is available to supporters as it is being created. <a href="yearning.html" class="CDbooktitle">Yearning for the Wind</a>, a beautiful video of a scalloped fretboard guitar and tabla duet recorded for the archive,  is being released to the public as first HD audio/video release in Ancient Future history to promote the fan funded project.</p>

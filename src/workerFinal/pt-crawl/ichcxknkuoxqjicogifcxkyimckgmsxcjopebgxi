        <td valign="top" width="105%">The main instruments of traditional music
          in Chad are the drum (tam-tam), African maracas, the balafon (a large
          xylophone with wood bars that are tapped), the lute and the harp.
          There is a traditional flute similar to the ocarina also. So there is
          a wide variety of musical instruments in Chad. The most popular places
          for playing these instruments are the churches, the millet beer bars,
          and at traditional dance nights in the villages.<br>
          How would you like to hear
        a lute playing, as recorded in Chad for real??&nbsp; If
        so, then go to <a
        href="http://www.eyeneer.com/World/Af/Instruments/lute.chad.html">this
        website</a>&nbsp;and click on the lute. To listen to a variety of
          Chadian artists, go to <a href="http://www.ialtchad.com/musique.htm">ialtchad's
          music page</a>, and click on the speaker links.</td>

        <p>Most of the art stems from a practical desire to earn
        money from the tourist who come to Chad, and from the
        local economy.&nbsp; Weavers make baskets, mats fans and
        other useful items from straw. To decorate them, the
        artisan will use dyes made of the flowers and roots of
        local plants.&nbsp;The most common colours on woven art in
        Chad are violet and green.</p>
        <p>Potters make clay pots<img src="pottery.jpg"
        alt="Clay pots from Kotoko village" align="right"
        hspace="0" width="228" height="179"> which can keep water
        cool in the hottest weather because of the water in it
        seeps out through the microscopic pores of the clay, as
        well as cups and other useful items. The potter usually
        does not use a wheel, but rather forms the wet clay into
        the shape required with their fingers, adding what is
        needed gradually as they go<a><img src="potter.jpg"
        alt="Kotoko potter at work" align="left" hspace="0"
        width="196" height="165"></a>. To fire the pots after
        they are glazed, the potter gently places them in a
        circle, along with kindling wood and straw. Then the
        kindling and straw is set ablaze and allowed to burn
        very, very hot. When the fire is at its hottest, the
        potter will cover the fire and pottery with sand. Then
        the fire is left overnight, at which time the potter is
        ready to bring his or her wares to the market for sale.<a><img

        alt="Stationery stencil from old x-ray sheet"
        align="right" hspace="0" width="143" height="204"></a></p>
        <p>Besides pottery and basketwork, local artisans paint
        paintings, create stationery and greeting cards. One of
        my favourite Chadian artists uses old x-ray paper to make
        stencils for some very lovely stationery (see right). A
        development organization in Abéché has become well
        known for their cross stitched patterns of Chad and
        animals familiar to all Chadians. Of special note is the
        tightness with which the stitches are placed on these
        pictures. The profit from the sale of these cross stitch
        pictures goes to the women without husbands who do the
        work as a way to provide for their families. </p>

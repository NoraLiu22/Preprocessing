<p>7.3.2 replace or modify the Infringing Items with equivalent items so that they become non-infringing; or</p>

<p>7.3.3 if such remedies are not reasonably available, withdraw the Infringing Items and we will refund any of the Fees paid by the Buyer (less a reasonable sum in respect of the Buyer’s and its Authorised Users’ use of the Infringing Items).</p>

<p>7.4 Clauses 7.2 and 7.3 set out Your sole and exclusive rights and remedies, and our entire obligations and liability, for infringement by us of Intellectual Property Rights.</p>

<h3>8. WARRANTIES</h3>

<p>8.1 Subject to the other provisions in these Terms and to our right to carry out scheduled maintenance, during the period when You have access to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, we warrant to the Buyer that we will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website is available to the Buyer’s Authorised Users.</p>

<p>8.2 We do not warrant that the use of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website and/or the Products will be uninterrupted or error-free. We may also carry out scheduled maintenance from time to time.</p>

<p>8.3 The Buyer accepts responsibility for the selection of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website and the Products to achieve its intended results.</p>

<p>8.4 Except as expressly stated in these Terms, there are no conditions, warranties, representations or other terms, express or implied, that are binding on us. Any condition, warranty, representation or other term concerning the supply of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, the Products and the Software which might otherwise be implied into, or incorporated in, these Terms whether by statute, common law or otherwise, is excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

<h3>9. LIABILITY</h3>

<p>9.1 This Clause 9 sets out the entire financial liability of OUP (including any liability for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, consultants, and subcontractors) to You including those arising from breach of contract, use made by You of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, the Software and/or the Products, and representation, statement or tortious act or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with Your use of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, the Software and/or the Products.</p>

<p>9.2 Nothing in these Terms excludes our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence; or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

<p>9.3 OUP’s Liability if You are a Business</p>

<p>9.3.1 Subject to Clause 9.2 we shall not be liable to You for any:</p>

<p>9.3.1.6 wasted management, operational or other time (in each case whether direct or indirect);</p>

<p>9.3.1.7 loss of any data, content and/or material (in each case, whether direct or indirect); and/or</p>

<p>9.3.1.8 liability of any of the other parties to third parties (whether direct or indirect), arising out of or in connection with these Terms and/or in connection with Your use of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, the Software and/or the Products, whether in contract, tort, misrepresentation, under statute or otherwise, howsoever caused including (without limitation) by negligence and also including (without limitation) any liability arising from a breach of, or a failure to perform or defect or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under these Terms.</p>

<p>9.3.2 Subject only to Clause 9.2 but without prejudice to Clause 9.3.1, our total aggregate liability in contract, tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of these Terms shall be limited to the Fees paid You to us during the 12 months preceding the date on which the claim arose or £5000 (whichever higher). You acknowledge that this limitation is reasonable.</p>

<p>9.4 OUP’s Liability if You are a consumer</p>

<p>9.4.1 Subject to clause 9.2, if we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for any loss or damage You suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if they were an obvious consequence of our breach or in the case of a consumer Buyer, if they were contemplated by that Buyer and us at the time the Buyer bought the Product(s).</p>

<p>9.4.2 If You are a consumer as opposed to a business, You agree that we only make available the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website and/or the Products for domestic and private use. You agree not to use the Products for any commercial, business or re-sale purposes, and we have no liability to You for:</p>

<p>9.4.2.1 any loss of profit (whether direct or indirect);</p>

<p>9.4.2.2 any loss of business (whether direct or indirect);</p>

<p>9.4.2.3 any business interruption (whether direct or indirect);

<p>9.4.2.6 any indirect, consequential or special loss.</p>

<p>9.5 If You are an Authorised User who is not also the Buyer, You irrevocably agree not to bring or threaten to bring any claims or proceedings directly against OUP. Any claims, proceedings, problems, dissatisfaction or issues which You have should be brought or raised directly with Your Buyer. If any Authorised Users bring or threaten to bring any claims or proceedings against OUP, the Buyer shall indemnify and keep OUP indemnified against any costs, losses, damage and/or expenses incurred by OUP.</p>

<h3>10. TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>

<p>10.1 Unless expressly stated otherwise in the relevant Product Specific Terms, You agree that the licence to access any Product shall expire at the end of the Licence Period.</p>

<p>10.2 Without prejudice to any rights which have accrued under these Terms, You or OUP may terminate Your access to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, the Products and or any contracts (“Contracts”) arising between OUP and You which relate to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website and/or the Products if the other party:</p>

<p>10.2.1 is in material breach of any of its obligation under these Terms and if such breach is remediable, fails to remedy that breach within 30 days of that party being notified in writing of the breach; or</p>

<p>10.2.2 is made bankrupt, is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986, or if the other party ceases or threatens to cease to trade, or if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of, or a composition with its creditors or other arrangement of similar import or has a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator or a similar officer appointed over all or a substantial part of its assets, or if a petition is passed or an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or resolution is passed for the winding up of the other party (other than for the purpose of a bona fide solvent reconstruction or amalgamation) or any similar circumstances arise in any jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>11. EFFECT OF TERMINATION</h3>

<p>11.1 On expiry or termination of any Contracts (as defined in Clause 10.2 above) or Your right to use the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website and/or the Products for any reason and subject to any express provisions set out elsewhere in these Terms:</p>

<p>11.1.1 all outstanding sums payable by the Buyer to OUP shall immediately become due and payable; and</p>

<p>11.1.2 all rights and licences granted to You to use the Software, the Products and the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website under these Terms shall cease.</p>

<p>11.2 The accrued rights and liabilities of the parties as at termination and the continuation of any provision expressly stated to survive or implicitly surviving termination shall not be affected.</p>

<p>11.3 If your access to a Product ceases (e.g. the Licence Period has expired), You will no longer be able to access that Product and/or Your User Materials that are associated to that Product. OUP reserves the right to delete Your User Materials which relate to that Product after 90 days from the date when You cease to have access to the Product in question.</p>

<h3>12. FORCE MAJEURE</h3>

<p>We will have no liability to You if we are prevented from, or are delayed in performing our obligations due to any circumstances and/or reasons which are outside of our control. These circumstances and reasons include strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes (whether involving the workforce of OUP or any other party), failure of a utility service or transport network, act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation or direction, sanctions, accident, breakdown of plant or machinery, fire, flood, storm, default of suppliers or subcontractors and/or non-performance of any services by OUP’s suppliers, banks or subcontractors.</p>

<h3>13. MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>13.1 If You are unable to access the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, You must first ascertain whether the inability to access the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website is caused by a failure on the part of Your device. If the fault lies with the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website and not Your device, You must report the issue by email by emailing OUP at <a href="mailto:eltdict.help@oup.com?subject=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries website query" title="link opens a new email">eltdict.help@oup.com</a>.</p>

<p>13.2 Upon receiving Your report, OUP shall use reasonable endeavours to resolve and rectify the problem to allow You to access the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website.</p>

<p>13.3 Where it is subsequently established that the fault does not lie with the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website but with Your device or Your internet services, we reserve the right to charge You a reasonable administrative fee.</p>

<h3>14. NOTICES</h3>

<p>14.1 Unless these Terms prescribe a specific manner in which notice should be given, all notices to be given under these Terms shall be in writing and shall either be delivered personally or sent by courier and shall be deemed duly served:</p>

<p>14.1.1 in the case of a notice delivered personally, at the time the same is left at the address of, or handed to a representative of, the party to be served; and</p>

<p>14.1.2 in the case of courier, two clear business days after the date of dispatch.</p>

<p>14.2 Notwithstanding Clause 14.1, OUP may notify You of any changes to these Terms or inform You of any changes to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website or the Products by emailing you using the email address which You provided to OUP and such notice shall be deemed to have been delivered the following business day or by other appropriate means.</p>

<h3>15. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h3>

<p>15.1 These Terms constitute the whole agreement between OUP and You and supersede all previous agreements between OUP and You relating to Your use of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website. Nothing in these Terms shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud.</p>

<p>15.2 We may amend these Terms from time to time. If we have to revise these Terms, we will give You at least one month’s written notice of any changes to these Terms before they take effect. If You do not wish to accept the changes, the Buyer can choose to cancel the contract in respect of the Products affected by the change to these Terms and we will refund the Buyer any portion of the Fees paid by You (less a reasonable sum in respect of the Your use of the Product acquired by the Buyer).</p>

<p>15.3 A waiver of any right under these Terms is only effective if it is in writing and it applies only to the party to whom the waiver is addressed and the circumstances for which it is given. No waiver shall be implied by taking or failing to take any other action.</p>

<p>15.4 If any provision (or part of a provision) of these Terms is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in force.</p>

<p>15.5 If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the commercial intention of the parties.</p>

<p>15.6 To the extent that it is applicable and legally enforceable, in the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions set out in these Terms and those in the terms and conditions governing the acquiring of the Products from OUP, the parties agree that the provisions in these Terms will prevail.</p>

<h3>16. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>

<p>16.1 These Terms and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with its subject matter are governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England.</p>

<p>16.2 The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with these Terms and/or Your use of the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website, the Products and the Software.</p>

<p>16.3 Notwithstanding Clauses 16.1 and 16.2, nothing in these Terms shall limit the right of OUP to take proceedings against You in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking of proceedings in any one or more jurisdiction preclude the taking of proceedings in any other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction.</p>

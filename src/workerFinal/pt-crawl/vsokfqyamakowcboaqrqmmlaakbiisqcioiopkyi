Highly improvisational, it is performed in one of seven        basic scales or modes, each one meant to elicit a certain emotion,        according to some music critics. [For more about singing traditional        mugham, see the article about </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="../../../../../../../../azer/azercom/htdocs/aiweb/categories/magazine/91_folder/91_articles/91_alim.html">Alim        Gasimov</A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">        in this issue.]<BR><BR>        While mugham is still performed in the traditional way, it has        also been fused with other types of music, especially jazz and        classical music. Early in the 20th century, Azerbaijani composer        Uzeyir Hajibeyov took advantage of the improvisational nature        of mugham to create works like the opera &quot;Leyli and Majnun&quot;        (1908), injecting mugham solos-accompanied by traditional regional        instruments such as the tar and kamancha-into the framework of        a Western opera performed primarily by string instruments.<BR><BR>        Today, yet another new, fresh version of mugham has appeared        in Azerbaijan: &quot;industrial mugham&quot;. The name itself        conjures up images of East vs. West, tradition vs. modernity.        This innovation combines the elements of mugham with the rhythms        of modern &quot;techno-house&quot; music. Basically, it's mugham        that you can dance to - believe it or not!<BR><BR>        <IMG SRC="../latin_91_photos/91_127_industrialmugham.jpg" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="216" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="../../../../../azgraphics/atransparent.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="214" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">In order to find out        what inspired the 1999 album &quot;Industrial Mugham&quot;, we        talked to <B>Aytan Ismikhanova</B>, the composer, and <B>Gulyaz        Mammadova</B>, one of the sisters who sings the mughams featured        on the CD. They explain one of the driving forces behind industrial        mugham: to lure younger Azerbaijanis back to their country's        national heritage by combining traditional classical folk music        with the popular new rhythms.<BR><BR>        </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Left:        </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Mugham singer        Gulyanag Mammadova.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><BR><BR>        _____<BR>        &quot;What would happen if we mixed 'techno-house' music with        traditional Azerbaijani mugham?&quot; wondered Vahid Mustafayev.        Vahid was an avid fan of modern electronic music and had a deep        love for the traditional modal music of his native land. In addition,        as co-founder of the country's most respected independent television        station (ANS), he was used to breathing life into innovative        ideas and watching them evolve into full-scale projects.<BR><BR>        Hoping to capitalize on the international popularity of synthesizer-based        dance music, he labeled his experiment &quot;industrial mugham&quot;        and released the first CD by the same name in May 1999.<BR><BR>        The idea of industrial mugham wasn't guaranteed to sell. For        one thing, many Azerbaijani youth didn't listen to mugham. They        were much more interested in Western pop music, especially internationally        known singers like Madonna, Ricky Martin, Celine Dion and Enrique        Iglesias. <BR><BR>        &quot;Believe me, it's not easy to foster a love for mugham in        the new generation,&quot; says Gulyaz Mammadova, a traditional        mugham singer in her late 20s, who appears on the &quot;Industrial        Mugham&quot; CD with her sister Gulyanag. &quot;If you mention        mugham, most young people grimace and say: 'Do you really think        I would listen to mugham?' But if we don't foster a love for        mugham in them, what will happen to mugham in the future? We        must perform mugham and pass it down, generation to generation.        It's a very deep and complex musical genre.&quot;<BR><BR>        <IMG SRC="../latin_91_photos/91_128_industrialmugham.jpg" WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="432" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="../../../../../azgraphics/atransparent.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="435" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">&quot;We wanted to create        dance music,&quot; says Aytan Ismikhanova, the composer for the        album. &quot;But at the same time, we wanted to bring mugham        to our youth, because they don't listen to mugham in its traditional        form.&quot;<BR><BR>        </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Geneva">A New Concept</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><BR>        Sisters Gulyaz and Gulyanag Mammadova are known for singing mugham        together.

He asked us to        sing for him and afterward told us that we were singing in an        old, ancient style, like the old singers did. 'It's true, you        can sing mugham,' he went on, 'but I'm looking for someone innovative,        someone who would dare to synthesize mugham with new forms.'<BR><BR>        &quot;At first we didn't quite understand what he meant by mixing        mugham with something modern. Maybe it was because we were used        to singing mugham in the traditional way. When we returned to        Baku, Vahid took us to his own studio - VVS -switched on some        rhythm and said: 'I want you to sing mugham to this rhythm. You        sing. Then Aytan will work with you on it.'&quot;<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>        Aytan's background is in classical music, having graduated from        Baku's famous Music Academy in 1991 and studied the likes of        Bach, Beethoven, Haydn and Rachmaninoff. After she started working        at VVS Studio, Aytan learned to program a synthesizer and began        experimenting with modern compositions. <BR><BR>        &quot;They didn't teach us about computers when we went to school,&quot;        she says. &quot;I've had to learn it all on my own. Of course,        I already knew how to compose and write scores for orchestras.&quot;        She has since gone on to compose songs not only for Industrial        Mugham but also for the Azerbaijani rap group Dayirman [see article        about Dayirman in this issue].<BR><BR>        She remembers how tricky it was to fit all of the elements together:        &quot;It was really quite difficult at the very beginning when        we had just introduced the idea to the sisters. It seemed a bit        strange to them because they weren't used to singing mugham within        any restrictions of rhythm. But this time, they had to adhere        to a strict rhythm - 130 beats per minute. Why this tempo, you        might wonder? Before I started working on this project, I had        listened to a lot of CDs and discovered that 130 beats was the        most frequently used tempo for 'house music'.&quot;<BR><BR>        Actually, the sisters weren't too sure what the reaction of their        voice teacher, Kamil Vazirov, would be. Since he had grown up        on traditional music, they weren't sure if he would take to these        new innovations or not. But it wasn't long before he accepted        the idea and starting helping the team come up with creative        ideas, especially related to improvisation and the progressions        from one mugham to the other.<BR><BR>        The &quot;Industrial Mugham&quot; CD features seven pieces -        each one introducing a different modal pattern: Rast, Shur-shahnaz,        Seygah, Bayati-Shiraz, Humayun, Heyrati and Chahargah. Each song        is seven to nine minutes long. (A regular mugham would last 1/2        hour to 1 hour or more.)<BR><BR>        &quot;We've preserved the modal intervals of the melodies so        that the listener can identify the mugham that is being performed,&quot;        Aytan says. &quot;Basically, we've only altered the rhythm and        added drums and bass.</FONT></P>        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><BR>        The two sisters sing mugham against this fast tempo and a backdrop        of computer-generated sounds and effects, such as a robot effect        or a telephone effect. Some of Aytan's arrangements also incorporate        Azerbaijani folk instruments such as the tar and kamancha along        with keyboard instruments, violins and occasional bells. <BR><BR>        </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Geneva">Mugham Video</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><BR>        This idea of mixing Eastern and Western traditions was taken        even further when they produced a video for one of the album's        songs - the Shahnaz mugham. The video, which came out in 2000,        is filmed in several public settings: the Palace of the Khans        in Shaki, around a tandir oven where an old woman is baking bread,        and at the &quot;Inshaatchilar&quot; Metro station in Baku.<BR><BR>        <IMG SRC="../latin_91_photos/91_432_mugum_composer.jpg" WIDTH="181" HEIGHT="216" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="../../../../../azgraphics/atransparent.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="214" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">&quot;It took us about        a month to shoot all the footage for the video,&quot; Gulyaz        says. &quot;In the various scenes, I represent our national traditions,        while my sister represents modernity.

That's considered long for radio broadcasting,&quot;        Aytan says.<BR><BR>        Aytan believes that there's a difference between the Azerbaijan        of today and that of ten years ago. &quot;Our mentality has changed        since the collapse of the Soviet Union. People have become more        liberated. It used to be that the Soviets prohibited genres like        jazz. We used to be cut off from new musical trends in the international        arena, but now we have access to all kinds of music. Students        travel abroad and exchange ideas. We recognize good music, and        we can listen to it whenever we want. In the past it used to        take three or four years before new musical ideas would find        their way to us. Now we have access to them right away. Thanks        to modern technology, we can visit the Web sites of countless        musicians and singers and immediately listen to their music and        see what they are doing.&quot;<BR><BR>        While only the future can tell if mugham will make a comeback,        Aytan believes that efforts like the &quot;Industrial Mugham&quot;        CD are vital: &quot;Industrial mugham is like a bridge between        traditional folk music, classical music and the new generation.        This combination of mugham with 'techno-house' will help keep        mugham alive.&quot;<BR><BR>        Their heads are already spinning with the next project - fusing        mugham with opera! An aria from Bizet's &quot;Carmen&quot; is        their first experiment. Gulyanag will be performing mugham while        Fidan Hajigizi of the Opera Theater joins the duet performing        opera. Two different musical genres. Two languages - Italian        and Azerbaijani - and two magnificent voices. The combination        promises to be amazing!</FONT></P>        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><BR>        The &quot;Industrial Mugham&quot; CD can be ordered from Azerbaijan        International at </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="http://AZER.com/">AZER.com</A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">.

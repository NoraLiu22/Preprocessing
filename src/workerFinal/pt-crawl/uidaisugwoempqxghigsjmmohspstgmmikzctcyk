Attacks by thylacines on humans were extremely rare, and on the few occasions

to these reports, had a particular fondness for defenceless maidens and
young children; typical of the "big bad wolf" stories of old.</font></font>

at work on the Bischoff and Corina track, a large hyena, either from hunger
or ferocity, attacked the party, and a very exciting fight took place,
those engaged in the defence only having sticks to keep the animal off.&nbsp;
After two or three attempts by the hyena to seize hold of one of the Messrs.
Hall, that gentleman struck the brute a severe blow on the nose, which
bled profusely.&nbsp; The animal then made off into the scrub, but after
a time crept back again to the attack, and the battle was renewed fiercely,
but this time the hyena was dispatched, and, on measurement, his length
was found to be five feet, exclusive of tail".</font></font></i>

A story from the Daily Telegraph of the 2nd August 1899 (p. 8) shows that
the thylacine is in fact placid enough to hand feed:</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The marsupial wolf, commonly known as tiger, has recently been making
his unsightly presence felt in the settlement of Green Point and its vicinity.&nbsp;
About a week since Mrs Arnold, a resident of that favoured locality, observed
near her house what she supposed to be a starving stray dog of most singular
shape and colour.&nbsp; The good woman charitably fed the animal on some
kangaroo meat rather too gamey for domestic use, and upon her son returning
home found that she had been entertaining a tiger-wolf unawares".</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aggressive encounters between thylacines are rare, but did occasionally
occur.&nbsp; Dr. Stephen Sleightholme (pers. comm. 3rd April 2012), Project
Director to the International Thylacine Specimen Database, made the following
observation on skins that he examined:</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marked scarification
of skins is often an indication of territoriality in male animals.&nbsp;
This has not been evident on any of the male thylacine skins I have inspected
for the purpose of this work.&nbsp; The absence of scarification may be
indicative of a low level of direct aggression between males when staking
their claim to a territorial area".</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the best documented
example of aggression between thylacines is that between a male and female
at the US National Zoo (Washington, DC).&nbsp; On the 5th July 1905, the
zoo received a young male thylacine from Dr. F. W. Goding.&nbsp; After
just a few weeks, the male was introduced to the zoo's existing female,
and they appeared to be getting on well.&nbsp; As an unrelated pair, one
can only assume that the zoo was hoping for a successful pairing that might
have resulted in young.&nbsp; Initially, they were kept separated at feeding
times and during the night to save any potential confrontation, but as
the curator W. H. Blackburne noted in the <i>"Daily Report of Animal Department"</i>
dated October 7th 1905, the male attacked the female on the morning of
the 6th October, inflicting damage to her ear and face.</font></td>

In a weekly column entitled <i>"Echoes of the Streets"</i> published in
the Launceston Examiner of the 11th July 1889 (p. 4), the author Tommy
Trot makes mention of a fight between two male thylacines at the City Park
Zoo in Launceston that resulted in the death of one of the animals:</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"An instance of the sagacity of a member of the brute creation occurred
very recently in a favourite haunt of mine, the City Park.&nbsp; The hero
of the anecdote is the lean looking native tiger, occupying one of the
lower cages in the zoological collection.&nbsp; His late mate also played
a very prominent part in the story.&nbsp; It appears that neither of the
pair was satisfied with the fare provided for them by the Curator, and
hungered for live meat.&nbsp; After discussion a happy notion struck one
of them, which he at once put into effect with satisfactory results, as
it cured both their cravings for a time.&nbsp; He sharpened his front teeth
on a tin dish and ate the other, or at least a considerable portion of
him, before the Curator knew anything about it.&nbsp; If that was not a
specimen of really human instinct I don't know what is.&nbsp; A singular
feature in it is that, like human beings who prey on each other, the brute
doesn't look any the more contented for his fratricidal meal".</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
T</font>his unfortunate incident is the <u>only</u> instance of cannibalism
ever recorded for the species, and it should be noted that this was undoubtedly
aberrant behaviour which resulted from being kept under unnaturally confined
living conditions.</font></td>

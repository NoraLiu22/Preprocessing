    <td bgcolor="#66CCCC">[One early theory of disease emphasized the influence of the
    natural environment on human health.&nbsp; Methodical observation of disease
    endemic to a given community led some practitioners of the healing arts
    to conclude that these diseases are caused by everyday exposure to the
    community's normal climate, water, and lifestyle.&nbsp; Changes in these
    factors set the stage for the introduction of epidemic disease--illness
    due to outside influences.&nbsp; The Hippocratic writings introduce the
    concept of the "epidemic constitution" -- a detailed description of a location's
    meteorological and astronomical conditions to which a physician must always
    be attentive.]</td>

    <td><p>Whoever wishes to investigate medicine properly, should proceed thus--
<ul>
<li>
First consider the <b>seasons of the year</b>, and the effects each of
them produces; they are not at all alike, but one spring can differ as
much from another as summer differs from autumn.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Then the <b>winds</b> -- both hot and cold; those common to all countries,
as well as those peculiar to each locality.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Consider the <b>qualities of the waters</b>, for as they differ from one
another in taste and weight, so also do they differ much in their qualities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In the same manner, when one comes into a city to which he is a stranger,
he ought to consider its situation, <b>how [the city] lies as to the winds
and the rising of the sun</b>; for its influence is not the same whether
it lies to the north or the south, to the rising or to the setting sun.</li>
</ul>
These things one ought to consider most attentively--
<ul>
<li>
...<b>the waters</b> which the inhabitants use -- are they marshy and soft,
or hard and running from elevated and rocky situations; are they saltish
and unfit for cooking;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>the ground</b> -- is it bare and dry, or wooded and well-watered; does
it lie in a hollow and is it hot, or is it elevated and cold; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>the mode in which the inhabitants live</b> -- what are their pursuits?
are they fond of drinking and eating to excess, and given to indolence?
or are they fond of exercise and labor, and moderate in eating and drinking?</li>
</ul>
From these things he must proceed to investigate everything else.&nbsp;
For if one knows all these things well, or at least the greater part of
them, he cannot miss knowing, when he comes into a strange city, either
the diseases peculiar to the place [<b>endemic diseases</b>], or the particular
nature of common diseases, so that he will not be in doubt as to the treatment
of the diseases, or make mistakes, as is likely to be the case provided
one had not previously considered these matters.
<p>And in particular, as the season and the year advances, he can tell
what <b>epidemic diseases</b> [<font size=-1>diseases that are not always
present in the population</font>] will attack the city, either in summer
or in winter, and what each individual will be in danger of experiencing
from the change in routine.</td>

<td width="420">For knowing the changes of the seasons, the risings
and settings of the stars, how each of them takes place, he will be able
to know beforehand what sort of a year is coming.&nbsp; Having made these
investigations, he will have full knowledge of each particular case.&nbsp;
He must succeed in securing health, and be triumphant in the practice of
his art.&nbsp; And if it shall be thought that these things belong rather
to meteorology, it will be admitted, on second thoughts, that astronomy
contributes not a little, but a very great deal, indeed, to medicine.&nbsp;

    <td><p>And respecting the seasons, one may judge whether the year will prove
sickly or healthy from the following observations--
<ul>
<li>
If the appearances connected with the rising and setting stars be as they
should be; if there be rains in autumn; if the winter be mild, neither
very tepid nor unseasonably cold, and if in spring the rains be seasonable,
and so also in summer, the year is likely to prove healthy.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
If the winter be dry and northerly, and the spring showery and southerly,
the summer will necessarily be of a febrile character, and give rise to
eye infections and dysenteries.&nbsp; For when suffocating heat sets in
all of a sudden, while the earth is moistened by the <b>vernal</b> [<font size=-1>springtime</font>]
showers, and by the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled from the
earth, which is thus soaked by rain and heated by a burning sun, while,
at the same time, men's bellies are not in an orderly state, nor the brain
properly dried; for it is impossible, after such a spring, but that the
body and its flesh must be loaded with humors, so that very acute fevers
will attack all, but especially those of a <b>phlegmatic</b> [<font size=-1>sluggish;
dull; apathetic</font>] constitution.&nbsp; Dysenteries are also likely
to occur to women and those of a very humid temperament.</li>

If at the rising of the Dog Star rain and wintery storms occur and the
<b>Etesian
winds</b> blow [<font size=-1>Mediterranean winds that blow from the north
for several weeks during the summer</font>], there is hope that these diseases
will cease, and that the autumn will be healthy.&nbsp; Otherwise, it is
likely to be a fatal season to children and women, and least of all to
old men; and that convalescents will pass into
<b>quartans</b> [<font size=-1>fevers
were named according to their period of cyclical recurrence; a quartan
fever is one that recurs every every fourth day counting the first day
of onset as day one</font>], and from quartans into <b>dropsies</b> [<font size=-1>edema</font>]</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
If the winter be southerly, rainy and mild, and the spring northerly, dry,
and wintry, then women with child whose delivery is due by spring are apt
to miscarry; and if they do bring forth, have feeble and sickly children,
so that they either die presently or are tender, feeble, and sickly, if
they live.&nbsp; Such is the fate of the women.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The others are subject to dysentery and dry <b>ophthalmia</b>
[<font size=-1>eye inflammation</font>], and some have
<b>catarrh</b> [<font size=-1>heavy
flow of mucus</font>] beginning in the head and descending to the lungs.&nbsp;
Men of a phlegmatic temperament are likely to have dysenteries; and women,
also, from the humidity of their nature, the phlegm descending downwards
from the brain; those who are <b>bilious</b> [<font size=-1>bad-tempered</font>],
too, have dry ophthalmies from the heat and dryness of their flesh; the
aged, too, have catarrhs from their flabbiness and wasting away of the
veins, so that some of them die suddenly and some become paralytic on the
right side or the left [<font size=-1>stroke</font>].
<p>For when, the winter being southerly and the body hot, the blood and
veins are not properly <b>constringed</b> [<font size=-1>contracted, constrained</font>];
a spring that is northerly, dry, and cold, having come on, the brain when
it should have been relaxed and purged, by nasal congestion and hoarseness
is then constringed and contracted, so that the summer and the heat occurring
suddenly, and a change supervening, these diseases occur.&nbsp; And such
cities as lie well to the sun and winds, and use good waters, are less
affected by these changes, but those that use marshy and pooly waters,
and lie well both as regards the winds and the sun, these all feel it more.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
If the summer be dry, those diseases soon cease, but if rainy, they are
protracted.&nbsp; Sores are apt to fester from the slightest cause.&nbsp; <b>Lienteries</b>
[<font size=-1>failure to digest food before eliminating it</font>] and
dropsies supervene at the conclusion of diseases since the bowels do not
readily dry up.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
If the summer and autumn be rainy and southerly, the winter must be sickly.&nbsp;
Ardent fevers are likely to attack the phlegmatic and men over forty; pleurisy
and pneumonia attack those that are bilious.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
If the summer is dry and northerly, but the autumn rainy and southerly,
headache and mortifications of the brain are likely to occur; and in addition
hoarseness, nasal congestion, coughs, and in some cases, consumption.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
But if the season is northerly and without water, there being no rain,
either <b>during the Dog Star</b> or at <b>Arcturus</b> [<font size=-1>August
through mid-September</font>], it is beneficial to those who are naturally
phlegmatic and those who are of a humid temperament, and with women; but
it is most harmful to the bilious; for they become much parched up, and
are attacked by dry ophthalmia, fevers both acute and chronic, and in some
cases melancholy.&nbsp; For the most humid and watery part of the bile
is dried up leaving the thickest and most acrid portion, and similarly
with the blood.&nbsp; Consequently these diseases come upon them.&nbsp;
But all these are beneficial to the phlegmatic, for they are thereby dried
up, and reach winter not oppressed with humors.</li>
</ul>
Whoever studies and observes these things may be able to foresee most of
the effects which will result from the changes of the seasons.&nbsp; One
ought to be particularly on guard during the greatest changes of the seasons,
and neither willingly give medicines, nor apply the <b>cautery</b> [<font size=-1>instrument
used to burn tissue to seal blood vessels and prevent the spread of infection</font>]
or knife to the belly for at least ten days.
<p>Now, the greatest and most dangerous are the two solstices, and especially
the summer, and also the two equinoxes, but especially the autumnal.&nbsp;
One ought also to be guarded about the rising of the stars, especially
of the Dog Star, then of Arcturus, and then the setting of the Pleiades;
for diseases are especially apt to prove critical in those days, and some
prove fatal, some pass off, and all others change to another form and another
constitution.</td>

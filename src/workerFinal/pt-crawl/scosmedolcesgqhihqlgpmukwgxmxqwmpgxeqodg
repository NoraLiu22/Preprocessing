<h2>Health Dangers of Urban Use of Pesticides (HDUUP)
<br>A Working Group within the City of Ottawa
<br>Ontario Canada</h2>
<p>
The Group was founded in 1996 within the Region of Ottawa-Carleton by Regional Councillor Diane Holmes. As of 1 January
2001, the Region and its constituent municipalities became one City of Ottawa. Its chair was John Sankey, later
Mari Wellman; Health Department liaison Martha Robinson; Councillor Diane Holmes later Alex Cullen.
Its members came from health organizations active within the City.
<p>
<b>The purpose of the Group</b> was to assist the City Health
Department in promoting the optimal health of City residents, by
<ul>
<li>health promotion through public education and local action,
<li>public education of health and environmental risks,
<li>public education regarding government regulations and industry practises,
<li>working to change government legislation to decrease the health risks from pesticides, and
<li>promoting use of non-toxic pest management and landscape practices.
</ul>
<p>
It limited its activities to matters to which the municipal government,
health department, and NGO's were in agreement. It worked within the
system to make it work better whenever possible, but was sufficiently
independent to be proactive when necessary. It was not formally
appointed, so had control of its own membership and agenda, and could be inclusive
and adapt quickly.
<p>
<b>Its work plan was</b> to
<ul>
<li>convince municipalities and the Province of Ontario to pass
legislation to limit the exposure of residents to pesticide usage,
<li>conduct and support public education campaigns,
<li>initiate and encourage existing local programs,
<li>encourage pest control companies to use non-toxic methods,
<li>conduct appropriate research,
<li>achieve partnerships with corporations, and
<li>publicize these positive activities.
</ul>
<p>The final project prior to the passing of cosmetic pesticide restrictions by the Province
of Ontario was to reduce the risks of insect-borne
diseases such as <a href="wnv.html">West Nile Virus</a>.
<p>
<b>During its lifetime</b>, it
<ul>
<li>produced, obtained private sector funding for, and published
peer-reviewed brochures approved by municipal government and the
health department on
<ul>
<li><a href="cockroach.html">
Non-pesticide Control of Cockroaches</a>
<li><a href="ecolawn.html">
Ecological Lawn Care in Ottawa-Carleton</a>
<li><a href="groundcover.html">
Ground Covering Plants for Ottawa-Carleton</a>
<li><a href="ipm.html">
Sustainable Municipal Turf Management</a>
<li><a href="grubs.html">
Non-toxic Control of White Grubs</a>
</ul>
<li>successfully encouraged the Regional Government to adopt a policy
of minimal pesticide use, that was drafted by the Health Department,
on all its properties;
<li>successfully encouraged the Council of the former City of Ottawa
to adopt a policy of minimal pesticide use on all its public open
spaces;
<li>successfully encouraged the new amalgamated City of Ottawa to adopt
the former Region's policy on pesticide use;
<li>successfully encouraged the Regional Government, and later the
amalgamated City of Ottawa, to formally request from the Province
of Ontario powers to restrict the use of pesticides on private properties
within the Region (powers now granted by the Supreme Court of Canada);
<li>made many presentations to governments responsible for urban pesticide policy
such as these in in <a href="presentation1.html">1999</a> and
<a href="presentation2.html">2002</a>.
<li>provided resources to local condominiums and other organizations
which enabled them to reduce pesticide use;
<li>obtained funding for 2000 <a href="images/lawnsign.gif">lawn signs</a>
and a related community newspaper campaign; and
<li>actively supported the City of Ottawa pesticide reduction programs
at staff and public meetings.

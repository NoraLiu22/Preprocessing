<B>Abstract:</B> 
Centrality within a city and neighborhood characteristics have often been 
used as indicators of access to employment and services in statements about 
urban form and accessibility, but there are reasons to question the 
appropriateness of doing so.  This paper evaluates the importance of geographic 
context within the urban environment (both location within cities as well as 
neighborhoods characteristics) for individuals in Portland, Oregon. 
Because conventional accessibility measures cannot incorporate individual 
characteristics, space-time individual accessibility measures were used 
with multilevel modeling to isolate the effects of individual level variations 
from that of geographical context.  The results show the influence of context 
on individual accessibility is weak, as accessibility tends to reflect individual 
and household characteristics rather than the local urban environment.  
Accessibility cannot be determined from location within cities, or from land 
uses around an individual’s home, implying that the use of urban design to 
influence accessibility is inappropriate.</P></font>

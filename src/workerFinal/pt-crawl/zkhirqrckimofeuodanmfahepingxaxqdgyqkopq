    <p class="BoxHeader">PURPOSE</p>
     <div class="BoxContent">To define the optimal sitting posture by investigating variable seated positions using positional MRI. 
Normal lumbar spine position during sitting has long been debated. In 1953, Keegan hypothesised a relationship between lordosis and trunk-thigh angle using plain radiography of only 4 individuals. No one has ever replicated his original study.</div>
   
    <p class="BoxHeader">METHOD AND MATERIALS</p>
     <div class="BoxContent">Measurements of lumbar lordosis angles, intervertebral disc (IVD) heights and translation of the nucleus pulposus (NP) were made on 22 normal subjects with no history of back pain or surgery using a 0.6 Tesla whole-body positional MRI scanner. 
We then determined which sitting position showed the least biomechanical stress on the lumbar spine.
This study would not have been possible on a regular fixed &#8216;tunnel&#8217; recumbent scanner.</div>
   
    <p class="BoxHeader">RESULTS</p>
     <div class="BoxContent">We found IVD height showed a tendency to decrease as lumbar lordosis decreased in variable sitting positions from reclining to forward flexion. 
The NP showed movement within a limited range in normal IVDs without change of its overall area. 
The optimal sitting position was with a trunk-thigh angle of 135 degrees. This position was shown to cause least 'strain' on the lumbar spine, most significantly when compared with an upright 90 degree sitting posture.</div>
   
    <p class="BoxHeader">CONCLUSION</p>
     <div class="BoxContent">We have adapted a small plain radiography study from 53 years ago and shown the best biomechanically and anatomically 'neutral' sitting postion using positional MRI.
It is well known that a relationship exists between seating posture and back pain and therefore this study has provided data that will help to reduce the incidence of chronic back problems from bad sitting positions.</div>
   
    <p class="BoxHeader">CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION</p>
     <div class="BoxContent">We have shown that positional MRI is of value in the evaluation of future seating design and as a result help to reduce chronic back problems from bad seating posture.</div>

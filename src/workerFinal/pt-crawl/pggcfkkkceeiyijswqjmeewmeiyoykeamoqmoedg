lyrics written by Mark Davies<P>
<HR>
<P>If I were in the ocean I'd send a smell to Mr. Rogers
<BR>If I were in a snort I'd get a pagoda for all my friends
<BR>If I were in a pudding I'd shave my armpits and be a squeegee
<BR>If I were in a shoe I'd take off my socks and call the neighbors dirty names

<P>If I were in a purse I'd say a prayer for all the Leons
<BR>If I were in a tither I'd have some crumpets with my tea
<BR>If I were in a dog I'd prance around like some old geezer
<BR>If I were in a gland I'd sing a shebang and call the neighbors dirty names
<P><HR><P>

    <h3><strong>A Brief History of Hubbard Harpischords</strong></h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">
      <img src="images/small_hub_wreath.jpg" alt="Hubbard Harpsichords Logo" align="right" hspace="0" width="102" height="127">Although
      there are many harpsichord makers presently working in the United States, few, if any, are
      without significant debt to Frank Hubbard (1920-1976), his research or his example. He
      will be remembered as central to the revival of early music in the twentieth century.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">For over 300 years the harpsichord was at the center of
      countless sessions of music-making whether in the salon, palace, church or tavern. During
      this time, few items could be encountered in daily life to exceed the harpsichord in
      technological sophistication or value.</font></p>
      <p align="left">
      <img src="images/german_double_smrt.jpg" alt="German Double-manual" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="10" width="179" height="187"><font size="2">Across Europe, master builders such as
      Ruckers and Moermans in Antwerp, Blanchet and Taskin in Paris and Hass in Germany were
      each to the harpsichord what Stradivarius, Amati and Guarneri became to the violin. The
      designs and construction techniques developed in their workshops resulted in instruments
      of such timeless beauty and magical sound as to influence the tastes of all composers of
      the period. J.S. Bach, Handel, Scarlatti and Rameau are only the best known of a host of
      composers who used the unique timber of the harpsichord to produce some of the most varied
      and exciting keyboard music ever written.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Unfortunately, during the nineteenth century the art of
      harpsichord making all but died out as the musical world turned its fancy to the piano. By
      the early twentieth century it became almost impossible to find an artist/craftsman who
      understood the old masters' secrets and could produce a harpsichord of equal standards.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">
      <img src="images/flemish_single.jpg" alt="Flemish Single Harpsichord" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="140" height="135">In 1948 Frank Hubbard
      and William Dowd conceived the idea of constructing harpsichords which would restore to
      their own time the sound and sensual beauty of the best classical instruments. Through
      tireless research by compiling measurements of available antiques, and by examining
      inventories of the old masters as recorded in local archives throughout Europe, the
      ancient craft of harpsichord building was recovered and mastered. Now, as the popularity
      of playing music on original instruments increases and the harpsichord takes center stage
      with period orchestras, we recognize that theirs was an idea whose time had come.</font></p>
